Example applications of this multi-view setting include clustering of web pages which have an intrinsic view,(the pages themselves) and an extrinsic view (e.g., anchor texts of inbound hyperlinks); multi-view learning has so far been studied in the context of classification. We develop and study partitioning and agglomerative, hierarchical multi-view clustering algorithms for text data. We find empirically that the multiview versions of k-Means and EM greatly improve on their single-view counterparts. By contrast, we obtain negative results for agglomerative hierarchical multi-view clustering. Our analysis explains this surprising phenomenon.

K-means requires several passes on the entire dataset, which can make it very expensive for large disk-resident datasets. In view of this, a lot of work has been done on various approximate versions of k-means, which, require only one or a,small number of passes on the entire dataset. In this paper we present a new algorithm which typically requires only, one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset, and provably produces the same cluster centers as reported by the original k-means algorithm. The algorithm uses sampling to create initial cluster centers, and then takes one or more passes over the entire dataset to adjust these cluster centers.. We provide theoretical analysis to show that the cluster centers thus reported are the same as the ones computed by the original k-means algorithm. Experimental results from a number of real and synthetic datasets show speedup between a factor of 2 and 4.5, as compared to k-means.

To achieve this, this paper introduces a new approach for the clustering of web documents, which is called Maximal Frequent Item-set(MFI) approach. Iterative clustering algorithms, such as K-means and Expectation-Maximization(EM), are sensitive to their initial conditions. MFI approach firstly locates the center points of high density clusters precisely. These center points then are used as initial points for the K-means algorithm. Our experimental results tested on 3 web document sets show that our MFI approach outperforms the other methods we compared in most cases, particularly in the case of large number of categories in web document sets.

This paper presents a special summarization method to generate single-document summary with maximum topic completeness and minimum redundancy. It initially implements the semantic-class-based vector representations of various kinds of linguistic units in a document by means of HowNet (an existing ontology), which can improve the representation quality of traditional term-based vector space model in a certain degree. Then, by adopting K-means clustering algorithm as well as a novel clustering analysis algorithm, we can capture the number of different latent topic regions in a document adoptively. Finally, topic representative sentences are selected from each topic region to form the final summary. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed summarization method, a novel metric which is known as representation entropy is used for summarization redundancy evaluation. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional basic summarization method under the evaluation scheme when dealing with diverse genres of Chinese documents with free writing style and flexible topic distribution.

However, the effect of exercise on gene expression in the spinal cord is poorly understood. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare thoracic and lumbar regions of spinal cord of either exercising (voluntary wheel running for 21 days) or sedentary rats. The expression data were filtered using statistical tests for significance, and K-means clustering was then used to segregate lists of significantly changed genes into sets based upon expression patterns across all experimental groups. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein were also measured after voluntary exercise, across different regions of the spinal cord. BDNF mRNA increased with voluntary exercise, as has been previously shown for other forms of exercise, contributed to by increases in both exon I and exon III. The exercise-induced gene expression changes identified by microarray analysis are consistent with increases in pathways promoting neuronal health, signaling, remodeling, cellular transport, and development of oligodendrocytes. Taken together these data suggest cellular pathways through which exercise may promote recovery in the SCI population.

To this end, computationally efficient models can be constructed for fitness evaluations to assist the evolutionary algorithms. When approximate models are involved in evolution, it is very important to determine which individuals should be re-evaluated using the original fitness function to guarantee a faster and correct convergence of the evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, the k-means method is applied to group the individuals of a population into a number of clusters. For each cluster, only the individual that is closest to the cluster center will be evaluated using the expensive original fitness function. The fitness of other individuals are estimated using a neural network ensemble, which is also used to detect possible serious prediction errors. Simulation results from three test functions show that the proposed method exhibits better performance than the strategy where only the best individuals according to the approximate model are re-evaluated.

To circumvent this problem, we propose Niching Genetic K-means Algorithm (NGKA) that is based on modified deterministic crowding and embeds the computationally attractive k-means. Our experiments show that NGKA can consistently and efficiently identify high quality solutions. Experiments use both simulated and real data with varying size and varying number of local optima. The significance of NGKA is also shown on the experimental data sets by comparing through simulations with Genetically Guided Algorithm (GGA) and Genetic K-means Algorithm (GKA).

Grey level histograms of different textures are used as inputs to the evolved programs. One dimensional K-means clustering is applied to the outputs and the tightness of the clusters is used as the fitness measure. To test generality, textures from the Brodatz library were used in learning phase and the evolved features were used on classification problems based on the Vistex library. Using the evolved features gave a test accuracy of 74.8% while using Haralick features, the most commonly used method in texture classification, gave an accuracy of 75.5% on the same problem. Thus, the evolved features are competitive with those derived by human intuition and analysis. Furthermore, when the evolved features are combined with the Haralick features the accuracy increases to 83.2%, indicating that the evolved features are finding texture regularities not used in the Haralick approach.

J	Bragato, G				Bragato, G			Fuzzy continuous classification and spatial interpolation in conventional soil survey for soil mapping of the lower Piave plain	GEODERMA			English	Article						augering data; compositional kriging; continuous soil map; fuzzy sets; fuzzy clustering; soil survey	K-MEANS; C-MEANS; LANDFORM	Soil maps on a reconnaissance or semi-detailed scale are frequently used as the basic level of information for regional land use assessment. However, they are impractical for suitability predictions concerning quality crops, which require an enlargement of details that can be guaranteed only by detailed soil survey and mapping. The change of scale increases the importance of field observations and introduces in the soil-landscape model the fuzziness related to surveyor's subjective judgement. The present study explored the applicability of the fuzzy c-means approach to conventional soil surveys for detailed land use assessment with the purpose of taking into consideration the fuzziness of data collected in areas where soil type transitions are not easily observable on the surface. The investigation was done using data from 1888 auger borings of a 42 000-ha survey carried out in the lower part of the fluvial plain east of Venice on the 1:25000 map scale. The morphological quantitative attributes of the master horizons A, Bw, Bg, Bk and C were first reduced in number so as to remove attribute redundancy. They were then submitted to fuzzy c-means, testing cluster validity with both internal and external criterion measures. The best partition was obtained with four classes, which were consistent with the main soil-forming processes of the area not only in terms of class centre features, but also of spatial variability and distribution pattern of the class memberships. The investigated approach might represent part of a complex analytical sequence capable of using both the spatial distribution of fuzzy continuous classes and the landform analysis to formulate a spatially detailed territorial model representing the basic level of information for a locally oriented land use assessment.

CMA takes advantages of k-means and self-adaptive algorithms. It is simple and works without any user interactions. There are two main stages in this algorithm. In the first stage, it classifies images in a database into several clusters, and automatically gets the necessary parameters for the next stage - k-means iteration. We test our CMA algorithm on a large database of more than ten thousand images. Experiments show the effectiveness of this method.

We sought to reveal strategies used by observers in visual search tasks using accurate eye tracking and image analysis at point of gaze. Observers were instructed to search for simple geometric targets embedded in 1/f noise. By analyzing the stimulus at the point of gaze using the classification image (CI) paradigm, we discovered CI templates that indeed resembled the target. No such structure emerged for a random-searcher. We demonstrate, qualitatively and quantitatively, that these Cl templates are useful in predicting stimulus regions that draw human fixations in search tasks. Filtering a 1/f noise stimulus with a CI results in a 'fixation prediction map'. A qualitative evaluation of the prediction was obtained by overlaying k-means clusters of observers' fixations on the prediction map. The fixations clustered around the local maxima in the prediction map. To obtain a quantitative comparison, we computed the Kullback-Leibler distance between the recorded fixations and the prediction. Using random-searcher CIs in Monte Carlo simulations, a distribution of this distance was obtained. The z-scores for the human CIs and the original target were -9.70 and -9.37 respectively indicating that even in noisy stimuli, observers deploy their fixations efficiently to likely targets rather than casting them randomly hoping to fortuitously find the target.

Standard clustering techniques in the information retrieval either have to state the number of clusters desired before the application of the clustering technique such as in K-means, or have to cluster the documents in an incremental fashion that at each stage the most similar documents are clustered. As a result, each document can belong to only one cluster. In reality, however, a document may belong to multiple clusters where each of the clusters has its own centroid.

This problem is the identification of radar signals in a tactical environment. The identification process requires two steps: clustering of collected radar pulse descriptor words and the classification of clustered results. The method described here, Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy ART), is a self-organizing neural network algorithm. The benefits of this algorithm are that it performs well against "real" and simulated radar pulse data sets and converges to a solution in a reasonably short amount of time. This paper will discuss the theory behind the Fuzzy ART as well as results of the processing of two "real" radar pulse data sets. The first evaluated data set consists of 5242 radar pulse descriptor words from 32 different emitters. The second data set consists of 107,850 pulse descriptor words from 112 different emitters. The radar pulse descriptors words that were used by the algorithm for both sets of data were radio frequency (RF) and pulse width (PW). The results of the processing of both of these datasets exceed the results of processing these datasets with other algorithms such as K-Means and other self-organizing neural networks.

Prior reserch on online dynamic pricing by sellers makes certain limiting assumptions such as sellers being aware of buyers preferences, and, prices and profits of competitors, and, buyers selecting products based only on their price. In this paper, we consider a market where buyers and sellers differentiate a product on multiple attributes, and, preferences of different buyers over different product attributes vary temporally. We describe adaptive learning and dynamic pricing algorithms that can be used by a seller to determine buyer preferences and determine a competitive price in the market. These algorithms axe encapsulated by software agents that automatically perform the necessary calculations so that the seller can maintain a competitive edge in the market. Simulation results of our algorithms show that they compare favorably against other existing online dynamic pricing algorithms.

A good fragmentation scheme followed by an optimal allocation could greatly enhance performance in such systems, as data transfer between distributed sites is minimized. In this paper we present a horizontal fragmentation approach that uses the k-means AI clustering method for partitioning object instances into fragments. Our new method applies to existing databases, where statistics are already present. We model fragmentation input data in a vector space and give different object similarity measures together with their geometrical interpretations. We provide quality and performance evaluations using a partition evaluator function.

Reducing the computational complexity of the MMSE receiver in terms of the filter laps is achieved using the K-mean classification algorithm. Performance of the reduced rank MMSE receiver with adaptive and optimum tap weights implementation is presented in both coded and uncoded systems. A system with full rank receiver and matched filter is used for the purpose of comparison. Pairwise error bound is derived for the system based full rank MMSE receiver. Simulation results show that good performance is achieved using the adaptive reduced rank receiver when compared to the adaptive full rank receiver in both coded and uncoded system, while for optimum implementation of the tap weights, reduced rank receiver shows degradation. Over the band limited channel considered results for reduced rank receiver also reiterate the fact that higher code rates tend to yield lower BER than the low rate codes.

The various-order statistics of the textures within a sliding two-dimensional window are measured. K-mean algorithm is used to approximately label the two Clusters in the overall image. However, only those clusters, which are very close to the class centres, are labelled. Therefore at this stage we have both the training and the working sets. A non-linear (SVM)-V-3 is then developed to exploit both sets to classify the regions. It is demonstrated that the algorithm is robust and the misclassification error is negligible. However, there may be a minor misplacement of the edges.

This technique is based on two main intuitive ideas: (i) complicated facial expression categories such as "anger" and "sadness", may be divided into several subcategories with different sub feature spaces where the recognition task can be performed with higher accuracy, and (ii) the k-means algorithm may be used to cluster these subcategories. A new image database with five facial expressions (neutral, si-nile, anger, sadness, surprise) of 60 women was constructed using a computationally efficient projection-based technique. Experimental results using the new database and an existing one (60 men) reveal that the new technique outperforms the standard vector matching technique and two recently developed methods using fixed-size and constructive one-hidden-layer neural networks. The mean recognition rate can be as high as 95% for the two databases.

The extracted feature vector is used by an extended version of the adaptive K-means clustering algorithm for the classification of image pixels.

A K-means clustering approach is adopted to group gaze location points into a number of clusters to represent the loci of regions of VA (or ROIs). Several metrics are then derived from the gaze positions and sequences to quantify the relative importance of the K-means clusters. An entropy-weighting strategy is adopted for the combination of these metrics to generate the ROI map. Results show that the ROI map is robust to the number of clusters and different gaze patterns and can be used in progressive image coding/decoding to enhance the image quality in regions of interest.

This local minimum is highly sensitive to the selected initial partition for the K-Means clustering. To overcome this difficulty, we present a heuristic K-means clustering algorithm based on a scheme for selecting a suboptimal initial partition. The selected initial partition is estimated by applying dynamic programming in a nonlinear principal direction. In other words, an optimal partition of data samples in the kemel principal direction is selected as the initial partition for the K-Means clustering. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the PCA based K-Means clustering algorithm and the kd-tree based K-Means clustering algorithm respectively.

Removal of noisy instances will improve the learnt hypothesis; thus, improving the classification accuracy of the model. A clustering-based noise detection approach using the k-means algorithm is presented. We present a new metric for measuring the potentiality (noise factor) of an instance being noisy. Based on the computed noise factor values of the instances, the clustering-based algorithm is then used to identify and eliminate p% of the instances in the dataset. These p% of instances are considered the most likely to be noisy among the instances in the dataset - the p% value is varied from 1% to 40%. The noise detection approach is investigated with respect to two case studies of software measurement data obtained from NASA software projects. The two datasets are characterized by the same thirteen software metrics and a class label that classifies the program modules as fault-prone and not fault-prone. It is shown that as more noisy instances are removed, classification accuracy of the C4.5 learner improves. This indicates that the removed instances are most likely noisy instances that attributed to poor classification accuracy.

In this paper we motivate theoretically and experimentally the use of a deterministic divisive hierarchical method, which we refer to as PCA-Part (Principal Components Analysis Partitioning)for initialization. The criterion that K-means clustering minimizes is the SSE (sum-squared-error) criterion. The first principal direction (the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix) is the direction which contributes the largest SSE. Hence, a good candidate direction to project a cluster for splitting is, then, the first principal direction. This is the basis for PCA-Part initialization method. Our experiments reveal that generally PCA-Part leads K-means to generate clusters with SSE values close to the minimum SSE values obtained by one hundred random start runs. In addition, this deterministic initialization method often leads K-means to faster convergence (less iterations) compared to random methods. Furthermore, we also theoretically show and confirm experimentally on synthetic data when PCA-Part may fail.

Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi) data were acquired over the Copper Cliff mine tailings impoundment area in the VNIR bands during the summers of 1996 and 1998. and Probe 1 data were collected in the VNIR/SWIR bands during the summer of 1999. Endmember fractions of water, lime, fresh and oxidised tailings, low, and high photosynthetic vegetation were obtained using constrained linear spectral unmixing. Vegetation fraction., tailings fraction and texture of the vegetation fraction were used in a K-Mean unsupervised classification, which produced the best results using seven classes (78.13%,, overall accuracy) and captured the vegetation cover from dense homogenous to low density patched cover.

This approach is motivated by the desire to develop all unsupervised classifier which call robustly detect settled regions (i.e.. regions containing man-made structures). It is well known ill the remote sensing community that the ground truth used in supervised classification are not only difficult to obtain but lend to be inconsistent and difficult to validate. In this paper. we present all Unsupervised approach for the problem which combines a two-step analysis of MS imagery with a spatial analysis of higher resolution panchromatic imagery. The MS analysis first combines the multi-spectral pixel information to create an image of pixel labels generated by the K-Means clustering algorithm. Tile-based fFeatures are then computed based on the first and second order class label statistics. These tile features are then used to classify, the tiles via a second application of the K-Means clustering algorithm. The results from this MS analysis define clusters of tiles of variable texture that are highly likely to contain evidence of human settlements. Spatial information is then brought to bear by analyzing co-registered high-resolution panchromatic images. By standard detectors we find the corner and edge densities in each co-registered tile. Determination of the threshold values used to determine the presence or absence of human settlements is currently performed by a human observer. The results of this spatial analysis are then compared and combined with tile MS results to finally determine the set of tiles containing signs of human settlements.

Fluxnet-Canada is a national research network developed to study the influence of climate and disturbance on terrestrial carbon cycling along an east-west transect of Canadian forest and peatlands. The purpose of the present work was to create large-area land cover classifications from satellite imagery to support Fluxnet scaling and modeling studies. The methodology presented in [9] was implemented on seven Fluxnet monitoring sites across Canada. A Landsat ETM+ image covering each site was clustered to 150 classes using unsupervised K-Means classification prior to 50-cluster merging through classification by generalization (CPG). The resulting clusters were merged to 16-class landcover maps through interactive labeling using cluster bitmaps to create spatial context for the 50 clusters. The bitmaps aided the analyst is,hen ground data was scarce or nonexistent. The products were sent to Fluxnet-Canada site managers for ground validation and the classifications were refined according to the feedback provided. The final landcover maps is ere used in the calculation of leaf area index (LAI) for the Landsat ETM+ scenes, thus allowing for upscaling of carbon flux measurements based on the correlation of LAI to carbon flux.

The study area is a 16km-wide, 1,339,495 ha corridor centered the AT and the five New England states (ME, NH, VT, CT, and MA). Ten circa-1990 and circa-2000 scenes (five per date) from NASA's global orthorectified Landsat data set provided cloud-free coverage. Multitemporal (1990/2000) Kauth-Thomas and 1990 single-daft, Kauth-Thomas transforms served as inputs in a two-tiered unsupervised classification scheme (k-means). Analysis identified a disturbed natural vegetation class that was spatially and spectrally distinct from agricuitural crop cycles, drought, and disease. Overall disturbance for New England from 1990-2000 is estimated at 28,383 ha, 2.17% of total corridor land.

As an efficient soft clustering algorithm, PCM is introduce into unsupervised image segmentation and used to cluster model likelihoods for different image blocks to identify corresponding image samples, on the basis, of which the unsupervised segmentation problem is converted into a self-supervised segmentation one. The simulation results on synthetic mosaics, aerial photo and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image show that the new unsupervised image segmentation technique can obtain much better image segmentation performance than the approach based on K-means clustering.

A novel algorithm known as Predictive Trajectory Merge-and-Split (PTMS) has been developed to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and hence update the number of objects in each tracked blob. This hybrid algorithm is based on the Kalman filter and a set of simple heuristics for temporal analysis. Some preliminary results are presented on the estimation of lane geometry through aggregation and K-means clustering of many individual vehicle trajectories modelled by polynomials of varying degree. We show how this process can be made insensitive to the presence of vehicle lane changes inherent in the data. An advantage of this approach is that estimation of lane geometry can be performed with non-stationary uncalibrated cameras.

In this context, text appearing in images represents an important entity for indexing and retrieval purposes. Often, text is superimposed over complex image background and its recognition by a commercial optical character recognition (OCR) engine is difficult. Thus, there is the need for a text segmentation process, including background removal and binarization, in order to achieve a satisfactory recognition rate by OCR. In this paper, an unsupervised learning method for text segmentation in images with complex backgrounds is presented. First, the color of the text and background is determined based on a color quantizer. Then, the pixel color and the standard deviation of the wavelet transformed image are used to distinguish between text and non-text pixels. To classify pixels into text and background, a slightly modified k-means algorithm is applied which is used to produce a binarized text image. The segmentation result is fed into a commercial OCR software to investigate the segmentation quality. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by presenting experimental results for a set of video frames.

The user can specify the desired number of levels of segmentations, minimum number of pixels defining a peak, and degree of non-linearity in mapping from principal component floating values to histogram bins, all of which affect the derived segmentation. In the present work, we seek to extend previous work which arrives at a small range of clusters or segmentation levels from the image itself. We seek within this range to find "better" segmentations or possibly a unique representative segmentation. The method employed to achieve this goal starts with an over-fine segmentation, i.e. more segmentation levels than needed, and uses quantitative metrics to measure the "quality" of that segmentation and to guide a compression into a reduced segmentation. If the method has merit, different starts should compress down into comparable segmentations. Therefore a measure to establish the similarity of two or more segmentations was developed. Different quantitative metrics were studied and several modes of compression were examined. Some impressive results are presented but the methods are still not robust with respect to segmentation starts and are image dependent as to the best modes of compression.

TIFCORR can stiffer from inconsistencies in mixing system estimation, thus we present a modified algorithm incorporating k-means clustering [2] to improve estimation robustness. To improve the data efficiency of TIFCORR, we also include an adaptive weighting function for mixing column estimates. These modifications transform our algorithm into a block adaptive algorithm with the ability to track time-varying mixtures.

In classifying complex patterns with high similarity like these defect patterns, the selection of an optimal feature set and an appropriate recognizer is a pre-requisite to a high recognition rate. In this paper GA and K-means algorithm were used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are divided into two classes using a linear decision function. This process is repeated at each node until all the patterns are classified into individual classes. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree can be constructed automatically, and the final recognizer is implemented by a neural network trained by standard patterns at each node. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

We use the k-mean clustering technique to group returned hit list documents. The relevancy of each cluster is evaluated according to document relevancy scores in the clusters. The final relevancy score of each document is a combination of the relevancy score of cluster and individual document. To form clusters with features more related to the query, we use pseudo-feedback documents to construct a latent semantic index (LSI), which transforms all the documents in the hit list into LSI feature vectors. Feature vectors constructed with relevant features are input to the clustering algorithm. We show that LSI based on relevant documents can improve the hit list cluster coherence significantly, in the sense that clusters group query relevant and irrelevant documents separately. We also show that the improved cluster quality, which results to better separation between relevant and irrelevant documents, can be used to improve the precision of a query hit list significantly.

This paper aims to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting by implementing multirelational data mining process on the large data sets of stores, products, and shoppers. Most existing data mining approaches look for patterns in a single relation of a database. Multi-relational data mining can analyze data from multiple relations directly without the need to transfer the data into a single relation first. Two data mining models are proposed in this paper, which are Pure Classification (PC) model and Hybrid Clustering Classification (HCC) model. Pure Classification model uses k-Nearest Neighbor Classification technique, and Hybrid Clustering Classification first uses k-Mean Mode Clustering to define clusters and then uses k-Nearest Neighbor classification to find k most similar objects. Hybrid Clustering Classification model introduces a concept of combining existing data mining techniques on the multi-relational data sets. Experimental results show that Hybrid Clustering Classification is particularly promising for demand forecasting.

Data mining techniques like clustering analysis have been successfully applied to drug screening data. However, clustering analysis of drug screening data often leads to neighborhood searching in very high-dimensional space, which remains to be a contemporary challenge. In this paper, we propose an efficient density based clustering method, which exploits compressed vertical data structures, P-trees(1), and optimized logical operations to accelerate the calculation of the density function within neighborhood rings. Experiments on Thrombin drug screening dataset, which contains 139,351 binary attributes, demonstrated that our approach can be not only efficient, but also accuracy in distinguishing molecular bioactivity for drug design.

It has been successfully applied to other kernel-based learning algorithms. Also, there are experimental studies on RSVM that showed the efficiency of RSVM. In this paper we propose a robust method to build the model of RSVM via RBF (Gaussian) kernel construction. Applying clustering algorithm to each class, we can generate cluster centroids of each class and use them to form the reduced set which is used in RSVM. We also estimate the approximate density for each cluster to get the parameter used in Gaussian kernel. Under the compatible classification performance on the test set, our method selects a smaller reduced set than the one via random selection scheme. Moreover, it determines the kernel parameter automatically and individually for each point in the reduced set while the RSVM used a common kernel parameter which is determined by a tuning procedure.

Our technique for grouping protein interaction is based on ART-1 neural network. The cluster prototype constructed with existing protein interaction data is used to predict the class of new protein interactions. The protein interaction data of S.cerevisiae (bakers yeast) from MIPS and SGD are used. The clustering performance was compared with traditional k-means clustering method in terms of cluster distance. According to the experimental results, the proposed method shows about 89.7% clustering accuracy and the feature selection filter boosted overall performances about 14.8%. Also, inter-cluster distances of cluster constructed with ART-I based clustering method have shown high cluster quality.

Introduced in the early 90's, they led to an explosion of interest in machine learning. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a selected training set classified in advance. With the repaid development of the internet and telecommunication, huge of information has been produced as digital data format, generally the data is unlabeled. It is impossible to classify the data with one's own hand one by one in many realistic problems, so that the research on unlabeled data classification has been grown. Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. In this paper, a SVMs classifier based on k-means algorithm is presented for the classification of unlabeled data.

A major goal is to create a behavioral system for the virtual actors so that they behave as realistic as possible. Among the large number of different techniques to solve this problem, those based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) do represent a powerful (but not well explored yet) approach. In this paper, we present a new framework for behavioral animation of virtual actors. The framework applies several Artificial Intelligence techniques (neural networks, expert systems, fuzzy logic, K-means) to build a sophisticated behavioral system so that the actors can take intelligent decisions by themselves. The paper describes the general framework, its main components and how these AI techniques have been effectively applied to this purpose. Some programming issues, the main steps of the simulation flow and some illustrative examples are also analyzed in this paper.

We designed and tested different classifiers and investigated ways of combining them to improve classification rates. The classifiers we tried were (1) a morphological shared-weight neural net, (2) a linear perceptron, (3) a decision template classifier, and (4) a k-means classifier. Six methods of combining the classifiers were tested: four ordered average operators (maximum, minimum, average, and competition jury vote) and two fuzzy integrals (Choquet integral and Seguno integral). Testing results show that the combined classifiers perform better than individual classifiers with correct classification rates of 99.2%.

In this Letter, a new algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) is presented. The ICA mixture model (ICAMM) algorithm that models class distributions as non-Gaussian densities has been employed for unsupervised classification of a test image from the AVIRIS sensor. A number of feature-extraction techniques have also been examined that serve as a pre-processing step to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data. The proposed ICAMM algorithm results in significant increase in the classification accuracy over that obtained from the conventional K -means algorithm for land cover classification.

In the previous papers, we reported an unsupervised image segmentation method based on Bayesian classifier and applied it to object-to-object color transformation. Although Bayesian decision rule is a robust tool to classify the objects statistically with the minimum error in average, it needs to preset some appropriate class centers before starting the classifier. The location of initial seed points much influences the segmentation accuracy. This paper discusses a better way to set the initial seeds and reports the Bayesian discriminator works better when coupled with k-means classifier for correcting the location of seed points. In addition, the paper introduces a new application of proposed model into scene color interchanges between segmented objects.

It began as a simple system designed to automatically grade student,essays. The idea was to alleviate the heavy demand placed on teachers to do such a task. For example, imagine the time and effort involved for a social studies teacher to grade eighty-two tests, each containing three essay answers. How long will the teacher spend grading the tests? How consistent will the grading be? The purpose of an automated essay assessment system is to classify essays according to their content. The classes A, A C, A and F correspond to an academic grade assigned by a teacher for each student written essay. These classes are rated from highest quality to lowest quality, respectively. Quality, for this purpose, will be determined by content. Clustering algorithms such as K-Means can be used to alleviate the grading tasks. This preliminary work shows related documents can be assigned to the same clusters to perhaps reduce the number of documents to be graded.

By doing a fuzzy classification of a query into the regions of support represented by the ISVMs, past experience is merged with short-term (i.e., intra-query) learning. However this led to the representation of long-term (i.e., inter-query) learning with a constantly growing number of 1SVMs in the feature space. We present an improved version of our earlier work that uses an incremental k-means algorithm to cluster 1SVMs. The main advantage of the improved approach is that it is scalable and can accelerate query processing by considering only a small number of cluster representatives, rather than the entire set of accumulated 1SVMs. Experimental results against real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Preliminary analysis of the results on the basis of the trace elements Sr, Y/Zr, and Th suggest three phases, two of which were identified by earlier micro-Raman spectroscopy as larnite (beta-Ca2SiO4) and CaSiO3-walstromite, two minerals with significantly different Ca content. In order to support this multiphase model for the investigated inclusion the data set was analysed combining the conventional multivariate method of PCA and K-means clustering procedure after application of instrument specific routines such as spectral evaluation and normalization. Through the knowledge of the full spatial 3D structure of the different phases, it was possible to correct for absorption of the fluorescent radiation in the different phases of the inclusion and the surrounding diamond.

J	Lin, TH; Li, HT; Tsai, KC				Lin, TH; Li, HT; Tsai, KC			Implementing the Fisher's discriminant ratio in a k-means clustering algorithm for feature selection and data set trimming	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							HIV-1 PROTEASE INHIBITORS; MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS; REGION SELECTION; DESIGN; 3D-QSAR; DESCRIPTORS; RECOGNITION; DERIVATIVES; SIMILARITY; PROTEINASE	The Fisher's discriminant ratio has been used as a class separability criterion and implemented in a k-means clustering algorithm for performing simultaneous feature selection and data set trimming on a set of 221 HIV-1 protease inhibitors. The total number of molecular descriptors computed for each inhibitor is 43, and they are scaled to lie between I and 0 before being subjected to the feature selection process. Since the purpose is to select some of the most class sensitive descriptors, several feature evaluation indices such as the Shannon entropy, the linear regression of selected descriptors on the pK(i) of selected inhibitors, and a stepwise variable selection program are used to filter them. While the Shannon entropy provides the information content for each descriptor computed, more class sensitive descriptors are searched by both the linear regression and stepwise variable selection procedures. The inhibitors are divided into several different numbers of classes. They are subsequently divided into five classes due to the fact that the best feature selection result is obtained by the division. Most of the good features selected are the topological descriptors, and they are correlated well with the pKi values. The outliers or the inhibitors with less class-sensitive descriptor values computed for each selected descriptor are identified and gathered by the k-means clustering algorithm. These are the trimmed inhibitors, while the remaining ones are retained or selected. We find that 44% or 98 inhibitors can be retained when the number of good descriptors selected for clustering is three. The descriptor values of these selected inhibitors are far more class sensitive than the original ones as evidenced by substantial increasing in statistical significance when they are subjected to both the SYBYL CoMFA PLS and Cerius(2) PLS regression analyses.

J	Zhou, XB; Wang, XD; Dougherty, ER; Russ, D; Suh, E				Zhou, XB; Wang, XD; Dougherty, ER; Russ, D; Suh, E			Gene clustering based on clusterwide mutual information	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						gene microarray; clustering; mutual information; simulated annealing; bootstrap technique; K-means; fuzzy C-means	EXPRESSION DATA; DRUG DISCOVERY; PATTERNS; NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; BOOTSTRAP	Cluster analysis of gene-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization studies has proved to be a useful tool for identifying biologically relevant groupings of genes and constructing gene regulatory networks. The motivation for considering mutual information is its capacity to measure a general dependence among gene random variables. We propose a novel clustering strategy based on minimizing mutual information among gene clusters. Simulated annealing is employed to solve the optimization problem. Bootstrap techniques are employed to get more accurate estimates of mutual information when the data sample size is small. Moreover, we propose to combine the mutual information criterion and traditional distance criteria such as the Euclidean distance and the fuzzy membership metric in designing the clustering algorithm. The performances of the new clustering methods are compared with those of some existing methods, using both synthesized data and experimental data. It is seen that the clustering algorithm based on a combined metric of mutual information and fuzzy membership achieves the best performance.

J	Ariely, D; Lynch, JG; Aparicio, M				Ariely, D; Lynch, JG; Aparicio, M			Learning by collaborative and individual-based recommendation agents	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							BRAND CHOICE BEHAVIOR; CONSUMER	Intelligent recommendation systems can be based on 2 basic principles: collaborative filters and individual-based agents. In this work we examine the learning function that results from these 2 general types of teaming-smart agents. There has been significant work on the predictive properties of each type, but no work has examined the patterns in their learning from feedback over repeated trials. Using simulations, we create clusters of "consumers" with heterogeneous utility functions and efforful reservation utility thresholds. The consumers go shopping with one of the designated smart agents, receive recommendations from the agents, and purchase products they like and reject ones they do not. Based on the purchase-no purchase behavior of the consumers, agents learn about the consumers and potentially improve the quality of their recommendations. We characterize learning curves by modified exponential functions with an intercept for percentage of recommendations accepted at Trial 0, an asymptotic rate of recommendation acceptance, and a rate at which learning moves from intercept to asymptote. We compare the learning of a baseline random recommendation agent, an individual-based logistic-regression agent, and two types of collaborative filters that rely on K-mean clustering (popular in most commercial applications) and nearest-neighbor algorithms. Compared to the collaborative filtering agents, the individual agent (a) learns more slowly, initially, but performs better in the long run when the environment is stable; (b) is less negatively affected by permanent changes in the consumer's utility function; and (c) is less adversely affected by error in the reservation threshold to which consumers compare a recommended product's utility. The K-mean agent reaches a lower asymptote but approaches it faster, reflecting a surprising stickiness of target classifications after feedback from recommendations made under initial (incorrect) hypotheses.

Several images covering the whole surface of the fruits were acquired thanks to a prototype grading machine. These images were then segmented and the features of the defects were extracted. During a learning procedure, the objects were classified into clusters by k-mean clustering. The classification probabilities of the objects were summarised and on this basis the fruits were graded using quadratic discriminant analysis. The fruits were correctly graded with a rate of 73%. The errors were found having origins in the segmentation of the defects or for a particular wound, in a confusion with the calyx end. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Konig, M; Winther, JG; Kohler, J; Konig, F				Konig, M; Winther, JG; Kohler, J; Konig, F			Two methods for firn-area and mass-balance monitoring of Svalbard glaciers with SAR satellite images	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article							KONGSVEGEN; ICE; SPITSBERGEN	This paper presents two methods for glacier monitoring on Svalbard using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images. Both methods were developed on glaciers in the Kongsfjorden area. The first method monitors the firn area extent and the firn line over time by thresholding and filtering the SAR image. Manual detection of the threshold is preferable, but using a constant threshold for all images also gives adequate results. A retreat of the firn-line position is visible, especially on Kongsvegen, corresponding to consecutive years of negative mass balance. The second method applies a k-means classification to three clusters on the glacier surface. The areal extent of the resulting class on the upper part of the glacier correlates remarkably well with the independently measured mass balance of Kongsvegen, having a correlation coefficient of around 0.89 for the various glaciers. This is because the snow from the accumulation area influences the k-means classification. Thus, on glaciers where mass-balance values are available, new mass-balance values can be predicted solely from SAR images. For glaciers where no mass balance is available, the area change cannot be calibrated to absolute mass-balance values, but relative changes can be predicted.

J	Kuo, RJ; Chang, K; Chien, SY				Kuo, RJ; Chang, K; Chien, SY			Integration of self-organizing feature maps and genetic-algorithm-based clustering method for market segmentation	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						market segmentation; clustering analysis; genetic algorithms; self-organizing feature maps	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Clustering analysis has been widely applied in the area of market segmentation. Conventional research usually uses the multivariate analysis method. Recently, due to promising results of computational intelligence techniques in engineering, they are also considered for market segmentation. Among them, genetic algorithms (GAs) are theoretically and empirically found to provide globally near-optimal solutions for various complex optimization problems. Because GA is good at searching, it can cluster the data according to their similarities. In addition, artificial neural networks also have high performance in both engineering and management. Hence, this research proposes a novel 2-stage method, which first uses self-organizing feature maps (SCIMs) to determine the number of clusters and then employs a GA-based clustering method to find the final solution (it is defined as S + G in this research). The results of simulated data via a Monte Carlo study show that the proposed method outperforms the other 2 methods: K means, which uses SOM to determine the number of clusters, and SOM followed by K means, based on both within-cluster variations (SSW) and the number of misclassifications. To further verify the proposed approach, a real-world problem, wireless telecommunications industry market segmentation, is employed. The results also show that the proposed method has the lowest SSW among the 3 methods.

The LPM metric is evaluated using a semantic image classification task where the database contains 11 categories of natural images with an accurate ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed techniques for multimedia data classification and retrieval.

We propose a novel way to group nodes, using information-theoretic principles to choose both the number of such groups and the mapping from nodes to groups. Our algorithm is completely parameter-free, and also scales practically linearly with the problem size. Further, we propose novel algorithms which use this node group structure to get further insights into the data, by finding outliers and computing distances between groups. Finally, we present experiments on multiple synthetic and real-life datasets, where our methods give excellent, intuitive results.

Often, these parameters directly or indirectly control the number of clusters to return. In the presence of different data characteristics and analysis contexts, it is often difficult for the user to estimate the number of clusters in the data set. This is especially true in text collections such as Web documents, images or biological data. The fundamental question this paper addresses is: "How can we effectively estimate the natural number of clusters in a given text collection?". We propose to use spectral analysis, which analyzes the eigenvalues (not eigenvectors) of the collection, as the solution to the above. We first present the relationship between a text collection and its underlying spectra. We then show how the answer to this question enhances the clustering process. Finally, we conclude with empirical results and related work.

However, characterization of clusters followed by clustering may not always produce clusters associated with special features, because the first clustering process and the second classification step are done independently, demanding an elegant way that combines clustering and classification and executes both simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on itemsets as the feature for characterizing groups, and present a technique called "itemset classified clustering," which divides data into groups given the restriction that only divisions expressed using a common itemset are allowed and computes the optimal itemset maximizing the interclass variance between the groups. Although this optimization problem is generally intractable, we develop techniques that effectively prune the search space and efficiently compute optimal solutions in practice. We remark that itemset classified clusters are likely to be overlooked by traditional clustering algorithms such as two-clustering or k-means, and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm with respect to the amount of data by the application of our method to real biological datasets.

To separate the test data, we analyze the local area of the test data set using local probability distribution and decide the candidate class of the data set. To decide each class of the test data, statistical hypothesis theory is applied to the decided candidate class of the test data set. To evaluate, the proposed classification method is compared to the conventional fuzzy c-mean method and k-means algorithm. The simulation results show more accuracy than results of fuzzy c-mean method and k-means algorithm.

Hence, landscape ecologists have a central interest in a comprehensive understanding of such changes. Our study focuses on the relationships between environmental conditions and agricultural land-cover changes. We present a method to (i) characterise the major spatial-temporal processes of land-cover changes, (ii) identify the correlations between environmental attributes and land-cover changes and (iii) derive potential environmental drivers of land-cover changes in a German marginal rural landscape. The method was applied to study land-cover dynamics from 1945 to 1998 in the districts of Erda, Steinbrucken and Eibelshausen, situated in the marginal rural landscape of the Lahn-Dill Highlands, Germany. We employed land-cover data gained by the interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photographs. Various environmental variables were introduced into the analyses. We identified physical landscape attributes (elevation, slope, aspect, available water capacity and soil texture) and structural landscape dimensions (patch size, patch shape and distance between patch and nearest settlement). With the aid of GIS, K-means partitioning and canonical correspondence analysis, we investigated land-cover trajectory types, land-cover transitions at individual time intervals and their relationships to these environmental variables. Our results show that, between 1945 and 1998, land-cover changes correlated with the physical attributes of the underlying landscape. On the other hand, the structural landscape dimensions correlated with land cover only in periods of minor land-cover changes (1972-98). Greater diversity of physical landscape attributes is correlated with greater land-cover dynamics. Besides the important influence of socio-economic factors, land-cover changes in the study areas took place within the relatively stable physical constraints of the underlying landscape.

The new method, associative clustering (AC), maximizes a Bayes factor between two clustering models differing only in one respect: whether the clusterings of the two data sets are dependent or independent. The model both extends Information Bottleneck (IB)-type dependency modeling to continuous-valued data and offers it a well-founded and asymptotically well-behaving criterion for small data sets: With suitable prior assumptions the Bayes factor becomes equivalent to the hypergeometric probability of a contingency table, while for large data sets it becomes the standard mutual information. An optimization algorithm is introduced, with empirical comparisons to a combination of IB and K-means, and to plain K-means. Two case studies cluster genes 1) to find dependencies between gene expression and transcription factor binding, and 2) to find dependencies between expression in different organisms.

The perceptual importance or salience of image pixels can be studied using a statistical measure of pixel-based features. The "outliers" or greatest values for this measure can be regarded as salient because in an imaging sense, the outliers tend to contribute to the local feature contrast. Our method finds important image features first by spatially decomposing the image using a process that models the human vision system. Salience maps then are created using the Mahalanobis distance, and a scalar visibility metric then is analyzed. Six mammographers each read three mammograms. Each mammogram had two views. During screening, eye position data were recorded. A K-means algorithm then was applied to identify fixation clusters. Following decomposition, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) then was performed to examine the effects of observer experience, spatial frequency, and discrimination using the maximum value of the visibility metric. This pilot study shows statistically significant differences in true positive and true negative features, and in both the features and filters used to discriminate true negative results between expert and resident observers. This type of analysis can be useful for finding fixation tendencies that result from the available spatial features during mammogram screening.

The algorithm was applied to 160 cranio-caudal DDSM mammograms (80 Lumisys and 80 Howtek images). The breast region was first segmented from its background using our self-organizing map (SOM) with knowledge-based refinement algorithm (presented previously). A different SOM neural network was subsequently developed to operate within the determined breast region. Multiscale feature vectors from the breast region were used to train the new SOM. The weight vectors of the SOM were then clustered by the K-means method, resulting in a breast region segmented into K different clusters. The prevalence of SOM clusters containing dense tissues was calculated to develop a summary density index. Statistical analysis was applied to optimize the implementation parameters of the summary index. The average summary index was higher in dense breasts than in non-dense breasts. The trend was consistent for both digitizers. though the results were statistically significant for only the Lumisys set. Unsupervised clustering and segmentation of mammograms is a promising approach for automated breast density assessment.

A total of 217 ultrasound images were segmented by using a K-Mean classifier, and the head skull was detected in 214 of the 217 cases by an iterative randomized Hough transform developed for detection of incomplete curves in images with strong noise without user intervention. The automatic measurements were compared with conventional manual measurements by sonographers and a trained panel. The inter-run variations and differences between the automatic and conventional measurements were small compared with published inter-observer variations. The results showed that the automated measurements were as reliable as the expert measurements and more consistent. This method has great potential in clinical applications.

Recently, some algorithms have been developed to achieve this goal. Because of the particularity of cell pathology images, the result of the image retrieval based on single characteristic is not satisfactory. A new method for pathology image retrieval by combining color, texture and morphologic features to search cell images is proposed. Firstly, nucleus regions of leukocytes in images are automatically segmented by K-mean clustering method. Then single leukocyte region is detected by utilizing thresholding algorithm segmentation and mathematics morphology. The features that include color, texture and morphologic features are extracted from single leukocyte to represent main attribute in the search query. The features are then normalized because the numerical value range and physical meaning of extracted features are different. Finally, the relevance feedback system is introduced. So that the system can automatically adjust the weights of different features and improve the results of retrieval system according to the feedback information. Retrieval results using the proposed method fit closely with human perception and are better than those obtained with the methods based on single feature.

To classify the tissues by physiological characteristics is not satisfactory in high noise functional medical images. In this study, we incorporated both tissue time-activity curves (TACs) and derived "kinetic parametric curves (KPCs)" information to develop a novel image segmentation method for liver tissues classification in dynamic FDG-PET studies. Validation of proposed method, four common clustering techniques, include K-mean (KM), Fuzzy C-mean (FCM), Isodata (ISO), Markov Random Fields (MRF), and proposed method were compared to evaluate its precision of segmentation performance. As results, 35.6% and 6.7% less mean errors in mean difference for KPCs and TACs are performed, respectively, than other methods. With combined KPCs and TACs based clustering method can provide the ability to diagnose ill liver tissues exactly.

Many heuristic algorithms have been developed to cluster genes on microarray data. However, their results may be dominated by some predefined criteria, such as the number of clusters and initial mean points of clusters. Moreover, most current algorithms assign each one of genes in the dataset into some cluster while some of them are irrelevant to the interested conditions. To automatically cluster informative genes together and discard the irrelevant genes, we consider the clustering problem as maximizing correlativity among genes in a cluster. An iterative GA approach is proposed to find the tightest clusters (no irrelevant genes) and the most appropriate number of clusters. The proposed approach is applied on Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset, and 21 significant clusters derived while 336 genes are discarded. The derived clusters have the deserving characteristics of intracluster tightness and intercluster distinctness. Furthermore, our method compares with K-Means heuristics under several clustering validation criteria and performs better than K-Means.

In this paper we adopt this principle to build classification models through interactively clustering a training data set to construct a tree of clusters. The leaf clusters of the tree are selected as decision clusters to classify new data based on a distance function. We consider the feature weights in calculating the distances between a new object and the center of a decision cluster. The new algorithm, W-k-means, is used to automatically calculate the feature weights from the training data. The Fastmap technique is used to handle outliers in selecting decision clusters. This step increases the stability of the classifier. Experimental results on public domain data sets have shown that the models built using this clustering approach outperformed some popular classification algorithms.

The mouse is one of the best models of mammalian fertility due to its well-characterized genetics and the existence of many infertile mutants both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. We used cDNA microarrays firstly to investigate normal gene expression in the wild-type (wt) testis and secondly to gain a better insight into the effect of the disruption of the Dazl gene on spermatogenesis. We constructed a cDNA microarray from a subtracted and normalized adult testis library and focused on six developmental time-points during the initial synchronous wave of spermatogenesis. The results suggest that in the wild-type testis, 89.5% of genes on our chip change expression dramatically during the time-course. To identify patterns in the gene-expression data, a k-means clustering algorithm and principal component analysis were used. In the Dazl knockout testes, the majority of genes remain at baseline levels of expression, because absence of Dazl has a severe effect on cell-types present in the testis. Although in the prepubescent Dazl-null mice the final point reached in germ cell development is the leptotene-zygotene stage, the microarray results suggest that lack of Dazl expression has a detectable effect on the mRNA complement of germ cells as early as day 5 when only type A spermatogonia are present.

Modelling and classification of the LSMs can lead to prediction of their time-space behaviour, and enhance the protection of the existing and new power systems and transmission lines. Prediction requires the classification of the simulated results and physical data, and comparing them together using characterization. Since the LSMs are highly nonlinear, nonstationary, and stochastic, ordinary models and analyses are incapable of simulating and characterizing these phenomena. Since self affinity of such maps is an indication of multifractality, percolation models and complexity measures such as the Renyi fractal dimension spectrum (RS) and Mandelbrot singularity spectrum (MS) are utilized. The data of the LSMs have been obtained through the Canadian Lightning Detection Network (CLDN) for Manitoba in the year 2002. The data have been characterized by both the RS and MS. Features have been extracted using the RS. Classification employed the regular and fuzzy K-means methods. For each classification method, 50 tests have been utilized, and classification performance for 2 to 15 classes has been investigated through Davis-Bouldin criterion. The fuzzy K-means classifier identified 6 optimal classes with a confidence level of 0.78, while the regular K-means algorithm could not distinguish the classes.

Interval set representation of a cluster consists of a lower bound and an upper bound. Objects in lower bound are definitely part of the cluster, and only belong to that cluster. Objects in the upper bound are possibly part of that cluster and potentially belong to another cluster. The interval sets make it possible to describe ambiguity in categorizing some of the objects. The interval clusters can be unsupervised counterparts of supervised rough sets. This paper describes two unsupervised algorithms for obtaining interval clusters. First algorithm is an extension of K-means based on properties of rough sets. The second algorithm is an extension of fuzzy C-means clustering. The paper describes conditions under which the fuzzy C-means clustering can lead to interval sets that obey some of the properties of rough sets. An experimental comparison of interval clusters from both the approaches is also provided.

Our idea is based on onservation on the clusters into which an image is divided by hierarchical k-means clustering with space feature and color feature. This clustering method has the advantage of extracting the region of an object with some varied size. We insist that our idea should lead to detect a target object quickly, because it is not necessary to search the locations containing no targets. First, we evaluate our clustering method and second, we demonstrate that our method is effective on an object detection by applying to our face detection system. We show that the detection time can be reduced by 24%.

They have a common probability evaluation module, but very different clustering and regression modules. The statistical model uses a typical K-means algorithm for data clustering, and a multivariate linear regression to build the estimation function, while the DENFIS-based model uses an evolving clustering method (ECM) and a dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) respectively. The predictions from these two models were evaluated on the meteorological data compiled from 454 worldwide locations, and the comparative analysis shows advantages of the DENFIS-based model as used for estimating the potential establishment of a pest insect.

In this paper, we propose a new robust clustering method based on the concept of density estimation in an autocorrelation derived feature space. In that feature space, clusters are better separated than in the original data space, making clustering easier. The autocorrelation features comprise the input to a new Probabilistic Neural Network motivated clustering algorithm. We show that the method can also be applied for outlier detection when only one class of data exists. The proposed method was tested with simulated data and real data collected front bioaffinity assay applications. The algorithm was able to separate the clusters despite of the presence of outliers in every case. In addition, we demonstrate that combinations Of traditional robust estimation techniques and clustering algorithms (k-means, fuzzy k-means) failed to detect different populations of data when applied to the same damsels due to existence of outliers.

K-means has been used in many clustering work because of the ease of the algorithm. Our main effort is to parallelize the k-means clustering algorithm. The parallel version is implemented based on the inherent parallelism during the Distance Calculation and Centroid Update phases. The parallel K-means algorithm is designed in such a way that each P participating node is responsible for handling n/P data points. We run the program on a Linux Cluster with a maximum of eight nodes using message-passing programming model. We examined the performance based on the percentage of correct answers and its speed-up performance. The outcome shows that our parallel K-means program performs relatively well on large datasets.

It is important to identify synergistic transcriptional motifs. Its search space is so large that an efficient computational method is required. In this paper, we present the method that can search automatically both transcriptional motif list and gene expression profiles for synergistic motif combinations. It uses evolutionary algorithms to find an optimal solution for the problems which have the huge search space. Our approach includes the additional evolutionary operator performing local search to improve searching ability. Our method was applied to four Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression datasets. The result shows that genes containing synergistic motif combination from our optimization technique are highly correlated than those from k-means clustering. In cell cycle as well as other expression datasets, our results generally coincide with the previous experimental results.

For this purpose, the PESA-II EA is adapted for the clustering problem by the incorporation of specialized mutation and initialization procedures, described herein. Two conceptually orthogonal measures of cluster quality are selected for optimization, enabling, for the first time, a clustering algorithm to explore and improve different compromise solutions during the clustering process. Our results, on a diverse suite of 15 real and synthetic data sets - where the correct classes are known - demonstrate a clear advantage to the multiobjective approach: solutions in the discovered Pareto set are objectively better than those obtained when the same EA is applied to optimize just one measure. Moreover, the multiobjective EA exhibits a far more robust level of performance than both the classic k-means and average-link agglomerative clustering algorithms, outperforming them substantially on aggregate.

K-means is one of the widely used clustering algorithms. In this work, we have developed and evaluated parallelization of k-means method for low-dimensional data on message passing computers. Three different data decomposition schemes and their impact on the pruning of distance calculations in tree-based k-means algorithm have been studied. Random pattern decomposition has good load balancing but fails to prune distance calculations effectively. Compact spatial decomposition of patterns based on space filling curves outperforms random pattern decomposition even though it has load imbalance problem. In both cases, parallel tree-based k-means clustering runs significantly faster than the traditional parallel k-means.

Unlike popular clustering algorithms such as k-means and DBSCAN, this algorithm is designed specifically for IP addresses. In particular, the algorithm employs the longest prefix match as a similarity metric and uses an adaptation of the nearest neighbor algorithm for search to yield meaningful clusters. The algorithm is automatic in that it does not require any input parameters. When applied to a large IP address dataset, the algorithm produced 90% correct clusters. Correct cluster analysis is essential for many network design and management tasks including design of web caches and server replications.

The classification techniques used in our study are based on cluster analysis of textural features. Variations of traditional K-Means Clustering are applied in the HRCT setting. A novel technique called label correction capable of segmenting "true" labelled pixel groups within the regions outlined by domain experts is presented: Label Correction helps to "clean" the training data before supervised learning, and also provides more accurate evaluation on the testing data. The system was tested on 321 HRCT scans comprising varying diseases together with normal scans and successfully evaluated on the manually labelled scans by the doctors. In addition, the image segmentation results were visually validated by the radiologists.

The approach is based on representing the face manifold in a low-dimensional space using the Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) algorithm and then performing K-means clustering. We define the face models as the cluster centers. Our strategy is motivated by the efficiency of LLE to recover meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in complex and high dimensional data such as face images. Two other well-known unsupervised learning algorithms (Isomap and SOM) are also considered. We compare and assess the efficiency of these different schemes on the CMU MoBo database which contains 96 face sequences of 24 subjects. The results clearly show significant performance enhancements over traditional methods such as the PCA-based one.

However, since text is often printed against a complex background, it is often difficult to detect. In this paper, a robust text localization approach is presented, which can automatically detect horizontally aligned text with different sizes, fonts, colors and languages. First, a wavelet transform is applied to the image and the distribution of high-frequency wavelet coefficients is considered to statistically characterize text and non-text areas. Then, the k-means algorithm is used to classify text areas in the image. The detected text areas undergo a projection analysis in order to refine their localization. Finally, a binary segmented text image is generated, to be used as input to an OCR engine. The detection performance of our approach is demonstrated by presenting experimental results for a set of video frames taken from the MPEG-7 video test set.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOL 1	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	AUG 23-26, 2004	Cambridge, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, Univ Surrey, UniS, IEEE Comp Soc, HP Res Labs Bristol	British Machine Vis Assoc			This paper presents an adaptative algorithm for the segmentation of color images suited for document image analysis. The algorithm is based on a serialization of the k-means algorithm that is applied sequentially by using a sliding window over the image. The algorithm reuses information about the clusters computed by the previous classification and automatically adjusts the clusters during the windows displacement in order to better adapt the classifier to any new local modification of the colors. For digitized documents, we propose to define several different clusters in the color feature space for the same logical class. We also reintroduce the user into the initialization step who must define the different samples of colors for each class and the number of classes. This algorithm has been tested successfully on ancient color manuscripts having heavy defects, showing lighting variation and transparency. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is generic enough to be applied on a large variety of images using other features for different purposes like color image segmentation as well as image binarization.

We construct two kinds of map by analyzing the spatial color distributions to take account of the human visual system: homogeneity map (H-map) and distinctiveness map (D-map). Then, we assign weight value to all color vectors by combining these maps to consider two factors at the same time. To extract representative colors, we define a new cost function and use the LKMA (local K-Means algorithm) with weighted color vectors. In this stage, we utilize an incremental splitting scheme with a penalty term to determine optimal number of clusters adaptively. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm reproduces an image preserving significant local features while removing unimportant details of an original image from the viewpoint of human.

In recent years, data in some applications has increased in both the number of instances and features. It is in this context that we introduce a novel approach to reduce both instance and feature space through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the classification of Emphysema in High Resolution Computer Tomography (HRCT) images. The technique was tested successfully on 60 HRCT scans having, Emphysema using three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Seeded K Means). The results were also compared against "density mask", a standard approach used for Emphysema detection in medical image analysis. In addition, the results were visually validated by radiologists.

Theoretical results show benefits resembling those of boosting algorithms, and bring new modified weighted versions of clustering algorithms such as k-means, expectation-maximization (EM) and k-harmonic means. Experiments display the quality of the results obtained, and corroborate the advantages that subtle data reweightings may indeed bring to clustering.

Recognizing semantic events in video requires to preliminary learn the different classes of events. This first stage is crucial since it conditions the further classification results. In video content analysis, the task is especially difficult due to the high intra-class variability and to noisy measurements. We then represent each class by the centers of several sub-classes (or clusters) thanks to a robust partitional clustering algorithm which can be applied in parallel to a (non-predefined) number of classes. Our clustering technique overcome three main limitations of standard K-means methods: sensitivity to initialization, choice of the number of clusters and influence of outliers. Moreover, it can process the training data in an incremental way. Experimental results on sports videos are reported.

The main difficulty, however, is that its performance is highly susceptible to the initialized partition. To attack this problem, a suboptimal K-Means algorithm is briefly reviewed by applying dynamic programming over the principal component direction. In particular, a heuristic clustering dissimilarity, the Delta-MSE function, is incorporated into the suboptimal K-Means algorithm. The Delta-MSE function is derived by calculating the difference of within-class variance before and after moving a given data sample from one cluster to another. Experimental results show that the suboptimal K-Means algorithm that uses the Delta-MSE dissimilarity generally outperforms the original L-2 distance based suboptimal algorithm and a specific kd-tree clustering algorithm.

Existing clustering methods either fail to capture the data or use restrictive models such as HMMs or AR models to model the data. In this paper, we present a general order-preserving clustering algorithm that allows arbitrary patterns of data evolution by representing each ordered set as a curve. Clustering of the data then reduces to grouping curves based on shape similarity. We develop a novel measure of shape similarity between curves using scale-space distance. Shape similarity or dis-similarity is judged by composing higher-dimensional curves from constituent curves and noting the additional twists and turns in such curves that can be attributed to shape differences. An algorithm analogous to K-means clustering is then developed that uses prototypical curves for representing clusters. Results are demonstrated on ordered gene expression data sets obtained from gene chips.

The problem is involved in the on-going development of a digital system for the virtual aided recomposition of fragmented frescos, an innovative approach currently being proved on the S. Matthew's fresco, made by Cimabue for the Upper Church of S. Francis in Assisi and broken, during the earthquake in 1997, into more than 140.000 pieces. The developed technique has been used to build the fragments' database. The segmentation process is based on the fast global k- means algorithm. Experiments show that separation of foreground and background on a so large number of images is much more manageable and effective using prototypes built by the clustering algorithm.

The feature space is then clustered, and each pixel is labeled with the cluster that contains its feature vector. A major limitation of this approach is that feature space clusters generally lack spatial coherence (i.e., they do not correspond to a compact grouping of pixels). In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that operates simultaneously in feature space and in image space. We define an energy function over both a set of clusters and a labeling of pixels with clusters. In our framework, a pixel is labeled with a single cluster (rather than, for example, a distribution over clusters). Our energy function penalizes clusters that are a poor fit to the data in feature space, and also penalizes clusters whose pixels lack spatial coherence. The energy function can be efficiently minimized using graph cuts. Our algorithm can incorporate both parametric and non-parametric clustering methods. It can be applied to many optimization-based clustering methods, including k-means and k-medians, and can handle models which are very close in feature space. Preliminary results are presented on segmenting real and synthetic images, using both parametric and non-parametric clustering.

The 1-th order Landmarks are made as the endpoints of the liner segment By computing an error criterion, this algorithm can automatically produce the K piece-wise segments of time series, which can approximate the time series. This representation allows efficient computation of the similar measure. And we present a method of the similar measure, which is designed to be insensitive to noise, shifting, amplitude scaling and time scaling. The k-mean clustering algorithm is run on this representation. The results show that the representation can improve the clustering precision.

As sensors could be deployed in a large area, data transmitting and receiving are energy consuming operations. One of the methods to save energy is to reduce the transmission distance of each node by grouping them to clusters. Each cluster will have a cluster-head (CH), which will communicate with all the other nodes of that cluster and transmit the data to the remote base station. In this paper we describe the adaptation of Growing Self-Organising map (GSOM) to cluster the wireless sensor nodes and to identify the cluster-heads. We compare the results with a well-known clustering algorithm. We also describe the energy minimization criterion for clustering.

Support vector machines have been shown to perform extremely well in many classification and regression applications. The relationship between indicated torque and crankshaft angular velocity is a current research topic, and is also a nonlinear problem. In a typical combustion engine, cycle-by-cycle variations of combustion events occur, even when running at a fixed operating point. Engine idle speed controllers capable of reducing the variability have been proposed, and rely on indicated torque information. Furthermore, real-time indicated torque knowledge is important for engine diagnostics. The proposed approach provides the potential for real-time reconstruction of indicated torque and reduction in costs for manufacturers. A comparison between the proposed approach and another popular model estimation approach, K-means clustering with RBF centres trained using a least mean squares algorithm, is presented. Reduction in the input data resolution and its effect on reconstruction accuracy is also investigated.

First we evaluate the distances between every pair of data-points; then try to find out those data-points which are similar; and finally construct initial centroids according to these found data-points. Different initial centroids lead to different results. If we can find initial centroids which are consistent with the distribution of data, the better clustering can be obtained. According to our experimental results, the improved k-means Clustering Algorithm has the accuracy higher than the original one.

Many initialization techniques have been proposed to attack this problem, but with only limited success. In this paper we propose an evolutionary K-means algorithm to attack this problem. The proposed algorithm combines Genetic Algorithms and K-means algorithm together for improving the search ability of the K-means algorithm. We rearrange the clusters in crossover operation based on the distance of clustering centers to avoid generating meaningless offspring. A new genetic operator called swap is proposed to replace the traditional mutation operator for avoiding producing invalid offspring. Experiments performed on some publicly available time series data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

One key of the clustering algorithms is the distance measure. A novel distance measure based on central symmetry is proposed in this paper. This kind of distance measure can be used to detect symmetrical patterns in data set. Then a modified version of K-means algorithm employing the central symmetry distance is presented. The proposed algorithm can be used for data clustering in data mining. It divides a given data set into several clusters of different geometrical structures. While detecting hyperspherical-shaped patterns, the clustering algorithm with he central symmetry distance measure performs much better than the preview algorithms with the ordinary measures. The novel clustering algorithm can also be used for human face detection. Finally, some experimental studies and results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

We first focus on discussing the market segmentation problem by applying clustering technique in data mining discipline. The partition of market is based on users' preference data and not on the commonly used one, users' attribute data. In that way, the definition of distance between two customers by their preference to a set of specified competing products is given. In stead of starting from scratch, the self-organization feature map is adopted as a basic clustering framework. In order to process the preference data, some necessary modifications are made. Both theoretic analysis and practical experiment are presented in this paper, which make us confident of that the algorithm we proposed has excellent performance and could discover the potential clustering patterns in the complex datasets. The second part is focus on displaying market segmentation structure. We apply visualization technique to representing the market structure clearly in a two dimensional plane so that the marketers can make their market strategies easier. The two main parts are organized as an integrated approach. Such an approach includes three core steps: preference data collecting step, preference data clustering step, by SOM neural networks and visualization step by ideal point model. There are three main advantages of the approach: firstly, the approach is based on well-defined mathematic models and can be supported by a series of numeral methods. Secondly, it does not have to face the tough market variable selection problem because we focus on preference data, not on evaluators' attribute data (demographic or geographic data etc.). Finally, the approach can produce multi-scale view of market segmentation results. The experiments show that the approach yields meaningful results and is comparable and complemented to the most general ones.

The proposed method calculate the cluster center through the K-means algorithm but needn't to presuppose the number of clusters which is determined according to the convergence of the cluster principle function being used. The convergence rate of the cluster principle function will become slower when the number of the cluster is becoming bigger, and the proper number of clusters can be determined when, that rate is slow enough to some degree. Then combining with recurrent least-squares algorithm to identify the parameter of the consequent part of the rule base, a fuzzy system is established. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

Simulation results show that this model proposed in the paper has the advantages of less computation and higher precision, compared with the k-means algorithm.

Clustering or partitioning a large set of data objects into homogeneous clusters is a fundamental data mining technique and application. The k-means method is a well-known clustering approach by minimizing the cost function based on the sum of the Euclidean distance squared between each data object and its nearest cluster center. In this paper, we present a new clustering approach based on the aggregate function as cost function, and get a globally convergent scheme and good computing results.

Given a set of documents, the associations among frequently co-occurring terms in any of the documents define naturally a hypergraph, which can then be decomposed into connected components at various levels. Each connected component represents a primitive concept in the collection. The documents can then be clustered based on the primitive concepts. Experiments with three different data sets from web pages and medical literatures have shown that the proposed unsupervised clustering approach performs significantly better than traditional clustering algorithms, such as k-means, AutoClass and Hierarchical Clustering (HAC). The results indicate that hypergraphs are a perfect model to capture association rules in text and is very useful for automatic document clustering.

The hardware processes are the applications tailored "cells" in the Processor-Coupled Polymorphous Fabric ([12], [11]) implemented on the Altera Excalibur Arm SoPC platform. In our global approach, a static communications schedule is adopted to reduce hardware overhead due to inter-cells message transfer synchronization and to speed-up application execution. The scheduling problem is defined and solved using constraints programming approach. This approach makes it possible to obtain optimal communication schedules in a number of real cases. It makes also possible to easily generate pipelined schedules that improve significantly performance of the final implementation. Our method is illustrated with a Fabric-based implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm. An optimal communication scheduled is achieved for this application.

One section of the data is owned by Alice while the other is owned by Bob. Both want to compute clusters from the union of the data but do not trust each other. Thus, they do not want the other party to learn anything about their share of the data except what can be inferred from the results. We present a protocol that allows Alice and Bob to carry this task under the k-medoids algorithm. Clustering with medoids (medians or other loss functions) is a more robust alternative that clustering with k-MEANS (the only method for which a privacy preserving protocol is known, but a methods that is statistically biased and statistically inconsistent with very low robustness to noise). Our approach highlights the necessary building blocks for extending our protocol to the family of representative-based clustering algorithms.

The electrophoresis process allows molecules, such as DNA fragments, to migrate through gel, under the influence of an electric current. DNA electrophoresis gel images generated, with the Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique, are characterized by many bands in a gel and thus require tremendous work by the user to complete their interpretation. AFLP is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based fingerprinting technology where PCR amplifies DNA fragments that are visualized on gels. To reduce the interaction in the detection and interpretation of DNA restriction fragments from gel images an automated procedure was carried out. The procedure is similar to that applied in the fields of pattern recognition and image analysis. First the gel images were preprocessed by converting them to vectors and then their features were classified using different clustering techniques in combination with statistics. The clustering is based on the assumptions that electrophoresis gel image consists of layers where each layer is a cluster of pixels or bands of similar intensity values. For validation the experiment was conducted on AFLP gel images of olive (Olea europaea L.) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum). The results show that this technique detected bands even when the gel image presents lane to lane variations and background effects due to brightness. Further work on the automation process would lead towards objective and rapid assessment of genetic diversity by reducing the user interaction to complete DNA gel image analysis.

Commercial OCR softwares perform well on "clean" documents or need user to select the kind of documents. Recently, a new kind of images taken by a camera in a "real-world" environment appeared. It implies different strong degradations missing in scanner-based pictures and the presence of complex backgrounds. In order to segment text as properly as possible, a new method is proposed using color information in order to extract text as well as possible. In this paper, a focus is given on each chosen parameter with comparative results between different recent techniques using color information. Moreover an emphasis is placed on stroke analysis and character segmentation. The binarization method takes it into account in order to improve character segmentation and recognition afterwards.

A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the clustering of genes into groups that show similar expression values over a range of conditions. Since only a small subset of the genes participate in any cellular process of interest, by focusing on subsets of genes and conditions, we can lower the noise induced by other genes and conditions - a co-cluster characterizes such a subset of interest. Cheng and Church [3] introduced an effective measure of co-cluster quality based on mean squared residue. In this paper, we use two similar squared residue measures and propose two fast k-means like co-clustering algorithms corresponding to the two residue measures. Our algorithms discover k row clusters and 1 column clusters simultaneously while monotonically decreasing the respective squared residues. Our. co-clustering algorithms inherit the simplicity, efficiency and wide applicability of the k-means algorithm. Minimizing the residues may also be formulated as trace optimization problems that allow us to obtain a spectral relaxation that we use for a principled initialization for our iterative algorithms. We further enhance our algorithms by an incremental local search strategy that helps avoid empty clusters and escape poor local minima. We illustrate co-clustering results on a yeast cell cycle dataset and a human B-cell lymphoma dataset. Our experiments show that our co-clustering algorithms are efficient and are able to discover coherent co-clusters.

This paper presents a family of permutation-based procedures to determine both the number of clusters k best supported by the available data and the weight of evidence in support of this clustering. These procedures use one of 37 cluster quality measures to assess the influence of structure-destroying random permutations applied to the original dataset. Results are presented for a collection of simulated datasets for which the correct cluster structure is known unambiguously.

In this paper, we handle clustering as a constrained minimization of a Bregman divergence. Theoretical results show benefits resembling those of boosting algorithms, and bring new modified weighted versions of clustering algorithms such as k-means, expectation-maximization (EM) and k-harmonic means. Experiments display the quality of the results obtained, and corroborate the advantages that subtle data reweightings may bring to clustering.

The k-means and EM algorithms are two of the most important algorithms in the Mixture Model-based clustering and tessellations. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering strategy which shares common features with both the EM and k-means algorithms. Our methods also lead to more general tessellations of a spatial region with respect to a continuous and possibly anisotropic density distribution. Moreover, we propose some probabilistic methods for the construction of these clusterings and tessellations corresponding to a continuous density distribution. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach. In addition, we also discuss the parallel implementation and performance of our algorithms on some distributed memory systems.

This approach is motivated by the following observation: while there are usually strong patterns in the data-patterns that may be key for the analysis and description of the data-these patterns are often split among different clusters by current clustering approaches. This is, perhaps, not surprising, since clustering algorithms have no built in knowledge of these patterns and may often have goals that are in conflict with preserving patterns, e.g., minimize the distance of points to their nearest cluster centroids. Also, patterns are typically overlapping, i.e., may involve some of the same objects, and if the clustering algorithm produces disjoint clusters, then some patterns must be split when the objects are clustered. In this paper we describe a technique for pattern preserving clustering that first finds patterns composed of tightly connected groups of objects or attributes and then, starting from these patterns, performs agglomerative clustering using the Group Average (UPGMA) technique. We present the results of some experiments on document data that compare our approach, HIerarchical Clustering with PAttern Preservation (HICAP), to two other clustering techniques: bisecting K-means and traditional UPGMA. These results show that, despite the extra constraint of pattern preservation, HICAP has performance very much like traditional UPGMA with respect to the cluster evaluation criteria of entropy and F-measure. More importantly, we also illustrate how patterns, if preserved, can aid cluster interpretation.

A detailed analysis shows the close relationship between K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) which is extensively utilized in unsupervised dimension reduction. We prove that the continuous solutions of the discrete K-means clustering membership indicators are the data projections on the principal directions (principal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix). New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which relate directly to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Experiments on Internet newsgroups indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5% of the optimal values, and that PCA provides an effective solution for the K-means clustering.

To overcome this problem, we present a parallel approach for the K-means Vector Quantization (VQ) algorithm based on master/slave paradigm and low-cost parallel cluster computing. Distributing the training samples over the slaves' local disks reduces the overhead associated with the communication process. In addition, models predicting computation and communication time have been developed. These models are useful to predict the optimal number of slaves taking into account the number of training samples and codebook size. The experiments have shown the efficiency of the proposed models and also a linear speed up of the vector quantization process used in a two-stage Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based system for recognizing handwritten numeral strings.

Firstly the individual learner through a preference definition stage effectively narrows the feature space according to her teaming objectives. Then an efficient version of the k-means algorithm, namely the k-means range, is employed for the creation of teaming concept clusters. These two stages, the pre-processing orthogonal range search followed by the dynamic clustering, enhance the intuitive transformation of large data sets into meaningful clusters. The complexity analysis of the aforementioned algorithm demonstrates the real-time computational efficiency of this research approach. Finally the potential and implications on distributed e-learning and teaching are discussed.

Background modelling is achieved via principle component analysis (PCA) followed by a two-class Bayes classification step, i.e., target or sea. A wavelet-denoising block is added to the system resulting in a significant increase in the detection performance. K-means clustering is also implemented to explore the target detection accuracy without training. It is concluded that the PCA training provides high detection accuracy while the K-means clustering mostly fails to classify the sea targets.

Pathological voices show higher vocal noise level due to malfunctioning of vocal cords. Addition of noise component in speech has found to change the spectral properties. In this study, we show the use of energy spectrum which is obtained from 21-channel filter-bank outputs, for the classification of pathological voices. A simple k-means nearest neighbor classifier based on spectral distance is designed and a good classification results have been reported.

For instance, the graph is a widely used data structure in these applications, but there is a lack of efficient algorithms for comparing and grouping graphs. In this paper, we propose a direct approach to the graph clustering problem. The key elements of the new approach are an efficient graph matching algorithm for computing the similarity between two graphs and a new median graph algorithm for computing the median of a set of graphs. Clustering is performed based on the k-means algorithm. Random graphs and synthetic images are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The criterions ABS must comply with are: (1) The selected bands have the most information; (2) The selected bands have the smallest correlation with other bands. After calculating and rearranging the index of each band, there are two methods of selecting the final bands: one is selecting the bands which index is bigger than the specified index, another method is selecting the first n bands whose index is the first n bands. In order to testify the effect of ABS method, feature-level wavelet fusion and K-means unsupervised classification were implemented on the dimensionally reduced image. The results of the classifications show ABS method can be used to select high informative bands so that the results is better than that of original image. At the same time computation is decreased rapidly compared to OIF method.

On the other hand, the image data are not only required for developing spatial or geographic data, but they are also critical for military and intelligence applications especially suited to addressing national security, that is, image data are critical for situation awareness and assessment purposes, and they are invaluable for detecting changes and providing relevant information to decision makers. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive tools that can allow fast and efficient processing of information from huge image data. In order to do automated image retrieval to meet the challenge of organizing and analyzing vast volumes of image data to effectively synthesize the critical information, the key step is image segmentation for the large-scale spatial image. In this paper, one content-based (unsupervised) image segmentation method is proposed and tested out to be very successful for the large-scale image segmentation.

After computing the fractal dimension of each image pixel by the 2D variation procedure, a clustering technique based on K-means is used to label pixels into semantic objects. The evaluation of the efficiency is carried out from a total of 200 postal envelope images with no fixed position for the address block, postmark and stamp. A ground-truth strategy is used to achieve an objective comparison. Experiments showed significant and promising results. By using the 2D variation procedure for three ranges of neighbor window sizes (r = {3, 5}, r = {3, 5, 7}, and r = {3, 5, 7, 9}), the proposed approach reached a success rate over than 90% on average.

It is remarked that developed Y-mixed phase causes a dramatic softening of the neutron star equation of state and leads to the serious problem that the resulting maximum mass for neutron star model contradicts the observed neutron star mass (M-max < M-obs = 1.44M(circle dot)), suggesting the necessity of some "extra repulsion" in hypernuclear system. It is shown that the introduction of three-body repulsion similar to that in nuclear system can resolve the serious situation and under the consistency with observation (M-max > M-obs) the threshold densities for Lambda and Sigma(-) are pushed to higher density side, from similar to 2rho(0) to similar to 4rho(0) (rho(0) being the nuclear density). On the basis of a realistic Y-mixed neutron star model, occurrence of Y-superfluidity essential for "hyperon cooling" scenario is studied and both of Lambda- and Sigma(-)-superfluids are shown to be realized with their critical temperatures 10(8-9) K, meaning that the "hyperon cooling" is a promising candidate for a fast non-standard cooling demanded for some neutron stars with low surface temperature. A comment is given as to the consequence of less attractive LambdaLambda interaction suggested by the "NAGARA event", He-6(LambdaLambda).

Three methods, two of them, LAMDA and Fuzzy C-Means, issued from soft-computing and K-Means, based on Euclidean distances, are compared. Moreover for LAMDA method, because of its ability to accept mixed type data, two approaches have been considered: first we take all descriptors as qualitative; then we transformed all descriptors into quantitative ones. For descriptors whose modalities have an order, a numerical scale was used, and for descriptors where there is no notion of ordering we split all modalities into binary descriptors. By studying the behaviour of those classification methods in a very small, easily interpretable database, the features and capabilities of the methods have been analysed, having in mind their application in the framework of online supervision and fault detection.

The algorithm finds the centroids of a user specified number of clusters, where each cluster groups together similar pixels. The new image clustering algorithm has been applied successfully to three types of images to illustrate its wide applicability. These images include synthetic, MRI and Satellite images. A comparison between the new approach and the well-known K-means clustering algorithm is provided to show the efficiency of PSO in the area of image clustering.

A major gene that regulates the rate of preimplantation development is the preimplantation embryo development (Ped) gene, discovered in our laboratory. In mice, presence of the Ped gene product, Qa-2 protein, results in a fast rate of preimplantation embryonic development, compared with a slow rate of preimplantation embryonic development for embryos that are lacking Qa-2 protein. Moreover, mice that express Qa-2 protein have an overall reproductive advantage that extends beyond the preimplantation period, including higher survival to birth, higher birthweight, and higher survival to weaning. Data are presented that suggest that Qa-2 increases the rate of development of early embryos by acting as a cell-signalling molecule and that phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase is involved in the cell-signalling pathway. The most likely human homologue of Qa-2 has recently been identified as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G. Data are presented which show that HLA-G, like Qa-2, is located in lipid rafts, implying that HLA-G also acts as a signalling molecule. In order to better evaluate the second criterion used in ART (i.e. overall morphology), a unique and innovative imaging microscope has been constructed, the Keck 3-D fusion microscope (Keck 3DFM). The Keck 3DFM combines five different microscopic modes into a single platform, allowing multi-modal imaging of the specimen. One of the modes, the quadrature tomographic microscope (QTM), creates digital images of non-stained transparent cells by measuring changes in the index of refraction. Quadrature tomographic microscope images of oocytes and preimplantation mouse embryos are presented for the first time. The digital information from the QTM images should allow the number of cells in a preimplantation embryo to be counted non-invasively. The Keck 3DFM is also being used to assess mitochondrial distribution in mouse oocytes and embryos by using the k-means clustering algorithm. Both the number of cells in preimplantation embryos and mitochondrial distribution are related to oocyte and embryo health. New imaging data obtained from the Keck 3DFM, combined with genetic and biochemical approaches, have the promise of being able to distinguish healthy from unhealthy oocytes and embryos in a non-invasive manner. The goal is to apply the information from our mouse model system to the clinic in order to identify one and only one healthy embryo for transfer back to the mother undergoing an ART procedure. This approach has the potential to increase the success rate of ART and to decrease the high, and undesirable, multiple birth rate presently associated with ART.

We combine the clustering method with soft computing, which tends to be more tolerant of imprecision and uncertainty, and apply a fuzzy clustering algorithm to deal with incomplete data. Our experiments show that the fuzzy imputation algorithm presents better performance than the basic clustering algorithm.

The end result is a partitioning of a set of pixel values into bins that represent equivalence classes. The proposed approach makes it possible to introduce a form of upper and lower approximation specialized relative to sets of pixel values. This approach is particularly relevant to a special class of digital images for power line ceramic insulators. Until now the problem of determining when a ceramic insulator needs to be replaced has relied on visual inspection. With the K-means indiscernibility relation, it is now possible to automate the detection of faulty ceramic insulators. The contribution of this article is the introduction of an approach to classifying power line insulators based on a rough set methods and K-means clustering in analyzing digital images.

In this is paper, we present a new algorithm K-means II to extend the famous K-means algorithm which is efficient only on numerical clustering, by using new cluster center definitions and new similarity measures. Thus, our algorithm can be used in categorical clustering while preserving the efficiency. Experiments on both real-life datasets and synthetic datasets show that the K-means II algorithm can produce high quality results and deserve good scalability at the same time.

The robot should memorize its interacting human, and also the environment as a background, because the background restricts the perception of the robot and gives suitable information to the robot. First, the robot memorizes the background by using difference extraction of images, and color information of the image by using k-means algorithm. And then, the robot learns the topological structure of the color patterns clustered by k-means algorithm. The experimental results show that the robot can recognize the human and several postures efficiently.

This problem is the identification of radar signals in a tactical environment. The identification process requires two steps: clustering of collected radar pulse descriptor words and the classification of clustered results. The method described here, Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory Map (Fuzzy ARTMAP) is a self-organizing neural network algorithm. The benefits of this algorithm are that the training process is very stable and fast and that it needs a small number of required initial parameters and it performs very well at novelty detection, which is the classification of unknown radar emitters. This paper will discuss the theory behind the Fuzzy ARTMAP, as well as results of the processing of two i reali radar pulse data sets. The first evaluated data set consists of 5242 radar pulse descriptor words from 32 different emitters. The second data set consists of 107850 pulse descriptor words from 112 different emitters. The radar pulse descriptors words that were used by the algorithm for both sets of data were radio frequency (RF) and pulse width (PW). The results of the processing of both of these datasets were better then 90% correct correlation with actual ID, which exceeds the results of processing these datasets with other algorithms such as K-Means. and other self-organizing neural networks.

SEE hand gestures can be periodic as well as non-periodic. We first differentiate between periodic and non-periodic gestures followed by recognition of individual gestures. After periodicity detection, non-periodic trajectories are classified into 8 classes and periodic trajectories are classified into 4 classes. A Polhemus tracker is used to provide the input data. Periodicity detection is based on Fourier analysis and hand trajectories are recognized by Vector Quantization Principal Component Analysis (VQPCA). The average periodicity detection accuracy is 95.9%. The average recognition rates with VQPCA for non-periodic and periodic gestures are 97.3% and 97.0% respectively. In comparison, k-means clustering yielded 87.0% and 85.1%, respectively.

J	Sutton, PD; Day, FA				Sutton, PD; Day, FA			Types of rapidly growing counties of the US, 1970-1990	SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article							MIGRATION; WEST	Recent economic growth and in-migration have led to an interesting patchwork of rapidly growing counties in the United States. This paper identifies 299 U.S. counties that were growing at least 70% from 1970 to 1990, a rate greater than one standard deviation above the mean of all counties. Using a k-means cluster algorithm, seven distinct types of rapidly growing counties, with meaningful spatial patterns, were found. Four of these clusters were primarily urban: smaller fast-growing cities in the south, large sunbelt cities, as well as both white and blue-collar suburban counties ringing many of the more dynamic metropolitan regional centers of the country. Also, there were two predominately rural clusters: retirement counties and several counties in the Intermontane West characterized by environmental amenities and isolated growth. Lastly, we observed a distinct cluster of several Hispanic counties in the southwest primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border. We believe these seven clusters present a remarkably clear portrait of the significant forces underlying the rapid growth of counties in the United States. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the assumption that every modality provides both probabilistic evidence and fuzzy evidence, two discounting strategies are developed for adaptive reasoning. To handle conflict between the probabilistic evidence and the fuzzy evidence, local discounting takes into account Kullback-Leibler distance between the two types of evidence. Global discounting takes into account source quality, in terms of Shannon entropy and hybrid entropy. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach performs better than K-mean Clustering, majority voting, fuzzy set operation, and Baysian approach.

In this paper, we employ an unsupervised clustering scheme (CM-Detect) to detect commercials in television programs. Each program is first divided into W-s-minute chunks, and we extract audio and visual features from each of these chunks. Next, we apply k-means clustering to assign each chunk with a commercial/program, label. In contrast to other methods, we do not make any assumptions regarding the program content. Thus, our method is highly content-adaptive and computationally inexpensive. Through empirical studies on various content; including American news; Japanese news, and sports programs, we demonstrate that our method is able to filter out most of the commercials without falsely removing the regular program.

The novelty of this work is that the objects to be clustered are represented by graphs rather than the usual case of numeric feature vectors. We apply these techniques to web documents, which are represented by graphs instead of vectors, in order to perform web document clustering. Web documents are structured information sources and thus appropriate for modeling by graphs. We will examine the performance of each clustering algorithm when the web documents are represented as both graphs and vectors. This will allow us to investigate the applicability of each algorithm to the problem of web document clustering.

B	Frigui, H; Nasraoui, F		Berry, MW		Frigui, H; Nasraoui, F			Simultaneous clustering and dynamic keyword weighting for text documents	SURVEY OF TEXT MINING: CLUSTERING, CLASSIFICATION, AND RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	Text Mining Workshop	APR   13, 2002	ARLINGTON, VA					In this chapter, we propose a new approach to unsupervised text document categorization based on a coupled process of clustering and cluster-dependent keyword weighting. The proposed algorithm is based on the K-Means clustering algorithm. Hence it is computationally and implementationally simple. Moreover, it learns a different set of keyword weights for each cluster. This means that, as a by-product of the clustering process, each document cluster will be characterized by a possibly different set of keywords. The cluster-dependent keyword weights have two advantages: they help in partitioning the document collection into more meaningful categories; and they can be used to automatically generate a compact description of each cluster in terms of not only the attribute values, but also their relevance. In particular, for the case of text data, this approach can be used to automatically annotate the documents. We also extend the proposed approach to handle the inherent fuzziness in text documents, by automatically generating fuzzy or soft labels instead of hard all-or-nothing categorization. This means that a text document can belong to several categories with different degrees. The proposed approach can handle noise documents elegantly by automatically designating one or two noise magnet clusters that grab most outliers away from the other clusters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by using it to cluster real text document collections.

To protect networks, intrusion detection systems aim to identify attacks with a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. Temporal changes in network Intrusion patterns and characteristics often render existing classification-based Intrusion detection data mining techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, researchers have recently revived unsupervised learning techniques to help identify anomalous behaviors or new attacks. This paper Investigates and compares four centroid-based clustering algorithms - k-means, Mixture-Of-Spherical Gaussians, Self-Organizing Map, and Neural-Gas - for analyzing large network security data sets. A simple but effective self-labeling heuristic Is proposed to detect attack clusters given unlabeled network traffic audit data. Empirical studies using the network security data set from the DARPA 1998 offline intrusion detection project (KDD 1999 Cup) show the feasibility of unsupervised intrusion detection and promising detection results.

Fuzziness of multi-scale landscape morphometry	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						fuzzy sets landforms; morphometry; multi-scale analysis; mountains; the Lake District	FUZZY K-MEANS; LANDFORM ELEMENTS; SORITES PARADOX; CLASSIFICATION; BOUNDARIES; OBJECTS; SETS	The landscape in which people live is made up of many features, which are named and have importance for cultural reasons. Prominent among these are the naming of upland features such as mountains, but mountains are an enigmatic phenomenon which do not bear precise and repeatable definition. They have a vague spatial extent, and recent research has modelled such classes as spatial fuzzy sets. We take a specifically multi-resolution approach to the definition of the fuzzy set membership of morphometric classes of landscape. We explore this idea with respect to the identification of culturally recognized landscape features of the English Lake District. Discussion focuses on peaks and passes, and the results show that the landscape elements identified in the analysis correspond to well-known landmarks included in a place name database for the area, although many more are found in the analysis than are named in the available database. Further analysis shows that a richer interrogation of the landscape can be achieved with Geographical Information Systems when using this method than using standard approaches.

The previous ICI self-can cell at ion schemes significantly, reduced the ICI and outperformed other existing coding techniques but they still suffered from the phase noise. To further improve the ICI self-cancellation receivers, in this paper, we introduce a totally, blind algorithm for the phase correction. This efficient algorithm is based on the energy, modulation and the K-means clustering method. Since our new scheme doesn't depend on any, pilot information, no additional spectral efficiency, sacrifice is needed for the phase correction. Computer simulation results are presented to show that our algorithm can lead to large performance margins over all other existing methods for different channel environments.

Images acquired by heterogeneous image sensors may provide complementary information about the scene, and a so-called multiresolution image fusion technique is applied to integrate the information at the pixel level. However, when the images are significantly different, consider a visual and an infrared image for example, the performance of the multiresolution fusion algorithms is not always satisfactory. When the application of concealed weapon detection is considered, an alternative solution is to detect the concealed weapon in an infrared or a millimeter wave image first, and then fuse/embed this region in the visual image. In this study, the multiresolution mosaic technique is employed to combine the visual and infrared or millimeter wave images, where the concealed weapon is first detected by a fuzzy k-means clustering method front the infrared or millimeter wave image. The synthesized image retains the quality comparable to the visual image while the region of the concealed weapon is highlighted. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Existing models postulate the number of states, and their associated distributions based on physical considerations. This produces good models but that are not convenient in different contexts. In this paper, we focus on the methodology of extraction of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from experimental data to describe the time fluctuations of received power in a mobile satellite service (MSS) context. It Is based on a MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) method associated with a k-means classification. Its complexity is reduced when compared to traditional MCMC method. Contrary to existing detection methods, the only assumption is the HMM states number and it enables an accurate estimation of the HMM parameters and of the transitions location between states of the model.

Representative samples of the British and Norwegian population were surveyed by telephone and asked to choose between two profiles of wooden furniture, where one was eco-labeled and more expensive. The eco-labeled would certify that the wood originated from sustainable forestry. The survey data allowed for substantiating the attribute segmenting with the hypothetical choice behavior between eco-labeled and unlabeled wood and logit model estimates of WTP. The statistical method to identify the segments was k-means cluster analysis, principally using stated importance of product attributes and estimated WTP for eco-labeling as grouping variables. One segment profiled as an "eco-segment" was confirmed by placing a higher value on the dimensions (values) of environmentalism-trusting environmental and outdoor organizations regarding information about forestry and environment, and having a higher rate of membership in environmental organizations. This "eco-segment" amounted to more than (1)/(4) of the samples. The British eco-segment could be described as relatively "greener" than the Norwegian. The British also had higher estimated WTP for eco-labeling compared to the Norwegians. The eco-segments had their media interest directed more towards intellectual issues than the other segments. Demographically, the eco-segments did not differ significantly from the other segments, except that the British had a greater female majority.

First, the fractal dimension of each pixel of a postal envelope image is computed using the 2D variation procedure. The K-means clustering technique is then used to label pixels as background, noise and semantic objects like stamps, postmarks, and address blocks. A database composed of 200 postal envelope images, with no fixed position for the address block, postmark and stamp is used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. For each envelope image, the ideal result (ground-truth segmentation) regarding each class has been generated. The comparison between the ground-truth segmentation and the results obtained through the proposed methodology is carried out pixel by pixel. Experiments showed significant and promising results. By using the 2D variation procedure for three ranges of neighbor window sizes (r = {3, 5}, r = {3, 5, 7}, and r = {3, 5, 7, 9}), the proposed approach reached a success rate over than 90% on average.

The algorithm covers learning of both, the reference patterns and the recognition thresholds being most suitable for a highly reliable recognition of new input patterns. Algorithm simulation verifies a better performance than the conventional k-means algorithm. In particular, learned-pattern quality is improved for a non-Gaussian distribution of the object patterns in the input-pattern stream. A VLSIchip architecture for integration of this learning algorithm with a fully-parallel associative memory is proposed in addition.

Most of the phenotypes investigated have been univariate traits ( quantitative or qualitative). The aims of this study are to derive multivariate traits by identifying homogeneous groups of people and assigning both qualitative and quantitative trait scores; to assess the heritability of the derived traits; and to conduct both qualitative and quantitative linkage analysis on one of the heritable traits. Methods: Multiple correspondence analysis, a nonparametric analogue of principal components analysis, was used for data reduction. Two-stage clustering, using both k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, was used to cluster individuals based upon axes ( factor) scores obtained from the data reduction. Probability of cluster membership was calculated using binary logistic regression. Heritability was calculated using SOLAR, which was also used for the quantitative trait analysis. GENEHUNTER-PLUS was used for the qualitative trait analysis. Results: We found four phenotypically distinct groups. Membership in the smallest group was heritable (38%, p < 1 x 10(-6)) and had characteristics consistent with atherogenic dyslipidemia. We found both qualitative and quantitative LOD scores above 3 on chromosomes 11 and 14 (11q13, 14q23, 14q31). There were two Kong & Cox LOD scores above 1.0 on chromosome 6 (6p21) and chromosome 11 (11q23). Conclusion: This approach may be useful for the identification of genetic heterogeneity in complex phenotypes by clarifying the phenotype definition prior to linkage analysis. Some of our findings are in regions linked to elements of atherogenic dyslipidemia and related diagnoses, some may be novel, or may be false positives.

Automated histogram filtering	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PEAK-DETECTION; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; LINEAR-REGRESSION; MULTIPLE OUTLIERS; MONTE-CARLO; OPTIMIZATION; FRUSTRATION	A number of short, Monte Carlo simulated annealing runs are performed on a highly frustrated 69-mer off-lattice model protein, consisting of a chain of 69 beads that are either hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or neutral in nature, and which demonstrably folds into a six-stranded beta-barrel structure. We employ an iterative, consensus-based scheme to cluster the 725 nonbonded distances between the hydrophobic beads using, in tandem, Ward's method for hierarchical clustering and k-means partitional clustering. We also independently analyze the same data using computer-automated histogram filtering, a technology designed to cluster high-dimensional data, without the tedium and subjectivity required by our iterative implementation of the two classical clustering methods. The memberships of low-energy clusters obtained from both classical clustering and automated histogram filtering approaches are remarkably similar. Nonbonded distance constraints are derived from these clusters and from small sets of the original unclustered conformations obtained by simulated annealing. Employing a distance geometry approach, we efficiently generate novel, low-energy conformations from each set of distance constraints, including the apparent native structure, up to 40 times faster than by doing additional simulated annealing runs. Over 33 000 unique locally optimized conformations are generated in total, substantially augmenting the number of low-energy states located by the original simulated annealing runs.

Samples were dissolved in absolute ethanol and their absorbance values in the range of 400-750 nm, after appropriate transformations, were used as variables in the multivariate statistical techniques of cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA). These techniques were used successively so that an effective and meaningful discriminant model was calculated in the final step. The initial 351 variables (log(10) transformed ink absorption values at each wavelength) were subjected to a K-means CA over the objects (samples) and only 20 variables were retained. Principal component analysis was used to detect any outliers (four samples were removed) and the remaining samples were re-subjected to PCA to decide how many variables to enter into DA and whether original variables or components should be used. It was found that the first three principal components (in accordance with the Kaiser criterion) were good descriptors of the 20 original variables (96.97% of the data variance was explained) and their use as latent variables in DA lead to low average variable redundancy (33.6%) in the discriminant model. The calculated model had a Wilks' lambda of 8.98 x 10(-5) and was statistically significant at the P = 0.05 level. The post hoc classification of the training dataset was 100% correct. From the DA results and the component loadings it was found that discrimination was achieved on the basis of differences in the shape of the absorption bands as well as their relative intensities. The method was therefore deemed appropriate for supporting exclusionary forensic purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tierney, EP; Tulac, S; Huang, STJ; Giudice, LC				Tierney, EP; Tulac, S; Huang, STJ; Giudice, LC			Activation of the protein kinase A pathway in human endometrial stromal cells reveals sequential categorical gene regulation	PHYSIOLOGICAL GENOMICS			English	Article						endometrium; decidualization; implantation; microarray technology	CYCLIC INOSITOL PHOSPHOHYDROLASE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; IN-VITRO; SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTORS; BINDING PROTEIN-1; HORMONE-RECEPTOR; GROWTH-FACTORS; EXPRESSION; DECIDUALIZATION	Decidualization of endometrial stromal cells is a prerequisite for human implantation and occurs in vivo in response to progesterone and involves activation of the protein kinase A ( PKA) pathway. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular signatures and patterns of gene expression during stimulation of this pathway with an analog of cAMP. Endometrial stromal cells from two subjects were treated with or without 8- Br- cAMP ( 1 mM) for 0, 2, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h and were processed for microarray analysis, screening for 12,686 genes and ESTs. Most abundantly upregulated genes included neuropeptides, immune genes, IGF family members, cell cycle regulators, extracellular matrix proteases, cholesterol trafficking, cell growth and differentiation, hormone signaling, and signal transduction. Most abundantly downregulated genes included activator of NF- kappa B, actin/ tropomyosin/ calmodulin binding protein, cyclin B, IGFBP- 5, alpha1 type XVI collagen, lipocortin III, L- kynurenine hydrolase, frizzle- related protein, and cyclin E2. RT- PCR validated upregulation of IGFBP- 1, preprosomatostatin, and IL- 11, and Northern analysis validated their kinetic upregulation. RT- PCR confirmed downregulation of IGFBP- 5, cyclin B, and TIL- 4. K- means analysis revealed four major patterns of up- and downregulated genes, and genes within each ontological group were categorized into these four kinetic patterns. Within each ontological group different patterns of temporal gene expression were observed, indicating that even genes within one functional category are regulated differently during activation of the PKA pathway in human endometrial stromal cells. Overall, the data demonstrate kinetic reprogramming of genes within specific functional groups and changes in genes associated with nucleic acid binding, cell proliferation, decreased G protein signaling, increased STAT pathway signaling, structural proteins, cellular differentiation, and secretory processes. These changes are consistent with cAMP modulating early events ( 0 - 6 h) primarily involving cell cycle regulation, subsequent events ( 12 - 24 h) involving cellular differentiation ( including changes in morphology and secretory phenotype), and late events ( 24 - 48 h) mediating more specialized function, including immune modulators, in the human endometrial stromal cell.

Such information allows improved management of all agricultural inputs. One of the limiting factors in the mapping of soil texture information, however, is cost. Confusion matrix analysis was used to determine whether bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) data derived from electro-magnetic induction (EMI) scanning at field capacity, and clustered using a k-means algorithm, accurately delineates soil textural boundaries in a field containing clay loam and sandy loam soils. The ECa map was compared to two soil surveys, the first conducted at one sample per hectare and the second at four to eight samples per hectare. Using confusion matrix analysis a significantly stronger relationship was measured between the ECa map and soil units of the more intensive soil map, than with the lower sampling density soil survey. This relationship was between two classes of soil with a difference in clay content of 12% and two clusters with a difference in mean ECa of 16(.)9mSm(-1). (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

J	Privitera, C; Stark, LW				Privitera, C; Stark, LW			Visual search characterized by new metrics for scaling and analysis	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							EYE MOVEMENTS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; ALGORITHMS; SCANPATHS; REGIONS	Perceptual and behavioral functions of the brain are complexly linked to each other. Vision, for example, strongly relies upon top-down internal cognitive models that not only control perception and recognition of the external visual world but also related motor functionalities such as eye movements or instrumental visual search. It is possible to analyze experimentally several aspects of this top-down control from the observation of specific motor behaviors; clustering of target acquisitions is an important example. Metrics were developed to attempt to capture these aspects of the visual search process at a number of different levels; the metrics were designed to be either scale independent (two indices S-p and S-s) or to define scale (the NK-functional curve). In order to estimate N, the number of clusters observed in a search scene, this NK-method was elaborated from the standard K-means algorithm. Two illustrative visual tasks, a quasi-natural search scene and picture viewing, were used in experiments to ascertain the effectiveness of these metrics. The results generally demonstrate the importance of top-down, normal vision and the applicability of the scanpath top-down theory for approaching the problems of visual search.

J	Medeiros, FNS; Mascarenhas, NDA; Costa, LF				Medeiros, FNS; Mascarenhas, NDA; Costa, LF			Evaluation of speckle noise MAP filtering algorithms applied to SAR images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							APERTURE RADAR IMAGES	This work proposes new speckle reduction filters for multi-look, amplitude-detected Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach and compares their performance. The new filters use an adaptive approach based on the one-dimensional k -means clustering algorithm over the variance ratio and also a region-growing procedure. The trade-off between the loss of radiometric resolution and edge preservation is evaluated in the filtered images. In order to obtain quantitative measures of the speckle reduction and of the edge blurring, we used some parameters such as the classical equivalent number of looks and the Hough transform. Experiments have been carried out with natural images corrupted with synthetic speckle noise following the Rayleigh and square root of gamma distributions and with real SAR images.

Objective: Our aim was to further understand the pathologic basis of mastocytosis and to identify novel molecular markers of disease. Methods: Microarray analysis was performed on RNA preparations obtained from bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with mastocytosis. Results were compared with gene expression profiles performed on bone marrow mononuclear cells of healthy subjects. Results: Analysis of gene expression in neoplastic bone marrow tissues revealed highly consistent profiles. One hundred four genes were significantly upregulated, and 64 genes were significantly downregulated in the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis. The most prominent differentially expressed gene was alpha-tryptase (44.6-fold increase). Also upregulated were genes involved in cell proliferation, neoplastic transformation, and apoptosis. Both hierarchical and K-means clustering analyses identified an identical group of 10 genes highly coordinately overexpressed in patients with mastocytosis, including genes for the mast-cell-associated enzymes alpha- and beta-tryptase and carboxypeptidase A. The expression level of 3 of these 10 genes (alpha-tryptase, the activating transcription factor type 3, and the muscle aponeurotic fibrosarcoma type F oncogene) was significantly correlated with serum tryptase levels, a surrogate marker of disease. Conclusion: The data presented in this study reveal significant differences in gene expression in the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis compared with healthy subjects, demonstrate highly coordinated genes that might contribute to pathology, and identify 3 genes as candidate molecular markers for systemic disease.

J	Domingos, P; Hulten, G				Domingos, P; Hulten, G			A general framework for mining massive data streams	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Statistical Analysis of Massive Data Streams	DEC 13-14, 2002	WASHINGTON, D.C.			data mining; Hoeffding bounds; machine learning; scalability; subsampling		In many domains, data now arrive faster than we are able to mine it. To avoid wasting these data, we must switch from the traditional "one-shot" data mining approach to systems that are able to mine continuous, high-volume, open-ended data streams as they arrive. In this article we identify some desiderata for such systems, and outline our framework for realizing them. A key property of our approach is that it minimizes the time required to build a model on a stream while guaranteeing (as long as the data are iid) that the model learned is effectively indistinguishable from the one that would be obtained using infinite data. Using this framework, we have successfully adapted several learning algorithms to massive data streams, including decision tree induction, Bayesian network learning, k-means clustering, and the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians. These algorithms are able to process on the order of billions of examples per day using off-the-shelf hardware. Building on this, we are currently developing software primitives for scaling arbitrary learning algorithms to massive data streams with minimal effort.

The statistical segmentation algorithm was applied after a pre-processing stage involving the use of a 3D anisotropic filter along with histogram equalization techniques. The segmentation algorithm makes use of prior knowledge and a probability-based multivariate model designed to semi-automate the process of segmentation. The algorithm was applied to images obtained from the Center for Morphometric Analysis at Massachusetts General Hospital as part of the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR). The developed algorithm showed improved accuracy over the k-means, adaptive Maximum Apriori Probability (MAP), biased MAP, and other algorithms. Experimental results showing the segmentation and the results of comparisons with other algorithms are provided. Results are based on an overlap criterion against expertly segmented images from the IBSR. The algorithm produced average results of approximately 80% overlap with the expertly segmented images (compared with 85% for manual segmentation and 55% for other algorithms).

This model makes use of a Markov matrix to codify useful structural information in QSAR. The self-return probabilities of this matrix throughout time ((SR)pi(k)) are then used as molecular descriptors. Firstly, a calculation of (SR)pi(k) is made for a large series of anticancer and non-anticancer chemicals. Then, k-Means Cluster Analysis allows us to split the data series into clusters and ensure a representative design of training and predicting series. Next, we develop a classification function through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This QSAR discriminates between anticancer compounds and non-active compounds with a correct global classification of 90.5% in the training series. The model also correctly classified 86.07% of the compounds in the predicting series. This classification function is then used to perform a virtual screening of a combinatorial library of coumarins. In this connection, the biological assay of some furocoumarins, selected by virtual screening using the present model, gives good results. In particular, a tetracyclic derivative of 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) has an IC50 against HL-60 tumoral line around 6 to 10 times lower than those for 8-MOP and 5-MOP (reference drugs), respectively. Finally, application of Iso-contribution Zone Analysis (IZA) provides structural interpretation of the biological activity predicted with this QSAR.

J	Huang, M; Liang, X; Liang, Y				Huang, M; Liang, X; Liang, Y			A transferability study of model parameters for the variable infiltration capacity land surface scheme	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						transferability; hydrological models; neural networks	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; RIVER-BASIN EXPERIMENT; WATER-BALANCE; SUBGRID VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGIC-MODELS; SOIL-MOISTURE; RUNOFF; PREDICTION; RAINFALL	[ 1] In this paper, a framework for transferring model parameters from data- rich areas to data- sparse areas is presented. The study shows that there are two critical steps for the success of transferring model parameters in general. The first is to classify effectively basic available data into clusters, and the second is to establish nonlinear relationships between model parameters and the classified basic available data. The framework for transferring model parameters is illustrated with the b- parameter of the Variable Infiltration Capacity ( VIC) land surface model. The b- parameter, which controls the shape of spatial distribution of soil moisture capacity for a study area, usually cannot be directly measured. At present, the VIC b- parameter is generally estimated through model calibration, which is not feasible for applications of regional climate and general circulation model studies because of limited observations. Therefore, to transfer the b- parameter from data- rich to data- sparse areas, an effective approach for estimating the b- parameter for the data- rich areas is necessary. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to estimate the b- parameter values using the State Soil Geographic ( STATSGO) database. The methodology of transferring the VIC b- parameter from data- rich areas to data- sparse areas combines a self- organizing map neural network with a K- means clustering method to classify soil data based on soil characteristics. A supervised neural network using a Bayesian regularization method is then developed to describe the nonlinear relationships between the VIC b- parameter and the statistics of soil properties. The framework is tested using soil data from Arkansas, California, Oklahoma, and Texas with encouraging results. A case study at the Illinois River watershed near Watts is carried out to evaluate the impact of the presented parameter transferability framework on model performance. The initial result shows that the b- parameter estimated from the proposed transferability framework provides reasonable model- simulated streamflows when compared to the observations.

J	Merz, P				Merz, P			Analysis of gene expression profiles: an application of memetic algorithms to the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering; k-means; evolutionary algorithms; combinatorial optimization	PATTERNS	Microarrays have become a key technology in experimental molecular biology since they allow monitoring of gene expression for more than 10,000 genes in parallel producing huge amounts of data. In the exploration of transcriptional regulatory networks, an important task is to cluster gene expression data to identify groups of genes with similar patterns and hence similar function. In this paper, memetic algorithms (MAs)-evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search-are proposed for minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC). In a fitness landscape analysis, it is shown that the MSSC problem has correlation structure exploitable by MAs. The proposed MAs are shown to be superior to multi-start k-means as well as five other clustering algorithms from the bioinformatics literature including hierarchical algorithms and self-organizing maps. Although the fitness values of the different clustering solutions lie close together, it is shown that the solutions differ significantly from each other in terms of cluster memberships which is extremely important for the biological interpretation of the clustering results.

J	Deb, K; Reddy, AR				Deb, K; Reddy, AR			Reliable classification of two-class cancer data using evolutionary algorithms	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						gene subset identification; classification of cancer data; DNA microarray; prediction strength; multiobjective optimization; evolutionary algorithms		In the area of bioinformatics, the identification of gene subsets responsible for classifying available disease samples to two or more of its variants is an important task. Such problems have been solved in the past by means of unsupervised learning methods (hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, k-mean clustering, etc.) and supervised learning methods (weighted voting approach, k-nearest neighbor method, support vector machine method, etc.). Such problems can also be posed as optimization problems of minimizing gene subset size to achieve reliable and accurate classification. The main difficulties in solving the resulting optimization problem are the availability of only a few samples compared to the number of genes in the samples and the exorbitantly large search space of solutions. Although there exist a few applications of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for this task, here we treat the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem of minimizing the gene subset size and minimizing the number of misclassified samples. Moreover, for a more reliable classification, we consider multiple training sets in evaluating a classifier. Contrary to the past studies, the use of a multiobjective EA (NSGA-II) has enabled us to discover a smaller gene subset size (such as four or five) to correctly classify 100% or near 100% samples for three cancer samples (Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Colon). We have also extended the NSGA-II to obtain multiple non-dominated solutions discovering as much as 352 different three-gene combinations providing a 100% correct classification to the Leukemia data. In order to have further confidence in the identification task, we have also introduced a prediction strength threshold for determining a sample's belonging to one class or the other. All simulation results show consistent gene subset identifications on three disease samples and exhibit the flexibilities and efficacies in using a multiobjective EA for the gene subset identification task.

In vitro exposure of insulin-producing INS-1E cells to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta + interferon (IFN)-gamma leads to a significant increase in apoptosis. To characterize the genetic networks implicated in beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis and its dependence on nitric oxide (NO) production, we performed a time-course microarray analysis of cytokine-induced genes in insulin-producing INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells were exposed in duplicate to IL-1beta + IFN-gamma for six different time points (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) with or without the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) blocker N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA). The microarray analysis identified 698 genes as cytokine modified (greater than or equal to2.5-fold change compared with control) in at least one time point. Based on their temporal pattern of variation, the cytokine-regulated genes were classified into 15 clusters by the k-means method. These genes were further classified into 14 different groups according to their putative function. Changes in the expression of genes related to metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription factors at all time points studied indicate beta-cell attempts to adapt to the effects of continuous cytokine exposure. Notably, several apoptosis-related genes were modified at early time points (2-4 h) preceding iNOS expression. On the other hand, 46% of the genes modified by cytokines after 8-24 h were NO dependent, indicating the important role of this radical for the late effects of cytokines. The present results increase by more than twofold the number of known cytokine-modified genes in insulin-producing cells and yield comprehensive information on the role of NO for these modifications in gene expression. These data provide novel and detailed insights into the gene networks activated in beta-cells facing a prolonged immune assault.

However, these patterns may overlap with those observed in the aging brain in elderly normal individuals. The aim of this study was to develop a new method for better classification and recognition of AD and FLD cases as compared with normal controls. Forty-six patients with AD, 7 patients with FLD and 34 normal controls (CTR) were included in the study. rCBF was assessed by technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime and a three-headed single-photon emission tomography (SPET) camera. A brain atlas was used to define volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to the brain lobes. In addition to conventional image processing methods, based on count density/voxel, the new approach also analysed other intrinsic properties of the data by means of gradient computation steps. Hereby, five factors were assessed and tested separately: the mean count density/voxel and its histogram, the mean gradient and its histogram, and the gradient angle co-occurrence matrix. A feature vector concatenating single features was also created and tested. Preliminary feature discrimination was performed using a two-sided t-test and a K-means clustering was then used to classify the image sets into categories. Finally, five-dimensional co-occurrence matrices combining the different intrinsic properties were computed for each VOI, and their ability to recognise the group to which each individual scan belonged was investigated. For correct classification of the AD-CTR groups, the gradient histogram in the parieto-temporal lobes was the most useful single feature (accuracy 91%). FLD and CTR were better classified by the count density/voxel histogram (frontal and occipital lobes) and by the mean gradient (frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, accuracy 98%). For AD and FLD the count density/voxel histogram in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes classified the groups with the highest accuracy (85%). The concatenated joint feature correctly classified 96% of the AD-CTR, 98% of the FLD-CTR and 94% of the AD-FLD cases. 5D co-occurrence matrices correctly recognised 98% of the AD-CTR cases, 100% of the FLD-CTR cases and 98% of the AD-FLD cases. The proposed approach classified and diagnosed AD and FLD patients with higher accuracy than conventional analytical methods used for rCBF-SPET. This was achieved by extracting from the SPET data the intrinsic information content in each of the selected VOIs.

However, standard methods for classifying the behavioral patterns of mutant Caenorhabditis elegans rely on human observation and are therefore subjective and imprecise. Here we describe the application of machine learning to quantitatively define and classify the behavioral patterns of C. elegans nervous system mutants. We have used an automated tracking and image processing system to obtain measurements of a wide range of morphological and behavioral features from recordings of representative mutant types. Using principal component analysis, we represented the behavioral patterns of eight mutant types as data clouds distributed in multidimensional feature space. Cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm made it possible to quantitatively assess the relative similarities between different behavioral phenotypes and to identify natural phenotypic clusters among the data. Since the patterns of phenotypic similarity identified in this study closely paralleled the functional similarities of the mutant gene products, the complex phenotypic signatures obtained from these image data appeared to represent an effective diagnostic of the mutants' underlying molecular defects.

The aim of the present study was to identify subgroups of IBS subjects using measures of rectal sensitivity and psychological symptoms, in addition to bowel symptoms. Such groupings, which cross conventional diagnostic approaches, may provide greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the condition and its treatment. Method: A K means cluster analysis was used to group 107 clinic patients with IBS according to physiological, physical, and psychological parameters. All patients had severe IBS and had failed to respond to usual medical treatment. Twenty nine patients had diarrhoea predominant IBS, 26 constipation predominant, and 52 had an alternating bowel habit. Results: The clusters were most clearly delineated by two variables: "rectal perceptual threshold (volume)'' and "number of doctor visits''. Three subgroups were formed. Group I comprised patients with low distension thresholds and high rates of psychiatric morbidity, doctor consultations, interpersonal problems, and sexual abuse. Group II also had low distension thresholds but low rates of childhood abuse and moderate levels of psychiatric disorders. Group III had high distension thresholds, constipation or alternating IBS, and low rates of medical consultations and sexual abuse. Conclusion: The marked differences across the three groups suggest that each may have a different pathogenesis and respond to different treatment approaches. Inclusion of psychosocial factors in the analysis enabled more clinically meaningful groups to be identified than those traditionally determined by bowel symptoms alone or rectal threshold.

J	Hirose, A; Nagashima, T				Hirose, A; Nagashima, T			Predictive self-organiziiig map for vector quantization of migratory signals and its application to mobile communications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Doppler effect; k-mean clustering algorithm; learning vector quantization; mobile communication; noise; self-organizing map; time-series prediction	EQUALIZATION; NETWORKS	This paper proposes a predictive self-organizing map (P-SOM) that performs an adaptive vector quantization of migratory time-sequential signals whose stochastic properties such as average values of signals in each cluster are varying continuously. The P-SOM possesses not only the weight corresponding to the signal values themselves but also those related to the time-derivative information. All the weights self-organize to predict appropriate future reference vectors. The prediction using the time-derivative weights enables the separation of continuously varying components form random noise components, resulting in a better performance of the adaptive vector quantization. That is to say, the stationary random noise components are captured by the ordinary weights, whereas the migrating components are captured by the first (and higher) order time-derivative ones. An application to a mobile communication receiver using quasi-coherent detection is presented. By utilizing both the ordinary and time-derivative weights consistently, the P-SOM generates a predictive reference vectors and quantizes the migratory signals adaptively. Simulation experiments on the bit-error rates (BERs) demonstrate that a P-SOM adaptive demodulator has a superior capability to track phase rotations caused by the Doppler effect. A theoretical noise analysis is also reported for the conventional SOM and the P-SOM. It is found that the calculation results are approximately in good agreement with the experimental ones.

The proliferation of full-text databases and advances in computer storage capacity have made it possible to carry out text analysis by means of linguistic and extra-linguistic knowledge. Since the mid 80s, research has tended to pay more attention to context, giving discourse analysis a more central role. The research presented in this paper aims to check whether discourse variables have an impact on modern information retrieval and classification algorithms. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, a functional framework for information analysis in an automated environment has been proposed, where the n-grams (filtering) and the k-means and Chen's classification algorithms have been tested against sub-collections of documents based on the following discourse variables: "Genre", "Register", "Domain terminology", and "Document structure". The results obtained with the algorithms for the different sub-collections were compared to the MeSH information structure. These demonstrate that n-grams does not appear to have a clear dependence on discourse variables, though the k-means classification algorithm does, but only on domain terminology and document structure, and finally Chen's algorithm has a clear dependence on all of the discourse variables. This information could be used to design better classification algorithms, where discourse variables should be taken into account. Other minor conclusions drawn from these results are also presented.

J	Kurz, X; Scuvee-Moreau, J; Rive, B; Dresse, A				Kurz, X; Scuvee-Moreau, J; Rive, B; Dresse, A			A new approach to the qualitative evaluation of functional disability in dementia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						dementia; functional disability; Activities of Daily Living scales; quality of life; costs	ECONOMIC-STUDY NADES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; OLDER-PEOPLE; BELGIUM	Background. Dementia patients suffer from the progressive deterioration of cognitive and functional abilities. Instrumental disabilities usually appear in the earlier stages of the disease while basic disabilities appear in the more advanced stages. In order to differentiate between mild, moderate and severe patients both instrumental and basic functional disabilities should be taken into account simultaneously. Objectives. The objective of this study was to find a new method for classifying dementia patients based on their disabilities by using a basic and an instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. Methods. Functional disability was assessed in a Belgian cohort of dementia patients using the Katz and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. A k-means derived clustering method allocated patients to disability clusters according to their Katz and Lawton scores. In order to validate the classification, we compared socio-demographic, clinical and costs parameters between the groups. Results. The clustering method allocated patients between three clusters: dependent, non-dependent with instrumental functional disability (ND-IFD) and non-dependent. Dependence, as defined by these clusters, significantly correlates with age, residential setting, MMSE, patient's quality of life and costs. Conclusion. This new classification of patients suffering from dementia will provide better understanding of functional disabilities and will complement the evaluation of disease severity based on cognitive function.

In the present study, oligonucleotide GeneChip microarrays were used to describe and analyze the levels of approximately 6500 transcripts in the uteri of immature, ovariectomized mice at various times following oral exposure to 100 mug/kg of ethynyl estradiol. The most reproducible responses were identified and subjected to K-means clustering, and functional annotations were obtained for the transcripts within each cluster. Connections were made between the observed transcriptional responses and the known physiological responses to estrogen exposure, focusing here on effects on uterine cell cycle progression leading to estrogen-stimulated uterine growth.

J	Xu, W; Nandi, AK; Zhang, J				Xu, W; Nandi, AK; Zhang, J			Novel fuzzy reinforced learning vector quantisation algorithm and its application in image compression	IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							DESIGN	A new approach to the design of optimised codebooks using vector quantisation (VQ) is presented. A strategy of reinforced learning (RL) is proposed which exploits the advantages offered by fuzzy clustering algorithms, competitive learning and knowledge of training vector and codevector configurations. Results are compared with the performance of the generalised Lloyd algorithm (GLA) and the fuzzy K-means (FKM) algorithm. It has been found that the proposed algorithm, fuzzy reinforced learning vector quantisation (FRLVQ), yields an improved quality of codebook design in an image compression application when FRLVQ is used as a pre-process. The investigations have also indicated that RL is insensitive to the selection of both the initial codebook and a learning rate control parameter, which is the only additional parameter introduced by RL from the standard FKM.

J	Bal, H; DiBella, EVR; Gullberg, GT				Bal, H; DiBella, EVR; Gullberg, GT			Parametric image formation using clustering for dynamic cardiac SPECT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						clustering methods; compartment modeling; dynamic cardiac SPECT	TL-201; TEBOROXIME; PET	Dynamic cardiac SPECT imaging can provide quantitative and possibly even absolute measures of physiological parameters. However, a dynamic cardiac SPECT study involves a number of steps to obtain estimates of physiological parameters of interest. One of the key steps involves the selection of regions of interest. In the past, this has been done manually or by using a semiautomatic method. We propose to use cluster analysis to segment the data to obtain improved parameter estimates. The algorithm consists of using a standard k-means clustering followed by a blood input fine-tuning procedure using fuzzy k-means performed to obtain a more accurate blood input function. Computer simulations were used to test the algorithm and to compute bias in kinetic rate parameters with and without the use of blood input fine-tuning. This was followed by performing eight studies in three canines and three studies in two patients with a dynamic cardiac perfusion SPECT protocol. The short-axis slice image data were used as input for the cluster analysis program as well as for a previously validated semi-automatic method. All of the time activity curves were fit to a two-compartment model. Parametric images of the wash-in rate parameter were obtained after cluster analysis. The wash-in rate estimates from the selected regions of interest with both of the methods were compared using microsphere derived flows as a gold standard in the case of canine studies. Our results suggest that in regions with low noise, cluster analysis provides parameter estimates comparable to the semi-automatic method in addition to providing improved visual defect localization and contrast. Moreover, the clustered curves have less noise and yield reasonable fits where with the semi-automatic method the fitting routine sometimes failed to converge. The use of clustering also required less manual intervention than the semi-automatic method. These results indicate that use of clustering may bring dynamic cardiac SPECT closer to clinical feasibility.

As the algorithm descends the multiresolution structure, the coarse segmentation results are propagated down to the lower levels so as to reduce the inherent class-position uncertainty and to improve the segmentation accuracy. The procedure is described as follows. In the first step, a quad-tree structure of multiple resolutions is constructed. Sampling windows of different sizes are utilized to partition the underlying image into blocks at different resolution levels and texture features are extracted from each block. Based on the texture features, a hybrid genetic algorithm is employed to perform the segmentation. While the select and mutate operators of the traditional genetic algorithm are adopted in this work, the crossover operator is replaced with K-means clustering method. In the final step, the boundaries and the segmentation result of the current resolution level are propagated down to the next level to act as contextual constraints and the initial configuration of the next level, respectively.

J	Schmidtlein, S; Ewald, J				Schmidtlein, S; Ewald, J			Landscape patterns of indicator plants for soil acidity in the Bavarian Alps	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biodiversity; macroecology; Ellenberg values; floristic data base; indicator plants; landscape pattern; soil pH; carbonate content; altitudinal gradient	VALUES; VEGETATION; CALIFORNIA; FORESTS	Aim Electronic distribution atlases and lists of ecological indicator values are becoming important tools in plant geography. In this contribution, we combine a geographical and an ecological data bank, and map out patterns of indicator value spectra ( instead of single or average values) across a physiographically complex landscape. For our study, we select indicators of soil pH and carbonate content as key environmental factors that strongly affect overall plant diversity patterns in the temperate zone. Our goal is to relate the distribution and diversity of plant groups that are indicators of soil pH and carbonate content to environmental controls at the landscape-scale, and thus contribute to a causal understanding of species pools. Location We studied the Bavarian Alps, which represent the German portion of the Northern Alps. Methods Based on the existing floristic survey, we calculated relative frequencies of nine classes of indicator plants for soil pH and carbonate content in grid cells. The resulting attribute matrix ( cells by indicator class frequencies) was subjected to principal components analysis and to k-means clustering. Results were compared and mapped out in the grid array of the whole region, resulting in continuous and discrete representations of species pool structure. We used a geographical information system to derive physiographical landscape properties from a geological map and a digital elevation model, and analysed their statistical relationship with the shapes of indicator spectra. Results and Main conclusions Averages of indicator values for soil pH and carbonate content follow the geological structure quite closely. Surprisingly, the diversity of indicator plant groups does not appear to be a function of geological or topographic heterogeneity. Rather, it seems to be related to areas of high elevation with uniform geology. The effect is a matter of additional acidophytes in high mountain areas and, in the high calcareous Alps, extreme calciphytes, while species with intermediate requirements are rarer than usual. For explanation, we suggest two facts: ( 1) a frequent lack of mature soils at high elevations and ( 2) particularities in soil genetic processes occurring under the harsh climatic conditions of high mountains.

We have developed a computer package EXCAVATOR for clustering gene expression profiles based on our new framework for representing gene expression data as a minimum spanning tree. EXCAVATOR uses a number of rigorous and efficient clustering algorithms. This program has a number of unique features, including capabilities for: (i) data- constrained clustering; (ii) identification of genes with similar expression profiles to pre-specified seed genes; (iii) cluster identification from a noisy background; (iv) computational comparison between different clustering results of the same data set. EXCAVATOR can be run from a Unix/Linux/DOS shell, from a Java interface or from a Web server. The clustering results can be visualized as colored figures and 2-dimensional plots. Moreover, EXCAVATOR provides a wide range of options for data formats, distance measures, objective functions, clustering algorithms, methods to choose number of clusters, etc. The effectiveness of EXCAVATOR has been demonstrated on several experimental data sets. Its performance compares favorably against the popular K-means clustering method in terms of clustering quality and computing time.

It is a challenging task to improve the efficiency of the algorithm without reducing the generalization performance of SVM. To face this challenge, a new SVM training algorithm based on the set segmentation and k-means clustering is presented in this paper. The new idea is to divide all the original training data into many subsets, followed by clustering each subset using k-means clustering and finally train SVM using the new data set obtained from clustering centroids. Considering that the decomposition algorithm such as SVMlight, is one of the major methods for solving support vector machines, the SVMlight is used in our experiments. Simulations on different types of problems show that the proposed method can solve efficiently not only large linear classification problems but also large nonlinear ones.

A k-means cluster analysis of patients with spinal and radicular pain based on the SF-36 Health Survey scales. Objective. The aim was to determine whether spine patients fall into clusters according to self-reported health status as measured by the SF-36 and to determine if clustering is similar across four common diagnostic categories: herniated disc, spinal stenosis, spondylosis, and chronic pain syndrome. Summary of Background Data. Cognitive-behavioral classifications of chronic pain patients have previously identified three patient groups described as Dysfunctional, Interpersonally Distressed, and Minimizers/Adaptive Copers. The purpose of these classifications is to facilitate and direct treatment based not only on biomedical diagnosis but also on emotional, social, and behavioral diagnoses. This type of analysis has not been done on the quality-of-life scores of patients with specific spinal diagnoses. Methods. Health status data were reviewed from the initial visits of 15,748 spine patients in the National Spine Network database. Based on the eight scales of the SF-36, k-means cluster analysis divided the National Spine Network population into distinct clusters of similar patients. Clustering was performed separately for each clinical diagnosis group. Results. In all four diagnostic categories, cluster analysis classified patients into three groups. Group 1 had fairly high ( relative to the entire sample) scores on all scales and was labeled "Highly Functional." Group 2 had low measures on physical variables but comparatively high scores on the mental scales. These were labeled "Emotional Adapters." Group 3 had low scores on all scales. These patients were labeled "Dysfunctional." Although patients in each diagnostic category fell into one of the three groups, the proportion of patients within each group was quite different among chronic pain patients as compared to the other three diagnostic groups. For example, 29% of herniated disc patients were in the Highly Functional group, whereas only 14% of patients in chronic pain were categorized as Highly Functional. Thirty-three percent of spondylosis patients were classified as Dysfunctional compared with 51% of chronic pain patients. Conclusions. Patients with spinal pain fall into three groups according to their profile of scores on the SF-36 Health Survey. It is proposed that such empirical groupings can guide decision-making in selecting the most appropriate therapies.

Recently developed MR imaging techniques using inversion recovery are a sensitive tool to identify and quantify morphologic changes in the substantia nigra due to neurodegeneration. Using a semi-automated computer segmentation technique to isolate the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC), we propose a colored image fusion technique to visually assess the sites of damage in the SNC and integrate the information obtained from two implemented inversion-recovery sequences. Patients and Methods. Six patients and six age-matched control subjects were scanned using a combination of two MR imaging inversion-recovery (IR) pulse sequences. A subgroup of them was used to develop our technique. Images were blended together into a final (RGBA) image, where A stands for the alpha channel describing transparency. Results. Abnormalities in the SNC can be accurately assessed in location, shape, and variations of signal intensities within the segmented SNC by varying the transparency (alpha) channel of the color fusion image. Several previous findings such as the lateral-medial gradient of signal change and a ventral-dorsal broadening of the pars compacta are accompanied by an overall mild-to-severe heterogeneity of neurodegeneration patterns. Conclusion. Color fusion techniques revealed subtle changes in the neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease, which can be helpful for an objective and hence effective visual assessment of disease progression.

Procedures for classifying a sequence of yield maps to delineate yield zones were evaluated in two irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) fields. Yield classes were created using empirically defined yield categories or through hierarchical or nonhierarchical cluster analysis techniques. Cluster analysis was conducted using average yield (MY), average yield and its standard deviation (MS), or all individual years (AY) as input variables. All methods were compared based on the average yield variability accounted for (RVc). Methods in which yield was empirically classified into three or four classes accounted for less than 54% of the yield variability observed and failed to delineate high-yielding areas. Six to seven yield classes established by cluster analysis of MY accounted for 60 to 66% of the yield variability. Differences among cluster analysis methods were small for MY as data source. However, fuzzy-k-means clustering had lower RVc than other methods if used with the MS or AY data. The spatial fragmentation of yield class maps increased in the order MY < MS < AY. Univariate cluster analysis of mean relative yield measured for at least 5 yr should be used for yield classification in irrigated fields where six to seven classes appear to provide sufficient resolution of the yield variability observed. More research should be conducted to develop methods that result in spatially coherent yield zones and to understand differences between rainfed and irrigated environments in the importance of mapping yield goals for crop management.

The three consecutive daily mean National Center for Environmental Protection reanalyzed 850 hPa geopotential height fields without precipitation on the last day over South Korea are used for clustering of synoptic patterns for the period of 1994-1998. Two emission conditions are simulated for each cluster to estimate long-term impact by long-range transport for acidic dry deposition over South Korea. One condition takes all emissions within the simulated domain into account as a base case and the other condition excludes South Korea's emission and all oxidizers and considering all of the other emissions as a control case. The results of the present study indicate that the contribution of long-range transport to the annual total South Korea's dry deposition of sulfur is found to be about 30% (78 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), of which 65% and 35% are contributed by SO2 and SO42-, respectively, whereas that of total nitrogen deposition is found to be 49% (240 eq ha- yr-1), of which 80% and 20% are contributed by the transformed nitrogen species including HNO3, NH4+ and NO3-, and the primary pollutants of NO, and NH3, respectively, suggesting the importance of secondary pollutants of nitrogen species for long-range transport to South Korea's total dry deposition of nitrogen.

We broadened the study of synchrony to all available fisheries in the world by making use of all available data in the FAO catch database during the last 50 years. We investigated synchronous patterns in remote fisheries using two different approaches. The first approach consisted of simulating catch time-series as random walk processes and comparing the synchronies found between these time-series to the synchronies found in FAO data. In the second approach, we applied classification algorithms to analyse synchronies in the FAO catch database. We used K-means clustering and neural networks to answer the following four questions: ( 1) Do the target series appear in the same cluster? ( 2) Do the clusters regroup series from the same region ( local synchrony) or from distant ones ( remote synchrony)? ( 3) Are there any numerically dominant patterns ( clusters) in the catch series? ( 4) Do the species displaying the same pattern share some common bio-ecological features or ranges of abundance? Our results indicate some degree of local rather than remote synchrony. Nonetheless, it does not prove that such remote synchronies do not exist, but simply that further process studies are required before accepting them as a new paradigm.

K-means, which is a "hard-max" approach, converges very fast. The method, however, devotes itself to local search, and it easily falls into local minima. On the other hand, the NG and SOM methods, which are "soft-max" approaches, are good at the global search ability. Though NG and SOM exhibit better performance in coming close to the optimum than that of K-means, the methods converge slower than K-means. In order to the disadvantages that exist when K-means, NG and SOM are used individually, this paper proposes hybrid methods such as NG-K, SOM-K and SOM-NG. NG-K performs NG adaptation during short period of time early in the learning process, and then the method performs K-means adaptation in the rest of the process. SOM-K and SOM-NG are similar as NG-K. From numerical simulations including an image compression problem, NG-K and SOM-K exhibit better performance than other methods.

Generally, producing a summary as extracts is achieved by including only sentences which are the most topic-related. DO-CUSUM is our summarization system based on a new topic keyword identification method. The process of DOCUSUM is as follows. First, DOGUSUM converts the content words of a document into elements of a context vector space. It then constructs lexical clusters from the context vector space and identifies core clusters. Next. it selects topic keywords from the core clusters. Finally, it generates a summary of the document using the topic keywords. In the experiments on various compression ratios (the compression of 30%, the compression of 10%, and the extraction of the fixed number of sentences: 4 or 8 sentences), DOCUSUM showed better performance than other methods.

We combine template-based face detection and tracking method with color information to track a face regardless of various lighting conditions and complex backgrounds as well as the race. Based on our experiments, we generate robust face templates from wavelet-transformed lowpass and two highpass subimages at the second level low-resolution. However, since template matching is generally sensitive to the change of illumination conditions, we propose a new type of preprocessing method. Tracking method is applied to reduce the computation time and predict precise face candidate region even though the movement is not uniform. Facial components are also detected using k-means clustering and their geometrical properties. Finally, from the relative distance of two eyes, we verify the real face and estimate the size of facial ellipse. To validate face detection and tracking performance of our algorithm, we test our method using six different video categories of QCIF size which are recorded in dynamic environments.

The role of personality is also in dispute. We aimed to assess the association of these factors with functional GI symptoms in a birth cohort study. Methods: The Dunedin birth cohort is well characterised and has been followed-up prospectively to age 26 (n=980). Measured were upper and lower GI symptoms over the prior year at age 26 using a validated questionnaire, psychiatric diagnoses at ages 18 and 21 by standardised interview applying DSM-III-R criteria, and personality at age 18 using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). Natural symptom groupings were identified using factor analysis and k-means clustering. The association of these clusters and psychiatric diagnoses or personality was assessed by logistic regression. Results: The k-means analysis produced a six-cluster solution, which was made up of a health group, and five "disease" clusters defined by higher than average scores on a single symptom. A diagnosis of depression at age 18 or 21 years was associated with increases in the odds of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.27-2.25) for all GI, of 2.16 (95% Cl: 1.12-4.16) for dysmotility and of 2.07 (95% Cl: 1.13-3.80) for constipation, but not with the other clusters. Similar results were observed with respect to anxiety disorders for the odds of GI overall (OR=1.42, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.99) and constipation (OR=2.11, 95% Cl: 1.17-3.79). The personality subscales were not strongly linked; membership of "any" diseased cluster was associated with a reduced odds of being in the fourth quartile for the well-being scale (OR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.88) but increased odds of being in the fourth quartile for the social potency scale (OR=1.64, 95% Cl: 1.18-2.28). Conclusions: In a young adult community sample, unexplained GI symptoms appear to be linked to psychiatric disorders but personality differences were minimal. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The experiments are performed on two models of the Altera Excalibur board, the first using the soft IP core 32-bit NIOS 1.1 RISC processor, and the second with the hard IP core ARM processor. In our experiments, we compare performance of the sequential k-means algorithm with three different accelerated versions. We consider granularity and synchronization issues when mapping an algorithm to a hybrid processor. Our results show that speedup of 11.8X is achieved by migrating computation to the Excalibur ARM hardware/software as compared to software only on a Gigahertz Pentium III. Speedup on the Excalibur NIOS is limited by the communication cost of transferring data from external memory through the processor to the customized circuits. This limitation is overcome on the Excalibur ARM, in which dual-port memories, accessible to both the processor and configurable logic, have the biggest performance impact of all the techniques studied.

J	Sugar, CA; James, GM				Sugar, CA; James, GM			Finding the number of clusters in a dataset: An information-theoretic approach	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cluster analysis; distortion; information theory; k-means clustering; mixture models	DATA SET; LIKELIHOOD	One of the most difficult problems in cluster analysis is identifying the number of groups in a dataset. Most previously suggested approaches to this problem are either somewhat ad hoc or require parametric assumptions and complicated calculations. In. this article we develop a simple, yet powerful nonparametric method for choosing the number of clusters based on distortion, a quantity that measures the average distance, per dimension, between each observation and its closest cluster center. Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters, but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world datasets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information-theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems.

EPTC richness was recorded in the Adour-Garonne stream system (France), at 155 unstressed sampling sites, which were characterized using 4 environmental variables: elevation, stream order, distance from the source, and maximum water temperature. The EPTC and environmental data were first computed with the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm. Then, using the k-means algorithm, clusters were detected on the map and the sampling sites were classified separately for each variable and for EPTC richness. Four clusters could be identified on the SOM map, according to the 4 environmental variables, and this classification was chiefly related to stream order and elevation (i.e., the longitudinal location of sampling sites within a stream system). Similarly, 4 subsets were derived from the SOM according to a gradient of EPTC richness. There was also a high coincidence between observed (field data) and calculated (predicted from the output neurons of the SOM) species richness in each taxonomic group. Species richness relationships between Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera for both observed and predicted data were highly significant. However, correlation coefficients among species richness of Plecoptera and the other groups were low. Last, a multilayer perceptron neural network, trained using the backpropagation algorithm, was used to predict EPTC richness (output) using the 4 above-mentioned environmental variables (input). The model showed high predictability (r = 0.91 and r = 0.61 for training and test data sets, respectively), and a sensitivity analysis revealed that elevation and stream order contributed the most among the 4 input variables. Prediction of species richness using a limited number of environmental variables is, thus, a valuable tool for the assessment of disturbance in a given area. The degree to which human activities have altered EPTC richness can be determined by knowing what the EPTC richness should be under undisturbed conditions in a given area.

We present an abstract framework for integrating multiple feature spaces in the k-means clustering algorithm. Our main ideas are (i) to represent each data object as a tuple of multiple feature vectors, (ii) to assign a suitable ( and possibly different) distortion measure to each feature space, (iii) to combine distortions on different feature spaces, in a convex fashion, by assigning ( possibly) different relative weights to each, (iv) for a fixed weighting, to cluster using the proposed convex k-means algorithm, and ( v) to determine the optimal feature weighting to be the one that yields the clustering that simultaneously minimizes the average within-cluster dispersion and maximizes the average between-cluster dispersion along all the feature spaces. Using precision/recall evaluations and known ground truth classifications, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of feature weighting in clustering on several different application domains.

J	Venkatesh, YV; Raja, SK				Venkatesh, YV; Raja, SK			On the classification of multispectral satellite images using the multilayer perceptron	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						ground truth data; K-means clustering; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Gaussian maximum-likelihood classification; multilayer perceptron; backpropagation; multispectral image classification	NEURAL-NETWORK; PATTERN-RECOGNITION	For classifying multispectral satellite images, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained using either (i) ground truth data or (ii) the output of a K-means clustering program or (iii) both, as applied to certain representative parts of the given data set. In the second case, different sets of clustered image outputs, which have been checked against actual ground truth data wherever available, are used for testing the MLP. The cover classes are, typically, different types of (a) vegetation (including forests and agriculture); (b) soil (including mountains, highways and rocky terrain); and (c) water bodies (including lakes). Since the extent of ground truth may not be sufficient for training neural networks, the proposed procedure (of using clustered output images) is believed to be novel and advantageous. Moreover, it is found that the MLP offers an accuracy of more than 99% when applied to the multispectral satellite images in our library. As importantly, comparison with some recent results shows that the proposed application of the MLP leads to a more accurate and faster classification of multispectral image data.

J	Hutt, A; Daffertshofer, A; Steinmetz, U				Hutt, A; Daffertshofer, A; Steinmetz, U			Detection of mutual phase synchronization in multivariate signals and application to phase ensembles and chaotic data	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; OSCILLATORS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; BRAIN; INTERMITTENCY; SEGMENTATION; CONVECTION; STABILITY; SYMMETRY	This work presents a method for the detection of mutual phase synchronization in nonstationary time series. We show how the application of a cluster algorithm that considers spatiotemporal structures of data follows from the general condition of phase-synchronized data. In view of the topology of phasic data, we reformulate the K-means cluster algorithm on a flat torus and apply a segmentation index derived in an earlier work [A. Hutt and H. Riedel, Physica D 177, 203 (2003)]. This index is extended by means of averaging in order to reflect phase synchronization in ensembles of multivariate time series. The method is illustrated using simulated multivariate phase dynamics and arrays of chaotic systems, in which temporal segments of phase-synchronized states are registered. A comparison with results from an existing bivariate synchronization index reveals major advantages of our method.

J	Steinley, D				Steinley, D			Local optima in K-means clustering: What you don't know may hurt you	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL TEST CLUSTERS; CLASSIFICATION CAPABILITIES; ALGORITHMS; NUMBER; SIZE	The popular K-means clustering method, as implemented in 3 commercial software packages (SPSS, SYSTAT, and SAS), generally provides solutions that are only locally optimal for a given set of data. Because none of these commercial implementations offer a reasonable mechanism to begin the K-means method at alternative starting points, separate routines were written within the MATLAB (MathWorks, 1999) environment that can be initialized randomly (these routines are provided at the end of the online version of this article in the PsycARTICLES database). Through the analysis of 2 empirical data sets and 8 10 simulated data sets, it is shown that the results provided by commercial packages are most likely locally optimal. These results suggest the need for some strategy to study the local optima problem for a specific data set or to identify methods for finding "good" starting values that might lead to the best solutions possible.

Although data are gathered as finite vector and may contain measurement errors, the functional form have to be taken into account. We propose a clustering procedure of such data emphasizing the functional nature of the objects. The new clustering method consists of two stages: fitting the functional data by B-sptines and partitioning the estimated model coefficients using a k-means algorithm. Strong consistency of the clustering method is proved and a real-world example from food industry is given.

The lens is also an excellent system for understanding fundamental biological processes such as cellular differentiation and ageing. Here, microarrays have been used to gain insights into global patterns of gene expression in the mouse lens. Lens gene expression compared to non-lens tissues has been investigated in order to identify genes preferentially expressed in the lens and lenses of different ages have been compared to identify differentially regulated genes. Methods: Genes expressed in the lens were identified using mouse GeneFilters(R) microarrays (GF400; ResGenTM). Each array comprises 5,184 mouse cDNAs representing sequence-verified known genes and uncharacterized ESTs spotted onto a nylon membrane. Target RNA (33P labeled) from lens and non-lens samples was hybridized to the arrays. The proportion of genes involved in various biological processes was investigated using Onto-ExpressTM to search for GeneOntologyTM terms associated with them. Differential gene expression was investigated using K-means clustering analysis. Expression of known and uncharacterized genes selected from the arrays was investigated further using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: 1,668 genes were expressed in one or more of newborn, 7 day old, and adult mouse lenses at levels significantly above background. Raw data and bioinformatics data relating to these genes have been published herein. There were 543 (33%) known genes, 124 (7%) had some similarity to known genes, 400 (24%) were functionally uncharacterized, and the remaining 601 (36%) genes were novel (matching only existing ESTs). Onto-ExpressTM identified genes involved in various biological processes including several categories containing greater numbers of genes than would be expected by chance, such as transcription regulation and G-protein coupled receptor signaling genes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed preferential expression of several genes in the lens compared to non-lens tissues and genes exhibiting significantly higher expression in the 7 day lens compared to either adult or newborn lenses. Expression in the lens of 10 genes involved in apoptosis was also confirmed and, intriguingly, expression of hemoglobin isoforms (Hba-a1, Hba-X, Hbb-b1, Hbb-b2, and Hbb-Y) was confirmed using isotype specific primers. Finally, we confirmed the expression in the lens of all additional novel, uncharacterized and known genes tested. Conclusions: The present work has provided insights into global patterns of gene expression in the lens and the expression of a significant number of genes has been confirmed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Genes preferentially expressed in the lens compared to non-lens tissues have been identified as well as genes differentially expressed between lenses at different ages. Gene expression profiling and gene discovery in the lens are essential prerequisites for future functional studies aimed at gaining insights into the potential roles of these genes in lens development, maturation, physiology, and pathogenesis (using targeted mutagenesis in mice, for instance).

J	Zheng, X; Chen, TL				Zheng, X; Chen, TL			Nonlinear time series forecast using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						neural network; nonlinear time series; clustering		In the research of using Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) forecasting nonlinear time series, we investigate how the different clusterings affect the process of learning and forecasting. We find that k-means clustering is very suitable. In order to increase the precision we introduce a nonlinear feedback term to escape from the local minima of energy, then we use the model to forecast the nonlinear time series which are produced by Mackey-Glass equation and stocks. By selecting the k-means clustering and the suitable feedback term, much better forecasting results are obtained.

J	Stevenson, EJ; Giresi, PG; Koncarevic, A; Kandarian, SC				Stevenson, EJ; Giresi, PG; Koncarevic, A; Kandarian, SC			Global analysis of gene expression patterns during disuse atrophy in rat skeletal muscle	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME PATHWAY; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MYOSIN HEAVY-CHAIN; SOLEUS MUSCLE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HINDLIMB SUSPENSION; BINDING PROTEIN-5; SATELLITE CELLS; MESSENGER-RNA; MYOSTATIN	Muscular inactivity leads to atrophy, weakness, and decreased fatigue resistance. In order to provide a window into the dynamic processes that underlie muscle atrophy, we performed global gene expression analysis of rat soleus muscles using Affymetrix GeneChips at 1, 4, 7 and 14 days of hindlimb unloading. Expression of 309 known genes was significantly changed by at least 2-fold (212 upregulated, 97 downregulated). K-means clustering was used to divide these genes into coregulated clusters based on the similarity of temporal expression patterns. This allowed the development of a timeline of the atrophy process with respect to the behaviour of genes in a broad array of functional categories. Regulatory genes were often upregulated early, in either a transient or sustained manner, but they also populated clusters with later patterns of activation, suggesting different phases of molecular adaptations. Other early events were the activation of ubiquitination genes and downregulation of protein chaperones. In comparison, clusters representing slightly delayed activation patterns included genes involved in fast contraction, glycolysis, translational inhibition, oxidative stress, protein degradation, and amino acid catabolism. Downregulated genes exhibited fewer unique expression patterns and included structural and regulatory genes of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, and genes that define a slow-oxidative phenotype. Other novel findings include the tight co-activation of proteasome subunit and ubiquitination genes, differential regulation of serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors, and the identification of transcriptional, signalling, growth and cell cycle genes that probably play a role in the atrophy process. The present work has uncovered temporal patterns of gene expression that highlight the molecular processes that underlie muscle atrophy and provide new avenues for study.

In this study, healthy breast tissue samples were examined by means of Raman spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 840 nm. Raman spectra of breast ducts were acquired using a microscopic mapping approach, and mapping measurements of breast duct epithelium were performed at a lateral resolution that enabled investigation of single epithelial cells. Different cellular compounds within the epithelial layer such as nuclei and cytoplasm were identified by principal components analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster analysis applied to their Raman spectra. Furthermore, spectra of breast secretion fluid that was found to cover the epithelium in most samples were analyzed. They contained mainly signal contributions from lipids. Two different classes of lipid secretion spectra were identified and both spectral classes could be found in the same sample. Spatially resolved analysis of breast duct fluid could provide new insights into breast secretion biochemistry in normal and pathological conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wojna, A				Wojna, A			Center-based indexing in vector and metric spaces	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article							COMBINING RULE INDUCTION; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; RIONA; TREES	The paper addresses the problem of indexing data for k nearest neighbors (k-nn) search. Given a collection of data objects and a similarity measure the searching goal is to find quickly the k most similar objects to a given query object. We present a top-down indexing method that employs a widely used scheme of indexing algorithms. It starts with the whole set of objects at the root of an indexing tree and iteratively splits data at each level of indexing hierarchy. In the paper two different data models are considered. In the first, objects are represented by vectors from a multi-dimensional vector space. The second, more general, is based on an assumption that objects satisfy only the axioms of a metric space. We propose an iterative k-means algorithm for tree node splitting in case of a vector space and an iterative k-approximate-centers algorithm in case when only a metric space is provided. The experiments show that the iterative k-means splitting procedure accelerates significantly k-nn searching over the one-step procedure used in other indexing structures such as GNAT, SS-tree and M-tree and that the relevant representation of a tree node is an important issue for the performance of the search process. We also combine different search pruning criteria used in BST, GHT nad GNAT structures into one and show that such a combination outperforms significantly each single pruning criterion. The experiments are performed for benchmark data sets of the size up to several hundreds of thousands of objects. The indexing tree with the k-means splitting procedure and the combined search criteria is particularly effective for the largest tested data sets for which this tree accelerates searching up to several thousands times.

J	Shu, C; Burn, DH				Shu, C; Burn, DH			Spatial patterns of homogeneous pooling groups for flood frequency analysis	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						flood frequency analysis; spatial point pattern; complete spatial randomness; K function	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS	Several methods for the exploration and modelling of spatial point patterns are introduced to study the spatial patterns of homogeneous pooling groups for flood frequency analysis. The study is based on selected catchments in Great Britain, where a high density of gauging stations has been established. Initial pooling groups are formed using the K-means clustering algorithm with appropriately selected similarity measures. The pooling groups are subsequently revised to improve the homogeneity in the hydrological response. Spatial patterns of the initial and final pooling groups are explored in terms of intensity and dependence of the spatial distribution of the catchments. A test against a spatial point process is used to confirm or reject the initial impression of spatial clustering. Changes in the spatial patterns from the initial to the final pooling groups are examined using two comparison methods. The spatial pattern analysis described above can be used to answer the following questions: whether homogeneous catchments tend to exist in the vicinity of each other; whether the improvement in homogeneity tends to form more clustered pooling groups; and how the spatial patterns observed can be used to direct the selection of pooling variables.

J	Park, IK; Lee, KM; Lee, SU				Park, IK; Lee, KM; Lee, SU			Models and algorithms for efficient multiresolution topology estimation of measured 3-D range data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						-3-D range data; dynamic mesh; K-means clustering; multiresolution; polygonal mesh; topology estimation	TRIANGULATION	In this paper, we propose a new efficient topology estimation algorithm to construct a multiresolution polygonal mesh from measured three-dimensional (3-D) range data. The topology estimation problem is defined under the constraints of cognition, compactness, and regularity, and the algorithm is designed to be applied to either a cloud of points or a dense mesh. The proposed algorithm initially segments the range data into a finite number of Voronoi patches using the K-means clustering algorithm. Each patch is then approximated by an appropriate polygonal and eventually a triangular mesh model. In order to improve the equiangularity of the mesh, we employ a dynamic mesh model, in which the mesh finds its equilibrium state adaptively, according to the equiangularity constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that satisfactory equiangular triangular mesh models can be constructed rapidly at various resolutions, while yielding tolerable modeling error.

The one-dimensional time series sampled from a dynamical system is mapped on to the m-dimensional phase space by the method of delays. The vectors in the phase space are partitioned by k-means clustering technique. The local trajectory matrix for the vectors in each of the clusters is determined. The eigenvalues of the local trajectory matrices represent the variation along the principal directions and are obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD). The product of the eigenvalues represents the generalized variance and is a measure of the local dispersion in the phase space. The sum of the local dispersions (g T) is used as the discriminant statistic to classify data sets obtained from deterministic and stochastic settings. The surrogates were generated by the Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT) technique.

J	Ho, SY; Lee, KZ				Ho, SY; Lee, KZ			Design and analysis of an efficient evolutionary image segmentation algorithm	JOURNAL OF VLSI SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						image segmentation; K-means; intelligent genetic algorithm; optimization	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; EDGE-DETECTION	Evolutionary image segmentation algorithms have a number of advantages such as continuous contour, non-oversegmentation, and non-thresholds. However, most of the evolutionary image segmentation algorithms suffer from long computation time because the number of encoding parameters is large. In this paper, design and analysis of an efficient evolutionary image segmentation algorithm EISA are proposed. EISA uses a K-means algorithm to split an image into many homogeneous regions, and then uses an intelligent genetic algorithm IGA associated with an effective chromosome encoding method to merge the regions automatically such that the objective of the desired segmentation can be effectively achieved, where IGA is superior to conventional genetic algorithms in solving large parameter optimization problems. High performance of EISA is illustrated in terms of both the evaluation performance and computation time, compared with some current segmentation methods. It is empirically shown that EISA is robust and efficient using nature images with various characteristics.

J	Robertson, AW; Mechoso, CR				Robertson, AW; Mechoso, CR			Circulation regimes and low-frequency oscillations in the South Pacific sector	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							HEMISPHERE WINTERTIME CIRCULATION; CLIMATIC TIME-SERIES; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; PERSISTENT ANOMALIES; GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE; WEATHER REGIMES; HEIGHT FIELD; TELECONNECTIONS; SIMULATION; STATISTICS	The characteristics of subseasonal circulation variability over the South Pacific are examined using 10-day lowpass-filtered 700-hPa geopotential height NCEP - NCAR reanalysis data. The extent to which the variability in each season is characterized by recurrent geographically fixed circulation regimes and/or oscillatory behavior is determined. Two methods of analysis (a K-means cluster analysis and a cross-validated Gaussian mixture model) both indicate three to four geographically fixed circulation regimes in austral fall, winter, and ( to some extent) spring. The spatial regime structures are found to be quite similar in each season; they resemble the so-called Pacific - South American (PSA) patterns discussed in previous studies and often referred to as PSA 1 and PSA 2. Oscillatory behavior is investigated using singular spectrum analysis. This identifies a predominantly stationary wave with a period of about 40 days and a spatial structure similar to PSA 1; it is most pronounced in winter and spring and exhibits a noticeable eastward drift as it decays. The power spectrum of variability is otherwise well approximated by a red spectrum, together with enhanced broader-band 15 - 30-day variability. The results presented herein indicate that low-frequency variability over the South Pacific is not dominated by a propagating wave whose quadrature phases are PSA 1 and PSA 2, as hitherto described. Rather, it is found that the variability is well described by the occurrence of three to four geographically fixed circulation regimes, with a ( near) 40-day oscillation that is predominantly stationary in space. The potential subseasonal predictability implied by this duality is discussed. Only during austral spring is a strong correlation found between El Nino and the frequency of occurrence of the circulation regimes.

The method aims to deal with typical problems which have been frequently observed in slant correction of handwritten Korean strings with conventional approaches developed for English/European languages. Directional strokes are extracted from a line of text image, and statistical distribution of the strokes is analyzed using K-means clustering. Gaussian modeling is applied to each of the stroke clusters and the slant angle is estimated from the one which represents the vertical strokes. Experimental results, including comparison with other conventional methods, support the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we used Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the global gene expression signatures associated with gliomas of different types and grades. Here, we show that the global transcriptional profiles of gliomas of different types and grades are distinct from each other and from the normal brain. To determine whether our data could be used to uncover molecular subtypes without prior knowledge of pathologic type and grade, we performed K-means clustering analysis and found evidence for three clusters with the aid of multidimensional scaling plots. These clusters corresponded to glioblastomas, lower grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas (P<0.00001). A predictor constructed from the 170 genes that are most differentially expressed between the subsets correctly identified the type and grade of all samples, indicating that a relatively small number of genes can be used to distinguish between these molecular subtypes. These results further define molecular subsets of gliomas which may potentially be used for patient stratification, and suggest potential targets for treatment.

J	De, B; Mattoo, SK; Basu, D				De, B; Mattoo, SK; Basu, D			Age at onset typology in opioid-dependent men: An exploratory study from India	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Article							HEROIN-ADDICTS; PERSONALITY-CHARACTERISTICS; EMPIRICAL LITERATURE; OPIATE DEPENDENCE; SENSATION-SEEKING; ALCOHOLICS; DISORDERS; CRITIQUE; SEVERITY	This study attempted to apply age at onset typology in ICD-10-diagnosed opioid dependence. The sample is comprised of eighty men seeking treatment at an addiction clinic in India. The measures included a sociodemographic and clinical profile, Severity of Opioid Dependence Questionnaire, Sensation Seeking Scale, Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), and Family History Assessment Module. Application of k-means cluster analysis led to the emergence of two cluster types: early onset (mean age at onset 21 years) and late onset (mean age at onset 27 years). The early onset group was characterized by a significantly younger current age, more urban and unemployed subjects, younger ages at the onset of opioid use and dependence, a higher severity of opioid use, a higher lifetime use of sedatives and tobacco, younger ages at the onset of dependence on alcohol and cannabis, higher sensation seeking, and higher global psychopathology in terms of MPQ. Other less differentiating features were higher family history of psychiatric illness (including substance abuse), longer duration of opioid use and dependence, and higher lifetime use of cannabis. These results show the age at onset typology in opioid dependence to be feasible and to have some similarities to age at onset typology in alcoholism.

In this control problem the controller tries to steer the state process into a given deterministic set T with probability one. The reachability set, V(t), for the target problem is the set of all initial data x from which the state process X-X(v)(t) is an element of T for some control process v. This representation is proved by studying the squared distance function to Gamma(t). For the codimension k mean curvature flow, the state process is dX(t) = root2P dW(t), where W(t) is a d-dimensional Brownian motion, and the control P is any projection matrix onto a (d - k)-dimensional plane. Smooth solutions of the inverse mean curvature flow and a discussion of non smooth solutions are also given.

A cohort of 213 normotensive healthy subjects was followed during five years. Using K-means clustering technique we have defined 7 homogeneous groups of subjects. Four, groups with different combinations of these factors had a significantly higher 5-year systolic BP increase. The common characteristic of these groups was a low BRS. In conclusion, cluster analysis is well suited to analyse combined effect of factors on hypertension genesis. Only low BRS seems to be the common factor involved in hypertension development.

We describe an error-minimization technique to identify movement between successive frames of a sequence and we show that we can use the K-Means clusters as the minimization template. A Kalman filter is used to provide smooth estimates of velocity at a pixel through time. Using this technique in combination with the K-Means clusters, we can identify storm motion at different scales and choose different scales to forecast based on the time scale of interest. The motion estimator has been applied both to reflectivity data obtained from the National Weather Service Radar (WSR-88D) and to cloud-top infrared temperatures obtained from GOES satellites.

J	Solman, SA; Menendez, CG				Solman, SA; Menendez, CG			Weather regimes in the South American sector and neighbouring oceans during winter	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; HEMISPHERE WINTER; LOCAL CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; OSCILLATION; REANALYSIS; PACIFIC; BLOCKING; ATLANTIC; EVENTS	We classified 34 years of winter daily 500 hPa geopotential height patterns over the eastern South Pacific-South America-South Atlantic region using the K-means clustering method. We found a significant classification into five weather regimes (WRs) defined as the most frequent large-scale circulation anomalies: WR1 (trough centred downstream of the Drake Passage), WR2 (trough over the SW Pacific and ridge downstream), WR3 (ridge over the SE Pacific and NW-SE trough downstream), WR4 (trough over the SE Pacific and NW-SE ridge downstream) and WR5 (weak ridge to the west of southern South America). We also analysed their persistence and temporal evolution, including transitions between them and development around onsets and breaks of each regime. The preferred transitions, WR1-->WR3-->WR2-->WR4-->WR1 and also WR1-->WR3-->WR2-->WR1, suggest the progression of a Rossby wave-like pattern in which each of the regimes resemble the Pacific-South America modes. Significant influence of the WRs on local climate over Argentina was found. The preferred transitions WR1-->WR3 and WR3-->WR2 induce sustained cold conditions over Patagonia and over northern Argentina, respectively. The most significant change in precipitation frequency is found for WR3, with wetter conditions over all the analysed regions. Finally, the interannual to interdecadal significant variations in the occurrence of these regimes were discussed. WR1 and WR3 are more frequent and WR2 is less frequent during El Nino, and WR2 and WR5 are more frequent and WR1 is less frequent during La Nina. A significant decrease in WR2 and increase of WR4 and WR5 during the 1970s and early 1980s were found.

J	Nagarajan, R				Nagarajan, R			Intensity-based segmentation of microarray images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						clustering; image segmentation; k-means; microarrays; normalization; PAM	EXPRESSION; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	The underlying principle in microarray image analysis is that the spot intensity is a measure of the gene expression. This implicitly assumes the gene expression of a spot to be governed entirely by the distribution of the pixel intensities. Thus, a segmentation technique based on the distribution of the pixel intensities is appropriate for the current problem. In this paper, clustering-based segmentation is described to extract the target intensity of the spots. The approximate boundaries of the spots in the microarray are determined by manual adjustment of rectilinear grids. The distribution of the pixel intensity in a grid containing a spot is assumed to be the superposition of the foreground and the local background. The k-means clustering technique and the partitioning around medoids (PAM) were used to generate a binary partition of the pixel intensity distribution. The median (k-means) and the medoid (PAM) of the cluster members are chosen as the cluster representatives. The effectiveness of the clustering-based segmentation techniques was tested on publicly available arrays generated in a lipid metabolism experiment (Callow et al., 2000). The results are compared against those obtained using the region-growing approach (SPOT) (Yang et al., 2001). The effect of additive white Gaussian noise is also investigated.

Applications to the design of new herbicides	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							EDGE-ADJACENCY MATRIX; GRAPH-THEORETICAL APPROACH; SPECTRAL MOMENTS; MOLECULAR CONNECTIVITY; SOIL SORPTION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; K-OC; DESCRIPTORS; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY	A new application of TOPological Sub-structural MOlecular DEsign (TOPS-MODE) was carried out in herbicides using computer-aided molecular design. Two series of compounds, one containing herbicide and the other containing nonherbicide compounds, were processed by a k-Means Cluster Analysis in order to design the training and prediction sets. A linear classification function to discriminate the herbicides from the nonherbicide compounds was developed. The model correctly and clearly classified 88% of active and 94% of inactive compounds in the training set. More specifically, the model showed a good global classification of 91%, i.e., (168 cases out of 185). While in the prediction set, they showed an overall predictability of 91% and 92% for active and inactive compounds, being the global percentage of good classification of 92%. To assess the range of model applicability, a virtual screening of structurally heterogeneous series of herbicidal compounds was carried out. Two hundred eighty-four out of 332 were correctly classified (86%). Furthermore this paper describes a fragment analysis in order to determine the contribution of several fragments toward herbicidal property; also the present of halogens in the selected fragments were analyzed. It seems that the present TOPS-MODE based QSAR is the first alternate general "in silico" technique to experimentation in herbicides discovery.

The definition of a single fixed point cluster (FPC) is based on a simple parametric model, but there is no parametric assumption for the whole dataset as opposed to mixture modeling and other approaches. An FPC is defined as a data subset that is exactly the set of non-outliers with respect to its own parameter estimators. This paper concentrates upon the theoretical foundation of FPC analysis as a method for clusterwise linear regression, i.e., the single clusters are modeled as linear regressions with normal errors. In this setup, fixed point clustering is based on an iteratively reweighted estimation with zero weight for all outliers. FPCs are non-hierarchical, but they may overlap and include each other. A specification of the number of clusters is not needed. Consistency results are given for certain mixture models of interest in cluster analysis. Convergence of a fixed point algorithm is shown. Application to a real dataset shows that fixed point clustering can highlight some other interesting features of datasets compared to maximum likelihood methods in the presence of deviations from the usual assumptions of model based cluster analysis.

Either or both dimensions for the genes and the samples of a given microarray dataset can be classified in an unsupervised fashion. Alternatively, if certain prior knowledge of the genes or samples is available, a supervised version of the clustering analysis can also be carried out. Either approach may be used to generate a partial or complete binary hierarchy, the dendrogram, showing the underlying structure of the dataset. Compared to other existing clustering methods used for microarray data analysis (such as hierarchical and K-means), the method presented here has the advantage of much improved computational efficiency while retaining effective separation of data clusters under-a distance metric, a straightforward parallel implementation, and useful extraction and presentation of biological information. Clustering results of both synthesized and experimental microarray data are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart ( such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.

J	Piasentier, E; Valusso, R; Camin, F; Versini, G				Piasentier, E; Valusso, R; Camin, F; Versini, G			Stable isotope ratio analysis for authentication of lamb meat	MEAT SCIENCE			English	Article						lamb meat; sable isotope ratios; feeding regime; geographical origin	ORIGIN ASSIGNMENT; N-15/N-14 RATIOS; CARBON ISOTOPES; REGIONAL ORIGIN; FRACTIONATION; C-13/C-12; ANIMALS; QUALITY; PLANTS; SWINE	The effectiveness of the analysis of stable isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) in fractions of lamb meat, measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry, was evaluated as a method of feeding and geographical origin authentication. Analyses were carried out on meat from 12 lamb types, produced in couples in six European countries (country of origin, CO) and divided in three groups according to the feeding regime during their finishing period: suckled milk only, pasture without any solid supplementation and supplementation containing maize grain (feeding regime, FR). These analyses were made on two samples of longissimus thoracis muscle, taken from the 13th rib section of the left side of two different lambs, randomly chosen between the 120 selected to represent each lamb type. delta(13)C values varied significantly in different meat fractions, the difference being higher in protein than in fat (average difference 5.0parts per thousand). However, the pairs delta(13)C values of crude fat and protein were highly correlated (r = 0.976) and affected by lamb type in a similar fashion, mainly reflecting animals' feeding regime. Even WIN values of meat protein fraction showed significant differences between lamb types, not dependant on the feeding regime. In fact, lambs fed on similar diets, but in different countries, gave meat with different N-15 relative abundances. These findings provide the possibility of discriminating lamb types within the same feeding regime. Canonical discriminant analysis was carried out to evaluate whether lamb meat from different CO or FR or CO x FR interaction could be mathematically distinguished by its stable isotope ratios. On the basis of CO, the corrected empirical allocation of 79.2% of the initial observations and the corrected cross-validation of two thirds of the individual meat samples was obtained. FR gave better results: 91.7% of the individual meat samples was both correctly allocated and cross-validated, indicating the high potential of stable isotope ratio analysis as a tool for lamb diet characterisation. The most satisfactory classification attained, using K-means clustering technique and canonical discriminant analysis, enabled a good resolution of six CO x FR groups of lamb types: Icelandic fed on pasture; British and French grazing; Italian; suckled and Karagouniko concentrates finished; French Lacaune; Ternasco de Aragon. It was concluded that multielement stable isotope analysis may be-considered promising for the reliable evaluation of lamb meat authenticity, in the same way as for wine, fruit juice, honey and dairy products.

J	Gourevitch, B; Le Bouquin-Jeannes, R				Gourevitch, B; Le Bouquin-Jeannes, R			K-means clustering method for auditory evoked potentials selection	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						data reduction; surface recordings; auditory etioked potentials; classification		Surface auditory evoked potentials are generally recorded using a headset of 32, 64 or 128 electrodes, but the quality of the responses is quite heterogeneous on the scalp surface. In some contexts, such as the analysis of auditory evoked potentials recorded in radio-frequency fields, the signal quality is essential, and it appears pertinent to consider only a limited number of electrodes. Therefore, before analysing signals influenced by radio-frequency fields, it is necessary to consider the preliminary step of selecting the channels where auditory activity is strong. This step is often realised by human visual selection and can take a considerable time. In this paper, a simple k-means clustering method is proposed, to select automatically the important channels, and the results are compared with traditional methods of selection. The method detected channels that showed a concordance rate of 86.5% with the visual selection (performed by five individuals) and gave the same final selection (only two extra electrodes in the automatic case). Moreover, the time needed for this automatic selection was 100 times less than that for the visual selection, and also human variability was avoided.

J	Takahashi, S; Anzai, Y; Sakurai, Y				Takahashi, S; Anzai, Y; Sakurai, Y			A new approach to spike sorting for multi-neuronal activities recorded with a tetrode - how ICA can be practical	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						spike sorting; multi-neuronal recording; tetrode; independent component analysis; k-means clustering; overlapping spikes; nonstationarity of waveforms	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VIVO; ACTION-POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; CORTEX; UNIT; VARIABILITY; SEPARATION; SIGNALS; MONKEYS	Multi-neuronal recording with a tetrode is a powerful technique to reveal neuronal interactions in local circuits. However, it is difficult to detect precise spike timings among closely neighboring neurons because the spike waveforms of individual neurons overlap on the electrode when more than two neurons fire simultaneously. In addition, the spike waveforms of single neurons, especially in the presence of complex spikes, are often non-stationary. These problems limit the ability of ordinary spike sorting to sort multi-neuronal activities recorded using tetrodes into their single-neuron components. Though sorting with independent component analysis (ICA) can solve these problems, it has one serious limitation that the number of separated neurons must be less than the number of electrodes. Using a combination of ICA and the efficiency of ordinary spike sorting technique (k-means clustering), we developed an automatic procedure to solve the spike-overlapping and the non-stationarity problems with no limitation on the number of separated neurons. The results for the procedure applied to real multi-neuronal data demonstrated that some outliers which may be assigned to distinct clusters if ordinary spike-sorting methods were used can be identified as overlapping spikes, and that there are functional connections between a putative pyramidal neuron and its putative dendrite. These findings suggest that the combination of ICA and k-means clustering can provide insights into the precise nature of functional circuits among neurons, i.e. cell assemblies.

Here we report a kernel density clustering method for analysing GEP data and compare its performance with the three most widely-used clustering methods: hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering, and multivariate mixture model-based clustering. Using several methods to measure agreement, between-cluster isolation, and within-cluster coherence, such as the Adjusted Rand Index, the Pseudo F test, the r(2) test, and the profile plot, we have assessed the effectiveness of kernel density clustering for recovering clusters, and its robustness against noise on clustering both simulated and real GEP data. Our results show that the kernel density clustering method has excellent performance in recovering clusters from simulated data and in grouping large real expression profile data sets into compact and well-isolated clusters, and that it is the most robust clustering method for analysing noisy expression profile data compared to the other three methods assessed.

In this research, the nonlimiting water range (NLWR), defined as the range of soil water content in which neither water, oxygen, nor MR is limiting for plant growth, was measured on soil samples from three field experiments. Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from an experimental field on Wasco silt loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Torriorthents) amended with dairy manure (25 and 50 ton/ha), sludge composting biosolids/green waste (25 and 50 ton/ha), and a control treatment from Shafter Field Experiment Station, Kern County. Similar samples were collected from a Reiff loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) and Yolo silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) treated with conventional 4-year rotation, conventional 2-year rotation, low-input, and organic farming systems in the Sustainable Agricultural Farming System (SAFS) in Davis, CA. The third set of samples were from a fine sandy soil (mixed, thermic, Typic Haplargid) irrigated with four saline waters with EC values of 0.5, 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 dS m(-1) in a pistachio orchard located at Paramount Farms, Kern County, CA. The core samples were used to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention at - 1500 kPa (wilting point) and - 10 kPa (field capacity) to calculate the available water content and the NLWR. Oxygen diffusion rates (ODRs) were measured on the soil cores after they were equilibrated to field capacity, and MR was measured using an automated mini-penetrometer after the soil was equilibrated to - 1500 kPa. The results showed that organic amendments did not significantly change the ODR, MR, NLWR, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K,). Mean values of MR and ODR were not significantly different in the four agricultural systems either, but soil under organic farming system had a relatively narrow NLWR because less water was retained at field capacity, indicating that the soil surface under this farming system has more large pores. The mean K(s) was significantly higher in conventional 4- and 2-year rotations than in organic and low-input treatments. Increasing irrigation water salinity above 4 dS m(-1) progressively decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity but had relatively little effect on other physical properties. In general, the treatment variables had relatively little effect on the NLWR, ODR, MR, or of surface soils, except for a decrease in K(s) when irrigated with waters with more than 4 dS m(-1).

J	Kim, DS				Kim, DS			Training ratio and comparison of trained vector quantizers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						clustering algorithim; empirically optimal quantizer; training ratio; training sequence; vector quantizer	VORONOI REGIONS; QUANTIZATION; CONVERGENCE; DISTORTION; DESIGN; ALGORITHM; LATTICES	The vector quantizer (VQ) codebook is usually designed by clustering a training sequence (TS) drawn from the underlying distribution function. In order to cluster a TS, We may use the K-means algorithm (generalized Lloyd algorithm) or the self-organizing map algorithm. In this paper, a survey of trained VQ performance is conducted to study the effect of the training ratio on training quantizers. The training ratio, which is defined by the ratio of the TS size to the codebook size, is dependent on the VQ structure. Hence, different VQs may show different training properties, even though the VQs are designed for the same TS. numerical comparison of trained VQs is then conducted in conjunction with deriving their. training ratios. Through the comparison, it is shown that structured VQs can achieve better performance than the full-search scheme if the codebooks are trained by a finite TS. Further, we can derive a design or comparison guideline that maintains equal training ratios in training different VQs.

The trimming is obtained by resorting to trimmed k-means methodology. The analysis always reduces to the examination of real valued curves, even in the multivariate case. As the technique is based on a robust clustering criterium, it is able to handle the presence of different kinds of outliers. An algorithm is proposed to carry out this (computer intensive) method. As with classical k-means, the method is specially oriented to mixtures of spherical distributions. A possible generalization is outlined to overcome this drawback.

J	Pimlott-Kubiak, S; Cortina, LM				Pimlott-Kubiak, S; Cortina, LM			Gender, victimization, and outcomes: Reconceptualizing risk	JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY; TRAUMA; WOMEN; DEPRESSION; VIOLENCE; COMMUNITY; ABUSE; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE	Large-scale studies of gender differences in psychopathological reactions to victimization have focused on posttraumatic stress disorder, overlooking other trauma-related disorders. The present study expands this literature with a contextualized examination of interpersonal aggression exposure and sequelae. Using k-means cluster analysis on a sample of 16,000, the authors identified 8 distinct profiles of exposure to sexual violence, physical assault, stalking, and emotional abuse. Analyses of covariance then suggested links among victimization profile, gender, and mental and physical health. Results revealed no meaningful interactive effects of gender and interpersonal aggression on outcomes, once lifetime exposure to aggressive events was adequately taken into account. These findings argue against theories of female victims' greater vulnerability to pathological outcomes, instead linking risk to exposure history.

The aim of this study was to evaluate K-means-based cluster analysis as a exploratory, data-driven method. The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to extract information without the need for prior knowledge concerning the hemodynamic response function. Two data sets were acquired to illustrate different types of BOLD fMRI response inside tumors: the first set following a respiratory challenge with carbogen, and the second after pharmacological modulation of tumor blood flow using flunarizine. To improve the efficiency of the clustering, a power density spectrum analysis was first used to isolate voxels for which signal changes did not originate from noise or linear drift. The technique presented here can be used to assess hemodynamic response to treatment, and especially to display areas of the tumor with heterogeneous responses. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We have validated the program with an already synthesized three-component combinatorial library of FXR partial agonists characterized by standard computational chemistry descriptors as case study. This has let us analyze the goodness of both the partitioning techniques for space division and all the selection methodologies with respect to representativity in terms of population and space coverage for different selection sizes. Within the chemical space analyzed, both hierarchical clustering and Optimum Binning division strategies are found to be the most advantageous reference space divisions to be used in the subsequent population and space coverage studies. Complete hierarchical clustering appears also to be the preferred selection methodology for both sparse and full array problems. The full array restriction fulfillment can easily be overcome by convenient optimization algorithms that allow optimal reagent selection preserving > 90% of the population coverage.

However, the success of such approach depends on the selection of relevant molecular descriptors and the use of appropriate sampling methods. In the context of pharmaceutical research, the molecular descriptors should be based on physicochemical properties related with the pharmacological behaviour of the compounds. In this sense, the alignment-free GRIND and VolSurf molecular descriptors are promising candidates since they have been successfully used in the modelling of both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. This work describes the use of such descriptors in the diversity sampling of a library of primary amines and compares the results with those obtained in a previous study that used quantum-mechanical descriptors. As in the previous work, principal component (PC) analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality and remove redundant information of the original descriptors, and the compounds were sampled on the basis of k-means clustering on the space of the selected PCs. The results of the present study show that VolSurf and GRIND provide similar quality sampling regarding global features of the molecules such as hydrophilicity, however the topology of the compounds is considered differently. The similarity between particular compounds strongly depends on the original descriptors used. However all the sample selections done in the PC space after k-means clustering provide the same apparent diversity in comparison to the whole dataset. The results indicate that there is no best set of descriptors on a diversity basis. The selection of descriptors must be based on the drug features to be investigated.

This might stem from the fact that correlational methods, in contrast to cluster analysis, do not account for the possibility that a subject presents high scores on more than one dimension simultaneously. We aimed to establish clusters of normal adolescents based on schizotypy dimensions and compare them on neurocognitive, behavioural, and neurodevelopmental markers. Methods: Two hundred seventy normal adolescents from the general population (mean age 13.4, SD=0.72) attending obligatory education were evaluated. Results: A K-means iterative cluster analysis was performed with the Perceptual Aberration, Revised Social Anhedonia and Physical Anhedonia Scales. A forced four-cluster model yielded the following clusters: 'negative schizotypy', 'high or mixed schizotypy', 'positive schizotypy', and 'normal scorers'. Comparisons with ANOVAs showed that 'high schizotypes' performed poorly on neurocognition (Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and Verbal Fluency (FAS)) and obtained the highest teacher ratings (TRF) of behavioural problems. 'Negative schizotypes' had the worst WCST results and more dermatoglyphic abnormalities. Both clusters had more neurological soft signs than 'normal scorers' and 'positive schizotypes'. Conclusions: Our results with community adolescents found the same cluster structure than the previous cluster analytic studies conducted in adult college subjects. Furthermore, we showed differences among them on neurocognitive and malneurodevelopment markers consistent with the adult literature on schizotypy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dembele, D; Kastner, P				Dembele, D; Kastner, P			Fuzzy C-means method for clustering microarray data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Clustering analysis of data from DNA microarray hybridization studies is essential for identifying biologically relevant groups of genes. Partitional clustering methods such as K-means or self-organizing maps assign each gene to a single cluster. However, these methods do not provide information about the influence of a given gene for the overall shape of clusters. Here we apply a fuzzy partitioning method, Fuzzy C-means (FCM), to attribute cluster membership values to genes. Results: A major problem in applying the FCM method for clustering microarray data is the choice of the fuzziness parameter m. We show that the commonly used value m = 2 is not appropriate for some data sets, and that optimal values for m vary widely from one data set to another. We propose an empirical method, based on the distribution of distances between genes in a given data set, to determine an adequate value for m. By setting threshold levels for the membership values, genes which are tigthly associated to a given cluster can be selected. Using a yeast cell cycle data set as an example, we show that this selection increases the overall biological significance of the genes within the cluster.

J	Larson, K; Hartmann, DL				Larson, K; Hartmann, DL			Interactions among cloud, water vapor, radiation, and large-scale circulation in the tropical climate. Part II: Sensitivity to spatial gradients of sea surface temperature	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							EASTERN EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; BOUNDARY-LAYER STRUCTURE; NO EVIDENCE; SST GRADIENTS; INCREASED CO2; MODEL; IRIS; CONVECTION; THERMOSTATS; VARIABILITY	The responses of the large-scale circulation, clouds, and water vapor to an imposed sea surface temperature (SST) gradient are investigated. Simulations compare reasonably to averaged observations over the Pacific, considering the simplifications applied to the model. The model responses to sinusoidal SST patterns have distinct circulations in the upper and lower troposphere. The upper circulation is sensitive to the heating from deep convection over the warmest SST. Stronger SST gradients are associated with stronger longwave cooling above stratus clouds in the subsidence region, stronger lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation, a reduction of the rain area, and larger area coverage of low clouds. A similar SST gradient with a warmer mean temperature produces slightly weaker lower-tropospheric circulation, and slightly reduced low cloud coverage. The outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is not sensitive to the mean SST or the range of the imposed sinusoidal SST gradient. The positive feedbacks of water vapor and decreasing high cloud OLR compensate for the increase in longwave emission with increasing mean temperature in these simulations. As the SST gradient is increased keeping the mean SST constant, the positive high cloud feedback is still active, but the air temperature increases in proportion to the maximum SST in the domain, increasing the clear-sky OLR value and keeping the average OLR constant. The net absorbed shortwave radiation (SWI) is found to be extremely sensitive to the SST gradient. The stronger lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation produces a higher water content in the high and low clouds, increasing the absolute magnitude of the shortwave cloud forcing. A 25% increase in the maximum zonal mass flux of the lower circulation of the 300-K mean, 4-K SST range simulation leads to a 7.4 W m(-2) decrease in SWI. Increasing the mean SST creates a positive feedback in these simulations because of the decrease in the lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation and the resultant decrease in cloud optical depth.

J	Perez-Quezada, JF; Pettygrove, GS; Plant, RE				Perez-Quezada, JF; Pettygrove, GS; Plant, RE			Spatial-temporal analysis of yield and soil factors in two four-crop-rotation fields in the Sacramento Valley, California	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Use of Soil Electrical Conductivity in Precision Agriculture	NOV   08, 2000	MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA				VARIABILITY; CORN	Data were analyzed from two 30-ha laser-leveled commercial fields in the Sacramento Valley, California, for crops grown between 1995 and 1999. Crops were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and corn (Zea mays L.). One of the fields had a wheat-tomato-bean-sunflower rotation while the other had a wheat-tomato-sunflower-corn rotation during the same period. Yield data were collected with a commercial yield monitor, except for tomato yield data, which were collected with an experimental yield monitor. After georeferencing, interpolation, and correction of yield-monitored data, analysis was performed on grid cells representing an area of 20-m square. Soil cores were extracted from the fields on a 60-m square grid. Yield and sand content were both separated into large- and small-scale components by median polish. Persistent large-scale trends in yield, which were consistent with large-scale trends in sand content, were observed. Six 2-yr comparisons via linear regression were performed in each field. Yield of one crop was a poor predictor of yield of another crop grown in another year, but after standardizing and averaging the yields, areas with the same average performance tended to be clustered together spatially. The standardized yields were also analyzed using K-means clustering. This provided a different spatial configuration of clusters from that of the standardized average but also a high level of spatial autocorrelation, which shows that both methods may be helpful in delineating management zones at the scale normally used by growers.

J	Yun, BH; Seo, CH				Yun, BH; Seo, CH			Semantic-based information retrieval for content management and security	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						information retrieval; semantics; content management; security	QUERY EXPANSION	An information retrieval system has to retrieve all and only those documents that are relevant to a user query, even if index terms and query terms are not matched exactly. However, term mismatches between index terms and query terms have been a serious obstacle to the enhancement of retrieval performance. In this article, we discuss automatic term normalization between words and phrases in text corpora and their application to a Korean information retrieval system. We perform three new types of term normalizations: transliterated word normalization, noun phrase normalization, and context-based term normalization. Transliterated words are normalized into equivalence classes by using contextual similarity to alleviate lexical term mismatches. Then, noun phrases are normalized into phrasal terms by segmenting compound nouns as well as normalizing noun phrases. Moreover, context-based terms are normalized by using a combination of mutual information and word context to establish word similarities. Next, unsupervised clustering is done by using the K-means algorithm and cooccurrence clusters are identified to alleviate semantic term mismatches. These term normalizations are used in both the indexing and the retrieval system. The experimental results show that our proposed system can alleviate three types of term mismatches and can also provide the appropriate similarity measurements. As a result, our system can improve the retrieval effectiveness of the information retrieval system.

J	Wang, JH; Rau, JD; Liu, WJ				Wang, JH; Rau, JD; Liu, WJ			Two-stage clustering via neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						clustering; gravitation; k-means; neural networks; quantization	SPATIAL POINT-PROCESSES; COMPUTER VISION; ROBUST; ALGORITHM; FEATURES; VALIDITY	This paper presents a two-stage approach that is effective for performing fast clustering. First, a competitive neural network (CNN) that can harmonize mean squared error and information entropy criteria is employed to exploit the substructure in the input data by identifying the local density centers. A Gravitation neural network (GNN) then takes the locations, of these centers As initial weight vectors and undergoes an unsupervised update process to group the centers into clusters. Each node (called gravi-node) in the GNN is associated with a finite attraction radius and would be attracted to a nearby centroid simultaneously during the update process, creating the Gravitation-like behavior without incurring complicated computations. This update process iterates until convergence and the converged centroid corresponds' to a cluster. Compared to other clustering methods, the proposed clustering scheme is free of initialization problem and does not need to pre-specify the number of clusters. The two-stage approach is computationally efficient and has great flexibility in implementation. A fully parallel hardware implementation is very possible.

J	Yaniv, R; Burshtein, D				Yaniv, R; Burshtein, D			An enhanced dynamic time warping model for improved estimation of DTW parameters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						Baum inequality; dynamic time warping (DTW); hidden Markov model (HMM); speech recognition	WORD RECOGNITION; SPEECH RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; PERFORMANCE	We introduce an enhanced dynamic time warping model (EDTW) which, unlike conventional dynamic time warping (DTW), considers all possible alignment paths recognition as well as for parameter estimation. The model, for which DTW and the hidden Markov model (HMM) are special cases, is based on a well-defined quality measure. We extend the derivation of the For. ward and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs, in order to obtain efficient solutions for the problems of recognition and optimal path alignment in the new proposed model. We then extend the Baum-Welch estimation algorithm for HMMs and obtain an iterative method for estimating the model parameters of the new model based on the Baum inequality. This estimation method efficiently considers all possible alignment paths between the training data and the current model. A standard segmental K-means estimation algorithm is also derived for EDTW. We compare the performance of the two training algorithms,with various path movement constraints, in two isolated letter recognition tasks.

J	Stan, D; Sethi, IK				Stan, D; Sethi, IK			eID: a system for exploration of image databases	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						k-means clustering; multi-dimensional scaling; image annotation; semantic retrieval	RETRIEVAL	The goal of this paper is to describe an exploration system for large image databases in order to help the user understand the database as a whole, discover hidden relationships, and formulate insights with minimum effort. While the proposed system works with any type of low-level feature representation of images, we describe our system using color information. The system is built in three stages: the feature extraction stage in which images are represented in a way that allows efficient storage and retrieval results closer to the human perception; the second stage consists of building a hierarchy of clusters in which the cluster prototype, as the electronic identification (eID) of that cluster, is designed to summarize the cluster in a manner that is suited for quick human comprehension of its components. In a formal definition, an electronic IDentification (eID) is the most similar image to the other images from a corresponding cluster; that is, the image in the cluster that. maximizes the sum of the squares of the similarity values to the other images of that cluster. Besides summarizing the image database to a certain level of detail, an eID image will be a way to provide access either to another set of eID images on a lower level of the hierarchy or to a group of perceptually similar images with itself. As a third stage, the multi-dimensional scaling technique is used to provide us with a tool for the visualization of the database at different levels of details. Moreover, it gives the capability for semi-automatic annotation in the sense that the image database is organized in such a way that perceptual similar images are grouped together to form perceptual contexts. As a result, instead of trying to give all possible meanings to an image, the user will interpret and annotate an image in the context in which that image appears, thus dramatically reducing the time taken to annotate large collection of images.

At the same time, the SVM was compared to several machine learning techniques currently used in this field. The classification task involves predicting the state of diseases, using data obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. SVM outperformed k-means cluster and two artificial neural networks on the whole. It can be concluded that nine samples could be mislabeled from the comparison of several machine learning techniques.

The integration process involves challenges related to issues of uncertainty and imprecision associated with both the data and the process itself. While the handling of uncertainty in geographical information systems (GIS) has been a focal point of research in recent years, the additional challenges of dealing with multiple data sources and types, as well as specific fields of analysis, lead to much more complex situations. In this paper, we present a framework for the use of fuzzy mobile agents to address these additional challenges from the standpoint of large-scale environmental systems.

In order to study changes in liver metabolism during the establishment of such catabolic states, we used a rat skin burn injury model that induces hypermetabolism and muscle wasting. At various times during the first week following the injury, livers were isolated and perfused in a recirculating system under well-defined conditions. We applied a steady-state metabolic flux analysis model of liver metabolism and then used k-means clustering to objectively group together reaction flux time profiles. We identified six distinct groups of reactions that were differentially responsive: (1) pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); (2) amino acid oxidation reactions leading to the formation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates; (3) gluconeogenesis; (4) TCA-cycle and mitochondrial oxidation; (5) lipolysis, beta-oxidation, and ketone body formation; and (6) urea-cycle. Burn injury sequentially upregulated the urea-cycle, the PPP, and the TCA-cycle, in order, while beta-oxidation and gluconeogenesis remained unchanged. The upregulation of the PPP was transient, whereas the rise in urea- and TCA-cycle fluxes was sustained. An ATP balance predicted an increased production of ATP and energy expenditure starting on day 3 post-burn, which correlated with the induction of the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler uncoupling protein-2. We conclude that metabolic profiling using flux analysis and clustering analysis is a useful methodology to characterize the differential activation of metabolic pathways in perfused organs and to identify specific key pathways that are sensitive to a stimulus or insult without making a priori assumptions.

We identify symptom patterns among veterans who believe they suffer from Gulf War-related illnesses and characterize groups of individuals with similar patterns. Methods. A mail survey was completed by 1161 veterans drawn from the Gulf War Health Registry. Results. An exploratory factor analysis revealed 4 symptom factors. A K-means cluster analysis revealed 2 groups: (1) veterans reporting good health and few moderate/severe symptoms, and (2) veterans reporting fair/poor health and endorsing an average of 37 symptoms, 75% as moderate/severe. Those in Cluster 2 were more likely to report having 1 or more of 24 medical conditions. Conclusions. These findings are consistent with previous investigations of symptom patterns in Gulf War veterans. This multisymptom illness may be more fully characterized by the extent, breadth, and severity of symptoms reported.

J	Taylor, JC; Wood, GA; Earl, R; Godwin, RJ				Taylor, JC; Wood, GA; Earl, R; Godwin, RJ			Soil factors and their influence on within-field crop variability, part II: Spatial analysis and determination of management zones	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article								Spatial variation of crop yields was examined in three trial cereal fields in England from 1994 through 1997. The fields were managed with uniform inputs but there were considerable differences in the spatial patterns and magnitudes of variation between fields and seasons. Up to 50% of the yield variation was within the tramline spacing distance (20-24 m) and this appeared to relate to crop management practices rather than underlying soil factors. Longer-range variation generally increased up to field scale but was not constant between seasons. Longer-range variation was more apparent in dry years and was attributable to soil variation. Soil series differences coincided with yield differences in dry years when the soil series differences could be expected to create large differences in soil-water relationships. Soil electrical conductivity, measured by electromagnetic induction (EMI), was investigated as a surrogate for detailed soil coring. Field zones created by EMI also coincided with yield differences and zones were similar to those delineated by soil series with expected differences in soil-water relationships. The EMI observations were found to be a useful and cost-effective surrogate for representing soil variability in fields likely to create yield variations. Subdivision of fields into management zones using multi-variate K-means cluster analysis of historical yield and EMI observations formed an objective basis for targeting soil samples for nutrient analysis and development of site-specific application strategies. The appropriateness of site-specific management has to be assessed annually because magnitude and pattern of variation changes from season to season. (C) 2003, Silsoe Research Institute.

A fixed-point (k-means) algorithm is defined that uses an arbitrary distance function. Finite convergence is proved. A robust distance defined by Boente et al. is selected for applications. Smooth approximations of this distance are defined and suitable heuristics are introduced to enhance the probability of finding global optimizers. A real-life example is presented and commented.

J	Kim, KA; Kim, SJ				Kim, KA; Kim, SJ			Method for unsupervised classification of multiunit neural signal recording under low signal-to-noise ratio	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						mixture of Gaussians; neural spike sorting; projection pursuit; unsupervised classification	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; NETWORK; MODEL	Neural spike sorting is an indispensable step in the analysis of multiunit extraclellular neural signal recording. The applicability of spike sorting systems has been limited, mainly to. the recording of sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, or to the cases where supervised classification can be utilized. We present a novel unsupervised method that shows satisfactory performance even under high background noise. The system consists, of an efficient spike detector, a feature extractor that utilizes projection pursuit based on negentropy maximization (Huber, 1985 and Hyvarinen et al., 1999), and an, unsupervised classifier based, on probability density modeling using mixture of Gaussians (Jain et al., 2000). Our classifier is based on the mixture model with a roughly approximated number of Gaussians and subsequent mode-seeking. It does not require accurate estimation of the number of units present in the recording and, thus, is better suited for use in fully,automated systems. The feature extraction stage leads to better performance than those utilizing principal component analysis and two nonlinear mappings for the recordings from the somatosensory cortex of rat and the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia. The classification method yielded correct classification ratio as high as 95%, for data where it was only 66% when a k-means-type algorithm was used for the classification stage.

J	Takahashi, S; Anzai, Y; Sakurai, Y				Takahashi, S; Anzai, Y; Sakurai, Y			Automatic sorting for multi-neuronal activity recorded with tetrodes in the presence of overlapping spikes	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HIPPOCAMPUS IN-VIVO; ACTION-POTENTIALS; DEPENDENCE; PATTERNS; CORTEX; MEMORY; UNIT; CLASSIFICATION; INTERNEURONS	Multi-neuronal recording is a powerful electrophysiological technique that has revealed much of what is known about the neuronal interactions in the brain. However, it is difficult to detect precise spike timings, especially synchronized simultaneous firings, among closely neighboring neurons recorded by one common electrode because spike waveforms overlap on the electrode when two or more neurons fire simultaneously. In addition, the non-Gaussian variability (nonstationarity) of spike waveforms, typically seen in the presence of so-called complex spikes, limits the ability to sort multi-neuronal activities into their single-neuron components. Because of these problems, the ordinary spike-sorting techniques often give inaccurate results. Our previous study has shown that independent component analysis (ICA) can solve these problems and separate single-neuron components from multi-neuronal recordings. The ICA has, however, one serious limitation that the number of separated neurons must be less than the number of electrodes. The present study combines the ICA and the efficiency of the ordinary spike-sorting technique (k-means clustering) to solve the spike-overlapping and the nonstationarity problems with no limitation on the number of single neurons to be separated. First, multi-neuronal activities are sorted into an overly large number of clusters by k-means clustering. Second, the sorted clusters are decomposed by ICA. Third, the decomposed clusters are progressively aggregated into a minimal set of putative single neurons based on similarities of basis vectors estimated by ICA. We applied the present procedure to multi-neuronal waveforms recorded with tetrodes composed of four microwires in the prefrontal cortex of awake behaving monkeys. The results demonstrate that there are functional connections among neighboring pyramidal neurons, some of which fire in a precise simultaneous manner and that precisely time-locked monosynaptic connections are working between neighboring pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Detection of these phenomena suggests that the present procedure can sort multi-neuronal activities, which include overlapping spikes and realistic non-Gaussian variability of spike waveforms, into their single-neuron components. We processed several types of synthesized data sets in this procedure and confirmed that the procedure was highly reliable and stable. The present method provides insights into the local circuit bases of excitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring neurons.

Dietary preferences may be associated with longevity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and further survival in centenarians. During 1992-1999, we examined the dietary practices of 104 centenarians (29 men and 75 women; mean age, 100.3+/-0.9 y) who lived in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Dietary patterns were classified by k-means cluster analysis. As clinical co-variables, we considered activities of daily living, cognitive function, nutritional status, presence of important disease, gender, and age at the time of the initial survey. Survival data were recorded yearly until 2001, and then tested with Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank statistic. Four dietary patterns were identified: a pattern preferring vegetables (n = 33), a pattern preferring dairy products (n = 26), a pattern preferring beverages (n = 10), and a pattern preferring cereals (n = 35). No clinical variables differed between the four dietary patterns. In 2001, 28 centenarians were still alive. The survival rate for those preferring dairy products was the highest of the four dietary patterns; in particular, being significantly higher than the pattern preferring beverages (p = 0.048). A dietary pattern preferring dairy products was associated with increased survival in Tokyo-area centenarians.

The ratio I-S/I-AS for carbon disulfide becomes unity in a frequency range less than 2 cm(-1) at 292 K meaning that the fluctuation of molecules loses the quantum character and that the usual fluctuation-dissipation theorem cannot be applied to analyze this spectral region. From the results of femtosecond optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy, it is found that the longer the exponential decay time is, the later the exponential decay begins, implying that the microscopic dynamics is directly connected with the macroscopic slowing-down of the fluctuation at low temperatures.

In addition to effective laboratory assays, various computational approaches for the detection of TFBS in promoter regions of coexpressed genes have been developed. The availability of complete genome sequences combined with the likelihood that transcription factors and their cognate sites are often conserved during evolution has led to the development of phylogenetic footprinting(1,2). The modus operandi of this technique is to search for conserved motifs upstream of orthologous genes from closely related species(1,2). The method can identify hundreds of TFBS without prior knowledge of co-regulation or coexpression. Because many of these predicted sites are likely to be bound by the same transcription factor, motifs with similar patterns can be put into clusters so as to infer the sets of co-regulated genes, that is, the regulons. This strategy utilizes only genome sequence information and is complementary to and confirmative of gene expression data generated by microarray experiments. However, the limited data available to characterize individual binding patterns, the variation in motif alignment, motif width, and base conservation, and the lack of knowledge of the number and sizes of regulons make this inference problem difficult. We have developed a Gibbs sampling-based(3) Bayesian motif clustering (BMC) algorithm to address these challenges. Tests on simulated data sets show that BMC produces many fewer errors than hierarchical and K-means clustering methods(4). The application of BMC to hundreds of predicted gamma-proteobacterial motifs(2) correctly identified many experimentally reported regulons, inferred the existence of previously unreported members of these regulons, and suggested novel regulons.

METHODS: H. pylori infection was detected by histology in 209 patients with mild chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG, n=76), severe CAG (n=22), mild intestinal metaplasia (IM, n=22), severe IM (n=58), or dysplasia (DYS, n=31). Serum anti-H. pylori IgG and IgA were double sampled and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assays. 35 clinical presentations were observed and their relationship with H. pylori infection was analyzed by the k-means cluster method. RESULTS: Both IgG and IgA levels in H. pylori positive patients were significantly higher than those negative for H. pylori(P<0.001-0.01). The prevalence of H. pylori was highest in severe IM (84.5 %), and lowest in mild CAG (51.3 %) (P<0.01). They were similar in severe CAG (68.2 %), mild IM (72.7 %), and DYS (67.7 %). In H. pylori positive patients, the IgG levels in severe CAG were significantly higher than those in mild CAG (P<0.01). In H. pylori negative patients, both IgG and IgA levels increased remarkably in severe IM, compared to those in mild IM (P<0.01-0.05). H. pylori infection exhibited no association with patient's gender (62.1 % in males; 71.7 % in females) and age (r=0.0814, P=0.241). The diagnostic accuracy based on 35 clinical presentations was 65.7 %. It could be improved by 5.7 % when only the assemblage of digestive symptoms were engaged, or by 8.6 % when the pathogenic factors, general status and grossoscopy were combined. The diagnostic accuracy could be decreased when only the general symptoms were engaged, or when the pathogenic factors were accompanied with some common digestive symptoms. CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection is a major risk factor for the process from atrophy, IM to DYS of gastric mucosa.

Investigation on the effective assemblages of clinical presentations may provide a better understanding in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment for H. pylori infection.

Several wells were drilled by an Agip-Enel joint venture, with downhole continuous physical properties acquired in each well. The main purpose of this study is to map and describe the spatial variations of the volcanic deposits, in terms of their nature, thickness and in situ physical properties. We apply fuzzy k means classification of the well-logging data available in the wells cored in the San Vito area. Fuzzy set theory provides an approach that quantitatively assigns individuals to physically continuous classes. The optimal number of classes is found by minimization of three mathematical functions, thus reducing subjectivity. The resulting classifications are found (1) to reflect the main lithologies in the San Vito plain, (2) to provide more detail on the geological stratigraphy, allowing a more precise volcanic history, and (3) to differentiate between transition zones and interbedded well-defined deposits. In addition to discriminating between lithologies that have different physical properties, this study gives information on the degree of homogeneity of each lithologic unit, and the range of variation for the measured properties. Finally, using the physical classification of the deposits, we are able to propose a detailed two-dimensional compressional acoustic velocity structure of the studied area.

Design: Cross-sectional cohort survey. Setting: Acute inpatient rehabilitation program in a level I trauma center. Participants: A total of 218 (87%) of 250 consecutive initial admissions who met inclusion criteria and completed interviews. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Alcohol and drug use questionnaires, alcohol problem questions, admission toxicology results, readiness to change, and treatment preference questions. Results: Participants were on average 37 years old, 84% were men, and 82% were white. Four types were identified by using k-means cluster analysis based on preinjury alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, and alcohol dependence. Cluster groups differed on extrinsic variables such as drug use, readiness to change, and interest in treatment or in attending Alcoholics Anonymous. The 4 types corresponded to those with a history of (1) alcohol abuse; (2) alcohol dependence; (3) alcohol dependence in remission, partial remission, or relapsed; and (4) normal or nondrinkers. Conclusion: More effective care may be possible if clinicians match common patient types to specific interventions such as education, motivational interventions, formal substance abuse treatment, and relapse prevention.

Regulation of epididymal structure and function is highly dependent on the ipsilateral testis. At the molecular level, however, few studies have been undertaken to determine which genes are expressed in the epididymis under testicular regulation. The goal of this study was to identify genes for which expression is regulated after orchidectomy, both throughout the epididymis and in a segment-specific manner. Microarrays spotted with 474 rat cDNAs were used to examine gene expression changes over the first 7 d post orchidectomy in the initial segment, caput, corpus, and cauda epididymidis of the adult Brown Norway rat. Using k-means cluster analysis, we show that four patterns of gene expression are activated in each epididymal segment over the first week following orchidectomy. Transient up-regulation of gene expression in the epididymis after orchidectomy is described for the first time. Potential androgen-repressed genes, including Gpx-1, show increased expression in the epididymis after orchidectomy. Several glutathione-S-transferases and calcium-binding proteins decline throughout the epididymis after orchidectomy, indicating that these may be novel androgen-regulated epididymal genes. Other genes coding for metabolism-associated proteins, transporters, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein show segment-specific regulation in the epididymis after orchidectomy. Finally, we describe the expression of the previously uncharacterized heat shock proteins, and apoptosis-associated genes in the epididymis after orchidectomy. Thus, gene expression in the epididymis is differentially affected over time after orchidectomy. These results provide novel insight into androgen-dependent and segment-specific epididymal function.

Methods Analytical as well as new, explorative statistical methods such as natural segmentation (k-means) and predictive modelling algorithms (C4.5) were used to classify the interactions of the individual risk factors for arterial hypertension in a large cohort of subjects. Fifty-five attributes (subject base, sociodemographic, medical history, laboratory data) were obtained from each of the 3547 participants of a community-based health survey. The study subjects, mean age of 41 years, were free of major comorbidity. Results Twenty-five percent of the subjects had at least stage 1 hypertension. No clear linear dependency of risk factors with the diagnosis hypertension could be derived by the analytical statistics. In particular, the mutual amplification of different risk factors towards hypertension could not be revealed by these techniques. Explorative analytics however, uncovered body mass index (BMI) as the main single risk factor associated with hypertension. High predictive accuracy was achieved when combinations of certain risk factors including male gender and age were used. Conclusions In summary, the survey of risk factors for hypertension using explorative analytics yielded high increases for the correct prediction of arterial hypertension. In this cohort, BMI was the single strongest parameter associated with arterial hypertension.

Most significantly, only 22% (3437) of the 15,590 unique Clusters matched 2805 (of 15,200) clusters in the Danio rerio UniGene database, indicating that our EST set is complementary to the existing ESTs in the public database and will be invaluable in assisting the annotation of genes based on the upcoming zebrafish genome sequence. Blast search showed that 7824 of our unique clusters matched 6710 known or predicted proteins in the nonredundant database. A cDNA microarray representing similar to3100 unique zebrafish cDNA clusters has been generated and used to profile the gene expression patterns across six different embryonic stages (cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching). Analysis of expression data using K-means clustering revealed that genes coding for muscle-specific proteins displayed similar expression patterns, confirming that the coordinate gene expression is important for myoienesis. Our results demonstrate that the combination of microarray technology with the zebrafish model system can provide useful information on how genes are coordinated in a genetic network to control zebrafish embryogenesis and can help to identify novel genes that are important for organogenesis.

J	Strehl, A; Ghosh, J				Strehl, A; Ghosh, J			Relationship-based clustering and visualization for high-dimensional data mining	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						cluster analysis; graph partitioning; high dimensional; visualization; retail customers; text mining; web-log analysis	EXPRESSION PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; GRAPHS; EIGENVECTORS; MATRICES; NETWORKS	In several real-life data-mining applications, data reside in very high (1000 or more) dimensional space, where both clustering techniques developed for low-dimensional spaces (k-means, BIRCH, CLARANS, CURE, DBScan, etc.) as well as visualization methods such as parallel coordinates or projective visualizations, are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a relationship-based approach that alleviates both problems, side-stepping the "curse-of-dimensionality" issue by working in a suitable similarity space instead of the original high-dimensional attribute space. This intermediary similarity space can be suitably tailored to satisfy business criteria such as requiring customer clusters to represent comparable amounts of revenue. We apply efficient and scalable graph-partitioning-based clustering techniques in this space. The output from the clustering algorithm is used to re-order the data points so that the resulting permuted similarity matrix can be readily visualized in two dimensions, with clusters showing up as bands. While two-dimensional visualization of a similarity matrix is by itself not novel, its combination with the order-sensitive partitioning of a graph that captures the relevant similarity measure between objects provides three powerful properties: (i) the high-dimensionality of the data does not affect further processing once the similarity space is formed; (ii) it leads to clusters of (approximately) equal importance, and (iii) related clusters show up adjacent to one another, further facilitating the visualization of results. The visualization is very helpful for assessing and improving clustering. For example, actionable recommendations for splitting or merging of clusters can be easily derived, and it also guides the user toward the right number of clusters. Results are presented on a real retail industry dataset of several thousand customers and products, as well as on clustering of web-document collections and of web-log sessions.

In this article, we present a generalized clustering approach for segmentation of microscopic cytological lung cell images. The cluster centroids or representative vectors are generalized and expanded from single vectors to sets of vectors to adaptively fit to the lung cell clustering shapes. Experimental results of the proposed approach for the cytological color lung cell images are provided and compared with those of classical K-means clustering approach.

J	Hockey, PAR; Wilson, WA				Hockey, PAR; Wilson, WA			Reproductive traits of marine terns (Sternidae): evidence for food limitation in the tropics?	OSTRICH			English	Article							CLUTCH SIZE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; ASHMOLES HYPOTHESIS; BREEDING BIOLOGY; FEEDING ECOLOGY; TRADE-OFF; BIRDS; INCUBATION; EGGS; PREDATION	Marine terns breed between 80degreesN and 70degreesS, making them a suitable group for examining links between latitude and reproductive traits. We investigated such traits for 34 taxa in seven genera, using analyses of residuals to correct for effects of e.g. female body mass and egg mass on other life history traits. Both tree- and K-means clustering, based on four traits excluding chick provisioning mode, identified two groups of terns - those that breed on tropical oceanic islands and those that breed along mainland coasts and at temperate islands (>40degrees from the Equator). Among mainland terns, there is a tendency for reduced clutch investment at low latitudes both between and within species. There is no interspecific latitudinal variation in incubation or fledging period of these terns, but intraspecific variation in fledging period (longer in the tropics) has been reported for one species. Tropical island terns, which mostly breed at sites lacking native ground predators, show extreme clutch reduction and lay a single, relatively large egg that has a long incubation period. Fledging periods are also long, despite the fact that these are the only terns to use multiple prey loading or regurgitation to feed their chicks. These patterns are interpreted as responses to low food availability stemming from a combination of low oceanic productivity, high bird densities because of breeding space limitation and localised prey depletion associated with central place foraging.

In this paper, RBFN with local linear functions is developed and applied to mapping nonlinear functions and modeling air pollutant emission. This extended version of the traditional RBFN has a linear function of inputs as a connecting weight, which is functionally equivalent to the first-order Sugeno fuzzy model. There are three kinds of parameters determined through proper training algorithms: the centers and spreads of each radial basis function, and the connection weights. The extended RBFN (ERBFN) is trained by a hybrid learning algorithm, which uses an iterative nonlinear optimization technique to obtain the center and spread of each radial basis function and the least squares method to obtain the connection weights. To avoid capturing a local optimum, the nonlinear parameters are initialized using a modified K-means clustering method, which has cluster-merging characteristic so as to automatically determine the number of basis functions. The proposed ERBFN method was applied to the approximation of three different functional forms and to the modeling of a real process. The results confirm that the proposed methodology gives considerably better performance and shows faster learning in comparison to previous methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, this has not been studied in diabetic populations, despite clear evidence that GI complaints are common in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to describe clustering of GI symptoms among individuals with and without diabetes mellitus, and to describe associations of symptom clustering in diabetes mellitus, with self-reported glucose control and treatment. METHODS: A large population survey (n = 15,000) was used to identify a cohort with diabetes mellitus. Items assessing therapy and quality of glycemic control were included, as were those assessing 16 common GI symptoms. Latent GI symptom factors were extracted by factor analysis and used in a k-means cluster analysis. The latter serves to group individuals according to commonalities in symptom profiles. The association of cluster group membership to glycemic control and diabetic treatment was described by logistic regression. RESULTS: Factor analysis identified four latent symptom factors, which accounted for 69.3% of the total variance. These were labeled Upper GI/Dysmotility, Diarrhea, Constipation, and Vomiting/Nausea. The k-means analysis produced a five-cluster solution, which included a "health" group and four "diseased" groups, each identified by a predominant symptom: Upper GI/Dysmotility symptoms, Nausea/Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Constipation. After adjustment for age and gender, poor glycemic control predicted membership in all disease clusters, when compared separately with the health group. Oral hypoglycemic drugs predicted membership in the Nausea/Vomiting cluster (OR = 5.13) when used alone, and membership in the Nausea/Vomiting (OR = 10.12) and Upper GI/Dysmotility cluster (OR = 10.12) when used in combination with insulin.

Therefore, fine beam RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were acquired in winter and spring 2000 and, 2001 and analyzed for ice cover types. Video footage of the ice conditions on the Peace River was obtained from aerial ice observations that were conducted simultaneously with the image acquisitions. The analysis of, the images was done (i) visually and (ii) using an unsupervised Fuzzy K-means classification. To streamline the process in an operational environment, the unsupervised ice classification was semi-automated. The unsupervised classification broke the data. into seven classes, which represent the major ice cover types observed on the Peace River. The spatial distribution of ice cover types as generated by the ice classification generally coincides well with air-truth information and backscatter, signatures from SAR images. The location of the boundaries between the ice types appears to be accurate, but it may not be precise. The ice maps can be used for ice monitoring, decision-making purposes, or the verification of ice models.

For the first aspect, the GA based k-means-type algorithm (GKMT) is proposed, which combines GA and k-means-type (KMT) to achieve the optimal selection of the training samples and input features simultaneously. By this algorithm, the "singular" samples will be eliminated according to the classification accuracy and the features that facilitate the classification will be enhanced. On the opposite. the useless features will be suppressed and even eliminated. For the second aspect, the hierarchical evolutionary strategy is proposed for the construction and training of the neural network classifier (HENN). This strategy uses the hierarchical chromosome to encode the structure and parameters of the neural network into control genes and parameter genes respectively, designs and trains the network simultaneously. Finally, the experimental study pertained to the fault diagnostics for the rotor-bearing system is given and the results presented show that the proposed evolutionary strategy for the classification problem is feasible and effective.

It is known that both worker and queen hornets parasitized by strepsipterous insects overwinter. The parasitized queens cannot reproduce in the next season and thus the level of parasitism potentially affects the number of colonies to be established in the population. Thus, estimation of the ratio of parasitized queens to the total of parasitized females would be useful for understanding the population dynamics of the hornet. K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that 50 to 85% of individuals were workers in the total of parasitized females during the period. From 8 to 15% of total queens were thought to be sterilized by X. moutoni, a level that would not be expected to have a serious effect on the population dynamics of V analis. Forced hibernation of workers might be considered to be a result of manipulation of the diapause system of the host by the parasite to increase its reproductive success.

J	Hoppner, F; Klawonn, F				Hoppner, F; Klawonn, F			Improved fuzzy partitions for fuzzy regression models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						fuzzy minimum function; fuzzy clustering; fuzzy regression; k-means; Voronoi diagram; Takagi-Sugeno model		Fuzzy clustering algorithms like the popular fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) are frequently used to automatically divide up the data space into fuzzy granules. When the fuzzy clusters are used to derive membership functions for a fuzzy rule-based system, then the corresponding fuzzy sets should fulfill some requirements like boundedness of support or unimodality. Problems may also arise in the case, when the fuzzy partition induced by the clusters is intended as a basis for local function approximation. In this case; a local model (function) is assigned to each cluster. Taking the fuzziness of the partition into account, continuous transitions between the single local models can be obtained easily. However, unless the overlapping of the clusters is very small, the local models tend to mix and no local model is actually valid. By rewarding crisp membership degrees, we modify the objective function used in fuzzy clustering and obtain different membership functions that better suit these purposes. We show that the modification can be interpreted as standard FCM using distances to the Voronoi cell of the cluster rather than using distances to the cluster prototypes. In consequence, the resulting partitions of the modified algorithm are much closer to those of the crisp original methods. The membership functions can be generalized to a fuzzified minimum function. We give some bounds on the approximation quality of this fuzzification. We apply this modified fuzzy clustering approach to building fuzzy models of the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type automatically from data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on beam theory, stating that mechanical properties of a structure depend on both the amount and quality of the constituent materials, we investigated the relationship between whole bone mechanical properties and a set of morphological and compositional traits in femurs of eight inbred mouse strains. K-means cluster analysis revealed that individual femora could be classified reliably according to genotype based on the combination of bone area (tissue amount), moment of inertia (tissue distribution), and ash content (tissue quality). This trait combination explained 66-88% of the interstrain variability in four whole-bone mechanical properties that describe all aspects of the failure process, including measures of brittleness. Stiffness and maximum load were functionally associated with cortical area, while measures of brittleness were associated with ash content. In contrast, work-to-failure was not directly related to a single trait but depended on a combination of trait magnitudes. From these findings, which were entirely consistent with established mechanical theory, we developed a hierarchical paradigm relating the mechanical properties that define bone fragility with readily measurable phenotypic traits that exhibit strong heritability. This paradigm will help guide the search for genes that underlie fracture susceptibility and osteoporosis.

We also propose modifications of the method to reduce the computational load without significantly affecting solution quality. The proposed clustering methods are tested on well-known data sets and they compare favorably to the k-means algorithm with random restarts. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.

Until now, this approach, which allows to explain some classic clustering criteria such as the well-known k-means criteria and to propose general criteria, has been developed to classify a set of objects measured on a set of variables. But, for this kind of data, if most clustering procedures are designated to construct an optimal partition of objects or, sometimes, of variables, there exist others methods, named block clustering methods, which consider simultaneously the two sets and organize the data into homogeneous blocks. In this work, a new mixture model called block mixture model is proposed to take into account this situation. This model allows to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a mixture approach. We first consider this probabilistic model in a general context and we develop a new algorithm of simultaneous partitioning based on the CEM algorithm. Then, we focus on the case of binary data and we show that our approach allows us to extend a block clustering method, which had been proposed in this case, Simplicity. fast convergence and the possibility to process large data sets are the major advantages of the proposed approach.

To better understand potato biology, we have undertaken a survey of the potato transcriptome using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from diverse tissues. A total of 61,940 ESTs were generated from aerial tissues, below-ground tissues, and tissues challenged with the late-blight pathogen (Phytophthora infestans). Clustering and assembly of these ESTs resulted in a total of 19,892 unique sequences with 8,741 tentative consensus sequences and 11,151 singleton ESTs. We were able to identify a putative function for 43.7% of these sequences. A number of sequences (48) were expressed throughout the libraries sampled, representing constitutively expressed sequences. Other sequences (13,068, 21%) were uniquely expressed and were detected only in a single library. Using hierarchal and k means clustering of the EST sequences, we were able to correlate changes in gene expression with major physiological events in potato biology. Using pair-wise comparisons of tuber-related tissues, we were able to associate genes with tuber initiation, dormancy, and sprouting. We also were able to identify a number of characterized as well as novel sequences that were unique to the incompatible interaction of late-blight pathogen, thereby providing a foundation for further understanding the mechanism of resistance.

J	Sohn, SY; Lee, SH				Sohn, SY; Lee, SH			Data fusion, ensemble and clustering to improve the classification accuracy for the severity of road traffic accidents in Korea	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						neural network; decision tree; Dempster-Shafer; Bayesian fusion; bagging; arcing; clustering algorithm	MULTISENSOR	Increasing amount of road traffic in 1990s has drawn much attention in Korea due to its influence on safety problems. Various types of data analyses are done in order to analyze the relationship between the severity of road traffic accident and driving environmental factors based on traffic accident records. Accurate results of such accident data analysis can provide crucial information for road accident prevention policy. In this paper, we use various algorithms to improve the accuracy of individual classifiers for two categories of severity of road traffic accident. Individual classifiers used are neural network and decision tree. Mainly three different approaches are applied: classifier fusion based on the Dempster-Shafer algorithm, the Bayesian procedure and logistic model; data ensemble fusion based on arcing and bagging; and clustering based on the k-means algorithm. Our empirical study results indicate that a clustering based classification algorithm works best for road traffic accident classification in Korea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several methods for data acquisition and analysis were combined to produce a high degree of reliability in recording electrophysiological signals from gastrointestinal and hepatic afferent fibers in the rat. Recordings with low noise were achieved by paralysis of the respiratory muscles and by pinning the nerve to a recording platform. Single unit activity was isolated using principal component (PC) analysis and cluster cutting of data in multi-dimensional space (1-3 PCs). Cluster assignments were determined by a semi-automated approach using the; k-means algorithm. The accuracy of single unit classification was assessed by checking inter-spike intervals (ISIs) to determine the length of the refractory period, and by cross-correlation analysis to assess whether single units were mistakenly split into more than one cluster. These analyses produced up to four isolated single units from each nerve filament (a bundle of nerve fibers), and typically it was possible to further increase yield by recording from several nerve filaments simultaneously using an array of electrodes.

J	Glasbey, CA; Ghazal, P				Glasbey, CA; Ghazal, P			Combinatorial image analysis of DNA microarray features	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION	Motivation: DNA and protein microarrays have become an established leading-edge technology for large-scale analysis of gene and protein content and activity Contact-printed microarrays has emerged as a relatively simple and cost effective method of choice but its reliability is especially susceptible to quality of pixel information obtained from digital scans of spotted features in the microarray image. Results: We address the statistical computation requirements for optimizing data acquisition and processing of digital scans. We consider the use of median filters to reduce noise levels in images and top-hat filters to correct for trends in background values. We also consider, as alternative estimators of spot intensity, discs of fixed radius, proportions of histograms and k-means clustering, either with or without a square-root intensity transformation and background subtraction. We identify, using combinatoric procedures, optimal filter and estimator parameters, in achieving consistency among the replicates of a gene on each microarray. Our results, using test data from microarrays of HCMV, indicate that a highly effective approach for improving reliability and quality of microarray data is to apply a 21 by 21 top-hat filter, then estimate spot intensity as the mean of the largest 20% of pixel values in the target region, after a square-root transformation, and corrected for background, by subtracting the mean of the smallest 70% of pixel values.

We perform, in an iterative fashion, a principal component analysis of the 946 nonbonded interbead distances, followed by two varieties of cluster analyses: hierarchical and k-means clustering. We identify several distinct sets of conformations with reasonably consistent cluster membership. Nonbonded distance constraints are derived for each cluster and are employed within a distance geometry approach to generate many new conformations, previously unidentified by the simulated annealing experiments. Subsequent analyses suggest that these new conformations are members of the parent clusters from which they were generated. Furthermore, several novel, previously unobserved structures with low energy were uncovered, augmenting the ensemble of simulated annealing results, and providing a complete distribution of low-energy states. The computational cost of this approach to generating low-energy conformations is small when compared to the expense of further Monte Carlo simulated annealing runs.

This approach uses a local averaging classifier relying on decision trees, and in case of altered or noisy road regions, a special intelligent detection procedure. The local averaging classifier based on the decision tree provides real-time road/non-road classification. The main idea is that the neighbor feature vectors around the control point are analyzed, and the control point has conditioned feature vector by the decision tree. However, this algorithm performs poorly in case of noisy road regions. To overcome this problem, we use the intelligent detection method for missing road regions. Let us assume that there are two problematic situations in the high ways: in the first one, a lane marking is missing. in the second one, both lane markings are missing. In the first case, we can predict where the other lane marking is, and apply ordinary K-Mean onto that region. In the second case, we split image into six parts. and the ordinary K-Mean is applied onto the most left and right four regions. In the case of rural ways, we also split the image into six parts, and apply ordinary K-Mean like in the second situation of the high ways. The merits of the proposed method are that it provides efficient accurate, and low cost classification in the real-time application.

It is a simple though computationally expensive algorithm, particularly for clustering large hyperspectral images into many categories. Software implementation presents advantages such as flexibility and low cost for implementation of complex functions. However, it presents limitations, such as difficulties to exploit parallelism for high performance applications. In order to accelerate the k-means clustering a hardware implementation could be used The disadvantage in this approach is that any change in the project requires previous knowledge of the hardware design process and can take several weeks to be implemented. In order to improve the design methodology, an automatic and parameterized implementation for hyperspectral images has been developed in a hardware/software codesign approach. An unsupervised clustering technique k-means that uses the Euclidian Distance to calculate the pixel to centers distance was used as a case study to validate the methodology. Two implementations, a software and a hardware/software codesign ones, have been implemented. Although the hardware component operates in 40MHz, being 12.5 times lesser than the software operating frequency (PC), the codesign implementation was approximately 2 times faster than software one.

The primary goal is to assist anomaly detection by preserving spectral uniqueness among the pixels. In order to reduce redundancy among the pixels, adjacent pixels which are spectrally similar are grouped using the k-means clustering algorithm. Representative pixels from each cluster are chosen and passed to the LLE algorithm, where the high dimensional spectral vectors are encoded by a low dimensional mapping. Finally, monochromatic and tri-chromatic images are constructed from the k-means cluster assignments and LLE vector mappings. The method generates images where differences in the original spectra are reflected in differences in the output vector assignments. An additional benefit of mapping to a lower dimensional space is reduced data size. When spectral irregularities are added to a patch of the hyperspectral images, again the method successfully generated color assignments that detected the changes in the spectra.

However, a dynamic cardiac SPECT study involves a number of steps to obtain estimates of physiological parameters of interest. One of the key steps involves the selection of regions of interest. In the past, this has been done manually or by using a semi-automatic method. We propose to use cluster analysis to segment the data to obtain improved parameter estimates. The algorithm consists of two steps: a standard k-means approach followed by a fine-tuning procedure using fuzzy k-means. Computer simulations were used to test the algorithm and to compute bias in kinetic rate parameters with and without the use of fine-tuning. This was followed by performing four canine (two teboroxime and two TI-201) and two patient (one teboroxime and one TI-201) dynamic cardiac perfusion SPECT studies. The short-axis slice image data were used as input for the cluster analysis program as well as for the semi-automatic method. The blood input function was obtained from the cluster analysis algorithm as one of the clusters. The pixel-wise time-activity curves were computed from the fine tuning step as a linear combination of the standard k-means cluster data. All the TACs were fit to a two compartment model. Parametric images of the wash-in rate parameter were obtained and compared to those obtained with the semiautomatic method. Microsphere derived flows were used as a gold standard in the canine studies for comparison. Our results suggest that cluster analysis provides parameter estimates comparable to the semi-automatic method. Moreover, the clustered curves have less noise and yield reasonable fits where with the semi-automatic method the fitting routine sometimes failed to converge. It was also found that the use of clustering required less manual intervention than the semi-automatic method. The use of clustering may help to bring dynamic cardiac SPECT closer to clinical feasibility.

Each registered person is represented by a low-dimensional appearance manifold in the ambient image space. The complex nonlinear appearance manifold expressed as a collection of subsets (named pose manifolds), and the connectivity among them. Each pose manifold is approximated by an affine plane. To construct this representation, exemplars are sampled from videos, and these exemplars are clustered with a K-means algorithm; each cluster is represented as a plane computed through principal component analysis (PCA). The connectivity between the pose manifolds encodes the transition probability between images in each of the pose manifold and is learned from a training video sequences. A maximum a posteriori formulation is presented for face recognition in test video sequences by integrating the likelihood that the input image comes from a particular pose manifold and the transition probability to this pose manifold from the previous frame. To recognize faces with partial occlusion, we introduce a weight mask into the process.

The approach can be used to discover groupings of similar object motions that were observed in a video collection. A finite mixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) is fitted to the motion data using the expectation-maximization (EH) framework. Previous approaches for HMM-based clustering employ a k-means formulation, where each sequence is assigned to only a single HMM. In contrast, the formulation presented in this paper allows each sequence to belong to more than a single HMM with some probability, and the hard decision about the sequence class membership can be deferred until a later time when such a decision is required Experiments with simulated data demonstrate the benefit of using this EM-based approach when there is more "overlap" in the processes generating the data. Experiments with real data show the promising potential of HMM-based motion clustering in a number of applications.

We formulate robust clustering under an information-theoretical framework; mutual information is the underlying concept used in the definition of quantitative measures of agreement or consistency between data partitions. Robustness is assessed by variance of the cluster membership, based on bootstrapping. We propose and analyze a voting mechanism on pairwise associations of patterns for combining data partitions. We show that the proposed technique attempts to optimize the mutual information based criteria, although the optimality is not ensured in all situations. This evidence accumulation method is demonstrated by combining the well-known K-means algorithm to produce clustering ensembles. Experimental results show the ability of the technique to identify clusters with arbitrary shapes and sizes.

The algorithm adopts a master-slave configuration and tries to minimize the total transmission power of master nodes and interference within piconets. The U.S. Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has imposed strict power regulations on the transmission power of UWB devices. To comply with FCC power regulations and to maintain maximum network capacity, we propose an algorithm that selects the nodes with the minimum average distance to neighboring nodes as the master nodes and forms piconets that have the minimum total emission power for a given radio range. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than a random selection algorithm in terms of power emission under all circumstances. The performance of PFA can approach the performance of the optimal k-means algorithm when the radio range is large.

With consideration of the complexity and randomness of traffic system, the linearization smooth of discrete traffic flows is developed to filter stochastic flows by least square approximation, and the,extensive meaning regularity and knowledge of traffic data are-drawn. It segments the time series of traffic flows into linear segments that are well,applied for their shape expression. Then online clustering analysis on the segmented traffic flow time series is conducted step by step with, the similarity threshold and the improved K-Means algorithm to. adapt the characteristics of traffic data. The measure of shape similarity is also proposed in this paper. Effectiveness of this method has been verified by the vector symbolization series of express highway traffic flows. The influencing factors of experimental result are discussed, some research to be taken in the future is proposed.

Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is a memory and compute intensive process, giving rise to area and latency concerns in the way of its implementation for real-time efficient embedded systems. The training schemes for computing the speaker models, such as the expectation maximization are highly iterative and contribute significantly to the overall complexity in the implementation of the system. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the LBG and the K-means algorithm to realize compute efficient training method. Models trained with the LBG algorithm achieves as much as 99.88% of EM accuracy, whilst K-means achieves as much as 99.91% of EM accuracy. Moreover, the EM computational complexity is almost twice that of LBG or K-means. Thus, using LBG and K-means algorithms for training Gaussian mixture speaker models for text-independent speaker verification, we show that, that they deliver comparable performance as the EM algorithm at significantly reduced computational complexity. Thus making them an ideal choice for low-cost applications.

In each iteration of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the size and direction of the movement of a codevector is decided by the overall pair-wise competition between the attraction of each training vector and the repellent force of the corresponding winning codevector. While each training vector only affects the winning codevector in the Generalised Lloyd Algorithm (GLA) [1] strategy, and only the attraction of training vectors are considered in the Fuzzy K-means (FKM) [1] strategy. The competition is measured by the membership function. Simulation results are presented to compare the proposed FRLVQ with GLA and FKM algorithms. It is apparent that FRLVQ has the better quality of codebook design, is very insensitive to the selection of the initial codebook, and relatively insensitive to the choice of learning rate sequences.

Reference [1] created a generalized style classification (GSC) technology that has been used in various studies to decide what funds managers belong to what styles. The GSC technology relies on k-means clustering to group fund manager returns into styles. Since the GSC technology relies on k-means clustering, the number of styles must be known a priori. Conventional techniques can be used to estimate the number of groups/style but they are dependent on various unrealistic assumptions. A new method to estimate the number of styles, first proposed by [13], known as the Gap statistic is adapted to the GSC technology. The approach is used to verify the number of styles in Japanese mutual funds data.

Genetic algorithms (GA) are used as a state sampling tool for the composite generation and transmission system. The GA binary chromosomes are used to represent composite system states. The system hourly load for the year is represented as a multi-state component using k-means clustering technique. Transition rates between the load states are calculated. The conditional probability based method is used to calculate the frequency of sampled failure states using different component transition rates. The GA samples network failure states with the system load assigned its maximum state value. Failure states are then reevaluated with lower load states until a success state is obtained or all load states have been evaluated. Through its fitness function GA is able to trace intelligently the network failure states. Case studies on a sample test system are presented. Results are compared with those obtained by non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation. These results are analyzed to indicate the advantages of the proposed method over other conventional methods.

Based on pairs of auxiliary and primary data, the primary data space is partitioned into Voronoi regions that are maximally homogeneous in terms of auxiliary data. Then only variation in the primary data associated with variation in the auxiliary data influences the clusters. Because the whole primary space is partitioned, new samples can be easily clustered in terms of primary data alone. In experiments, the approach is shown to produce more homogeneous clusters than alternative methods. Two regularization methods are demonstrated to further improve the results: An entropy-type penalty for unequal cluster sizes, and the inclusion of a K-means component to the model. The latter can alternatively be interpreted as special kind of joint distribution modeling where the emphasis between discrimination and unsupervised modeling of primary data can be tuned.

Edges are first detected in term of the high phase congruency in the gray-level image. K-means cluster is used to label long edge lines based on the global color information to estimate roughly the distribution of objects in the image, while short ones are merged based on their positions and local color differences to eliminate the negative affection caused by texture or other trivial features in image. Region growing technique is employed to achieve the final segmentation results. The proposed method unifies edges, both the whole and local color distributions, as well as the spatial information to solve the natural image segmentation problem. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method have been demonstrated by various experiments.

We first review recent supervised Bayesian image segmentation algorithms using wavelet-domain HMMs. Then, a new unsupervised segmentation approach is developed by capturing the likelihood disparity of different texture features with respect to wavelet-domain HMMs. The K-mean clustering is used to convert the unsupervised segmentation problem into a self-supervised process by identifying the reliable training samples. The simulation results on synthetic mosaics and real images show that the proposed unsupervised segmentation algorithm can achieve high classification accuracy that is close to the supervised one.

In our method, a video is expressed as the representative frames extracted by a simple key-frame extraction algorithm applied in a sequential manner. Then those key-frames are put together with little redundancy using a clustering algorithm for video abstraction. In order to evaluate the proposed scheme, the speed of the commonly used k-means algorithm for clustering is compared with that of the proposed method that combines both the SVD and the k-means algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast and effectively summarizes the content of a video with little redundancy.

First, a quad-tree structure is constructed and the input image is partition into blocks at different resolution levels. Texture features are then extracted from each block. Based on the texture features, a hybrid genetic algorithm is employed to perform the segmentation. The crossover operator of traditional genetic algorithm is replaced with k-means clustering method while the mutate and select operators are adopted. In the final step, the boundaries and the segmentation result of the current resolution level are propagated down to the next level to act as contextual constraints and the initial configuration of the next level, respectively.

Tracking is achieved by predicting the object boundary using motion vectors, followed by contour update, using occlusions/disocclusion detection. An adaptive block-based approach has been used for estimating motion between frames. An efficient modulation scheme is used to control the gap between frames used for object tracking. The algorithm for detecting occlusion proceeds in two steps. First, covered regions are estimated from the displaced frame difference. These covered regions are classified into actual occlusions and false alarms using motion characteristics. Disocclusion detection is also performed in a similar manner. The immediate applications of the proposed tracking algorithm are video compression using MPEG-4 and content retrieval based on standards like H.26L. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The smaller the distance is, the greater the similarity is. All the features of each vector have different functions in describing samples. So we can decide different function of every feature by using feature weight learning, that is, introduce feature weight parameters to the distance formula. Feature weight learning can be viewed as a linear transformation for a set of points in the Euclidean space. The numerical experiments applied in K-means clustering prove the validity of this learning algorithm.

It is characterized by a complexity that is significantly lower than the cubic complexity that characterizes the calculation of the eigenvectors of a matrix. It's based on a "clustering of clusters" technique, that combines the use of k-means and spectral clustering. Additionally, this method includes the use of Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering with Axis Smoothing that is shown to improve the separation in the spectral domain for high values of the scaling parameter sigma(2).

K-means algorithm is a widely used partition method in clustering. As the dataset's scale increases rapidly, it is difficult to use K-meansand deal with massive data. An improved K-means algorithm is presented. It can avoid getting into locally optimal solution in some degree, and reduce the probability of dividing one big cluster into two or more ones owing to the adoption of squared-error criterion. The experiments demonstrate that the improved K-means is more stable and more accurate.

However, like most machine learning algorithms, neural networks are adversely affected by sparse training sets, especially with respect to generalization performance. Several approaches to improve generalization performance when only sparse training data are available have been suggested. These include adding noise to training data or to weight updates. One recent method by Karystinos and Pados first clusters the training data and then generates new training data using a probability density function estimated from the clusters. This paper investigates this method further, especially with respect to the sensitivity of the method to the clustering procedure. We investigate the sensitivity to the number of clusters used by the clustering method, the sensitivity to the clustering method (K-Means) itself, and also the use of the minimum differential entropy as an indicator for good cluster choices.

The method uses a k-means clustering technique to assign the data of each class to k groups, then we train the SVM based on a new dataset consist of the central vectors of each group. The value of k is the upper bound of the number of support vector in the class.

Its use in content-based image retrieval is still in its infancy, due to the lack of efficient algorithms for graph matching and graph clustering. Like (vector) data clustering, graph clustering plays a key role in organizing images according to their content. In this paper, we propose a new graph clustering algorithm based on the k-means algorithm. The key elements of the new algorithm are an efficient graph matching algorithm for computing the similarity between two graphs and a new median graph algorithm for computing the median of a set of graphs. Random graphs and a synthetic image database are used to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The digital image watermarking techniques are usually performed in spatial or transform domain. Most of transform-domain watermarking methods are based on Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) and robust to JPEG lossy compression. Recently, digital image watermarking based on another significant lossy compression technique, Vector Quantization (VQ), has appeared, which carries watermark information by codeword indices. It is quite effective, especially for the robustness to VQ compression with the same codebook. We develop a more favorable image watermarking method based on classified VQ in this paper. This technique can achieve excellent embedding performance and extract the watermark without the original image. This original theoretical result is acceptable with experiments that show superiority to some existing VQ-based watermarking algorithms, and the watermarked image is robust to some common signal processing operations.

Tracking is achieved by predicting the object boundary using motion vectors, followed by contour update, using occlusions/disocclusion detection. An adaptive block-based approach has been used for estimating motion between frames. An efficient modulation scheme is used to control the gap between frames used for object tracking. The algorithm for detecting occlusions proceeds in two steps. First, covered regions are estimated from the displaced frame difference. These covered regions are classified into actual occlusions and false alarms using motion characteristics. Disocclusion detection is also performed in a similar manner. The immediate applications of the proposed tracking algorithm are video compression using MPEG-4 and content retrieval based on standards like H.26L. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The questions are classified into ten intension categories using predefined question stemming keywords. The answers in the FAQ database are also clustered using latent semantic analysis (LSA) and K-means algorithm. For FAQ mining, given a query, the question part and answer part in an FAQ question-answer pair is matched with the input query, respectively. Finally, the probabilities estimated from these two parts are integrated and used to choose the most likely answer for the input query. These approaches are experimented on a medical FAQ system. The results show. that the proposed approach achieved a retrieval rate of 90% and outperformed the. keyword-based approach.

The most common clustering methods, e.g. K-means and ISODATA, do not work well for such kinds of datasets. In this work, density estimation techniques and density-based clustering methods are exploited. Density-based clustering is well-known in data mining to classify a data set based on its density parameters, where high density areas are separated by lower density areas, although it can only work with a simple data set in which cluster densities are not very different. Our contribution is to propose the k nearest neighbor (knn) density-based rule for a high dimensional dataset and to develop a new knn density-based clustering (KNNCLUST) for such complex dataset. KNNCLUST is stable, clear and easy to understand and implement. The number of clusters is automatically determined. These properties are illustrated by the segmentation of a multispectral image of a floodplain in The Netherlands.

The classifier can then be used to classify unlabelled instances by predicting their class based on the features presented to the classifier. We present an empirical method of evaluating the learning task involved in object classification based on subsets of features. Also, we present comparisons between three classifiers, decision trees, Euclidean decision tables and K-means. The purpose of the experiments is to show how a classifier can learn from the data and how much of the data is necessary to achieve good levels of learning. Preliminary results show that the accuracy of classifiers is not improved dramatically with the use of more than one half of the number of features.

Clustering analysis, a technique for data mining or data analysis in databases, has been widely applied in various areas. Its purpose is to segment the individuals in the same population according to their characteristics. In this research, an enhanced three-layered self-organizing map neural network, called 31,SOM, is developed to overcome the drawback of the conventional two-layered SOM through sight-inspection after the mapping process. To further verify its feasibility, the proposed model is applied to two common problems: the identification of four given groups of work-part images and the clustering of a machine/part incidence matrix. The experimental results prove that the data that belong to the same group can be mapped to the same neuron on the output layer of the 31 SOM. Its performance in clustering accuracy is good and is also comparable with that of the FSOM, FCM and k-means.

SEDIMENT PROFILE CAMERA	Sediment profile imagery (SPI) is a remote sensing technique that is used for determining whether the marine sediments provide the suitable habitat for benthic (bottom-dwelling) fauna. The SPI technique is based on an inverse periscope that penetrates the seabed and the captured images are analysed in order to evaluate the activity of the resident marine fauna and the overall level of sediment contamination. Although this sediment monitoring technique has been widely used by the marine benthic scientists for several years, SPI analysis is based on a visual qualitative and quantitative evaluation performed by the human operator. Independent tests reveal that this method is affected in terms of sensitivity and reproductibility by the subjectivism of the human operator. This paper describes the development of a color-based image processing technique that is applied to decide if the imaged sediment contains an oxidised layer and to detect its area and position within the image. A number of experimental results are presented and discussed.

The classic K-means clustering algorithm is a deterministic search and may terminate in a locally optimal clustering. In this paper, a genetic K-means clustering algorithm, called GKMCA, for clustering in gene expression datasets is described. GKMCA is a hybridization of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the iterative optimal K-means algorithm (IOKMA). In GKMCA, each individual is encoded by a partition table which uniquely determines a clustering, and three genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) and an IOKM operator derived from IOKMA are employed.

In this paper, concepts of combinatorial heuristic optimization axe considered for approaching the MSSC: An iterated local search (ILS) approach is proposed which is capable of finding (near-)optimum solutions very quickly. On gene expression data resulting from biological microarray experiments, it is shown that ILS outperforms multi-start k-means as. well as three other clustering heuristics combined with k-means.

The author developed another variation in this family K-Harmonic Means (KHM). It has been demonstrated using a small number of "benchmark" datasets that KHM is more robust than K-means and EM. In this paper, we compare their performance statistically. We run K-means, K-Harmonic Means and EM on each of 3600 pairs of (dataset, initialization) to compare the statistical average and variation of the performance of these algorithms. The results axe that, for low dimensional datasets, KHM performs consistently better than KM, and KM performs consistently better than EM over a large variation of clustered-ness of the datasets and a large variation of initializations. Some of the reasons that contributed to this difference are explained.

In the substitution process, each instance containing missing values is compared with complete instances, and the closest instance is used to assign the attribute missing value. We evaluate this method in simulations performed in four datasets that are usually employed as benchmarks for data mining methods - Iris Plants, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes and Wine Recognition. First, we consider the substitution process as a prediction task. In this sense, we employ two metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan) to simulate substitutions both in original and normalized datasets. The obtained results were compared to those provided by a usually employed method to perform this task, i.e. substitution by the mean value. Based on these simulations, we propose a substitution procedure for the well-known K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Then, we perform clustering simulations, comparing the results obtained in the original datasets with the substituted ones. These results indicate that the proposed method is a suitable estimator for substituting missing values, i.e. it preserves the relationships between variables in the clustering process. Therefore, the proposed Nearest-Neigh or Method is an appropriate data preparation tool for the K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

Inadequacy of such algorithms stems from Gaussian distribution assumption for the class-component densities, which is only an assumption rather than a demonstrable property of natural spectral classes. In this paper, we present an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based approach for unsupervised classification of multi/hyperspectral imagery. ICA employed for a mixture model, estimates the data density in each class and models class distributions with non-Gaussian structure (i.e. leptokurtic or platykurtic p.d.f.), formulating the ICA mixture model (ICAMM). It finds independent components and the mixing matrix for each class, using the extended informationmaximization learning algorithm, and computes the class membership probabilities for each pixel. We apply the ICAMM for unsupervised classification of images from a multispectral sensor - Positive Systems Multi-Spectral Imager, and a hyperspectral sensor - Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Four feature extraction techniques: Principal Component Analysis, Segmented Principal Component Analysis, Orthogonal Subspace Projection and Projection Pursuit have been considered as a preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality of the hyperspectral data. The results demonstrate that the ICAMM significantly outperforms the K-means algorithm for land cover classification of remotely sensed images.

K-means clustering is used to implement an automated algorithm for the assignment of pixels in the image to cell and non-cell categories. Cell pixels are subsequently classified into carcinoma and normal categories through the use of a feed-forward ANN computed with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno training algorithm. Inputs to the ANN consist of principal component scores computed from Fourier filtered absorbance data. A grid search optimization procedure is used to identify the optimal network architecture and filter frequency response. Data from three images corresponding to normal cells, carcinoma cells, and a mixture of normal and carcinoma cells are used to build and test the classification methodology. A successful classifier is developed through this work, although differences in the spectral backgrounds between the three images are observed to complicate the classification problem.

This article presents a performance comparison of four neural and fuzzy paradigms (multilayer perceptrons, radial basis function networks, NEFCLASS systems, and classifying fuzzy-k-means) applied to misuse detection on the basis of TCP and IP header information. As an example, four different attacks (Nmap, Portsweep, Dict, Back) will be detected utilising evaluation data provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The best overall classification results (99.42%) can be achieved with radial basis function networks, which model hyperspherical clusters in the feature space.

This task can be formulated as an optimization problem, namely the minimization of the total distance between the signal and the code vectors. In this paper, we formulate VQ as a constrained binary integer programming problem by eliminating the code vectors, where the constraints that partition the signal space are linear. We propose a two dimensional Gradient Network to solve this problem. The performance of this solution method is tested on image compression applications and the results are compared with the ones obtained by the well-known k-means algorithm.

Navigation patterns were then analyzed using the Pathfinder algorithm and the k-means clustering algorithm to group navigation patterns into clusters. The patterns in the clusters helped understand the kinds of paths that students take, which informed the design of conditions for adaptivity.

Therefore a warning system for air pollution episodes is widely needed to minimize negative health effects. However the forecasting of air pollution episodes has been observed to be problematic partly due their rareness and short-term nature. The research presented here aims to evaluate different neural network based models for forecasting urban air pollution (NO2) hourly time series and particularly the episode peaks. The performances of three multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models namely basic MLP and two hybrid models were compared by calculating several statistical indicators. In the hybrid models evaluated here, training data set was clustered to several air quality episodes using the k-means (KM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithms and then several MLP models were applied to the clustered data, each one representing one cluster. The results showed that the hybrid models have some advantages over a basic MLP model in the forecasting air quality episodes, but the performance achieved also show that architectural issues cannot solely solve the model performance problems.

If the vibrometry sensor has a high enough sampling rate, an accurate estimate of the surface vibration is measured. For vehicles with running engines, an automatic target recognition algorithm can use these measurements to produce identification estimates. The level of identification possible is a function of the distinctness of the vibration signature. This signature is dependent upon many factors, such as engine type and vehicle weight. In this paper, we present results of using data mining techniques to assess the identification potential of vibrometry data. Our technique starts with unlabeled vibrometry measurements taken from a variety of vehicles. Then an unsupervised clustering algorithm is run on features extracted from this data. The final-step is to analyze the produced-clusters and determine if physical vehicle characteristics can be mapped onto the clusters.

Methods such as hierarchical clustering and the K-means method are convenient and competitive first choices off the shelf for the scientist. Gaussian mixture modelling is another popular but computationally expensive clustering strategy. especially when the data are high-dimensional. We propose to first conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) or correspondence analysis (CA) for dimension reduction, and then fit Gaussian mixtures to the data projected to the several major PCA or CA directions. Two technical difficulties of this approach are: (a) the selection of a subset of the PCA factors that are informative for clustering, and (b) the selection of a proper transformation for each factor. We propose a Bayesian formulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo strategies that overcome the two difficulties and examine the performances of the new method by both simulation studies and real applications in molecular imaging analysis and DNA microarray analysis.

A core is a dense region in the high-dimensional space that, for example, can be represented by its most typical observation, by its centroid or, more generally, by assigning weight functions to the observations. Well-known cluster analysis techniques like the partitional K-Means or the hierarchical Ward axe useful for discovering partitions or hierarchies in the underlying data. Here these methods axe generalised in two ways, firstly by using weighted observations and secondly by allowing different volumes of clusters. Then a more general K-Means approach based on pair-wise distances is recommended. Simulation studies are carried out in order to compare the new clustering techniques with the well-known ones. Moreover, a successful application is presented. Here the task is to discover clusters with quite different number of observations in a high-dimensional space.

We use Csiszar's phi-divergence between the given two-way distribution and the independence case with the same margins. This includes the classical chi(2) measure, Kullback-Leibler's discriminating information, and variation distance. By using the general theory of 'convexity-based clustering criteria' (Bock 1992, 2002a, 2002b) we derive a k-means-like clustering algorithm that uses 'maximum support-plane partitions' (in terms of likelihood ratio vectors) in the same way as classical SSQ clustering uses 'minimum-distance partitions'.

It is combination of the well known EM algorithm and a recently proposed vector quantization method called LBG-U. By using LBG-U to initialize the centers of the mixture components we were able to achieve better density estimates than with randomly initialized centers or with centers initialized by traditional LBG (a.k.a. batch k-Means). The empirical study performed two (of three) investigated data sets also indicated that the variance of the results for the new method is significantly lower than for the other two methods. Therefore our novel approach makes estimations from different initializations more consistent.

We evaluated five methods of comparing repertoires of `codas', short repeated patterns of clicks, recorded from sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) groups. Three of the methods involved classification of codas - human observer classification, k-means cluster analysis using Calinski and Harabasz's (1974) criterion to determine k, and a divisive k-means clustering procedure using Duda and Hart's (1973) criterion to determine k. Two other methods used multivariate distances to calculate similarity measures between coda repertoires. When used on a sample coda dataset, observer classification failed to produce consistent results. Calinski and Harabasz's criterion did not provide a clear signal for determining the number of coda classes (k). Divisive clustering using Duda and Hart's criterion performed satisfactorily and, encouragingly, gave similar results to the multivariate similarity measures when used on our data. However, the relative performance of the k-means techniques is likely data dependent, so one method is not likely to perform best in all circumstances. Thus results should be checked to ensure they extract logical clusters. Using these techniques concurrently with multivariate measures allows the drawing of relatively robust conclusions about repertoire similarity while minimising uncertainties due to questionable validity of classifications.

J	Otu, HH; Sayood, K				Otu, HH; Sayood, K			A divide-and-conquer approach to fragment assembly	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DNA-SEQUENCE; ALGORITHMS	Motivation: One of the major problems in DNA sequencing is assembling the fragments obtained by shotgun sequencing. Most existing fragment assembly techniques follow the overlap-layout-consensus approach. This framework requires extensive computation in each phase and becomes inefficient with increasing number of fragments. Results: We propose a new algorithm which solves the overlap, layout, and consensus phases simultaneously. The fragments are clustered with respect to their Average Mutual Information (AMI) profiles using the k-means algorithm. This removes the unnecessary burden of considering the collection of fragments as a whole. Instead, the orientation and overlap detection are solved efficiently, within the clusters. The algorithm has successfully reconstructed both artificial and real data.

Our intensity distribution re-binning method is based on the K-means clustering algorithm as opposed to the generally used equidistant binning method. K-means clustering is a binning method with a variable size for each bin which is adjusted to achieve a natural clustering. Furthermore, a shading correction method is applied to reduce the effect of intensity inhomogeneities in MR images. Registering clinical shading corrected MR images to PET images using our method shows that a significant reduction in computational time without loss of accuracy as compared to the standard equidistant binning based registration is possible.

The ideal structural formulas for sI and sII are, respectively, S2L6 . 46H(2)O and S16L'(8) . 136H(2)O, where S denotes a polyhedral cage with 20 vertices, L a 24-cage, and L' a 28-cage. The space-filling polyhedral cages are defined by the oxygen atoms of the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules. Collectively, the mean cage volume ratio is 1.91 : 1.43 : 1 for the 28-cage : 24-cage : 20-cage, which correspond to equivalent sphere radii of 4.18, 3.79, and 3.37 Angstrom, respectively. At 100 K, mean polyhedral volumes are 303.8, 227.8, and 158.8 Angstrom(3) for the 28-cage, 24-cage, and 20-cage, respectively. In general, the 20-cage volume for a sII is larger than that of a sI, although trimethylene oxide is an exception. The temperature dependence of the cage volumes reveals differences between apparently similar cages with similar occupants. In the case of trimethylene oxide hydrate, which forms both sI and sII, the 20-cages common to both structures contract quite differently. From 220 K, the sII 20-cage exhibits a smooth monotonic reduction in size, whereas the sI 20-cage initially expands upon cooling to 160 K, then contracts more rapidly to 10 K, and overall the sI 20-cage is larger than the sII 20-cage. The volumes of the large cages in both structures contract monotonically with decreasing temperature. These differences reflect reoriented motion of the trimethyelene oxide molecule in the 24-cage of sI, consistent with previous spectroscopic and calorimetric studies. For the 20-cages in methane hydrate (sI) and a mixed methane-ethane hydrate (sII), both containing methane as the guest molecule, the temperature dependence of the 20-cage volume in sII is much less than that in sI, but sII is overall larger in volume.

Based on high order statistic, ICA learns both ICA filters and independent components at the same time. The proposed method firstly generates ICA filter by adopting the fast ICA algorithm from the KOMPSAT full scene and secondly classifies projected texture features under the unsupervised manner on the independent feature space. As there exist some finless texture areas on the gray KOMPSAT image, we organize new feature vector composed of large feature values and a normalized mean value of pixels in the window K-means clustering algorithm is used for classifying those new feature vectors. The proposed classification method shows sufficient performance for the KOMPSAT panchromatic image with 6.6m ground sampling distance (GSD).

The proposed method is based on: image splitting in homogeneous areas, combined color/gray and texture based feature vector, K-mean classification applied to all sub-images, and a nearest class based merging. The proposed algorithm is designed for intensity or color images. Another characteristic of this algorithm is that it has two parallel procedures, namely, lane detection for high ways exploiting the presence of lane markings and lane detection for rural ways. The main problem of the existing methods is their inability to exactly discriminate road and unroad regions due to road wearing out, shadow, tire skid marks, and puddles. By the image splitting in homogeneous sub images and by applying the classification on these sub images the accuracy can be improved and the overall classification time can be saved. For the splitting phase the experience has shown that the upper part of the image corresponds to the very far road parts, and that road percentage in the upper half image is small. Therefore we will focus our attention only on the lower half image. We select the best splitting scheme based on experiments on many road images. For the classification we use the K-mean applied on a feature vector combining color/grey features with texture features extracted by the Gabor jet. For the reconstruction of the road region, a road region merging, based on nearest road classes and reference feature vector, is performed. The forward and backward method is used for detection of the road region borders. The connection of the road border edges, finally, is done using Kalman filter or Bresenham line drawing.

We need effective intrusion detection systems to protect our computers from these unauthorized or malicious actions. Traditional instance-based learning methods for Intrusion Detection can only detect known intrusions since these methods classify instances based on what they have learned They rarely detect the intrusions that they have not learned before. In this paper we present a clustering heuristic for intrusion detection, called Y-means. This proposed heuristic is based on the K-means algorithm and other related clustering algorithms. It overcomes two shortcomings of K-means: number of clusters dependency and degeneracy. The result of simulations run on the KDD-99 data set shows that Y-means is an effective method for partitioning large data space. A detection rate of 89.89% and a false alarm rate of 1.00% are achieved with Y-means.

The fundamental advantages of using multifractal measures include normalization and a very high compression ratio of a signature of the traffic, thereby leading to faster implementations, and the ability to add new traffic classes without redesigning the traffic classifier. The variance fractal dimension trajectory is used to provide a multifractal "signature" for each type of traffic over its duration, and the modelling of its statistical histograms provides further compression and generalization. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and the k-means clustering algorithm is used to determine the number of classes in the multifractal signatures. A probabilistic neural network is then trained with these signatures, and its performance on classifying unknown traffic is used to indicate the most likely number of classes in the data.

Examples of such applications include web applications, request routing in peer-to-peer overlay network, and distributed computing applications. In this paper, we present and formulate the internet host clustering problem. Leveraging previous work on internet host distance measurement, we propose two hierarchical clustering techniques to solve this problem. The first technique is a marker based hierarchical partitioning approach. The second technique is based on the well known K-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated these two approaches in simulation using a representative Internet topology generated with the GT-ITM generator for over 1,000 hosts. Our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithmic clustering approaches effectively identify clusters with arbitrary diameters.

It is shown how PSO can be used to find the centroids of a user specified number of clusters. The algorithm is then extended to use K-means clustering to seed the initial swarm. This second algorithm basically uses PSO to refine the clusters formed by K-means. The new PSO algorithms are evaluated on six data sets, and compared to the performance of K-means clustering. Results show that both PSO clustering techniques have much potential.

It is inspired from the self-assembling behavior observed in real ants where ants progressively become attached to an existing support and then successively to other attached ants. The artificial ants that we have defined will similarly build a tree. Each ant represents one data. The way ants move and build this tree depends on the similarity between the data. We have compared our results to those obtained by the k-means algorithm and by AntClass on numerical databases (either artificial, real, or from the CE.R.I.E.S.). We show that AntTree significantly improves the clustering process.

Large image databases often store the images in compressed format, JPEG for example. This paper examines the algorithms of direct extraction of low level features from compressed images, working with two different clustering techniques. Results indicate that a K-means clustering algorithm has the advantage of a shorter searching time, whereas an Isodata clustering algorithm can have a higher accuracy rate.

CIXL2 is a new crossover operator, based on obtaining the statistical features of the best individuals of the population. These features are used as virtual parents for the crossover operator. Due to the permutation problem of neural network coding that negatively affects the crossover operator, we have adopted a novel approach. Crossover is made at node level. Instead of performing crossover over two whole networks, we perform crossover over two nodes. We present here the adaptation of two crossover methods: CIXL2 and BLX-a. All the nodes of the best networks axe clustered, by means of a k-means algorithm, and a redefinition of the operators is carried out using the obtained clusters. Each node is mated within the cluster where it belongs.

Consideration of a spatial dimension becomes important when data either refer to specific locations and/or have significant spatial dependence which needs to be considered if meaningful patterns are to emerge. For point data there are two main groups of approaches. One stems from traditional statistical techniques such as k-means clustering in which every point is assigned to a spatial grouping and results in a spatial segmentation. The other broad approach searches for 'hotspots' Which can be loosely defined as a localised excess of some incidence rate. Not all points are necessarily assigned to clusters. This paper presents a novel variable resolution approach to cluster discovery which acts in the first instance to define spatial concentrations within the data thus allowing the nature of clustering to be defined. The cluster centroids are then used to establish initial cluster centres in a k-means clustering and arrive at a segmentation on the basis of point attributes. The variable resolution technique can thus be viewed as a bridge between the two broad approaches, towards knowledge discovery in mining point data sets. Applications of the technique to date include the mining of business, crime, health and environmental data.

Mining this data can produce new insights into weather, climatological and environmental trends that have significance both scientifically and practically. This paper discusses the challenges posed by earth science databases and examines the use of fuzzy K-Means clustering for analyzing such data. It proposes the extension of the fuzzy K-Means clustering algorithm to account for the spatio-temporal nature of such data. The paper introduces an unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithm, based on the fuzzy K-Means and defines a cluster validity index which is used to determine an optimal number of clusters. It is shown experimentally that the algorithms are able to identify and preserve regions of meteorological interest.

Many heuristic algorithms have been applied to the clustering problem, which is known to be NP Hard. Genetic algorithms have been used in a wide variety of fields to perform clustering, however, the technique normally has a long running time in terms of input set size. This paper proposes an efficient genetic algorithm for clustering on very large data sets. The genetic algorithm uses the most time efficient traditional techniques along with preprocessing of the input data set. We test our algorithm on both artificial and real data sets, both of which are of large size. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the k-means algorithm in terms of running time as well as the quality of the clustering.

The aim of the work is to investigate how the study of the P-wave morphology may assess any clustering algorithm in separating patients with AF risk from healthy subjects. The clustering is done by the k-means algorithm and using a new method: the Integrated Shape Averaging (ISA). According to the results, the method was able to separate patients with AF risk from safety ones with 75 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity on 40 recordings. Furthermore, two families of P-wave patterns were characterized among the patients with AF risk and probably corresponding to electrical manifestations of conduction defects in the left or the right atrium.

The constrained optimisation formulation relates both second and third-order statistical parameters of the image with the AR model formulation. The k-means algorithm is applied to sets of AR model coefficients obtained by the proposed method in block-by-block process.

This paper deals with the generation of clusters of relevant words from E-mail texts. Our approach consists of the application of text mining techniques and, later, data mining techniques, to obtain related concepts extracted from sent and received messages. We have developed a new clustering algorithm based on neighborhood, which takes into account similarity values among words obtained in the text mining phase. The potential of these applications is enormous and only a few companies, mainly large organizations, have invested in this project so far, taking advantage of employees's knowledge in future decisions.

In PART I of the paper, the correlation criteria showed their capability to indicate various changes to the structure's state. PART 2, presented here, develops the methodology of decision theory to identify precisely all of the structure states. Although, the statistical approach can be used for classification, interpreting the information is difficult. Neural network techniques. have been proven to possess many advantages for classification due to their learning ability and good generalization. In this paper, the radial basis function neural network is applied for function approximation and recognition. The key idea is to partition the input space (the indicators of the correlation criteria) into a number of subspaces that are in the form of hyper spheres. Then, the widely used k-mean clustering algorithm was selected as a logical approach to detecting the structure states. A bookshelf structure, with measured frequency responses from 24 accelerometers was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The results show the successful classification of all structure states, for instance, the undamaged and damage states, damage locations and damage levels, and the environmental variability.

According to our observation on real data, the distribution of attributes with respect to information gain is very sparse because only a few attributes are major discriminating attributes where a discriminating attribute is an attribute, by whose value we are likely to distinguish one tuple from another. In this paper, we propose an efficient decision tree classifier for categorical attribute of sparse distribution. In essence, the proposed Inference Based Classifier (abbreviated as IBC) can alleviate the "overfitting" problem of conventional decision tree classifiers. Also, IBC has the advantage of deciding the splitting number automatically based on the generated partitions. IBC is empirically compared to C4.5, SLIQ and K-means based classifiers. The experimental results show that IBC significantly outperforms the companion methods in execution efficiency for dataset with categorical attributes of sparse distribution while attaining approximately the same classification accuracies. Consequently, IBC is considered as an accurate and efficient classifier for sparse categorical attributes.

One of the problems is that the results depend heavily on initial values and criterion to combine clusters. In this investigation, we propose a new method to avoid this deficiency. Here we assume there exists aspects of local regression in data. Then we develop our theory to combine clusters using F values by regression analysis as criterion. We examine experiments and show how well the theory works.

A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Well-known are two types of the similarity join, the distance range join where the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest point query or k-distance join which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we propose an important, third similarity join operation called k-nearest neighbor join which combines each point of one point set with its k nearest neighbors in the other set. We discover that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbor classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. Our list of possible applications includes standard methods for all stages of the KDD process including preprocessing, data mining, and postprocessing. Thus, our method is turbo charging the complete KDD process.

A fundamental tool in such document analysis tasks is a list of so-called 'stop' words, called a 'stoplist'. A stoplist is a specific collection of so-called 'noise' words, which tend to appear frequently in documents, but are believed to carry no usable information which would aid learning tasks, and so the idea is that the words in the stoplist are removed from the documents concerned before processing begins. It is well-known that the results of document classification experiments (for example) are invariably considerably improved when a stoplist is employed. Current stoplists in regular use are, however, rather outdated. We have explored this claim in recent work which produced new stoplists based on word-entropy over modem collections of documents. In this work we introduce the notion of optimising a stoplist, and use stochastic search in conjunction with k-means clustering to converge on stoplists which lead to better performance on certain tasks than any previously published.

However, it is not necessarily guaranteed to group the same types (classes) of objects together. In such cases, some supervision is needed to partition objects which have the same class label into one cluster. This paper demonstrates how the popular k-means clustering algorithm can be profitably modified to be used as a classifier algorithm. The output field itself cannot be used in the clustering but it is used in developing a suitable metric defined on other fields. The proposed algorithm combines Simulated Annealing and the modified k-means algorithm. We also apply the proposed algorithm to real data sets, which result in improvements in confidence when compared to C4.5.

The method uses three main elements: adaptive image splitting, sub-image level classification and homogeneity based merging. The classification is carried out on the resulting sub-images using a K-mean. After classification through a merging process the classified road and unroad classes are grouped into road and unroad regions, respectively. A forward and backward method is used to detect borders of the road region after grouping. Finally, we use the Kalman filter and the Bresenhent line drawing to connect the border pixels.

We then apply these metrics to data originating from a retailer who operates both an e-shop and a number of traditional stores. We focus in particular on the analysis of k-Means session clusters exhibiting an interest in offline purchases. Web usage metrics measuring the success of Web sites have been proposed before. In the domain of Web merchandizing, success is measured eventually by the number of purchases accomplished. Basic statistics such as conversion and traffic have been proposed to quantify this notion of success. However, when it comes to retailers with multiple distribution channels, there is a definite lack of standard metrics based on web log and transaction data. This paper tries to remedy this void.

However, natural resource data are not available to elucidate the threat. What is required is information on stratigraphy and spatial location and quality (i.e. low, intermediate and high salinity) of groundwater. Electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments have been used successfully to obtain this information because they measure bulk electrical conductivity (ECa), which is a function of clay content. mineralogy, salinity and moisture. In this paper, we show how data collected from an EM survey can be used to infer this information in the cotton growing area of the lower Namoi valley, Australia. The survey involved taking EM34 measurements at three coil spacings in the horizontal mode of operation (i.e. 10, 20 and 40 m). In all 1869 locations were visited on an approximate 1-km grid. In order to objectively classify the ECa data into natural resource management units, we used fuzzy k-means (FKM). The classes obtained were subsequently mapped using a method that ensured summation of class membership values to unity and using local ordinary kriging. The use of a confusion index highlighted areas where the collection of additional information may be appropriate. Using fuzzy linear discriminant analysis we found that measurements obtained at the 10 m coil spacing reflect the shallow stratigraphy and physiography, whilst the 40 m coil spacing clearly differentiated parts of the clay plain underlain by saline aquifers. We conclude that the use of EM34 data and fuzzy k-means provide a good and non-destructive approach to representing the lower Namoi valley landscape. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The relevance of these for episodic visceral pain is unknown. Our aim was to replicate conceptually the taxonomy in patients with episodic visceral pain. Patients with chest pain and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD; n = 25), coronary artery (CAD; n = 20), or with chest pain but without either reflux or coronary artery disease (non-cardiac chest pain - NCCP; n = 23) were assessed using several standard affective and cognitive measures relevant to pain. Differences between the diagnostic groups were explored. K-means cluster analysis broadly replicated the three groups found in previous research but the 'interpersonally distressed' group had few members. An additional cluster analysis suggested a more parsimonious solution for the sample was a two-cluster one, which approximated to the 'adaptive coper and 'dysfunctional' profiles. Membership of both the three- and two-cluster profiles was not associated with membership of specific diagnostic category.

A more general k-means clustering procedure is developed that is suitable for use with very large datasets, such as arise in data mining and survey analysis. An exact assignment test guarantees that the algorithm will converge, and the detection of outliers allows the densest regions of the sample space to be mapped by tessellations of tightly-specified spherical clusters. A summary tree is obtained for the resulting k-cluster partition.

For the research, a vector of descriptive variables included in the state statistical reports was used. Their normalised values were applied for evaluation of the manufacturing branches. The attractiveness of individual branches on the particular levels of manufacturing sector (section D in NACE - Nomenclatures des Activitiees de Communite Europeene) was determined. On the level of divisions and groups clusters were obtained by k-means method. Additionally the homogeneity of divisions was examined. On the level of class individual variables have been combined into composite indicator, which has become the evaluation criterion. Finally the ranking of manufacturing branches was made.

J	Rojas, W				Rojas, W			Multivariate analysis of genetic diversity of Bolivian quinoa germplasm	FOOD REVIEWS INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						Andean crop; quinoa; genetic variability; germplasm; multivariate methods	PATTERN; WILLD	To determine the genetic diversity of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), the crop's morphological traits and agronomic performance were evaluated during 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, using germplasm preserved in Bolivia and IBPGR descriptors as modified by the Fundacion PROINPA's Quinoa Project. Three multivariate methods were used to analyze diversity, allowing sets of individuals to be described and grouped, while considering multiple characteristics and their interrelationships. Principal component analysis was used to quantify the contribution of the three components most associated with total variance, and to identify the variables characterizing each of these components. The nonhierarchical procedure (k-means) of cluster analysis was used to group accessions according to genetic diversity. The resulting seven clusters were combined with passport data to provide useful descriptions of the gerrnplasm. Multiple discriminatory analysis complemented the study, deriving, through the step-by-step procedure, six statistically significant (P = 0.001) functions. The discriminatory ability of each independent variable was quantified through the index of potency. About 92% of the accessions were readily classified into the seven groups identified by cluster analysis. The Mahalanobis distance (D-2) method was used to show their statistical differences. Even incorrectly classified accessions were identified and reassigned to a more appropriate group.	Fdn PROINPA, La Paz, Bolivia	Rojas, W (reprint author), Fdn PROINPA, La Paz, Bolivia.

Decomposition methods are used to improve both criteria. As opposed to most decomposition methods, that partition the dataset via sampling, this paper presents an accuracy-oriented method that partitions the instance space into mutually exclusive subsets using K-means clustering algorithm. After employing the basic divide-and induce method on several datasets with different classifiers, its error rate is compared to that of the basic learning algorithm. An analysis of the results shows that the proposed method is well suited for datasets of numeric input attributes and that its performance is influenced by the dataset size and its homogeneity. Finally, a homogeneity threshold is developed, that can be used for deciding whether to decompose the data set or not.

Optical Flow technique is used to derive the dynamic scene properties from the image sequences captured from stereo CCD cameras. Here, it is proposed to use the K-means clustering algorithm along with a template matching algorithm to identify the target from the 2D optical flow fields. Visual depth information of the interested target is calculated based on the disparity of the stereo image. The proposed target-tracking algorithm fuses different optical features to identify the relative position and speed of the target with respect to the camera system. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to track the target in the image sequence. In order to test the performance of the proposed algorithm, an experiment is conducted using stereo image sequences of a moving object. This paper presents the vision based target identification and tracking algorithm used in mobile robot navigation for a target tracking and following mission.

It is inspired from the chemical recognition system of ants. In this system, the continuous interactions between the nestmates generate a "Gestalt" colonial odor. Similarly, our clustering algorithm associates an object of the data set to the odor of an ant and then simulates meetings between ants. At the end, artificial ants that share a similar odor are grouped in the same nest, which provides the expected partition. We compare AntClust to the K-Means method and to the AntClass algorithm. We present new results on artificial and real data sets. We show that AntClust performs well and can extract meaningful knowledge from real Web sessions.

We compare the conventional vector-model approach using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to a novel method we have developed for clustering graph-based data with the standard k-means algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated using five different graph distance measures under three clustering performance indices. The experiments are performed on two separate document collections. The results show the graph-based approach performs as well as vector-based methods or even better when using normalized graph distance measures.

The K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) method was used to perform the text categorization. The experimental results were obtained taking into account for a relevant term of a document its corresponding WordNet synset. For the IR task, three techniques were investigated: the direct use of a weighted matrix, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model, and the bisecting spherical k-means clustering technique. The experimental results we obtained taking into account the semantics of the documents, allowed for an improvement of the performance for the text categorization whereas they were not so promising for the IR task.

However, homonym collocation often causes semantic ambiguity. Therefore, the results extracted from corpus should be classified according to every meaning of a word in order to ensure correct collocation. In this paper, K-means clustering is used to solve this problem. This paper reports collocation conditions as well as normalized algorithms actually adopted to address this problem. As a result of applying the proposed method to selected homonyms, the optimal number of semantic clusters showed similarity to those in the dictionary. This approach can disambiguate the sense of homonyms optimally using extracted texts, thus resolving the ambiguity of homonyms arising from collocation.

However, few systems successfully handle this issue for a broad diversity of images. In this paper, we are seeking a practical and generic solution to image segmentation. As a fast segmentation process, K-means based clustering is employed in feature space first. Then, in image plane, the spatial constraints are adopted into the hierarchical K-means clusters on each level. The two processes are carried out alternatively and iteratively. Also, an effective region merging method is proposed to handle the over segmentation. Extensive experiments show the proposed approach is fast and generic, thus practical in applications.

The study discusses the improvements made on the K-FLANN II algorithm, which eventually lead to a consistent set of cluster centroids, regardless of the data presentation sequence DPS. To further improve clustering efficiency, a form of hierarchical clustering is explored, leading to the parallel-distributed implementation of the K-FLANN. Results of the investigation are presented along with a discussion of the fundamental behavior of the parallel network.

By exhaustively setting the combinatorial space of these parameters, it is possible to extract the data clustering behaviour to test for significance between the obtained data clusters and the actual data. If the correlation between the clustered data output and the actual data output is high, a clustering function would likely exist in the neural network that uses the prescribed parameter set. In doing so, it is possible to extract significant factors from an array of input factors and thus determine the principal factors that contribute to the particular output. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the network's ability to extract significant factors using available test data.

The liquid drop analyzer extracts liquid features from different types of liquid drops and obtains a spectrum of characteristics. The data is then clustered using the K-Means Fast Learning Artificial Neural Network (K-FLANN) that implements a systematic reshuffling of the input data points to achieve consistent clustering, regardless of the data input sequence. An introduction of the K-FLANN network is presented in this paper as it is rarely encountered. The discussions explains how the K-FLANN stabilizes the cluster formations such that the resultant cluster centroids remain relatively consistent even though the clustering is done on data presented in a different sequence. The experimental results have a dual agenda. Firstly it shows that the liquid drop photonic data is a viable method of discriminating between liquids and secondly the K-FLANN is resilient changes in data presentation sequences and preserves the clustering consistencies.

In the approach, video shots are grouped into clusters of similar scenes based on shot color attributes. First, the similarity between video shots is measured by shot color histogram intersection. To obtain scene likeness matrix in a maximum-a-posterior (MAP) probability manner, a thresholding method is proposed on shot similarity matrix. Then, a graph is constructed based on the scene likeness that similar shots have an edge between them. Based on the constructed graph, a graph partitioning method is proposed to cluster video shots into different scenes such that the connectivity of video shots within one cluster is higher than that between different clusters. The advantage of the graph partitioning method is that the cluster number need not to be known as a prior. The graph partitioning method is compared with conventional k-means clustering method; in which the cluster number is determined by the cluster validity measure. The main contributions of the paper lie in the formulation of video scene clustering to a graph partitioning problem, and the comparison with the conventional k-means clustering method. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed graph theoretic approach.

The proposed system takes as input, color images of stained peripheral blood smears and identi-fies the class of each of the White Blood Cells (WBC), in order to determine the count of cells in each class. The pro-cess involves segmentation, feature extraction and classifica-tion. WBC segmentation is a two-step process carried out on the HSV-equivalent of the image, using K-Means clus-tering followed by EM-algorithm. Features extracted from the segmented cytoplasm and nucleus, are motivated by the visual cues of shape, color and texture. Various classifiers have been explored on different combinations of feature sets. The results presented here are based on trials conducted with normal cells. For training the classifiers, a library set of 50 patterns, with about 10 samples from each class, is used. The test data, disjoint form the training set, consists of 34 patterns, fairly represented by every class. The best classification ac-curacy of 97% is obtained using Neural networks, followed by 94% using SVM.

The normal k-means algorithm has been modified to capture more knowlege about the distribution of input patterns and to take care of hyper-ellipsoidal shaped clusters. The RBF neural network with the proposed algorithm has been tested with three different machine-learning data sets. The average recognition rate of RBF neural network over these data sets has been found to be 93.70% using the proposed improved k-means algorithm, where as in the method using normal k-means algorithm the corresponding value is found to be 88.12%. Clearly, the results show that the performance of the RBF neural network using the proposed modified k-means algorithm has been improved.

Clustering techniques have been used to automatically discover typical user profiles from Web access logs recently. But it is a challenging problem to design effective similarity measure between the session vectors which are usually high dimensional and sparse. Non-negative matrix factorisation approaches are applied to dimensionality reduction of the session-URL matrix, and the spherical k-means algorithm is used to partition the projecting vectors of the user session vectors into several clusters. Two methods for discovering typical user session profiles from the clusters are presented last. The results of experiment show that our algorithms can mine interesting user profiles effectively.

A method introduced by Dhillon and Modha is an improvement in that direction. It uses centroids of clusters or so called concept decomposition for lowering the rank of the term-document matrix. Our work is focused on improvements of that method using fuzzy k-means algorithm. Also, we compare the precision of information retrieval for the two above methods.

This paper presents an example of the effect of data transformation on unsupervised continuous classification of landforms using the fuzzy k-means with extragrades algorithm on morphometric variables (MVs) derived from a DEM. Results show that after being transformed all MVs distributions become more normal and homogeneous. The optimised solution of number of classes given by the minimisation of FPI and MPE show significant changes between untransformed and normalised results. The use of normalised data achieved better results in terms of finding more distinct and less disorganised substructures for the same optimal number of classes. However, class separability was reduced due to data homogenisation. Furthermore, the resulting classes produced using the two different data sets show a small degree of overlap. Thus, not only data transformation affected the optimal solution pair in terms of number of classes and degree of fuzziness, it also has a major impact on the classification of each individual pixel, demonstrating the importance of data normalisation in the unsupervised classification process and in the delineation of landforms.

Classical methods usually fail to achieve a good segmentation result on such images. We studied a new method for high resolution optical image segmentation which is based on the multifractal characterization of the image. Starting from the analysis of the Holder regularity at each point, we extract features leading to the segmentation of the image. Based on information from the high frequencies, we use a k-means clustering algorithm to perform the segmentation. The whole algorithm is described and results of the method applied to Ikonos image as well as a comparison with classical co-occurrence techniques are presented.

Polarization of radar electromagnetic wave is a very important factor of backscattering theory and geosciences applications. However, polarimetric SAR images are still difficult to interpret and therefore there is a need to improve the classifier that can make use of the polarimetric information. Under the certain circumstance the present paper attempts' to classify remotely sensed scenes by all the complete polarization response parameters, which are presented as data dimensions for classification arithmetic. The test site locates in Hetian of Xinjiang, China. SIR-C Data was acquired in the test site in 1994. Fully polarimetric SAR data can be processed as multi-dimensions images. But the polarimetric information is related greatly with variable targets. Firstly, we decompose the backscattering matrice and get polarimetric ratios, polarimetric degree, and polarimetric entropy. These polarimetric parameters are considered as data dimensions in which elements change in terms of probability functions with variable targets. Training samples were then generated,from the outputs of the unsupervised classification of K-means,,to be used in subsequent supervised classifications of two frequencies (C- and L-bind for SIR-C data) and various polarization combinations. The estimation of the classifier tallies' with the local municipal, statistics. The result shows, that classification precision can be improved finely with the polarimetric technique.

Among these, hierarchical methods and K-means clustering have emerged as two popular approaches. In this paper, we shall present an algorithm that efficiently combines the strong points of these two approaches in a novel two-stage process that outperforms the individual components in both accuracy of representation and computation time. To make the combination more effective, we propose a new initialization scheme for the K-means stage to achieve improved codebook placement We also propose a novel visualization scheme that combines the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) in an arrangement that ensures reliability of the visualization. The performance of the clustering and visualization techniques proposed here is illustrated by application to a challenging data set popularly used as a benchmark.

Clustering techniques have been used to automatically discover typical user profiles recently. But it is a challenging problem to design effective similarity measure between the session vectors which are usually high dimensional and sparse. A new approach based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is presented We apply non-negative matrix factorization to dimensionality reduction of the session-URL matrix, and the projecting vectors of the user session vectors are clustered into typical user session profiles using the spherical k-means algorithm. The results of experiment show that our algorithm can mine interesting user profiles effectively.

If the amount of data increases like in image information mining, where one has to process GBytes of data, for instance, many of the existing clustering algorithms cannot be applied because of a high computational complexity. To overcome this disadvantage, we developed an efficient clustering algorithm called dyadic k-means. The algorithm is a modified and enhanced version of the traditional k-means. Whereas k-means has a computational complexity of O(nk) with n samples and k clusters, dyadic k-means has one of O(n log k). Our algorithm is particularly efficient for the grouping of very large data sets with a high number of clusters. In this article we will present statistically-based methods for the objective evaluation of clusters obtained by dyadic k-means. The main focus is on how well the clusters describe the data point distribution in a multidimensional feature space and how much information can be obtained from the clusters. Both the filling of the feature space with samples and the characterization of this configuration with dyadic k-means produced clusters will be considered. We will use the well-established scatter matrices to measure the compactness and separability of clustered groups in the feature space. The probability of error, which is another indicator for the characterization of samples in the feature space by clusters, will be calculated for each point, too. This probability delivers the relationship of each point to its cluster and can therefore be considered as a measurement of cluster reliability. We will test the evaluation methods both on a synthetic and a real world data set.

However, it is difficult to determine sufficient quality for reconstructed hyperspectral. images. We have measured the information loss from the lossy compression with Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR). To get more illustrative error measures unsupervised K-means clustering combined with spectral matching methods was used. Spectral matching methods include Euclidean distance, Spectral Similarity Value (SSV) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). We used two AVIRIS radiance images, which were compressed with three different methods: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and three-dimensional wavelet transform combined with lossless BWT/Huffinan encoding. The two-dimensional JPEG2000 compression method was applied to the eigenimages produced by the PCA. It was found that clustering combined with spectral matching is a good method to realize the image quality for many applications. The high classification accuracies have been achieved even at very high compression ratios. The SAM and the SSV are much more vulnerable for information loss caused by the lossy compression than the Euclidean distance. The results suggest that lossy compression is possible in many real-world segmentation applications. The PCA transform combined with JPEG2000 was the best compression method according to all error metrics.

A common approach is to segment the 2D frames in order to separate the objects of interest from the background, then estimate the motion of the objects and track them over time. Most existing algorithms assume that the objects to be tracked are rigid. In many scientific simulations, however, the objects of interest evolve over time and thus pose additional challenges for the segmentation and tracking tasks. We investigate efficient segmentation methods in the context of scientific simulation data. Instead of segmenting each frame separately, we propose an incremental approach which incorporates the segmentation result from the previous time frame when segmenting the data at the current time frame. We start with the simple K-means method, then we study more complicated segmentation techniques based on Maxkov random fields. We compare the incremental methods to the corresponding sequential ones both in terms of the quality of the results, as well as computational complexity.

The clustering of high resolution imagery is difficult, due to the fact that the minor objects, such as roads, make the appearance of the same category region non-uniform. This paper proposes a new approach to cluster high resolution remote sensing imagery. The new clustering approach includes three steps as the following: Firstly, eliminate the minor components in the moving windows. Secondly, compute the image features, such as the energy, some high order cumulants and central moments of pixels' values in moving windows. Lastly, apply the BPC neural network, which is combined by a Back-Propagation (BP) neural network and a Competive neural network, to cluster images according to the image features. Two methods, minimum distance method and the K -means method, are compared with the new clustering approach, proposed by this paper, by using SPOT images for clustering residential areas and agricultural areas in the suburbs of Beijing. The experimental results show that the new clustering approach has the higher clustering accuracy.

Here, we discuss two major issues which arise in all classification/segmentation algorithms. ne first issue concerns the desired range of segmentation levels. We explore this issue by means of plots of histogram peaks versus the scaling parameter used to map into integer bins. By taking into account the role of P-min, the minimum definition of a peak in the histogram, we demonstrate the viability of this approach. The second issue is that of devising a merit function for assessing segmentation quality. Our approach is based on statistical tests used in the Automatic Classification of Time Series (ACTS) algorithm and is shown to support and be consistent with the histogram plots.

The method uses conventional techniques such as geostatistical and classical pattern recognition [1] in conjunction with modern techniques such as soft computing (neuro computing, fuzzy logic, genetic computing, and probabilistic reasoning) [2-4]. An important task of our research is to use clustering techniques recognize the optimal location of a new well to be drilled based on 3-D seismic data and available production log/data or other viable logs. The classification task will be accomplished in three ways; 1) k-means clustering, 2) fuzzy clustering, and 3) neural network clustering to recognize the similarity cubes. Then the relationship between each cluster and production log will be recognized around the wellbore and the results will be used to reconstruct and extrapolate the production log away from the wellbore. This advanced 3-D seismic and log analysis and interpretation can be used to predict; 1) mapping between production data and seismic data, 2) reservoir connectivity based on multi-attributes analysis, 3) pay zone estimation, and 4) optimum well placement.

In this paper, we propose a vision-based interface for 3D action games. We make dynamic gestures to input of the interface and represent a user's gesture as an ordered sequence of a user's poses. To estimate a human poses, we classify whole frames using K-Means clustering. For recognizing a gesture, each symbols from input sequence is matched with templates composed of ordered pose symbol sequences that indicate the specific gestures. Our interface recognizes ten gesture commands with a single commercial camera and no markers. Experimental results with 50 humans show an average recognition rate of 93.72 % per a gesture command.

A black-box model of relation between concrete composition and concrete properties can be constructed using a suitable artificial neural network like Fuzzy ARTMAP that was implemented for the presented experiments. After training the system allows valuable prediction of technological data. It was expected that pretreatment of data by their clustering should enable improved prediction on testing examples. The clustering was realized in two different ways: with k - means algorithm and with GCA approach. The improvement of the precision of predictions was found rather limited, but the final efficiency was better, as more records have been positively recognized. The approach seems to be even more promising in case of data of particular internal structure and application of advanced procedures of clustering.

In this paper, six morphological features based on texture analysis were studied in order to categorize normal and cancer colon mucosa. They were derived after a series of preprocessing steps to generate a set of different shape measurements. Based on the shape and the size, six features known as Euler Number, Equivalent Diameter, Solidity, Extent, Elongation, and Shape Factor AR were extracted. Mathematical morphology is used firstly to remove background noise from segmented images and then to obtain different morphological measures to describe shape, size, and texture of colon glands. The automated system proposed is tested to classifying 102 microscopic samples of colorectal tissues, which consist of 44 normal colon mucosa and 58 cancerous. The results were first statistically evaluated, using one-way ANOVA method in order to examine the significance of each feature extracted. Then significant features are selected in order classify the dataset into two categories. Finally, using two discrimination methods; linear method, and k-means clustering, important classification factors were estimated. In brief, this study demonstrates that abnormalities in low-level power tissue morphology can be distinguished using quantitative image analysis. This investigation shows the potential of an automated vision system in histopathology. Furthermore, it has the advantage of being objective, and more importantly a valuable diagnostic decision support tool.

The spectral method is used in the unsupervised learning part of the NRBF neural networks. Compared with other general clustering methods used in NRBF neural networks, such as K-Means, the spectral method can avoid the local minima problem and therefore multiple restarts are not necessary to obtain a good solution. This classifier was tested with satellite multi-spectral image data of New England acquired by Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. Classification results show that this new neural network model is more accurate and robust than the conventional RBF model. Furthermore, we analyze how the number of the hidden units affects training and testing accuracy. These results suggest that this new model may be an effective method for classification of multi-spectral satellite image data.

In particular clustering is an important component of real-time image compression and exploitation algorithms, such as vector quantization, segmentation of SAR, EO/IR, and hyperspectral imagery, group tracking, and behavior pattern analysis. Thus, development of fast scalable real-time clustering algorithms is important to enable exploitation of imagery coming from surveillance and reconnaissance airborne platforms. Clustering methods are widely used in pattern recognition, data compression, data mining, but the problem of using them in real-time systems has not been a focus of most algorithm designers. In this paper we describe a practical clustering procedure that is designed specifically for compression of 2-D images and can satisfy stringent requirements of real-time onboard processing.

The algorithm is applied to 160 images and shows promising results. Evaluation is based on comparisons with a histogram/region-growing algorithm. A self-organizing map is used to obtain an initial segmentation. The weight vectors of the self-organizing map are then clustered using the K-means method. Knowledge-based refinement provides the final binary mask that segments the image. Results indicated that the proposed approach could be used as the first stage in a computer-aided diagnostic system.

Through cluster analysis (hierarchy and k-means) Pedunculate Oak provenances were grouped and the differences in monitored features between resulting clusters were analysed. Results show that the inclusion of individual provenances into clusters corresponds in both the hierarchy and non-hierarchy procedure (in total 4). Clusters don't follow geographic links, therefore we assume genetic connectedness. Cluster 1 (Vrbanja) shows the highest values for analysed features except the dry branches, which indicates that the process ol'branch dving and stem cleaning in this provenance has not yet started. Cluster 3 (Motovun, Dubica, Skakavac, Gusevac, Morovic, V.Gorica) shows the lowest values for all analysed features except the dry branches. Clusters 2 (Orlovac, Spacva, Zdenacki Gaj, Kljucevi, Novska, Gunja, Lipovljani) and 4 (Okucani and Durdenovac) show very similar results for every feature except the dry branches where cluster 4 has higher value than cluster 2 although they are geographically relatively close.

This paper summarizes my findings about this role. I also describe three examples where concave functions are useful: building measures of badnessof-fit, building robust M-estimators, and building clustering objective functions. Finally, using the common thread of concavity, all three will be combined to build a comprehensive, flexible procedure for robust cluster analysis.

A key observation in our construction is the fact that PPMs can be formulated in the context of model selection. The underlying partition structure in these models is closely related to that arising in connection with Dirichlet processes. This allows a straightforward adaptation of some computational strategies-originally devised for nonparametric Bayesian problems-to our framework. The resulting algorithms are more flexible than other competing alternatives that are used for problems involving PPMs. We propose an algorithm that yields Bayes estimates of the quantities of interest and the groups of experimental units. We explore the application of our methods to the detection of outliers in normal and Student t regression models, with clustering structure equivalent to that induced by, a Dirichlet process prior. We also discuss the sensitivity of the results considering different prior distributions for the partitions.

First, one reference pattern for each category is generated from the training data. Second, the reference dictionary is optimized by using the Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) algorithm. Third, the reference dictionaries axe compressed to approximately one tenth of the original data using Vector Quantization with the K-means clustering algorithm. Then, the compressed reference dictionaries are again optimized by the GLVQ algorithm.

In order to do that, a cost function is initially defined based on the estimation of higher order statistics (HOS) of the intensities within small regions. K-mean algorithm is used to find the centres of the two clusters (boundary or texture) from the values of the cost function over the entire image. Then the target values are assigned to the class members based on their Euclidean distances from the centres. A supervised nonlinear SVM algorithm with RBF kernel is later used to classify the cost function values. The boundary is then identified in places where the cost function has greater values. The overall system will be semi-supervised since, the targets are not predetermined; however, the number of classes is considered as two. The results show that the algorithm performance is superior to other conventional classification system for texture segmentation. The displacement of the edges is negligible.

Our approach is based on the computation and comparison of characteristic subspaces (i.e. contexts) for each of the symbols and can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known value difference metric. Subsequently, as one possible extension, we propose a linearization of the computed symbolic distances by multidimensional scaling, thereby mapping a set of symbols onto the interval [0, 1]. Thus, even algorithms, which have originally been designed for usage with continuous attributes (e.g. clustering algorithms like k-means), may be applied to datasets containing discrete attributes, without having to adapt the algorithm itself. Finally, we evaluate the proposed metric and the linearization in quantitative and qualitative settings and exemplify the applicability in clustering domains.

This study demonstrates a procedure for the efficient acquisition of a vegetation map using topographic attributes and nominal vegetation data sampled in the field. Topographic attributes were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and nominal vegetation data were reduced to normalised scores by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The procedure for mapping vegetation types addressed the relations between DCA scores and topographic attributes, spatial correlation of DCA scores and classification of predicted DCA scores based on a cluster analysis of DCA scores at observation locations. The modelled vegetation classes corresponded with the impression obtained in the field. We also showed that the final result is rather sensitive to which samples are included in the analysis.

The purpose of this paper is to review various document clustering techniques, and to discuss research issues for enhancing effectiveness or efficiency of the clustering methods. We explore extensive literature on non-hierarchical methods (single-pass methods), hierarchical methods (single-link, complete-link, etc.), dimensional reduction methods (LSI, principal component analysis, etc.), probabilistic methods, data mining techniques, and so on. In particular, this paper focuses on typical techniques, such as the k-means algorithm, the leader-follower algorithm, self-organizing map (SOM), single- or complete-link methods, bisecting k-means methods, latent semantic indexing (LSI), Gaussian-Mixture model and so on. After reviewing the techniques and algorithms, we discuss research issues on document clustering; computational complexity, feature extraction (selection of words), methods for defining term weights and similarity, and evaluation of results.

A fair insight on the customers' behavior will permit the definition of specific contract aspects based on the different consumption patterns. In this paper, we propose a KDD project applied to electricity consumption data from a utility client's database. To form the different customers' classes, and find a set of representative consumption patterns, a comparative analysis of the performance of the K-means, Kohonen Self-Organized Maps (SOM) and a Two-Level approach is made. Each customer class will be represented by its load profile obtained with the algorithm with best performance in the data set used.

Cracks are first detected using a morphological top-hat operator and grid-based automatic thresholding. From a 1-pixel wide representation of crack patterns, we generate a statistical structure of global and local features from a chain-code based representation. A well structured model of the crack patterns allows post-processing to be performed such as pruning and high-level feature extraction. High-level features are extracted from the structured model utilising information mainly based on orientation and length of line segments. Our strategy for classifying the crack patterns makes use of an unsupervised approach which incorporates fuzzy clustering of the patterns. We present results using the fuzzy k-means technique.

Our method is based on the K-means clustering algorithm as opposed to the generally used equidistant binning method. K-means clustering is a binning method with a variable size for each bin which is adjusted to achieve a natural clustering. Registering clinical MR-CT and MR-PET images with K-means clustering based intensity distribution estimation shows that a significant reduction in computational time without loss of accuracy as compared to the standard equidistant binning based registration is possible. Further inspection shows a reduction in the NMI variance and a reduction in local maxima for K-means clustering based NMI registration as opposed to equidistant binning based NMI registration.

The previous methods usually used single feature and fixed threshold between consecutive frames. And some of the methods suggested detecting the enhanced shot change using the multiple features and unsupervised learning method. But those approaches are difficult to determine the relationship among the features. In this paper, we propose to use the CART for extracting important features of the multiple features and obtaining threshold value for each feature. We also perform the cross-validation analysis and drop-case method to verify the performance of our method And to evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it with single feature methods and k-means algorithm. An experimental result shows that our method has better performance than the previous methods.

Numerical comparison of the powers of the obtained tests with those of the minimax single contrast tests and the likelihood ratio tests is shown. It is seen that Bayes tests have comparable minimum powers with the likelihood ratio tests and have larger maximum powers for given noncentrality parameters.

The three regions selected for the survey were central Italy, Sicily and Calabria, and Sardinia. A total of seventy-nine sites were visited across the three regions in May when the botanical composition of perennial legume species was documented, including recording companion annual species. Detailed ecogeographic information was collected at each site, and soil samples were taken for later laboratory analysis. Climate data for each site were obtained from the Central Bureau of Agricultural Ecology. The sites were revisited in July to collect seed of the perennial species. One hundred and forty-seven legume species were identified, fifty-two of which were perennial. The most common perennial species were Trifolium pratense, T repens and Lotus corniculatus, and these were also found to be the species with the widest distributions. Species distribution and site variability was analysed using k-means clustering. This identified eleven different climate clusters and nine soil clusters. Particularly acid soils were rare. Cross-tabulation of soil and climate clusters resulted in several environment combinations, which could be explained by geography to a limited extent. The results obtained in this study provide useful preliminary information in the search for perennial legumes for the farming systems of southern Australia, particularly in areas with acid soils.

The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study.

Performance metrics are developed based upon quantitative comparisons of convergence rates and segmentation quality. A methodology for making these comparisons is developed and used to establish K values that produce the best segmentations with minimal processing requirements. Convergence rates depend on the initial choice of cluster centers. Consequently, this same methodology may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different initialization techniques.

The techniques employ unsupervised artificial neural networks to nonuniformly quantize the real and imaginary values of digital holograms. The digital holograms of real-world three-dimensional objects were captured using phase-shift interferometry. Our techniques are compared experimentally with the uniform quantization approach, and with an alternative nonuniform quantization technique based on the k-means clustering algorithm.

However there still remain two major limitations, data sparsity and scalability. In this paper, we explore a new collaborative filtering algorithm to solve the problem of data scalability and improve the predication accuracy. It uses a binary tree to store partitioned items. In the process of tree formation, a K-means clustering is used to partition data and create the neighbor of similar items, and then predication based on a smaller item database is performed. Since the preliminary clustering greatly reduces the search space, the search for similar neighbor items will be faster than for the entire database. In addition, the cluster that contains similar items is cohesive, thus it can produce a higher overall accuracy. The experimental results argue that our algorithm obviously outperforms current CF algorithms and it is feasible and efficient.

J	Kim, JB; Kim, HJ				Kim, JB; Kim, HJ			Efficient region-based motion segmentation for a video monitoring system	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						moving object detection and segmentation; object tracking; adaptive thresholding; k-means clustering; video monitoring system	INFORMATION	This paper presents an efficient region-based motion segmentation method for segmentation of moving objects in a traffic scene with a focus on a video monitoring system (VMS). The presented method consists of two phases: first, in the motion detection phase, the positions of moving objects in a scene are determined using an adaptive thresholding method. To detect varying regions by moving objects, instead of determining the threshold value manually, we use an adaptive thresholding method to automatically choose the threshold value. Second, in the motion segmentation phase, pixels that have similar intensity and motion information are segmented using a weighted k-means clustering algorithm to the binary region of the motion mask obtained in the motion detection. In this way, we need not process a whole image so computation time is reduced. Experimental results demonstrate robustness not only in the variation of luminance conditions and changes in environmental conditions, but also for occlusions among multiple moving objects.

This restriction can be done by means of clustering techniques to partition the image data set into subspaces of similar elements. In this article several clustering methods and validity indices are examined with regard to image categorization. A subset of the COIL-100 image collection is clustered by different agglomerative hierarchical methods as well as the k-Means, PAM and CLARA clustering algorithms. The validity of the resulting clusters is determined by computing the Davies-Bouldin-Index and Calinski-Harabasz-Index. To evaluate the performance of the different combinations of clustering methods and validity indices with regard to semantically meaningful clusters, the results are compared with a given reference grouping by measuring the Rand-Index.

These tools include approaches from classical biostatistics, such as logistic regression or linear discriminant analysis, and supervised learning methods from computer science, such as support vector machines and artificial neural networks. In this review, we present an overview of another class of models, cluster analysis, which will likely be less familiar to pharmacogenetics researchers. Cluster analysis is used to analyze data that is nota priori known to contain any specific subgroups. The goal is to use the data itself to identify meaningful or informative subgroups. Specifically, we will focus on demonstrating the use of distance-based methods of hierarchical clustering to analyze gene expression data.

The performance evaluation of a modified Fuzzy c-Means algorithm is carried out, and a comparison with a traditional hard clustering technique is presented. Clustering precision and recall are defined and applied as quantitative evaluation measures of the clustering results. The experiments with various test document sets have shown that in most cases fuzzy clustering performs better than the hard k-Means algorithm and that the fuzzy membership values can be used to determine document relevance and to control the amount of information retrieved to the user.

More recently, efforts have been made to cluster documents and words simultaneously. The FCCM algorithm due to Oh et al. is a fuzzy clustering algorithm that maximizes the co-occurrence of categorical attributes (keywords) and the individual patterns (documents) in clusters. However, this algorithm poses certain problems when the number of documents or the number of words is very large. In this paper, we modify the FCCM algorithm so that it can be used to cluster large text corpora. Our experiments show that the modified algorithm is scalable and produces meaningful clusters. We also show the relation between FCCM and the Spherical K-Means (SKM) algorithm and introduce the Spherical Fuzzy c-Means (SFCM) algorithm.

A K-Means clustering method is used to generate the initial finely segmented image and to reduce the search space of the image segmentation. A genetic algorithm is then employed to control region splitting and merging to optimize the evaluation function. A critical factor affecting the performance of the segmentation is the choice of the evaluation function in the design of genetic algorithm. Here an evaluation function is defined that incorporates both edge and region information. Considering the edge ambiguity in the image, a novel fuzzy-set-based edge-boundary-coincidence measure is defined and combined with a region heterogeneity measure to guide the genetic algorithm to tune the segmentation. Experimental results on test images show that the genetic segmentation algorithm with the fuzzy-set-based evaluation function performs very well.

Since real images are usually nonstationary, a fixed predictor is not adequate to handle the varying statistics of input images. Using back propagation learning with causal neighbors of the coding pixel as training patterns to update network weights continuously, ADFK is made adaptive on the fly. Furthermore, prediction error is further refined in ADFK by applying error compensation different to compound context error modeling used in CALIC [1] based on dynamic codebook design with adaptive fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm. Compensated errors are then entropy encoded using conditional arithmetic coding based on error strength estimation. The proposed compensation mechanism is proved to be very useful through experiments by further improving the bit rates in an average amount of about 0.2bpp in test images. Success in the use of proposed predictor is demonstrated through the reduction in the entropy and actual bit rate of the differential error signal as compared to that of existing linear and nonlinear predictors.

Its application to microarray analysis relies on such algorithms as k-means, dimensionality reduction techniques, and graph-based approaches for building dendrograms of sample data. In contrast, similar problems for discrete-attributed data are relatively unexplored An instance of analysis of discrete-attributed data arises in detecting co-regulated samples in microarrays. In this paper, we present an algorithm and a software framework, PROXIMUS, for error-bounded clustering of high-dimensional discrete attributed datasets in the context of extracting co-regulated samples from microarray data. We show that PROXIMUS delivers outstanding performance in extracting accurate patterns of gene-expression.

By adopting a customized peer group filtering (PGF) to identify prototypes for k-means clustering, dominant scenes can be clustered based on shot color histogram (SCH). Meanwhile, the number of clusters can automatically be determined by estimating the time coverage of dominant scenes. To improve the computational efficiency and clustering accuracy, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are used to project SCH into reduced dimensional spaces. The prototypes obtained by PGF can also be served as sufficient and representative training data for LDA.

Specifically, wavelet-domain hidden Markov models are-used to characterize the global textural behavior of images in the wavelet-domain. Three clustering methods, i.e., the K-mean, a soft clustering and a multiscale clustering are studied to convert the unsupervised segmentation problem into the self-supervised process by identifying the reliable training samples. In particular, multiscale clustering involves multiple context models from different scales for context fusion. The simulation results on synthetic mosaics show that the proposed unsupervised segmentation algorithm can achieve high classification accuracy that is close to the supervised one.

We propose a tree (or a hierarchical) structure for clustering observed shapes. Clustering at any level is performed using a modified k-mean algorithm; means of individual clusters provide shapes for clustering at the next higher level. To impose a probability model on the shape space, we use a finite-dimensional Fourier approximation of functions tangent to the shape space at the sample mean. Examples are presented for demonstrating these ideas using shapes from the Surrey fish database.

The technique is applied to two real-life problems: designing tracking portfolios for equity funds and pricing exotic equity derivatives. A comparison is made between the wavelet and standard linear correlation techniques which shows that the wavelet-based correlation measure offers improved performance when applied to the problem of designing tracking portfolios. The technique has also a potential to be used in other more challenging problems such as pricing rainbow options or selecting long/short equity pairs at hedge funds.

The process of evaluating the data can be time consuming owing to the large amounts of data requiring considerable domain experience and interpretation. This paper presents an intelligent system (IS) to automate the process of data analysis, thereby shortening the evaluation time and providing an explanation of the reasoning behind its conclusions. The intelligent system utilizes a knowledge-based system (KBS), neural network based classification, K-means clustering techniques and rule induction methods to evaluate the data and inform the operator of any errors encountered.

Peaches of 3 cultivars ('Babygold 9', 'Elegant lady', and 'Maycrest') were classified into two classes according to actual firmness data and using the thresholds resulting from a k-means clustering (multivariate analysis). Fruits were then classified in the same 2 classes with a linear discriminant analysis, based on color attributes. In general, total correct classification resulted highest for 'Babygold 9' (93%) and lowest for 'Elegant lady' fruits (65%), with accuracy varying according to the color pattern of the cultivar (i.e. per cent of "blush" on the total peel surface). Further studies are needed in order to validate these results for other varieties.	Univ Foggia, I-71100 Foggia, Italy	Peri, G (reprint author), Univ Foggia, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.

In the literature, conventional k-means (MacQueen 1967) is one common algorithm used in pixel-based image segmentation. However, it needs to pre-assign an appropriate cluster number before performing clustering, which is an intractable problem from a practical viewpoint. In contrast, the recently proposed Rival Penalization Controlled Competitive Learning (RPCCL) approach (Cheung 2002) can perform correct clustering without knowing the exact cluster number in analog with the RPCL (Xu et al. 1993). The RPCCL penalizes the rivals with a strength control such that extra seed points are automatically driven far away from the input data set, but without the de-learning rate selecting problem as the RPCL. In this paper, we further investigate the RPCCL on color image segmentation in comparison with the k-means and RPCL algorithms.

KM and MPC use respectively the Euclidean distance and the vector angle as color similarity measures. It is shown that the vector angle is an intensity-invariant measure in RGB based on the Dichromatic Reflectance Model. Results are given for various color spaces: RGB, XYZ, rgb (normalized RGB), CIELAB, CIELUV, h(1)h(2)h(3) (a new space), and l(1)l(2)l(3). Quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of the MPC algorithm on the RGB, rgb, and XYZ color spaces whereas the KM combination seems most effective in the CIELAB, h(1)h(2)h(3), and l(1)l(2)l(3) color spaces. Finally, poor color clustering results with MPC in h(1)h(2)h(3) and with KM in rgb suggest that some assumptions in deriving a simplified version of Shafer's model for matte surfaces might have been violated.

The latest improvements in K-FLANN, stabilizes the cluster formations such that the cluster centroids remain relatively, consistent even though the data presentation sequence (DPS) changes. Previous implementations of FLANN experienced inconsistent cluster centroids that varied with the DPS. The paper also discusses the selection criteria of parameter ranges, outlining the important behavioral characteristics of the network as these parameters change.

While a number of algorithms have been applied to gene clustering, there are relatively few studies on the application of neural networks to, this task. In addition, there is a lack of quantitative evaluation of the gene clustering results. This paper proposes Adaptive Resonance Theory under Constraint (ART-C) for efficient clustering of gene expression data. We illustrate that ART-C can effectively identify gene functional groupings through a case study on rat CNS data. Based on a set of quantitative evaluation measures, we compare the performance of ART-C with those of K-Means, SOM, and conventional ART. Our comparative studies on the yeast cell cycle and the human hematopoietic differentiation data sets show that ART-C produces reasonably good quantitative performance. More importantly, compared with K-Means and SOM, ART-C shows a significantly higher learning efficiency, which is crucial for knowledge discovery from large scale biological databases.

These devices lack of ability to detect the source of fire in the early stage and they always create false alarms. In this paper, a reliable electronic nose (EN) system designed from the combination of various metal oxide gas sensors (MOGS) is applied to detect the early stage of fire from various sources. The time series signals of the same source of fire in every repetition data are highly correlated and each source of fire has a unique pattern of time series data. Therefore, the error back propagation (BP) method can classify the tested smell with 99.6% of correct classification by using only a single training data from each source of fire. The results of the k-means algorithms can be achieved 98.3% of correct classification which also show the high ability of the EN to detect the early stage of fire from various sources accurately.

The result is that our measure is equivalent to the Xie-Beni measure in cases where that measure works well and is better in cases where the minimum distance between clusters is too small relative to the other distances. Our new validity measure is tested versus the Xie-Beni by use of a new clustering algorithm that improves the well-known k-means algorithm. The test objective is to determine the optimal number K of clusters for a set of feature vectors and to expose a pathology of the Xie-Bene validity.

We present a novel clustering technique that addresses these issues. Our algorithm first finds the nearest neighbors of each data point and then redefines the similarity between pairs of points in terms of how many nearest neighbors the two points share. Using this definition of similarity, our algorithm identifies core points and then builds clusters around the core points. The use of a shared nearest neighbor definition of similarity alleviates problems with varying densities and high dimensionality, while the use of core points handles problems with shape and size. While our algorithm can find the "dense" clusters that other clustering algorithms find, it also finds clusters that these approaches overlook, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent relatively uniform regions "surrounded" by non-uniform or higher density areas. We experimentally show that our algorithm performs better than traditional methods (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, CURE) on a variety of data sets: KDD Cup '99 network intrusion data, NASA Earth science time series data, and two-dimensional point sets. The run-time complexity of our technique is 0(n(2)) if the similarity matrix has to be constructed. However, we discuss a number of optimizations that allow the algorithm to handle large data sets efficiently.

The virulence of 23 strains isolated from infested seeds of wheat, rye, and barley plants collected from 1998 to 2001 from different regions of Russian Federation was evaluated in controlled environment chambers using plants of 13 wheat and barley cultivars. Based on differences in virulence and UPGMA cluster analysis, strains from barley and rye clustered into two separate groups whereas strains from wheat were found in both clusters. The results showed that P. s. pv. atrofaciens has a high degree of variation in virulence to the species and genotypes of cereals in Russia. The susceptibility of over 60 varieties of wheat was evaluated by several inoculation techniques against several isolates of P. s. pv. atrofaciens. Plant reaction data were analysed by Factor, k-means Cluster and ANOVA analysis. Several resistant lines were identified including, Russian winter wheat cultivars 'Moskovskaya nizkostebelnaya', 'Mironovskaya 61', 'Pamyat Fedina', 'Zhneya' and hybrid PPG-93; spring wheat 'Bezenchukskaya', 'Isheevskaya', 'Kinelskaya', and foreign cultivars 'Cooperacion Calquin', 'Pinjab 96', 'Prointa Superior', 'Prointa Imperial', 'Lhanaa', 'Bedhao' and 'Rhabour-15'.

In a recent study, we used DNA microarray analyses to determine genes that are dynamically regulated during human placental development in an in vitro model system in which highly purified cytotrophoblast cells aggregate spontaneously and fuse to form a multinucleated syncytium that expresses placental lactogen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and other proteins normally expressed by fully differentiated syncytiotrophoblast cells. Of the 6918 genes present on the Incyte Human GEM V microarray that we analyzed over a 9-day period, 141 were induced and 256 were downregulated by more than 2-fold. The dynamically regulated genes fell into nine distinct kinetic patterns of induction or repression, as detected by the K-means algorithm. Classifying the genes according to functional characteristics, the regulated genes could be divided into six overall categories: cell and tissue structural dynamics, cell cycle and apoptosis, intercellular communication, metabolism, regulation of gene expression, and expressed sequence tags and function unknown. Gene expression changes within key functional categories were tightly coupled to the morphological changes that occurred during trophoblast differentiation. Within several key gene categories (e.g., cell and tissue structure), many genes were strongly activated, while others with related function were strongly repressed. These findings suggest that trophoblast differentiation is augmented by "categorical reprogramming" in which the ability of induced genes to function is enhanced by diminished synthesis of other genes within the same category. We also observed categorical reprogramming in human decidual fibroblasts decidualized in vitro in response to progesterone, estradiol, and cyclic AMP. While there was little overlap between genes that are dynamically regulated during trophoblast differentiation versus decidualization, many of the categories in which genes were strongly activated also contained genes whose expression was strongly diminished. Taken together, these findings point to a fundamental role for simultaneous induction and repression of mRNAs that encode functionally related proteins during the differentiation process.

It is shown that the number of states for the fuzzy clustering method induces much less states than the K-means method.

With this parallel algorithm, based on the master/slave paradigm, we overcome two drawbacks of the sequential version: a) the time taken to create the codebook; and b) the amount of memory necessary to work with large training databases. Distributing the training samples over the slaves' local disks reduces the overhead associated with the communication process. In addition, models predicting computation and communication time have been developed. These models are useful to predict the optimal number of slaves taking into account the number of training samples and codebook size.

The presented method is based on the fuzzy rule development obtained from membership functions and applied to roads maps. Features are determined to operate a reliable segmentation. We make use of three features, difference intensity, standard deviation and a measure of the local contrast to classify each pixel to the foreground, which consists of character and line patterns, and to the background. K-means algorithm is used to cluster features vectors. The computed parameters are translated into linguistic variable developing the fuzzy rules system representing segmentation process. Two methods based on k-means algorithm are developed. The first method constitutes a pre-processing for the second method. It permits to select pertinent parameters and adapt their structure for a better detection of information. It doesn't require a training phase.

We introduce a new similarity index s(., .), and analyze the consistency of the estimator of the number of classes when k-means algorithm is used in conjunction with s(., .). Various similarity indices are experimentally evaluated when comparing the "true" data partition with the partition obtained at each level of a hierarchical clustering tree. Finally, experimental results with real data are reported for a glioma microarray dataset.

K-means, which is a "hardmax" approach, converges very fast, but it easily falls into local minima. On the other hand, the NG and SOM methods, which are "soft-max" approaches, are good at the global search ability. Though NG and SOM exhibit better performance in coming close to the optimum than K-means, they converge slower than K-means. In order to the drawbacks that exist when K-means, NG and SOM are used individually, we have developed hybrid methods such as NG-K and SOM-K. This paper investigates the effectiveness of NGK and SOM-K in an image compression application. Our simulation results show that NG-K and SOM-K have good scalability to the number of weight vectors.

Image is segmented into three kinds of regions: echo, shadow, and sea-bottom reverberation. Sonar image is passed through a bank of Gabor filters and the filtered images that possess a significant component of the original image are selected. The selected filtered images are then subjected to a non-linear transformation. An energy measure is defined on the transformed images in order to compute texture features. The texture energy features are used as input to k-means clustering algorithm. Results of the proposed method are presented for different Sonar images to demonstrate the robustness of this method.

Whereas the k-median problem involves optimizing the simultaneous placement of k facilities, the online median problem imposes the following additional constraints: the facilities are placed one at a time, a facility cannot be moved once it is placed, and the total number of facilities to be placed, k, is not known in advance. The objective of an online median algorithm is to minimize the competitive ratio, that is, the worst-case ratio of the cost of an online placement to that of an optimal offline placement. Our main result is a constant-competitive algorithm for the online median problem running in time that is linear in the input size. In addition, we present a related, though substantially simpler, constant-factor approximation algorithm for the (metric uncapacitated) facility location problem that runs in time linear in the input size. The latter algorithm is similar in spirit to the recent primal-dual-based facility location algorithm of Jain and Vazirani, but our approach is more elementary and yields an improved running time. While our primary focus is on problems which ask us to minimize the weighted average service distance to facilities, we also show that our results can be generalized to hold, to within constant factors, for more general objective functions. For example, we show that all of our approximation results hold, to within constant factors, for the k-means objective function.

However, the K-means algorithm is suitable to find the clustering that contains compact spherical clusters. If the shape of clusters is not spherical, the K-means algorithm is failure to find the clustering result Therefore, in this study, the genetic clustering algorithm is proposed to find the clustering whether the shape of clusters is spherical or not. Also, the genetic clustering algorithm can automatically find the number of clusters in the data set Thus, the users need not to pre-define the number of clusters in the data set Experimental results show our proposed genetic clustering algorithm achieves better performance than the traditional clustering algorithms.

Attention is drawn to clear evidence that supports, in particular, an argument in favour of gender-response differences in both location and structural dissonance. The study also illustrates how the isolation of dissonant response patterns may be approached analytically, especially in terms of using selected stable features of k-means cluster solutions as a basis for the direct categorisation of observed data.

J	Long, WF				Long, WF			Dissonance detected by cluster analysis of responses to the approaches and study skills inventory for students	STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article							QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES; LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT; ORCHESTRATION; PERCEPTIONS; ASSOCIATION; CONSEQUENCES; STRATEGIES; UNIVERSITY; PATTERNS; RISK	The Approaches and Study Skills Inventory was completed during 1999-2000 by 4138 students variously at an ancient university, a post-1992 university and a teacher training college in Scotland. Responses were analysed by k-means cluster analysis. In stable clusters, members of which were collectively located close to (but not at) the lower end of the academic standing spectrum, relatively high scores occurred for responses on conceptually mutually incompatible deep and surface/apathetic subscales. Similar stable, conceptually problematic cluster subscale scores were seen when learners were grouped into subsets on the basis of discipline of study. The results suggest that small numbers of poorly attaining learners using dissonant study methods occur in a variety of educational settings. These learners are distinct from those lowly attaining ones who unabashedly use surface methods of studying and have low academic aspirations.

J	Bejaran, RA; Camilloni, IA				Bejaran, RA; Camilloni, IA			Objective method for classifying air masses: an application to the analysis of Buenos Aires' (Argentina) urban heat island intensity	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							SYNOPTIC METEOROLOGICAL CONTROLS; WET DEPOSITION TOTALS; PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; WEATHER REGIMES; 3-DAY PERIODS; CLASSIFICATION; CLIMATOLOGY; TEMPERATURE; AGGREGATION	During recent years, numerous studies have examined the Buenos Aires urban climate, but the relationship between large-scale weather conditions and the Buenos Aires urban heat island (UHI) intensity has not been studied. The goal of this paper is to apply an objective synoptic climato-logical method to identify homogeneous air masses or weather types affecting Buenos Aires during winter, and to relate the results to the UHI intensity. A K-means clustering method was used to define six different air masses considering the 03:00, 09:00, 15:00 and 21:00 LT surface observations of dry bulb temperature, dew point, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure and wind direction and velocity at Ezeiza, the most rural meteorological station of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area (Fig. 1). Results show that the mean UHI intensity is at its maximum (2.8degreesC) a few hours before sunrise when conditions are dominated by cold air masses associated with cold-core anticyclones, weak winds and low cloud cover. Inverse heat islands are found during the afternoon for all air masses indicating that surface processes are not dominant at that time. The relatively infrequent and warmest air mass is the only one that presents a mean negative urban-rural temperature difference ( -0.1degreesC) during the afternoon with the smallest diurnal cycle of the UHI intensity probably due to the prevailing high humidity and cloudy sky conditions. The paper provides an insight into the Buenos Aires urban-rural temperature difference under a variety of winter weather types and results could be useful to improve local daily temperature forecasts for the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires on the basis of the routine forecasts of weather types.

Clustering is one of the tools to reveal the structure of this mixture. The same is true to the datasets with chosen response variables that people run regression on. Without separating the clusters with very different response properties, the residue error of the regression is large. Input variable selection could also be misguided to a higher complexity by the mixture. In Regression Clustering (RC), K (>1) regression functions are applied to the dataset simultaneously which guide the clustering of the dataset into K subsets each with a simpler distribution matching its guiding function. Each function is regressed on its own subset of data with a much smaller residue error. Both the regressions and the clustering optimize a common objective Junction. We present a RC algorithm based on K-Harmonic Means clustering algorithm and compare it with other existing RC algorithms based on K-Means and EM.

Previously Kubica et. al. presented the group detection algorithm (GDA) - an algorithm for finding underlying groupings of entities from co-occurrence data. This algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model and produces coherent groups that are consistent with prior knowledge. Unfortunately, the optimization used in GDA is slow, potentially making it in feasible for many large data sets. To this end, we present k-groups - an algorithm that uses an approach similar to that of k-means to significantly accelerate the discovery of groups while retaining GDA's probabilistic model. We compare the performance of GDA and k-groups on a variety of data, showing that k-groups' sacrifice in solution quality is significantly offset by its increase in speed.

However, conducting such experiments is costly and time consuming. The cost and time required are linearly proportional to sample size. Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide a way to determine the minimal number of samples or trials required in a microarray experiment. One of the uses of microarray hybridization experiments is to group together genes with similar patterns of the expression using clustering techniques. In this paper, the k -means clustering technique is used. The basic idea of our approach is an incremental process in which testing, analysis and evaluation are integrated and iterated. The process is terminated when the evaluation of the results of two consecutive experiments shows they are sufficiently close. Two measures of "closeness" are proposed and two real microarray datasets are used to validate our approach. The results show that the sample size required to cluster genes in these two datasets can be reduced; i.e. the same results can be achieved with less cost. The approach can be used with other clustering techniques as well.

Analysis of the fracture of skull can help doctors to diagnose. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to automatically detect the fracture of skull based on CT image content. First region growing method, whose seeds and growing rules are chosen by k-means clustering dynamically, is applied for image automatic segmentation. The segmented region boundary is found by boundary tracing. Then the shape of the boundary is analyzed, and the circularity measure is taken as description parameter. At last the rules for computer automatic diagnosis of the fracture of skull are reasoned by entropy function. This method is used to analyze the images from the third ventricles below layer to cerebral cortex top layer. Experimental result shows that the recognition rate is 100% for the 100 images, which are chosen from medical image database randomly and are not included in the training examples. This method integrates color and shape feature, and isn't affected by image size and position. This research achieves high recognition rate and sets a basis for automatic analysis of brain image.

Textures are modeled using a block-transition probabilistic model. In the training phase, the original textured image is split into equal size blocks, and clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then, the transition probabilities between block-clusters are calculated. In the synthesis phase. the algorithm generates a sequence of indices, each representing a block-cluster, based on the transition probabilities. One advantage of this method over previous block sampling techniques is its stability. More specifically, the texture is synthesized block-by-block in a raster order. The block at a specific location is selected from one of the original image blocks. Thus, synthesis does not lead to artifacts. Additionally, the algorithm uses pre- and post-filtering. The image is filtered by a predictive filter, and the residual image is modeled using the probabilistic approach. The final synthesized image is the result of filtering the residual image by the inverse filter. Using pre- and post-processing eliminates the blockage effect. Moreover, the algorithm is computationally inexpensive. and the synthesis phase is particularly fast since it only requires generation of a sequence of cluster indices. Results show that the proposed method is successful in synthesizing realistic natural textures for a large variety of textures.

High pollution levels were especially observed in the inner city canal sediments, probably related to the import of polluted river Rhine water. In contrast, the more-or-less isolated outer city sites were generally much less polluted. Regression analysis on the database generally showed highly significant correlations between individual heavy metal contents. The heavy metal contents were usually significantly correlated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well. This points to one or more common sources for these micropollutants. Factor analysis and the K-means cluster analysis technique were applied on the above database; it showed a large cluster of stations, nearly all located in the outer city of Delft, characterized by relatively low heavy metal and organic micropollutants' contents. Another cluster of 18 stations, mostly located in the inner city of Delft, possessed intermediate pollution levels, directly related with the supply of river Rhine water. Finally, the stations of a third cluster, situated in the inner city as well, were highly polluted, especially by local pollution sources. The above hypotheses were further supported by a more detailed statistical analysis for a number of inner city stations, together with 10-year river Rhine pollution data.

The studied system offers a hierarchical organization of feature vectors into signature vectors leading to a research tree so that users can explore the database visually. To build the tree, our technique consists in transforming the images using multiresolution analysis in order to extract features at multiple scales. Then a hierarchical signature vector for each scale is built using extracted features. An automatic classification of the obtained signatures is performed using the k-means algorithm. The images are grouped into clusters and for each cluster a model image is computed. This model image is inserted into a research tree proposed to users to browse the database visually. The process is reiterated and each cluster is split into sub-clusters with one model image per cluster, giving the nodes of the tree.

We first review recent supervised Bayesian image segmentation algorithms using wavelet-domain HMMs. Then, a new unsupervised segmentation approach is developed by capturing the likelihood disparity of different texture features with respect to wavelet-domain HMMs. Three clustering methods, i.e., K-mean, soft clustering and multiscale clustering, are studied to convert the unsupervised segmentation problem into the self-supervised process by identifying the reliable training samples. The simulation results on synthetic mosaics and real images show that the proposed unsupervised segmentation algorithms can achieve high classification accuracy.

It was assumed that it was probably caused by great difference between properties of the used materials. Hence it was presumed that the use of reinforcer with lower quantity of carbon fibres in tow would not decrease bending properties of reinforced plywood. Five layer plywood reinforced with impregnated carbon fibre cloth was produced to research whether a significant reduction of quantity of carbon fibres had influence on bending properties of reinforced plywood. The carbon fibres used in the experiment had 3000 filaments per tow (3K). In order to provide better understanding of the problem, models were developed and analysed by use of the Finite Element Method. The achieved results of research were compared to the results of testing non-reinforced plywood and plywood reinforced with 12 K quantity of carbon fibres used in previous researches.

J	Silva, L; Gil, J; Sobrino, I				Silva, L; Gil, J; Sobrino, I			Definition of fleet components in the Spanish artisanal fishery of the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain ICES division IXa)	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Gulf of Cadiz; hierarchical cluster; K-means cluster; fishing trip types; fleet components		The Spanish artisanal fishery in the Gulf of Cadiz is of a notably multi-gear and multi-species nature, with target species occurring seasonally, where a fleet composed of about 1000 vessels captures more than 50 commercial species. From this complexity arises the need for defining fleet components (FCs) (i.e., groups of vessels developing the same fishing pattern through the year), which allow the design of simpler and more efficient sampling schemes on the basis of understanding the behaviour of such components. To define the artisanal FCs, the daily landings by species and vessel during 1996 were considered. In a preliminary analysis, a total of 53 fishing trip types were objectively characterised from the species composition of these landings using hierarchical Cluster Analysis (CA) techniques. A non-hierarchical K-means CA was applied later to re-classify the 1996 data and to classify 1997 landings data by trip type. The red seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo), red-banded seabream (Pagrus auriga), octopus (Octopus vulgaris) and striped venus (Chamaela gallina) types stood out according to their importance in landed weight. In a second stage, only those vessels with more than 50 daily landings regularly distributed through the year were selected. A matrix with as many rows (cases) as selected vessels and 53 trip types x 12 months = 636 columns (variables) was designed. A new CA was applied to group vessels which show similar fishing annual patterns. Eleven FCs were defined from these results. Two basic features of these components may be emphasised: they are highly related to the landing (home) ports and the fishing gears used, and they show definite seasonal fluctuations according to the main fishing trip types developed.

Fulvic and humic acids were extracted from the samples into an alkaline aqueous solution and absorbance values, after appropriate transformations, were subjected to a K-mean cluster analysis (CA) over the objects (samples) for an initial feature reduction (20 variables retained). This was followed by principal component analysis (PCA) for the removal of outliers (four samples removed). The same statistical technique was used on the remaining samples to decide how many variables to enter into the linear discriminant function analysis (DA) and whether original variables or component scores should be used. It was found that the scree test was a good criterion for deciding on the number of components to extract (nine components extracted) and that the use of component scores instead of original variables led to a lower average redundancy (20.6%) of the variables in the discriminant model. From the components entered into the model and their loadings, it was concluded that the discrimination achieved was due to the relative concentration of aromatic groups and other fragments in the samples as well as the degree of soil humification. An overall 85% correct classification of the training dataset was observed (Wilks' lambda = 0.0420) and the method was judged satisfactory for supporting exclusionary forensic purposes.

Methods: In order to characterize the evolution of the auditory responses we applied a Karhunen-Loeve decomposition and k-means cluster analysis to globally compare spatial patterns of brain activity at different latencies and stimulation rates. Tones were presented binaurally at 27 different stimulation rates within a perceptually and behaviorally relevant range from 0.6 to 8.1 Hz. Results: Over this range, we observed a linear increase of the amplitude of the main auditory response at 100 ms latency (N1m) with increasing inter-stimulus interval, and qualitative changes of the overall spatiotemporal dynamics of the auditory response. In particular, a transition occurred between a transient evoked response at low frequencies, and a continuous steady-state response at high frequencies. Conclusions: We show the onset of temporal overlap between responses to successive tones that leads to this transition. Response overlap begins to occur near 2 Hz, marking the onset of a continuous perceptual representation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ishihara, D; Jeong, MJ; Yoshimura, S; Yagawa, G				Ishihara, D; Jeong, MJ; Yoshimura, S; Yagawa, G			Design window search using continuous evolutionary algorithm and clustering - its application to shape design of microelectrostatic actuator	COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						structural design; design window; continuous evolutionary algorithm; K-means clustering; finite element analysis; microelectrostatic actuator	SYSTEM	This paper describes a search method for multi-dimensional design window (DW), which is defined as an existing area of satisfactory solutions in a design parameter space. The method consists of the following two steps: (1) direct search for satisfactory design solutions using a continuous evolutionary algorithm (CEA) from a wide area of the design parameter space in a robust manner, and (2) identification of a precise structure of DW by clustering the detected satisfactory solutions with a modified K-means algorithm. The CEA is a kind of genetic algorithms modified to deal with continuous variables. The modified K-means clustering algorithm contains an explicit procedure to determine the optimum number of clusters. The proposed DW search method was implemented to an integrated computational aided engineering system for multi-disciplinary structural design developed by the authors, and then the method was applied to shape design of a microelectrostatic actuator for next generation high-density optical memory. A DW consisting of four clusters, i.e. four sub-DWs was obtained, and the features of the representative design solutions of the four sub-DWs were compared with each other in detail, and a final design solution was determined.

J	Acharyya, M; Kundu, MK				Acharyya, M; Kundu, MK			Document image segmentation using wavelet scale-space features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						document segmentation; M-band wavelet; texture segmentation	TEXTURE SEGMENTATION; TECHNICAL JOURNALS; CLASSIFICATION; BASES; PAGES	In this paper, an efficient and computationally fast method for segmenting text and graphics part of document images based on textural cues is presented. We assume that the graphics part have different textural properties than the nongraphics (text) part. The segmentation method uses the notion of multiscale wavelet analysis and statistical pattern recognition. We have used M-band wavelets which decompose an image into M x M bandpass channels. Various combinations of these. channels represent the image at different scales and orientations in the frequency plane. The objective is to transform the edges between textures into detectable discontinuities and create the feature maps which give a measure of the local energy around each pixel at different scales. From these feature maps, a scale-space signature is derived, which is the vector of features at different scales taken at each single pixel in an image. We achieve segmentation by simple analysis of the scale-space signature with traditional k-means clustering., We do, not assume any a priori information regarding the font size, scanning resolution, type of layout, etc. of the document in our segmentation scheme.

J	Maulik, U; Bandyopadhyay, S				Maulik, U; Bandyopadhyay, S			Performance evaluation of some clustering algorithms and validity indices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						unsupervised classification; Euclidean distance; K-Means algorithm; single linkage algorithm; validity index; simulated annealing		In this article, we evaluate the performance of three clustering algorithms, hard K-Means, single linkage, and a simulated annealing (SA) based technique, in conjunction with four cluster validity indices, namely Davies-Bouldin index, Dunn's index, Calinski-Harabasz index, and a recently developed index I. Based on a relation between the index I and the Dunn's index, a lower bound of the value of the former is theoretically estimated in order to get unique hard K-partition when the data set has distinct substructures. The effectiveness of the different validity indices and clustering methods in automatically evolving the appropriate number of clusters is demonstrated experimentally for both artificial and real-life data sets with the number of clusters varying from two to ten. Once the appropriate number of clusters is determined, the SA-based clustering technique is used for proper partitioning of the data into the said number of clusters.

Void swelling was observed in all specimens irradiated at temperatures ranging from 573 to 673 K. In CuAl15 brazed with graphite at 1083 K, mean grain size was about 800 nm. Voids were observed in grains larger than 1 mum but not in smaller than 500 nm in diameter. The CuAl25 joined with SUS316 by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1323 K had a mean grain size of 60 mum because of a large grain growth during the HIP process and showed large void swelling. Small grain size is effective in suppressing void swelling due to strong sink effects of grain boundaries for the point defects. The present results indicate that joining at high temperatures may reduce the void swelling resistance of GlidCop copper alloys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Saito, K; Nakano, R				Saito, K; Nakano, R			Extracting regression rules from neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						polynomial equations; nominal variables; regression rules; rule extraction; vector quantization; cross-validation; decision trees		This paper proposes a new framework and method for extracting regression rules from neural networks trained with multivariate data containing both nominal and numeric variables. Each regression rule is expressed as a pair of a logical formula on the conditional part over nominal variables and a polynomial equation on the action part over numeric variables. The proposed extraction method first generates one such regression rule for each training sample, then utilizes the k-means algorithm to generate a much smaller set of rules having more general conditions, where the number of distinct polynomial equations is determined through cross-validation. Finally, this method invokes decision-tree induction to form logical formulae of nominal conditions as conditional parts of final regression rules. Experiments using four data sets show that our method works well in extracting quite accurate and interesting regression rules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ng, MK; Wong, JC				Ng, MK; Wong, JC			Clustering categorical data sets using tabu search techniques	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; k-means; k-modes; tabu search; numeric data; categorical data	ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE	Clustering methods partition a set of objects into clusters such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects in different clusters according to some defined criteria. The fuzzy k-means-type algorithm is best suited for implementing this clustering operation because of its effectiveness in clustering data sets. However, working only on numeric values limits its use because data sets often contain categorical values. In this paper, we present a tabu search based clustering algorithm, to extend the k-means paradigm to categorical domains, and domains with both numeric and categorical values. Using tabu search based techniques, our algorithm can explore the solution space beyond local optimality in order to aim at finding a global solution of the fuzzy clustering problem. It is found that the clustering results produced by the proposed algorithm are very high in accuracy. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Document clustering plays an important role in information retrieval and taxonomy management for the Web. In this paper we examine three clustering methods: K-means, multi-level METIS, and the recently developed normalized-cut-method using a new approach of combining textual information, hyperlink structure and co-citation relations into a single similarity metric. We found the normalized-cut method with the new similarity metric is particularly effective, as demonstrated on three datasets of web query results. We also explore some theoretical connections between the normalized-cut method and the K-means method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Whitfield, PH; Bodtker, K; Cannon, AJ				Whitfield, PH; Bodtker, K; Cannon, AJ			Recent variations in seasonality of temperature and precipitation in Canada, 1976-95	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						k-means clustering; spatial patterns; cohesion; time steps; temperature; precipitation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; SERIES	A previously reported analysis of rehabilitated monthly temperature and precipitation time series for several hundred stations across Canada showed generally spatially coherent patterns of variation between two decades (1976-85 and 1986-95). The present work expands that analysis to finer time scales and a greater number of stations. We demonstrate how the finer temporal resolution, at 5 day or I I day intervals, increases the separation between clusters of recent variations in seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation. We also expand the analysis by increasing the number of stations from only rehabilitated monthly data sets to rehabilitated daily sets, then to approximately 1500 daily observation stations. This increases the spatial density of data and allows a finer spatial resolution of patterns between the two decades. We also examine the success of clustering partial records, i.e. sites where the data record is incomplete. The intent of this study was to be consistent with previous work and explore how greater temporal and spatial detail in the climate data affects the resolution of patterns of recent climate variations. The variations we report for temperature and precipitation are taking place at different temporal and spatial scales. Further, the spatial patterns are much broader than local climate regions and ecozones, indicating that the differences observed may be the result of variations in atmospheric circulation.

J	Schaffner, S				Schaffner, S			Statistical approach to analyze attitudes in three steps	ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG			German	Article						small scale forestry; attitudes of small scale forest owners; measurement of attitudes; multidimensional scaling; factor analysis; k-means cluster analysis		Attitudes and opinions are a constituent part of theories which expound thinking and acting of human beings. Research on attitudes and opinions towards a certain object is dependent on sets of indirect questions about this object of interest. Mostly participants of a study have to judge series of statements for example by agreeing or rejecting in different scales. Often attitudes are composed of different dimensions depending on the complexity of the matter. For example an attitude to property can be composed of three major dimensions: to profit of the property, to use the property or to own (in an abstract meaning) the property. In such cases there is a need of several statements to examine the peoples attitude. Studies which examine several attitudes result in complex data. Statistical possibilities in reducing these complex data are shown by identifying patterns how people have answered to these stimuli (statements). Multidimensional Scaling, Factor Analysis and K-Means Cluster Analysis are statistical procedures which can be used to identify these patterns.

J	Abdelwahab, HT; Abdel-Aty, MA				Abdelwahab, HT; Abdel-Aty, MA			Investigating driver injury severity in traffic accidents using fuzzy ARTMAP	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; CHOICE	This paper applies fuzzy adaptive resonance theory MAP (fuzzy ARTMAP) neural networks to analyze and predict injury severity for drivers involved in traffic accidents. The paper presents a modified version of fuzzy ARTMAP in which the training patterns are ordered using the K-means algorithm before being presented to the neural network. The paper presents three applications of fuzzy ARTMAP for analyzing driver injury severity for drivers involved in accidents on highways, signalized intersections, and toll plazas. The analysis is based on central Florida's traffic accident database. Results showed that the ordered fuzzy ARTMAP proved to reduce the network size and improved the performance. To facilitate the application of fuzzy ARTMAP, a series of simulation experiments to extract knowledge from the models were suggested. Results of the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network showed that female drivers experience higher severity levels than male drivers. Vehicle speed at the time of an accident increases the likelihood of high injury severity. Wearing a seat belt decreases the chance of having severe injuries. Drivers in passenger cars are more likely to experience a higher injury severity level than those in vans or pickup trucks. Point of impact, area type, driving under the influence, and driver age were also among the factors that influence the severity level.

J	Yuen, KCP; McPherson, B				Yuen, KCP; McPherson, B			Audiometric configurations of hearing impaired children in Hong Kong: implications for amplification	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Asia Pacific Conference on Speech, Language and Hearing	OCT, 1998	HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA				FREQUENCY-RESPONSE; PERCEPTION; GAIN	Purpose: Children with hearing loss who require special school placement may have a wide range of audiometric configurations. Since such children will vary in auditory status their amplification requirements may also be diverse. This study examined the audiological records of 231 children attending four schools for hearing impaired children in Hong Kong to gain an understanding of common audiometric patterns found in the school children and their auditory rehabilitation needs. Method: Data on the children's aetiology of hearing loss, hearing status, tympanometric findings and the electroacoustic characteristics of their hearing aids were obtained. For 424 children's ears considered having essentially sensorineural hearing loss, k-means cluster analysis methods were used to categorize audiometric configuration groups. Results: Cluster analysis that indicated that five distinct audiometric configurations could be found among the school children. Different clusters contained children who had differing amplification needs. The study analysed a number of parameters to check fitting outcomes, including average prescribed gain, frequency-specific measured versus prescribed gain, prescribed frequency response, measured versus prescribed frequency response and the predicted aided thresholds for the children. Conclusion: The amplification needs associated with these five configurations, including recommended prescription gain, maximum power output and possible signal processing strategies, were considered.

Moreover, a new algorithm called growing K-means, GK, is introduced as the alternative to Neural Gas and Growing Neural Gas. It has small input requirements and is conceptually very simple. The GK leads to nearly optimal values of the cost function, and, contrary to K-means, it is independent of the initial data set partition. The incremental property of GK additionally helps to estimate the number of "natural" clusters in data, i.e., the well-separated groups of objects in the data space.

An non-linear integer programming formulation is proposed to determine optimal premiums based on the insurer's need to find a balance between profitability and market share. The non-linear integer programming approach to solving this problem is used within a data mining framework which consists of three components: classifying policy holders into homogenous risk groups and predicting the claim cost of each group using k-means clustering; determining the price sensitivity (propensity to pay) of each group using neural networks; and combining the results of the first two components to determine the optimal premium to charge. We have earlier presented the results of the first two components. In this paper we present the results of the third component. Using our approach, we have been able to increase revenue without affecting termination rates and market share.

Three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous structures, which were constructed for the first time by time-resolved LSCM, were found to have a "sponge-like" structure composed of two phases. The structure factor obtained by 3D Fourier transformation of the sponge was found to be identical to that obtained by TRS, confirming that the sponge truly reflects the structural entities evolving in the system. Furthermore, the sponge was shown for the first time to be theoretically predictable by using 3D computer simulations based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. The sponge was subjected to differential geometrical analysis: its Gaussian curvature K, mean curvature H, and their distributions were successfully determined for the first time. The result revealed that the sponge has hyperbolic interfaces with area-averaged curvatures satisfying <K > < 0 and <H > congruent to 0 and that its interface has some deviations from a minimal surface. The sponge was found to be strikingly similar to that occurring in oil/water/surfactant systems at the hydrophile-lipophile-balance, though their characteristic length scales are diversely different (mum vs nm), implying universality of the sponge.

J	Boone, DS; Roehm, M				Boone, DS; Roehm, M			Evaluating the appropriateness of market segmentation solutions using artificial neural networks and the membership clustering criterion	MARKETING LETTERS			English	Article						market segmentation; neural networks; statistical techniques	K-MEANS; PERFORMANCE; NUMBER; ALGORITHM; MODEL	The "appropriateness" of a given segmentation solution is a key consideration in all marketing segmentation studies. By appropriate, it is meant that not only has the optimal segmentation solution been identified, but also that the proper number of segments to market to has been correctly specified. This research focuses on the second, and more fundamental, issue of determining the appropriate number of segments in a marketplace. If the appropriate number of segments is over-specified, marketers may over-segment the market and treat audience segments separately that could effectively be treated inclusively. Conversely, if the appropriate number of segments is under-specified, marketers may under-segment the market and fail to identify distinct, viable segments that should be marketed to separately. The issue of market under- and over-segmentation may be addressed with the membership clustering criterion (MCC), an analytical technique based on fuzzy sets derived from artificial neural networks (mathematical models of animal nervous systems). Using artificial and real world data sets, we empirically test the MCC, compare it to existing methods for determining the number of segments in a market, and demonstrate its advantages in evaluating the appropriateness of marketing to different numbers of market segments.

In the first stage of this CAD system, lung regions are identified by a k-means clustering technique. Each lung slice is classified as belonging to the upper, middle, or the lower part of the lung volume. Within each lung region, structures are segmented again using weighted k-means clustering. These structures may include true lung nodules and normal structures consisting mainly of blood vessels. Rule-based classifiers are designed to distinguish nodules and normal structures using 2D and 3D features. After rule-based classification, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to further reduce the number of false positive (FP) objects. We performed a preliminary study using 1454 CT slices from 34 patients with 63 lung nodules. When only LDA classification was applied to the segmented objects, the sensitivity was 84% (53/63) with 5.48 (7961/1454) FP objects per slice. When rule-based classification was used before LDA, the free response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve improved over the entire sensitivity and specificity ranges of interest. In particular, the FP rate decreased to 1.74 (2530/1454) objects per slice at the same sensitivity. Thus, compared to FP reduction with LDA alone, the inclusion of rule-based classification lead to an improvement in detection accuracy for the CAD system. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to lung nodule detection and FP reduction on CT images. (C) 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

J	Yung, NHC; Chung, HY; Cheung, PYS				Yung, NHC; Chung, HY; Cheung, PYS			Quadrilateral-based region segmentation for tracking	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						segmentation; quadrilateral; region extraction; object tracking	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; VIDEO; OBJECTS; RECOGNITION; SEQUENCES	We propose a novel quadrilateral based region segmentation method that is favorable for object tracking. Instead of using groups of pixels or regular blocks, it uses groups of connected quadrilaterals to represent regions. The proposed method derives the vertices of each quadrilateral from the edge map using the concept of center of masses. By merging the quadrilaterals, regions can be represented, The proposed method offers better data reduction than pixelwise region representation and better boundary approximation than block-based segmentation methods, Experimental results show that it generates a more reasonable region map, which is more suitable for object tracking, and a smaller number of regions than the seeded region growing, K-means clustering, and constrained gravitational clustering methods.

Gulf veterans report medically unexplained symptoms more frequently than non-Gulf veterans did. We examined whether Gulf and non-Gulf veterans could be distinguished by their patterns of symptom reporting. Method. A k-means cluster analysis was applied to 500 randomly sampled veterans from each of three United Kingdom military cohorts of veterans; those deployed to the Gulf conflict between 1990 and 1991; to the Bosnia peacekeeping mission between 1992 and 1997; and military personnel who were in active service but not deployed to the Gulf (Era). Sociodemographic, health variables and scores for ten symptom groups were calculated. Results. The gap statistic indicated the five-group solution as one that provided a particularly informative description of the structure in the data. Cluster I consisted of low scores for all symptom groups. Cluster 2 had veterans with highest symptom scores for musculoskeletal symptoms and high scores for psychiatric symptoms. Cluster 3 had high scores for psychiatric symptoms and marginally elevated scores for the remaining nine groups symptom groups. Cluster 4 had elevated scores for musculoskeletal symptoms only and cluster 5 was distinguishable from the other clusters in having high scores in all symptom groups, especially psychiatric and musculoskeletal. Conclusion. The findings do not support the existence of a unique syndrome affecting a subgroup of Gulf veterans but emphasize the excess of non-specific self-reported ill health in this group.

J	Hennig, C; Christlieb, N				Hennig, C; Christlieb, N			Validating visual clusters in large datasets: fixed point clusters of spectral features	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						discriminant coordinates; outliers; contamination model; sky surveys; stellar populations	HAMBURG/ESO SURVEY; BRIGHT QSOS; SELECTION	Finding clusters in large datasets is a difficult task. Almost all computationally feasible methods are related to k-means and need a clear partition structure of the data, while most such datasets contain masking outliers and other deviations from the usual models of partitioning cluster analysis. It is possible to look for clusters informally using graphic tools like the grand tour, but the meaning and the validity of such patterns is unclear. In this paper, a three-step-approach is suggested: In the first step, data visualization methods like the grand tour are used to find cluster candidate subsets of the data. In the second step, reproducible clusters are generated from them by means of fixed point clustering, a method to find a single cluster at a time based on the Mahalanobis distance. In the third step, the validity of the clusters is assessed by the use of classification plots. The approach is applied to an astronomical dataset of spectra from the Hamburg/ESO survey.

The entire process leading to the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells takes 3 days and plates become fully covered with multinucleated cells at 4 days. Microarray probing at eight time points revealed 635 genes that showed greater than 2-fold differential expression for at least one time point and they could be classified into six groups by the "k-means" clustering analysis. Among a group of 106 early inducible genes (within 2-5 h after RANKL stimulation), four genes including NFAT2 were identified as genes whose enhanced expressions were fairly correlated with an efficient induction of matured osteoclasts. Moreover, cyclosporin A significantly suppressed the multinucleated cell formation accompanying the reduction of the nuclear localization of NFAT2. When the expression of NFAT2 was suppressed by introducing antisense NFAT2, multinucleated cell formation was severely hampered. Functional analysis thus combined with gene analysis by microarray technology elucidated a key role of NFAT2 in osteoclastogenesis in vitro.

J	Glick, M; Grant, GH; Richards, WG				Glick, M; Grant, GH; Richards, WG			Docking of flexible molecules using multiscale ligand representations	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FAVORABLE BINDING-SITES; HYDROGEN-BOND FUNCTIONS; D-XYLOSE ISOMERASE; AUTOMATED DOCKING; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PROBE GROUPS; PROTEINS; COMPLEX; ABILITY; ENZYME	Structural genomics will yield an immense number of protein three-dimensional structures in the near future. Automated theoretical methodologies are needed to exploit this information and are likely to play a pivotal role in drug discovery. Here, we present a fully automated, efficient docking methodology that does not require any a priori knowledge about the location of the binding site or function of the protein. The method relies on a multiscale concept where we deal with a hierarchy of models generated for the potential ligand. The models are created using the k-means clustering algorithm. The method was tested on seven protein-ligand complexes. In the largest complex, human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase/ nevirapin, the root mean square deviation value when comparing our results to the crystal structure was 0.29 A. We demonstrate on an additional 25 protein-ligand complexes that the methodology may be applicable to high throughput docking. This work reveals three striking results. First, a ligand can be. docked using a very small number of feature points. Second, when using a multiscale concept, the number of conformers that require to be generated can be significantly reduced. Third, fully flexible ligands can be treated as a small set of rigid k-means clusters.

J	Park, SU; Lee, YH; Lee, EH				Park, SU; Lee, YH; Lee, EH			Estimation of nitrogen dry deposition in South Korea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						K-mean clustering technique; empirical radical concentration; National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP); reanalysis data; nitrogen species; secondary pollutants	SULFUR; MODEL; TRANSPORT	Dry deposition of nitrogen over South Korea has been estimated using a simplified chemical model and the K-mean clustering technique. The three consecutive daily mean National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalyzed 850 hPa geopotential height fields without precipitation on the last day over South Korea are used for clusterings of synoptic patterns for the period of 1994-1998. The estimated long-term dry deposition of nitrogen by aggregating each cluster over South Korea is found to be about 530 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) of which 30%, 23%, 19%, 18% and 9% are contributed by HNO3, NH4+, NO2, NH3 and NO3- nitrogen species, suggesting the importance of secondary pollutants of nitrogen species for dry deposition of nitrogen.
