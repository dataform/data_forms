Design Retrospective off-line analysis of cardiotocogram and FSpO(2) recordings. Setting The Maternity Unit of the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aretaieion Hospital, University of Athens. Population Sixty-one women of more than 37 weeks of gestation were monitored throughout labour. Methods Multiresolution wavelet analysis was applied in each 10-minute period of second stage of labour focussing on long term variability changes in different frequency ranges and statistical analysis was performed in the associated 10-minute FSpO(2) recordings. Self-organising map neural network was used to categorise the different 10-minute fetal heart rate patterns and the associated 10-minute FSP02 recordings. Main outcome measures Umbilical artery pH of <7.20 and Apgar score at 5 minutes of less than or equal to7 formed the inclusion criteria of the risk group. Results After using k-means clustering algorithm, the two-dimensional output layer of the self-organising map neural network was divided into three distinct clusters. All the cases that mapped in cluster 3 belonged in the risk group except one. The sensitivity of the system was 83.3% and the specificity 97.9% for the detection of risk group cases. Conclusions A relationship between the fetal heart rate variability in different frequency ranges and the time in which FSpO(2) is less than 30% was noticed. Fetal pulse oximetry seems to be an important additional source of information. Computerised analysis of the fetal heart rate monitoring and pulse oximetry recordings is a promising technique in objective intrapartum diagnosis of fetal hypoxia. Further evaluation of this technique is mandatory to evaluate its efficacy and reliability in interpreting fetal heart rate recordings.

J	Salman, NH; Liu, CQ				Salman, NH; Liu, CQ			Image analysis based on image segmentation and edge detection techniques	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Markov random field (MRF); edge following; K-means; edge detection; image segmentation	ALGORITHM	A combination of Markov random field (MRF), watershed segmentation method, edge following technique and Difference in strength (DIS) map was used for image segmentation and edge detection analysis. We obtained an initial segmentation based on K-means clustering technique and the minimum distance. Then the region process is modeled by MRF to obtain an initial estimate of x regions in the image under process. Starting from this we used two techniques; The first is watershed technique to segment the image and to detect the region boundaries. Then merging procedure was used based on mean intensity value. The second is edge following and edge strength techniques to obtain edge maps of our images. In this paper : We solved the problem of undesirable oversegmentation results produced by the watershed algorithm, when used directly with raw data images. Also, the edge maps have no broken lines on entire image and the final edge detection result is one closed boundary per actual region in the image.

The algorithm called KGA-clustering, while exploiting the searching capability of K-Means, avoids its major limitation of getting stuck at locally optimal values. Its superiority over the K-Means algorithm and another genetic algorithm-based clustering method, is extensively demonstrated for several artificial and real life data sets. A real life application of the KGA-clustering in classifying the pixels of a satellite image of a part of the city of Mumbai is provided. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Design-Retrospective study. Animals-80 dogs with severe otitis externa that required total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy. Procedure-Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, and age at time of surgery. Histologic specimens from the horizontal ear canal were evaluated by a single examiner for overall tissue response pattern and scored for sebaceous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland ectasia, fibrosis, pigment-laden macrophages, and osseous metaplasia. Results-48 of 80 (60%) dogs were Cocker Spaniels. Thirty-five of 48 (72.9%) Cocker Spaniels had a predominately ceruminous tissue response pattern; only 9 of 32 (28.1 %) dogs of other breeds had the same pattern. Other breeds most commonly had a pattern dominated by fibrosis (n = 13 [40.6%]); fibrosis was the predominant pattern in only 4 of 48 (8.3%) Cocker Spaniels. Discriminant analysis and K-means clustering of 4 histopathologic criteria correctly classified 75% of the dogs as Cocker Spaniels or all other breeds. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cocker Spaniels are at increased risk for chronic severe otitis externa requiring total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy, indicating that earlier and more aggressive management of the primary otitis externa and secondary inflammation is warranted in this breed. Cocker Spaniels with chronic severe otitis externa have distinct differences in pathologic characteristics of the horizontal ear canal, compared with other breeds.

Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 10 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and five HCs were used to determine the change in brain fractional volume (BFV) over a two-year period. T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and proton density (PD)/T2-weighted sequences were analysed Image segmentation to determine brain volume was performed using the following: a histogram SA, an adaptive fuzzy c-means algorithm (AFCM), and an adaptive Bayesian segmentation with a K-means clustering. Results: Combinations of the SA and PS in MS patients demonstrated significant differences in the per cent change in BFV from baseline. For the combination of PS and SA the per cent change in BFV for year one and year two varied from +2.05% to -1.6% and +0.79% to -3.11%, respectively. Analysis of the HCs data revealed fluctuations in BFV varying from +0.26% to -0.29%. Conclusions: MRI estimates of CA are dependent on both the type of PS and SA; therefore, the choice of SA technique and PS should be consistent during an MS treatment trial.

However, much less is known about the real convergence of these algorithms when the data sample size is finite. In this paper, we address the study of the real convergence of the popular K-means algorithm (Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematics, Statistics and Probablity, Vol. 1, 1967, 281) when it deals with finite data resources.

Large data sets are difficult to handle and therefore, there is a big interest in designing a subset of the original data set, which preserves the information of the original data set and facilitates the computations. There are many subset selection methods and their choice depends on the problem at hand. The two most popular groups of subset selection methods are uniform designs and cluster-based designs. Among the methods considered in this paper there are uniform designs, such as those proposed by Kennard and Stone, OptiSim, and cluster-based designs applying K-means technique and density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). Additionally, a new concept of the subset selection with K-means is introduced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, W; Cohen, DM				Tian, W; Cohen, DM			Urea stress is more akin to EGF exposure than to hypertonic stress in renal medullary cells	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						expression array; tonicity enhancer binding protein; hypertonicity; cytoprotection; activating transcription factor 3; mIMCD3 cells; epidermal growth factor	DUCT MIMCD3 CELLS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 EXPRESSION; RESPONSE ELEMENT; KIDNEY-CELLS; MDCK CELLS; C-FOS; ACTIVATION; PROTEIN; GENE	Although urea is considered to be a cell stressor even in renal medullary cells perpetually exposed to this solute in vivo by virtue of the renal concentrating mechanism, aspects of urea signaling resemble that of a peptide mitogen. Urea was compared with epidermal growth factor and hypertonic NaCl or hypertonic mannitol using a large-scale expression array-based approach. The expression profile in response to urea stress more closely resembled that of EGF treatment than hypertonic stress, as determined by hierarchical cluster analysis; the effect of urea+NaCl was equidistant from that of either solute applied individually. Among the most highly urea- and hypertonicity-responsive transcripts were genes that had previously been shown to be responsive to these solutes, validating this approach. Increased expression of the activating transcription factor 3 by urea was newly detected via expression array and confirmed via immunoblot analysis. Earlier, we noted an abrogation of tonicity-dependent gene regulation by urea, primarily in a transient transfection-based model (Tian W and Cohen DM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 280: F904-F912, 2001). Here we applied K-means cluster analysis to demonstrate that the genes most profoundly up- or downregulated by hypertonic stress were partially restored toward basal levels in the presence of urea pretreatment. These global expression data are consistent with our earlier biochemical studies suggesting that urea affords cytoprotection in this context. In the aggregate, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the urea effect in renal medullary cells resembles that of a peptide mitogen in terms of the adaptive program of gene expression and in terms of cytoprotection from hypertonicity.

Subjects were 161 burn patients treated at the Uppsala University Hospital between 1980 and 1995. Measures were the coping with burns questionnaire (CBQ), the burn specific health scale-brief (BSHS-B) and the Swedish universities scales of personality (SSP). The CBQ was subjected to a K-means cluster analysis and three clusters were derived: extensive, adaptive, and avoidant copers. Extensive copers used the most coping and took an intermediate role regarding health status and the personality trait of neuroticism. Adaptive copers preferred the strategies emotional support and optimism/problem solving, and had the highest health status ratings. Avoidant copers preferred the strategy avoidance and reported the lowest use of emotional support and optimism/problem solving. They had the lowest health status ratings and the highest ratings on neuroticism and aggressiveness. The clusters did not differ in severity of injury or time since injury. In conclusion, coping patterns can be discerned among burn patients, and those individuals preferring avoidance and lacking other coping options displayed more maladaptive traits and poorer health status years after the burn.

Conventional research usually employs the multivariate analysis procedures. In recent years, due to their high performance in engineering, artificial neural networks have also been applied in the area of management. Thus, this study aims to compare three clustering methods: (1) the conventional two-stage method, (2) the self-organizing feature maps and (3) our proposed two-stage method, via both simulated and real-world data. The proposed two-stage method is a combination of the self-organizing feature maps and the K-means method. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is slightly better than the conventional two-stage method with respect to the rate of misclassification, and the real-world data on the basis of Wilk's Lambda and discriminant analysis.

The spatial extent of benthic microalgae on Heron Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia) was mapped using data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper sensor. integrated with field measurements of sediment chlorophyll concentration and reflectance. Field-measured sediment chlorophyll concentrations. 2 ranging from 23-1.153 mg chl a m(2), were classified into low, medium, and high concentration classes (1-170, 171-290, and > 291 mg chl a m(-2)) using a K-means clustering algorithm. The mapping process assumed that areas in the Thematic Mapper image exhibiting similar reflectance levels in red and blue bands would correspond to areas of similar chlorophyll a levels. Regions of homogenous reflectance values corresponding to low, medium, and high chlorophyll levels were identified over the reef sediment zone by applying a standard image classification algorithm to the Thematic Mapper image. The resulting distribution map revealed large-scale ( > 1 km 2) patterns in chlorophyll a levels throughout the sediment zone of Heron Reef. Reef-wide estimates of chlorophyll a distribution indicate that benthic Microalgae may constitute up to 20% of the total benthic chlorophyll a at Heron Reef. and thus contribute significantly to total primary productivity on the reef.

J	Yoo, HW; Jang, DS; Na, YK				Yoo, HW; Jang, DS; Na, YK			An efficient indexing structure and image representation for content-based image retrieval	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						indexing structure; content-based image retrieval; triangle inequality	COLOR; TOOLS	In this paper, we present the following schemes for a content-based image search: (1) A fast image search algorithm that can significantly reduce similarity calculation compared to a full comparison of every database image. (2) A compact image representation scheme that can describe the global/local information of the images and provide successful retrieval performance. For fast searches, a tree is constructed by successfully dividing nodes into the desired depth level by working from the root to the leaf nodes using the k-means algorithm. When the query is completed, we traverse the tree top-down by minimizing the route taken between the query image and node centroid until we meet the undivided nodes. Within undivided nodes, the algorithm of triangle inequality is used to find the images most similar to the query. For compact image representation, RGB color histogram features which are quantized into 16 bins each of the R, G, and B channels are used for global information. Dominant hue, saturation, and value which are extracted from the HSV joint histogram in the localized regions within the image are used for local information. These features are sufficiently compact to index image features in large database systems. For experiments on the retrieval efficiency, the use of the proposed method provided substantial performance benefits by reducing the image similarity calculation up to an average of a 96% and for experiments on the retrieval effectiveness, in the best case, it provide a 36.8% recall rate for a whale query image and a 100% precision rate for an eagle query image. The overall performance was a 20.0% recall rate and a 72.5% precision rate.

As a result, customer databases are becoming increasingly larger and more complex, and may tax the capabilities and exacerbate the shortcomings of the techniques currently used to analyze them. To address this challenge, we examine the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as an alternative means of segmenting retail databases. In particular, we investigate the Hopfield-Kagmar (HK) clustering algorithm, an ANN technique based on Hopfield networks, and empirically compare it to K-means and mixture model clustering algorithms. Our results indicate that ANNs may be more useful to retailers for segmenting markets because they provide more homogeneous segmentation solutions than mixture model and K-means clustering algorithms, and are less sensitive to initial starting conditions.

J	Yang, JW; Chen, XO				Yang, JW; Chen, XO			A semi-structured document model for text mining	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						semi-structured document; XML; text mining; vector space model; structured link vector model		A semi-structured document has more structured information compared to an ordinary document, and the relation among semi-structured documents can be fully utilized. In order to take advantage of the structure and link information in a semi-structured document for better mining, a structured link vector model (SLVM) is presented in this paper, where a vector represents a document, and vectors' elements are determined by terms, document structure and neighboring documents. Text mining based on SLVM is described in the procedure of K-means for briefness and clarity: calculating document similarity and calculating cluster center. The clustering based on SLVM performs significantly better than that based on a conventional vector space model in the experiments, and its F value increases from 0.65-0.73 to 0.82-0.86.

J	Clausi, DA				Clausi, DA			K-means Iterative Fisher (KIF) unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to image texture segmentation	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						binary hierarchical clustering; texture segmentation; computer vision; image segmentation; K-means; Fisher linear discriminant; Gabor filters; co-occurrence probabilities	MARKOV RANDOM-FIELD; GABOR FILTERS; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	The K-means Iterative Fisher (KIF) algorithm is a robust, unsupervised clustering algorithm applied here to the problem of image texture segmentation. The KIF algorithm involves two steps. First, K-means is applied. Second, the K-means class assignments are used to estimate parameters required for a Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). The FLD is applied iteratively to improve the solution. This combined K-means and iterative FLD is referred to as the KIF algorithm. Two KIT implementations are presented: a mixture resolving approach is extended to an unsupervised binary hierarchical approach. The same binary hierarchical KIF algorithm is used to properly segment images even though the number of classes, the class spatial boundaries, and the number of samples per class vary. The binary hierarchical KIF algorithm is fully unsupervised, requires no a priori knowledge of the number of classes, is a non-parametric solution, and is computationally efficient compared to other methods used for clustering in image texture segmentation solutions. This unsupervised methodology is demonstrated to be an improvement over other published texture segmentation results using a wide variety of test imagery. Gabor filters and co-occurrence probabilities are used as texture features. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study our goals were (i) to develop a sound statistical method to establish a comprehensive cutoff point for identification of differentially expressed genes, (h) to identify a gene expression fingerprint for heart failure, (fit) to attempt to distinguish different etiologies of heart failure by their gene expression fingerprint, and (iv) to identify gene clusters that show coordinated up- or down-regulation in human heart failure. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to profile seven nonfailing (NF) and eight failing (F) human hearts with a diagnosis of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. Biological and experimental variability of the hybridization data were analyzed, and then a statistical analysis procedure was developed, including Student's t test after log-transformation and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. A comprehensive cutoff point composed of fold change, average difference, and absolute call was then established and validated by TaqMan PCR. Of 6,606 genes on the GeneChip, 103 genes in 10 functional groups were differentially expressed between F and NF hearts. A dendrogram identified a gene expression fingerprint of F and NF hearts and also distinguished two F hearts with distinct etiologies (familial and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, respectively) with different expression patterns. K means clustering also revealed two potentially novel pathways associated with up-regulation of atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide and with increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Gene expression fingerprints may be useful indicators of heart failure etiologies.

Through the use of an infrared line scanner equipped with 14 spectral bandpass filters, passive infrared images are collected of an ammonia plant within a nitrogen fertilizer facility. Piecewise linear discriminant analysis is used to implement an automated algorithm for the detection of scene pixels that correspond to chemical vapor signatures. A separate classifier is used to detect the presence of hot carbon dioxide (CO2) within the images. In the assembly of training and prediction data for the development of both classifiers, the K-means clustering algorithm is used together with knowledge of the site to assign pixels to the plume/nonplume and CO2/non-CO2 categories. The effects of temperature variation within the imaged scene are removed from the data through the use of an algorithm for separating the contributions of temperature and emissivity to the Planck equation. Averaged across four data runs containing a total of 3.5 million pixels, the resulting discriminants are observed to detect approximately 91% of the plume pixels while achieving a false detection rate of less than 0.01%. The corresponding performance criteria for the CO2 classifier are a successful detection of approximately 94% of the pixels with a CO2 signature and a false detection rate of less than 0.7%. The robustness of the CO2 classifier is further enhanced through the adoption of a probability-based classification rule.

In order to realize such a successful clustering, we investigate a clustering method based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) in this report. Results: We apply Fuzzy ART as a clustering method for analyzing the time series expression data during sporulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The clustering result by Fuzzy ART was compared with those by other clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering, k-means algorithm and self-organizing maps (SOMs). In terms of the mathematical validations, Fuzzy ART achieved the most reasonable clustering. We also verified the robustness of Fuzzy ART using noised data. Furthermore, we defined the correctness ratio of clustering, which is based on genes whose temporal expressions are characterized biologically. Using this definition, it was proved that the clustering ability of Fuzzy ART was superior to other clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering, k-means algorithm and SOMs. Finally, we validate the clustering results by Fuzzy ART in terms of biological functions and evidence.

J	Zhou, W; Maerz, NH				Zhou, W; Maerz, NH			Implementation of multivariate clustering methods for characterizing discontinuities data from scanlines and oriented boreholes	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						discontinuous rock; discontinuity sets; Euclidean norm; multivariate cluster analysis algorithms; visualization tools	TRACE LENGTH; ROCK; GEOMETRY	In geological engineering, discontinuities are typically analyzed by grouping (clustering) them into subsets based on similar orientations, and then characterizing each set in terms of position, spacing, persistence, roughness and other parameters. Multivariate analysis can be used to incorporate some of these other parameters directly into the cluster analysis. The implementation of four methods of cluster analysis that consider orientation, spacing and roughness are described here: nearest neighbor, k-means, fuzzy c-means, and vector quantization. The net result is a better grouping of discontinuities, so that members of a subset might be more uniform in terms of mechanical or hydrological properties. This paper presents the implementation of this analysis in a Windows(R) based program CYL that also serves as a graphical visualization tool. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we test the performance of the many available graphical and statistical methodologies used to classify water samples including: Collins bar diagram, pie diagram, Stiff pattern diagram, Schoeller plot, Piper diagram, Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis, K-means clustering, principal components analysis, and fuzzy k-means clustering. All the methods are discussed and compared as to their ability to cluster, ease of use, and ease of interpretation. In addition, several issues related to data preparation, database editing, data-gap filling, data screening, and data quality assurance are discussed and a database construction methodology is presented. The use of graphical techniques proved to have limitations compared with the multivariate methods for large data sets. Principal components analysis is useful for data reduction and to assess the continuity/overlap of clusters or clustering/similarities in the data. The most efficient grouping was achieved by statistical clustering techniques. However, these techniques do not provide information on the chemistry of the statistical groups. The combination of graphical and statistical techniques provides a consistent and objective means to classify large numbers of samples while retaining the ease of classic graphical presentations.

J	Charalampidis, D; Kasparis, T				Charalampidis, D; Kasparis, T			Wavelet-based rotational invariant roughness features for texture classification and segmentation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						fractals; k-means; segmentation; texture; wavelets	SURFACES; FILTERS; IMAGES; MODELS	In this paper, we introduce a rotational invariant feature set for texture segmentation and classification, based on an extension of fractal dimension (FD) features. The FD extracts roughness information from images considering all available scales at once. In this work, a single scale is considered at a time so that textures with scale-dependent properties are satisfactorily characterized. Single-scale features are combined with multiple-scale features for a more complete textural representation. Wavelets are employed for the computation of single- and multiple-scale roughness features because of their ability to extract information at different resolutions. Features are extracted in multiple directions using directional wavelets, and the feature vector is finally transformed to a rotational invariant feature vector that retains the texture directional information. An iterative K-means scheme is used for segmentation, and a simplified form of a Bayesian classifier is used for classification. The use of the roughness feature set results in high-quality segmentation performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the roughness feature set exhibits a higher classification rate than other feature vectors presented in this work. The feature set retains the important properties of FD-based features, namely insensitivity to absolute illumination and contrast.

J	Huang, KY				Huang, KY			The use of a newly developed algorithm of divisive hierarchical clustering for remote sensing image analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; MULTIDATE	The ISODATA (or K-means) clustering algorithm has been widely used to perform unsupervised classification and to aid in collecting training samples for supervised classification. However, it requires the analyst to have some a priori knowledge on data so that several input parameters can be specified manually, particularly the initial number of clusters and their locations. When processing large data sets, it is very slow because of its iterative process. The objective of this study was to develop a divisive hierarchical clustering ( DHC) algorithm to avoid the before-mentioned limitations and to serve as an alternative to ISODATA. The DHC algorithm was developed based on the concepts of the hyperplane and the binary tree. This study shows that an inappropriate assignment of initial seeds for ISODATA would reduce final classification accuracies significantly. In contrast, DHC requires a minimum of user input with only three parameters and has the ability to determine these parameters automatically from the data set itself, thereby avoiding the adverse effects associated with ISODATA. Because DHC passes through the data set only once, it is fast when processing large sets of remotely sensed data; however, the overall accuracy of DHC is slightly lower than that of ISODATA. Although the algorithm lost a bit in accuracy, it gained much in speed. In summary, this study concludes that DHC is well suited to serve as a surrogate for ISODATA when applied to remote sensing image analysis with large data sets.

The proposed method uses the self-organizing maps to approximate the probability density function of the image patterns. The map is post-processed, by the k-means clustering algorithm, in order to detect groups of neurons whose weights are similar. Each segmented image of the sequence is generated by correlating its pixels and clusters found in the map. The image sequence segmented was used to measure fetal heart structures. To refine the measurements we used a border detection technique based on the least-means squares error. The segmentation procedure was validated successfully by physicians.

J	Iyatomi, H; Hagiwara, M				Iyatomi, H; Hagiwara, M			Scenery image recognition and interpretation using fuzzy inference neural networks	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						neural network; fuzzy inference; scenery image; image recognition; image understanding	SEGMENTATION	In this paper, we propose a new image recognition and interpretation system. The proposed system is composed of three processes: (1) regional segmentation process (2) image recognition process; and (3) image interpretation process. As a pre-processing in the regional segmentation process. an input image is divided into some proper regions using techniques based on K-means algorithm. In both the image recognition and the interpretation processes. fuzzy inference neural networks (FINNs) working in parallel are employed to achieve a high level of recognition and interpretation. Scenery images are used and it is confirmed that the system has an average of 71.9% accuracy rate in the recognition process and good results in the interpretation process without heuristic knowledge. In addition. it is also confirmed that the proposed system has an ability to extract proper rules for the image recognition and interpretation. (C) 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.

Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have not consistently examined indices of overall brain atrophy, therefore it cannot be completely ruled out that hippocampal changes are explained by whole-brain atrophy. The purpose of this study was to assess hippocampal and whole-brain volume in civilian PTSD. Methods: Twelve subjects with PTSD and 10 control subjects underwent brain MRI. Hippocampal volumes were visually quantified using a computerized volumetric program. Whole-brain volumes were obtained with automated k-means-based segmentation. Results: No differences were found in intracranial volumes (XV). Subjects with PTSD had higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/ICV ratios and lower white matter/ICV ratios, consistent with generalized white matter (WM) atrophy. The effect of age on CSF/ICV was more pronounced in the PTSD group. Subjects with PTSD had smaller absolute and normalized bilateral hippocampal volumes. These differences persisted after adjusting for lifetime weeks of alcohol intoxication. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression scores correlated negatively with left hippocampal volume, but PTSD scores were a better predictor of hippocampal volumes. Conclulsions: Our results replicate previous findings of reduced hippocampal volume in PTSD but also suggest independent, generalized, white matter atrophy.

J	Legendre, P; Ellingsen, KE; Bjornbom, E; Casgrain, P				Legendre, P; Ellingsen, KE; Bjornbom, E; Casgrain, P			Acoustic seabed classification: improved statistical method	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article								Huge amounts of money will be spent by industrialized nations during the next decades to obtain detailed maps of continental shelf seabeds. These maps, which will allow a more rational exploitation of the sea floor, are needed to assess the impact of anthropic activities. The statistical method of analysis of echosounder backscatter data described in this paper presents several improvements over existing techniques. The steps are as follows. (i) The backscatter data are decomposed mathematically into a number of quantitative variables, which are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). (ii) Principal components representing 95-99% of the variation are used in a K-means partitioning procedure. A statistical criterion indicates what the number of groups is that best reflects the variability of the data. (iii) The groups are then plotted on maps of the survey area. Insofar as the mathematical decomposition produces variables that reflect the variations of the physical nature and composition of the seabed, the classes of the partition will correspond to different seabed types.

An oceanographic survey covered spatial variability in temperature, chlorophyll-a (chl a ), dissolved oxygen, salinity and water density. Fish larvae were sampled during daytime and nighttime periods through two consecutive days in four stations: two inside and two outside of a well-developed upwelling plume, and at three depth strata: 0-20, 20-80 and 80-200 m. Eighteen taxa were analysed, of which the Myctophidae Diogenychthys atlanticus , Diogenichthys laternatus , and the anchovy Engraulis ringens , were most abundant. Our data showed little evidence for diel vertical migration and larvae were more abundant at depth (>80 m) under low temperature (similar to12degreesC) and low chl a (similar to2 mg m(-3) ), below the highly advective upper layer. The exploratory K -means analysis allowed the separation of data into two distinct habitats: upwelling and nonupwelling types. Most taxa were allocated in nonupwelling waters, i.e. outside the cold plume. However, short-term variations (<24 h) in the position of the upwelling plume influenced both horizontal and vertical occurrence as well as abundance of taxa, and caused variability in temperature, oxygen and chl a . These changes in oceanographic conditions, caused by upwelling circulation and the dynamics of the cold plume, may sharply modify the habitat of fish larvae and have an important role in survivorship and recruitment success.

Using color pixel classification alone does not sufficiently accurately extract color regions so we suggest to use a strategy based on three steps: simplification, classification, and color watershed. Color watershed is based on a new aggregation function using local and global criteria. The strategy is performed on microscopic images. Quantitative measures are used to evaluate the resulting segmentations according to a learning set of reference images.

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's algorithm. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.

At present, the initiation and propagation of such oxidative processes in situ are not well understood, in part because of the insolubility of the ceroid deposits. We investigated the chemical composition of ceroid in human atherosclerotic plaque by combining autofluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In eight sectioned human atherosclerotic samples, we located granular and ring-shaped ceroid deposits by autofluorescence microscopy. Subsequently, two-dimensional Raman maps of the ceroid deposits and surrounding non-fluorescent atheroma were acquired at 1 mum resolution. These Raman spectra were subjected to a K-means clustering analysis. By assigning a different color to each cluster, pseudo-color Raman images of the tissue sections were obtained. From these images the clusters belonging to ceroid and the non-fluorescent surrounding tissue were selected. The averaged cluster spectra were analyzed by means of a least-squares fit with the Raman spectra of pure chemical compounds. In addition, the Raman spectra were compared with the Raman spectra of normal and oxidized lipids. Marked differences between the Raman spectra of ceroid and surrounding, non-fluorescent atheroma were observed, amidst large sample to sample variation in chemical composition. Compared with the non-fluorescent tissue, the changes in the Raman spectra of the ceroid deposits could best be explained by larger signal contributions from hemoglobin and cholesteryl esters. We conclude that there is a large heterogeneity in the chemical composition of ceroid. Its composition is largely dependent on the chemical constituents of the surrounding atheroma. Heme or heme degradation products are consistently present in the ceroid deposits. Our results support the hypothesis that iron and heme can form complexes with the intravascular lipoproteins, thereby stimulating oxidation and initiating the formation of ceroid.

To determine whether orlistat causes fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in African-American and Caucasian adolescents. Design. Prospective, open-label pilot study. Setting. Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. Patients. Seventeen adolescents with body mass indexes above the 95th percentile for age, race, and gender who also had at least one obesity-related comorbid condition. Intervention. Subjects received orlistat 120 mg 3 times/day and a daily multivitamin supplement containing vitamin A 5000 IU, vitamin D 400 TU, vitamin E 300 IU, and vitamin K 25 mug. Measurements and Main Results. During 3-6 months of orlistat treatment, acute absorption of retinol (vitamin A) was not significantly altered, but absorption of a-tocopherol (vitamin E) was significantly reduced compared with baseline levels (p<0.001). Serum levels of vitamins A and E did not change significantly however, there was a nonsignificant decrease in vitamin K. Mean vitamin D levels were significantly reduced compared with baseline (p<0.02) after I month of orlistat, despite multivitamin supplementation. Conclusion.

The sample consisted of 470 high school students (15 to 18 years old). The students responded to two self-report questionnaires: The School Failure Coping Scale and The Components of Self-Regulated Learning. A K-Means cluster analysis was used to classify students on the basis of their coping strategies. The first cluster included students high on problem-oriented and low on emotion-oriented strategies. The second contained students high oil emotion-focused and low oil problem-focused coping strategies, The third group included students with high scores on all strategies, and the fourth those with low scores on all strategies. Results showed that these classified groups differed across all components of self-regulated learning and school achievement. It was concluded that pattern approach to coping with school failure could be useful in future research and that study of coping strategies should include the meaning students attach to their success and failure ill school, as well as their level of aspiration.

A novel segmentation method is proposed for lip tracker initialisation which is based on a Gaussian mixture model of the pixel RGB values. The model is built using the predictive validation technique advocated by Kittler which has been modified to allow modelling with full, rather than just diagonal covariance matrices. A subsequent grouping of the mixture components provides the basis for a Bayesian rule labelling of the pixels as lip or non-lip. The proposed method is tested on a database of 145 images and demonstrates that its accuracy is significantly better than the segmentation obtained by k-means clustering. Moreover, the proposed method does not require the number of segments to be specified a priori.

J	Maletti, G; Ersboll, B; Conradsen, K				Maletti, G; Ersboll, B; Conradsen, K			A contextual classifier that only requires one prototype pixel for each class	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						prototypes; redundancy; region growing; supervised classification; window size optimization		A three-stage scheme for the classification of multi-spectral images is proposed. In each stage, statistics of each class present in the image are estimated. The user is required to provide only one prototype pixel for each class to be seeded into a homogeneous region. The algorithm starts by generating optimum initial training sets, one for each class, maximizing the redundancy in the data sets. These sets are the realizations of the maximal discs centered on the prototype pixels for which it is true that all the elements belong to the same class as the center one. Afterwards, a region-growing algorithm increases the sample size, providing more statistically valid samples of the classes. Final classification of each pixel is done by comparison of the statistical behavior of the neighborhood of each pixel with the statistical behavior of the classes. A critical sample size obtained from a model constructed with experimental data is used in this stage. The algorithm was tested with the Kappa coefficient K on synthetical images and compared with K-means ((&kappa;) over bar = 0.41) and a similar scheme that uses spectral means ((&kappa;) over bar = 0.75) instead of histograms ((&kappa;) over bar = 0.90). The results are shown on a dermatological image with a malignant melanoma.

When the training set and the number of reference vectors increases, the computational effort can become prohibitive for mono-processor Computers. This paper illustrates the parallelization of two clustering techniques using the MULTISOFT machine, a commodity supercomputer, built at the University of Messina. The particular management policy of the MULTISOFT machine and the implementation techniques have shown very interesting results: the speedup increases together with the complexity of the problem to be solved.

Ground data is extended to the entire scene using a supervised neural network classification algorithm. The clustering algorithms examined are K-means, extended K-means, agglomerative hierarchical, fuzzy K-means and fuzzy maximum likelihood. Fuzzy clustering is found to perform best relative to a reference scene obtained with the Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM5) platform.

J	Varela, JC; Goldstein, MH; Baker, HV; Schultz, GS				Varela, JC; Goldstein, MH; Baker, HV; Schultz, GS			Microarray analysis of gene expression patterns during healing of rat corneas after excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EPIDERMAL GROWTH-FACTOR; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNAS; GELATINASE-B; TEAR FLUID; TGF-BETA; CELLS; RECEPTORS	PURPOSE. To characterize changes over time in the genomic expression profile of rat corneas after excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), in an effort to better understand the cellular response to injury and the dynamic changes that occur in gene expression patterns as a wound heals. METHODS. The corneal gene expression profile of 1176 genes at 3 and 7 days after PRK was determined and compared with untreated corneal gene expression patterns by interrogating commercially available cDNA arrays with labeled target cDNA prepared from pooled total RNA harvested from the respective treatment group of adult male rats. The gene expression patterns were inferred based on the hybridization intensities of the probes on the cDNA arrays. The hybridization signals were globally normalized and filtered. The data were analyzed by using hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms before and after normalization of variances. RESULTS. Of the 1176 cDNA elements on the array, 588 consistently produced similar results in replicate experiments and comprised the data set analyzed in this work. In total, 73 genes were identified, with expression levels that differed by at least threefold at either 3 or 7 days after PRK. At 3 days after PRK, 70 genes were identified with expression levels that differed by more than threefold, compared with the expression level in untreated animals. The expression of 42 genes increased by threefold or more, whereas expression of 28 genes decreased by threefold or more. By day 7 after PRK, the number of genes displaying more than a threefold difference in expression pattern was reduced to 27 genes, 20 of which showed elevated levels, whereas 7 exhibited decreased levels. Hierarchical clustering of the 588 studied genes produced 10 clusters with correlation coefficients of 0.9 or greater. To determine whether any of the clusters were overrepresented by genes with related functions, the cumulative hypergeometric probability was calculated by obtaining the observed number of functionally related genes within each of the 10 clusters. Seven of the clusters were statistically overrepresented by one or more categories of functionally related genes, such as cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and metabolic pathway genes. Clustering analysis of 56 genes generally considered to influence corneal wound healing produced 10 gene clusters with correlation coefficients of at least 0.9. Expression of 23 of these 56 genes increased at day 3, then decreased at day 7 to levels similar to those on day 0. These included several growth factors (VEGF, FGF, IGF-I), proteases (PAI-1, PAI-2A) and protease inhibitors (TIMP-2 and TIMP-3). Expression of nine genes increased on both days 3 and 7 compared with expression on day 0 (e.g., TGFBI, TGFBIIR, M6P/IGFR-2), and no genes decreased on both days 3 and 7, compared with day 0. CONCLUSIONS. Microarray analysis of 1176 identified 588 genes with reproducible patterns of expression in rat corneas on days 3 and 7 after PRK and 73 genes with a threefold Change in expression compared with untreated corneas. Hierarchical clustering of these 588 genes identified 10 clusters of genes with very similar patterns of expression. Clustering of genes with similar patterns of expression implies a common regulatory pathway for the genes within a cluster, and identifies potential news targets for regulating corneal wound healing.

J	Beauchaine, TP; Beauchaine, RJ				Beauchaine, TP; Beauchaine, RJ			A comparison of maximum covariance and k-means cluster analysis in classifying cases into known taxon groups	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article							TAXOMETRIC ANALYSIS; MONTE-CARLO; PSYCHIATRIC-ILLNESS; LATENT STRUCTURE; MIXTURE MODEL; BEHAVIOR; SCHIZOTYPY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ALGORITHMS; DISORDERS	Maximum covariance (MAXCOV) is a method for determining whether a group of 3 or more indicators marks I continuous or 2 discrete latent distributions of individuals. Although the circumstances under which MAXCOV is effective in detecting latent taxa have been specified, its efficiency in classifying cases into groups has not been assessed, and few studies have compared its performance with that of cluster analysis. In the present Monte Carlo study, the classification efficiencies of MAXCOV and the k-means algorithm were compared across ranges of sample size. effect size, indicator number, taxon base rate, and within-groups covariance. When the impact of these parameters was minimized, k-means classified more data points correctly than MAXCOV. However, when the effects of all parameters were increased concurrently, MAXCOV outperformed k-means.

The combination of several biologically relevant features such as diameter, eccentricity, fractal dimension, influence histogram, influence area, convex hull area, and convex hull diameter are derived from geometrical transforms and then processed by three different clustering methods (Ward's hierarchical scheme, K-means and genetic algorithm), whose results are then combined by a voting strategy. These experiments indicate the superiority of some features and also suggest some possible biological implications. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Bozinov, D; Rahnenfuhrer, J				Bozinov, D; Rahnenfuhrer, J			Unsupervised technique for robust target separation and analysis of DNA microarray spots through adaptive pixel clustering	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; CANCER	Motivation: Microarray images challenge existing analytical methods in many ways given that gene spots are often comprised of characteristic imperfections. Irregular contours, donut shapes, artifacts, and low or heterogeneous expression impair corresponding values for red and green intensities as well as their ratio R/G. New approaches are needed to ensure accurate data extraction from these images. Results: Herein we introduce a novel method for intensity assessment of gene spots. The technique is based on clustering pixels of a target area into foreground and background. For this purpose we implemented two clustering algorithms derived from k-means and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), respectively. Results from the analysis of real gene spots indicate that our approach performs superior to other existing analytical methods. This is particularly true for spots generally considered as problematic due to imperfections or almost absent expression. Both PXPAM and PXKMEANS prove to be highly robust against various types of artifacts through adaptive partitioning, which more correctly assesses expression intensity values.

J	Cannon, AJ; Whitfield, PH; Lord, ER				Cannon, AJ; Whitfield, PH; Lord, ER			Synoptic map-pattern classification using recursive partitioning and principal component analysis	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							LEVEL OZONE CONCENTRATIONS; CIRCULATION PATTERNS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; SCALE CIRCULATION; NEURAL NETWORKS; SURFACE OZONE; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATOLOGY; VANCOUVER; MODEL	A method for classifying synoptic-scale maps into discrete groups is introduced. Tree-based recursive partitioning models are used to develop mappings between synoptic-scale circulation fields and the leading linear and nonlinear principal components (PCs) of weather elements observed at a surface station. Statistically unique but climatically insignificant patterns are avoided by identifying map patterns based on their association with indices related to local weather conditions. The method requires few user-adjustable parameters and includes an algorithm that provides objective guidance for determining the appropriate number of map patterns to retain. The classification method is demonstrated using daily sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height maps from a domain covering British Columbia and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The linear and nonlinear weather element PCs are derived from daily measurements of surface temperature, dewpoint temperature, cloud opacity, and u and v wind components taken at Vancouver, British Columbia. Classification performance is tested by applying the method to precipitation and air quality scenarios. Results are compared with those from unsupervised map-pattern classifications based on the k-means clustering algorithm. Results from recursive partitioning models using linear weather element PCs as targets were better than those from the k-means algorithm. Recursive partitioning trees using nonlinear PCs as targets performed slightly worse than those using linear PCs as targets. Interestingly, trees using gridpoint circulation data as inputs outperformed models that used truncated PCs of the circulation data as inputs. Poorer results were found not to result from loss of information due to truncation of the PCs. Instead, the way information is encoded in principal component analysis (PCA) may be responsible for the poor classification performance in the recursive partitioning models using circulation PCs as inputs.

World Scientific, Singapore, 1997, pp. 21-34] extended the k-means paradigm to cluster categorical data by using a frequency-based method to update the cluster modes versus the k-means fashion of minimizing a numerically valued cost. However, as is the case with most data clustering algorithms, the algorithm requires a pre-setting or random selection of initial points (modes) of the clusters. The differences on the initial points often lead to considerable distinct cluster results. In this paper we present an experimental study on applying Bradley and Fayyad's iterative initial-point refinement algorithm to the k-modes clustering to improve the accurate and repetitiveness of the clustering results [cf. P. Bradley, U. Fayyad, Refining initial points for k-mean clustering, in: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, CA, 1998]. Experiments show that the k-modes clustering algorithm using refined initial points leads to higher precision results much more reliably than the random selection method without refinement, thus making the refinement process applicable to many data mining applications with categorical data.

This paper investigates two strategies for optimal placement of radioports. One is based on a modified Sebestyen algorithm and minimizes average path loss' The second is based on a hybrid of genetic and k-means algorithms and minimizes the maximum path loss. Simulation results for three floor plans using two radioports show that there is placement error in most Sebestyen solutions. In contrast, the hybrid strategy, while it cannot theoretically guarantee optimal placement, produces optimal placement in the cases mentioned above and is approximately two orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than a global search.

J	Isken, MW; Rajagopalan, B				Isken, MW; Rajagopalan, B			Data mining to support simulation modeling of patient flow in hospitals	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; simulation modeling; patient flow models; hospital capacity planning; K-means clustering	BED ALLOCATION	Spiraling health care costs in the United States are driving institutions to continually address the challenge of optimizing the use of scarce resources. One of the first steps towards optimizing resources is to utilize capacity, effectively. For hospital capacity planning problems such as allocation of inpatient beds, computer simulation is often the method of choice. One of the more difficult aspects of using simulation models for such studies is the creation of a manageable set of patient types to include in the model. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of using data mining techniques, specifically, clustering techniques such as K-means, to help guide the development of patient type definitions for purposes of building computer simulation or analytical models of patient flows in hospitals. Using data from a hospital in the Midwest this study brings forth several important issues that researchers need to address when applying clustering techniques in general and specifically to hospital data.

J	Andrew, D; Craig, AD				Andrew, D; Craig, AD			Responses of spinothalamic lamina I neurons to maintained noxious mechanical stimulation in the cat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVOKED CUTANEOUS PAIN; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; HUMAN-SKIN NERVES; TRIGEMINOTHALAMIC NEURONS; THERMAL STIMULI; TRACT NEURONS; BRIEF CONTACT; RATS TAIL; FIBERS; MONKEY	Noxious mechanical stimuli that are maintained for minutes produce a continuous sensation of pain in humans that augments during the stimulus. It has recently been shown with systematic force-controlled stimuli that, while all mechanically responsive nociceptors adapt to these stimuli, the basis for such pain can be ascribed to A-fiber rather than C-fiber nociceptors, based on distinctions in their respective response profiles and stimulus-response functions. The present experiments investigated whether similar distinctions could be made in subsets of nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons using similar maintained stimuli. Twenty-eight lamina I STT neurons in the lumbosacral dorsal horn of barbiturate-anesthetized cats were tested with noxious mechanical stimuli applied with a probe of 0.1 mm(2) contact area at forces of 25, 50, and 100 g for 2 min. The neurons were classified as nociceptive-specific (NS, n = 14) or polymodal nociceptive (HPC, n = 14) based on their responses to quantitative thermal stimuli. The NS neurons had greater responses and showed less adaptation than the HPC neurons in response to these stimuli, and they encoded stimulus intensity better. Comparison of the normalized response profiles of all 28 nociceptive lamina I STT neurons, independent of cell classification, revealed 2 subgroups that differed significantly: "Maintained" cells with responses that remained above 50% of the initial peak rate during stimulation and "Adapting" cells with responses that quickly declined to <50%. The Maintained neurons encoded the intensity of the mechanical stimuli better than the Adapting neurons, based on ratiometric functions. A k-means cluster analysis of all 28 cells distinguished the identical two subgroups. These categories corresponded closely to the NS and HPC categories: Maintained cells were mostly NS neurons (10 NS, 3 HPC), and Adapting cells were mostly HPC neurons (4 NS, 11 HPC). Thus the present data are consistent with the distinctions between A-fiber and C-fiber nociceptors observed previously, because A-fiber nociceptors are the predominant input to NS lamina I STT neurons and C-fiber nociceptors are the predominant input to HPC neurons. These findings support the view that NS, but perhaps not HPC, lamina I STT neurons have a role in the pain caused by maintained mechanical stimuli and contribute to the sensations of "first" pain and "sharpness." Nonetheless, none of the units studied showed increasing responses during the stimuli, suggesting a role for other ascending neurons or forebrain integration in the augmenting pain produced by maintained mechanical stimulation.

We propose a new Bayesian method for this. The method uses "a priori" spatial information modeled by means of a suitable Markov random field. The image data for each class are assumed to be i.i.d. following a multivariate Gaussian model with unknown mean and unknown diagonal covariance matrix. When the prior information is not used and the variances of the Gaussian model are equal, the method reduces to the standard K-means algorithm. All the parameters appearing in the posterior model are estimated simultaneously. The prior normalizing constant is approximated on the basis of the expectation of the energy function as obtained by means of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Some experimental results suggest calculating this expectation from a "standard" function by simple multiplication by the minimum value of the energy. A local solution to the problem of maximizing the posterior distribution is obtained by using the Iterated Conditional Modes algorithm. The implementation of this method is easy and the required computations are carried out quickly, The method was applied with success to classify simulated image data and real dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging data.

Theoretically PPCS may shift between phytoplankton and macrophyte states with intermediate P loading, but phytoplankton dominate when P loading exceeds a critical threshold. We analyzed sediment cores from five shallow, eutrophic lakes (size range: 0.6 to 125 km(2)) that are phytoplankton dominated to determine whether the development of the current state was associated stratigraphically with an increase in sediment total P (TP) and a shift in PPCS. We used sponge biogenic silica (BSi(S)ponges) concentrations and total carbon to total nitrogen ratios (TC:TN) as proxies for macrophyte abundance and sediment organic matter source, respectively. Three stratigraphic groups of sediments were identified with k-means cluster analysis. These samples were grouped by increasing TP concentrations and decreasing age and identified as macrophyte, transitional and phytoplankton sediments. Results show that as P loading increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the lakes produced sediments with an increasing contribution from phytoplankton. Four of our lakes may represent a subset of shallow lakes because of their large size (30 to 125 km(2)) and relatively rapid historic P enrichment. In these Florida lakes, PPCS shifted to phytoplankton dominance with no paleolimnological record of lake-wide alternating stable states or of lake-wide phytoplankton dominance before anthropogenic P enrichment.

Design In the randomized, prospective Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP) 1,062 children were randomly assigned to all intervention group (n=540; low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet) or to a control group (n=522; unrestricted diet) at 7 months of age. Subjects/settings The intervention families received, at 6-month intervals, individualized counseling that focused on the known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors and aimed at reducing children's saturated fat and cholesterol intake. Nutrition counseling was targeted at the child but, because of the young age of the children, was given to the parents. When children were 7 years old, food and nutrient intakes of 307 intervention and 323 control children were studied using 4-day food records. Statistical analyses performed K-means cluster analysis was used to classify children into 4 groups on the basis of similarity of food intake. Differences in nutrient intakes and serum lipid concentrations between children in the 4 food intake clusters were evaluated using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Results Intervention children dominated the broad, skim milk, and margarine cluster and the cereals, rice, and pasta cluster whereas the 1.5%-fat milk and butter cluster included mainly control children. Saturated fat intake was nearest to the recommendations, that is 11.7% and 11.9% of energy, in the broad, skim milk, and margarine cluster and the cereals, rice, and pasta cluster, respectively. Children in the broad, skim milk, and margarine cluster had 20% to 27% higher fiber intakes (P<.001) whereas children in the sugar and sweets cluster had markedly higher sugar intakes than children in other clusters (P<.001). Serum cholesterol concentrations were lower in those. clusters with high dietary ratios of polyunsaturated to saturated fat. Conclusion Detailed and repeated dietary counseling of parents, starting when children are aged 7 months, that aims at decreasing children's exposure to known nutrition risk factors for coronary heart disease modifies children's food patterns and nutrient intakes toward expected values.

J	Glick, M; Robinson, DD; Grant, GH; Richards, WG				Glick, M; Robinson, DD; Grant, GH; Richards, WG			Identification of ligand binding sites on proteins using a multi-scale approach	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HYDROGEN-BOND FUNCTIONS; AUTOMATED DOCKING; STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PROBE GROUPS; ENERGY; VALIDATION; COMPLEXES; MOLECULES; ABILITY	Identification of a ligand binding site on a protein is pivotal to drug discovery. To date, no reliable and computationally feasible general approach to this problem has been published. Here we present an automated efficient method for determining binding sites on proteins for potential ligands without any a priori knowledge. Our method is based upon the multiscale concept where we deal with a hierarchy of models generated using a k-means clustering algorithm for the potential ligand. This is done in a simple approach whereby a potential ligand is represented by a growing number of feature points. At each increasing level of detail, a pruning of potential binding site is performed. A nonbonding energy function is used to score the interactions between molecules at each step. The technique was successfully employed to seven protein-ligand complexes. In the current paper we show that the algorithm considerably reduces the computational effort required to solve this problem. This approach offers real opportunities for exploiting the large number of structures that will evolve from structural genomics.

Different MA, such as hierarchical clustering methods (HCM) and K-means clustering and the linear and quadratic discriminant analyses are tested and compared. The resulting methodology is based on the successive use of the principal component analysis, HCM with average linkage and K-means clustering. and finally the linear discriminant analysis. It is found that these tools result in a much better discrimination between air masses than the classical selection criteria. From a study based on data selected during seven isobaric flights (230 hPa) crossing the same COL in June 1995, the MA method allows to obtain the physical and chemical structure of the COL and surrounding air masses, and the identification of air mass directly linked to the stratosphere-troposphere exchanges (STE). This air mass corresponds to a mixed zone between stratosphere and troposphere near the jet stream, with intermediate values and weak gradients of ozone, potential temperature and humidity (the tropopause is poorly defined). These STE air masses could not have been found objectively with classical discrimination criteria. A possible hypothesis to explain these STE is the dynamics associated with strong convection beneath and around the southern side of the COL. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Murray, AT; Grubesic, TH				Murray, AT; Grubesic, TH			Identifying non-hierarchical spatial clusters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						clustering; spatial analysis; spatial patterns; optimization; spatial data mining; location modeling	K-MEANS; ALGORITHM	investigating relationships in information is an important component of statistical and spatial analysis. Clustering techniques have proven to be effective in helping to find patterns or relationships which otherwise may not have been detected. One of the most popular partitioning based clustering approaches is k-means. In this paper we explore the application of the k-means approach to spatial information in order to assess its characteristic features. One aspect of concern is implementation in commercial statistical software packages. In particular, the invariable sub-optimality (or poor solution quality) of identified clusters will be investigated. Another aspect of evaluation is a direct comparison to an alternative, spatially-based clustering approach. Although numerous authors over the past 30 or so years have discussed shortcomings associated with the use of the k-means approach, empirically based work which illustrates biasing effects is lacking. This paper contributes to the further understanding of clustering techniques.

J	Miliaresis, GC; Argialas, DP				Miliaresis, GC; Argialas, DP			Quantitative representation of mountain objects extracted from the global digital elevation model (GTOPO30)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article								A methodology was developed previously by the authors for the segmentation of the Global Digital Elevation Model (GTOPO30) to three terrain classes (mountains, basins and piedmont slopes) and it was applied to the Great Basin Section (south-west USA). In the present research effort, mountain objects were identified through a connected component-labelling algorithm applied on the mountain terrain class. Taking into account the physical and perceptual attributes of the Great Basin mountain features, 12 morphometric attributes were defined for the mountain objects and were used as descriptors in their parametric representation. Finally, classification of mountain objects through the implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm resulted in four clusters of mountain objects that appeared to be spatially arranged to distinct geographic regions. The results were compared with existing maps and they were found to be in accordance with existing physiographic descriptions. It is concluded that the derived parametric representation of mountain objects carried sufficient physiographic information and it can be used for mountain classification. The conclusions point out the physiographic information content of GTOPO30 and its value and applications to regional geology and space geomorphology.

J	Vrahatis, MN; Boutsinas, B; Alevizos, P; Pavlides, G				Vrahatis, MN; Boutsinas, B; Alevizos, P; Pavlides, G			The new k-windows algorithm for improving the k-means clustering algorithm	JOURNAL OF COMPLEXITY			English	Article						k-means clustering algorithm; unsupervised teaming; data mining; range search		The process of partitioning a large set of patterns into disjoint and homogeneous clusters is fundamental in knowledge acquisition. It is called Clustering in the literature and it is applied in various fields including data mining, statistical data analysis, compression and vector quantization. The k-means is a very popular algorithm and one of the best for implementing the clustering process. The k-means has a time complexity that is dominated by the product of the number of patterns, the number of clusters, and the number of iterations. Also, it often converges to a local minimum. In this paper, we present an improvement of the k-means clustering algorithm, aiming at a better time complexity and partitioning accuracy. Our approach reduces the number of patterns that need to be examined for similarity, in each iteration, using a windowing technique. The latter is based on well known spatial data structures, namely the range tree, that allows fast range searches. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Braverman, A				Braverman, A			Compressing massive geophysical datasets using vector quantization	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						clustering; ECVQ algorithm; K-means algorithm; Monte Carlo methods; self-consistency		This article presents a procedure for compressing massive geophysical datasets. A dataset is stratified geographically, and a penalized clustering algorithm applied to each stratum independently. The algorithm, called Monte Carlo extended ECVQ, is based on the entropy-constrained vector quantizer algorithm (ECVQ). ECVQ trades off error induced by compression against data reduction to produce a set of representative points, each of which stands for some number of input observations. Since the data are massive, a preliminary set of representatives is determined from a stratum sample, then the full stratum is clustered by assigning each observation to the nearest representative. After replacing the initial representatives by means of these clusters, the new representatives and their associated counts are a compressed version, or summary, of the original stratum data. With the initial set of representatives determined from a sample, the final summary is subject to sampling variation. A statistical model for the relationship between compressed and uncompressed data provides a framework for assessing this variability. Test data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project are used to demonstrate the procedure.

Quantized RGB histograms and the dominant triple (hue, saturation, and value), which are extracted from quantized HSV joint histogram in the local image region, are used for representing global/local color information in the image. Entropy and maximum entry from co-occurrence matrices are used for texture information and edge angle histogram is used for representing shape information. Relevance feedback approach, which has coupled proposed features, is used for obtaining better retrieval accuracy. A new indexing method that supports fast retrieval in large image databases is also presented. Tree structures constructed by k-means algorithm, along with the idea of triangle inequality, eliminate candidate images for similarity calculation between query image and each database image. We find that the proposed method reduces calculation up to average 92.2 percent of the images from direct comparison. (C) 2001 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This strategy can be useful in pharmacological screening, combinatorial chemistry or parallel synthesis planning. It consists of first describing the compounds by means of parameters derived from quantum mechanical computations (water solvation DeltaG, benzene solvation DeltaG, octanol solvation DeltaG, dipolar moment), as well as standard molecular parameters such as solvent-accessible surface area and molecular weight. Solvation parameters are used because of the importance of this phenomenon in the pharmacological behaviour. Redundant information in the description of the compounds is eliminated by using principal components (PC) instead of the original descriptors. Based on the similarity between the N compounds in the PC space, they are classified into n groups by k-means cluster analysis. The compounds that are nearest to the centroid of each cluster constituted the maximum diversity sample. When practical difficulties exist for the use of one of the proposed compounds, another also close to the cluster centroid can substitute for it. This strategy has been tested in the selection of a sample of 50 amines from the 923 available in the Aldrich catalogue. The results have been contrasted with those obtained from an optimal, distance-based experimental design, resulting in an 86% of agreement between both approaches.

J	Kim, JH; Kohane, IS; Ohno-Machado, L				Kim, JH; Kohane, IS; Ohno-Machado, L			Visualization and evaluation of clusters for exploratory analysis of gene expression data	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop of the International-Medical-Informatics-Association (IMIA)	DEC, 1999	PHOENIX, ARIZONA	Int Med Informat Assoc		DNA microarray; gene expression profile; visualization; cluster analysis; optimization	PATTERNS; MAPS	Clustering algorithms have been shown to be useful to explore large-scale gene expression profiles. Visualization and objective evaluation of clusters are two important considerations when users are selecting different clustering algorithms, but they are often overlooked. The developments of a framework and software tools that implement comprehensive data visualization and objective measures of cluster quality are crucial. In this paper, we describe a theoretical framework and formalizations for consistently developing clustering algorithms. A new clustering algorithm was developed within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that a theoretically sound principle can be uniformly applied to the developments of cluster-optimization function, comprehensive data-visualization strategy, and objective cluster-evaluation measures as well as actual implementation of the principle. Cluster consistency and quality measures of the algorithm are rigorously evaluated against those of popular clustering algorithms for gene expression data analysis (K-means and self-organizing maps), in four data sets, yielding promising results.

J	Brusco, MJ; Cradit, JD; Stahl, S				Brusco, MJ; Cradit, JD; Stahl, S			A simulated annealing heuristic for a bicriterion partitioning problem in market segmentation	JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH			English	Article							CLUSTERWISE LINEAR-REGRESSION; BENEFIT SEGMENTATION; METHODOLOGY; MODEL	K-means clustering procedures are frequently used to identify homogeneous market segments on the basis of a set of descriptor variables. In practice, however, market research analysts often desire both homogeneous market segments and good explanation of an exogenous response variable. Unfortunately, the relationship between these two objective criteria can be antagonistic, and it is often difficult to find clustering solutions that yield adequate levels for both criteria. The authors present a simulated annealing heuristic for solving bicriterion partitioning problems related to these objectives. A large computational study and an empirical demonstration reveal the effectiveness of the methodology. The authors also discuss limitations and extensions of the method.

One hundred and five competitive swimmers were recruited to participate in the study. They were asked to complete both the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) and the Sport Imagery Questionnaire. The results of a K-means cluster analysis on the TEOSQ scores resulted in a three-cluster solution that maximized between-group differences and minimized within-group differences. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the three cluster groups could be distinguished by their use of imagery. Specifically, the results indicated that individuals with a 'complementary balance' between task and ego orientations were more motivated to perform the functions of imagery that would help them to maximize their performance.

Surface finish can also be used to provide feedback to the manufacturing process. An area of active research in surface metrology is in developing tools and techniques for providing greater insight into the relationship between surface texture, a component's Junction and the manufacturing process. In this context, this paper explores the use of different clustering techniques such as k-means, ISODATA and neural networks to relate surface metrology data to a component's function and the manufacturing process that produced the part.

We propose a two level segmentation process that enables the audio tracks to be sampled in short sequences which are classified into several classes. The segmentation is performed by computing several features for each audio sequence. These features are computed either on a complete audio segment or on a frame (set of samples) which is a subset of the audio segment. The proposed approach for microsegmentation of audio data consists of a combination of a K-Means classifier at the segment level and of a Multidimensional Hidden Markov Model system using the frame decomposition of the signal. A first classification is obtained using the K-Means classifier and segment-based features. Then final result comes from the use of Multidimensional Hidden Markov Models and frame-based features involving temporary results. Multidimensional Hidden Markov Models are an extension of classical Hidden Markov Model dedicated to multicomponents data. They are particularly adapted in our case where each audio segment can be characterized by several features of different nature.

Initially, n d-dimensional data is decomposed into a large number of compact clusters; the K-means algorithm performs this decomposition, with several clusterings obtained by N random initializations of the K-means. Taking the co-occurrences of pairs of patterns in the same cluster as votes for their association, the data partitions are mapped into a co-association matrix of patterns. This n x n matrix represents a new similarity measure between patterns. The final clusters are obtained by applying a MST-based clustering algorithm on this matrix. Results on both synthetic and real data show the ability of the method to identify, arbitrary shaped clusters in multidimensional data.

The incorporation of kernel function enables the K-Means algorithm to explore the inherent data pattern in the new space. However, the recent applications of kernel K-Means algorithm are confined to small corpora due to its expensive computation and storage cost. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a new clustering scheme which changes the clustering order from the sequence of samples to the sequence of kernels, and employs a disk-based strategy to control data. The new clustering scheme has been demonstrated to be very efficient for large corpus by our experiments on hand-written digits recognition, in which more than 90% of the running time was saved.

In each stage, statistics of each class present in the image are estimated. The user is required to provide only one prototype pixel for each class to be seeded into a homogeneous. region. The algorithm starts by generating optimum initial training sets, one for each class, maximizing the redundancy in the data sets. These sets are the realizations of the maximal discs centered on the prototype pixels for which it is true that all the elements belong to the same class as the center one. Afterwards a region growing algorithm increases the sample size providing more statistically valid samples of the classes. Final classification of each pixel is done by comparison of the statistical behavior of the neighborhood of each pixel with the statistical behavior of the classes. A critical sample size obtained from a model constructed with experimental data is used in this stage. The algorithm was tested with the Kappa coefficient kappa on synthetical images and compared with K-means ((kappa) over bar = 0.41) and a similar scheme that uses spectral means ((kappa) over bar = 0.75) instead of histograms ((kappa) over bar = 0.90). Results are shown on a dermatological image with a malignant melanoma.

Specifically, wavelet domain hidden Markov models (HMMs) are adopted to obtain statistical image characterization. The joint multi-context and multi-scale (JMCMS) approach is also applied to exploit robust multiscale contextual information. We first review the supervised Bayesian segmentation algorithms where complete image features are given. Secondly, we study semi-supervised segmentation by only providing partial image features. The K-mean clustering is used to convert the semi-supervised segmentation problem into the self-supervised process by identifying the reliable training samples. Thirdly, an unsupervised segmentation algorithm is also developed where image features are completely unknown and can be trained online during segmentation. The simulation results on a synthetic mosaic show that the proposed algorithms can achieve high classification accuracy for both serni-supervised and unsupervised segmentations.

Fuzzy databases queries, and other areas of development have helped address problem in geographical information representation, management, query, and modeling. Cost, in a general sense, Is an Issue not generally considered when addressing the topic of fuzzy sets and GIS. By considering the issue of cost afresh perspective on the development of fuzzy sets in GIS applications is possible. A comparison of fuzzy versus nonfuzzy approaches shows that fuzzy logic-based approaches typically provide more detailed, useful information. As GIS becomes more complex and Intelligent, fuzzy logic-based methods will become a cost-effective approach for improving its problem-solving abilities.

In particular, a few techniques exist to select a different subset of feature for each known class, which we refer to as discriminative feature selection. The main objective guiding discriminative feature selection has been the ultimate performance of the classifier system. Unsupervised learning, however, is plagued by the problem of absence of the class labels. For this reason, there has been a blatant weakness in (if not a total lack of) discriminative feature selection/tuning In unsupervised learning. However, in many unsupervised learning applications, such as clustering of Web documents and of Web user sessions, the features are rarely equally relevant in all clusters. For instance a given keyword Is generally not equally relevant in all document categories. Similarly, a given URL cannot be expected to be equally relevant to all Web usage categories. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for fuzzy unsupervised learning in Web mining, for the case when the attributes/features do not have the same relevance In all clusters. Being a relative of the Fuzzy C-Means and K-Means clustering algorithms, our approach is computationally and implementationally simple, and if desired, can easily be implemented In a scalable mode in an Identical manner to previous well known scalable Implementations of the K-Means. Most importantly, our approach learns a different set of attribute weights for each cluster. Hence, each cluster will be characterized by a possibly different set of attributes. These adaptive attribute weights help produce a more meaningful partitioning of the data space, and they can be used to automatically generate a compact description of each cluster In terms of not only the attribute values, but also their relevance. The performance of the proposed algorithm is Illustrated on real collections of Web documents and Web sessions extracted from a Web server log file.

The algorithm capitalizes on the fact that the state sequence of a left-right HMM is uniquely determined by the state duration occupancies. The algorithm is mostly suitable for parameter estimation from a single training sequence. Extensions to estimation from multiple sequences are possible but deemed impractical. Two alternatives are proposed for utilizing this algorithm in automatic speech recognition. The first is based on averaging the parameter estimates from individual sequences while the second uses the Farago and Lugosi segmentation to initialize the segmental k-means or the Baum algorithm. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it in isolated digit recognition. Using the second approach, a reduction of the error rate from .65% to .36% was realized.

The patterns are recurrent signal segments in the original temporal sequence with respect to some criteria defined by the user. We use Threshold hidden Markov model (THMM) to model the signal sequence. A variance of the Segmental K-means algorithm is used to train the THMM. The trained THMM can be used to detect the pattern in the temporal sequence. We apply the proposed approach to automatically analyze multiple synchronized temporal sequences from several input modalities. The timing information of the extracted patterns is used to learn the correlation across multiple modalities, which leads to automatic concept learning.

A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Well-known are two types of the similarity join, the distance range join where the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest point query or k-distance join which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we investigate an important, third similarity join operation called k-nearest neighbor join which combines each point of one point set with its k nearest neighbors in the other set. It has been shown that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbor classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. We propose a new algorithm to compute the k-nearest neighbor join using the multipage index (MuX), a specialised index structure for the similarity join. To reduce both CPU and I/O cost, we develop optimal loading and processing strategies.

However spherical k-means can often yield qualitatively poor results, especially when cluster sizes are small, say 25-30 documents per cluster, where it tends to get stuck at a local maximum far away from the optimal solution. In this paper we present a local search procedure, which we call "first-variation" that refines a given clustering by incrementally moving data points between clusters, thus achieving a higher objective function value. An enhancement of first variation allows a chain of such moves in a Kernighan-Lin fashion and leads to a better local maximum. Combining the enhanced first-variation with spherical k-means yields a powerful "ping-pong" strategy that often qualitatively improves k-means clustering and is computationally efficient. We present several experimental results to highlight the improvement achieved by our proposed algorithm in clustering high-dimensional and sparse text data.

Many initialization methods were proposed to tackle this problem, but with only limited success. In this paper we propose a new approach to resolve this problem by repeated dimension reductions such that K-means or EM are performed only in very low dimensions. Cluster membership is utilized as a bridge between the reduced dimensional sub-space and the original space, providing flexibility and ease of implementation.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc				We present a method for modelling and estimating branching structures, such as blood vessel bifurcations, from medical images. Branches are modelled as a superposition of Gaussian functions in a local region which describe the amplitude, position and orientations of intersecting linear features. The centroids of component features are separated by applying K-means to the local Fourier phase and the covariances and amplitudes subsequently estimated by a likelihood maximisation. We employ a penalised likelihood test (AIC) to select the best fit model in a region. Results are presented on synthetic and representative 2D retinal images which show the estimation to be robust and accurate in the presence of noise. We compare our results with a curvature scale-space operator method.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc				In this paper we propose a methodology for brain parcellation. with anatomical and functional constraints dedicated to fMRI data analysis. The aim is to provide a representation of fMRI data at any intermediate dimensionality between voxel and region of interest. In order to fill in the gap between these two approaches we developed an automatic parcellation of the 3D cortex with an adjustable resolution. The algorithm relies on an adaptation of the K-means clustering in a non convex domain with geodesic distances. Fine anatomical or functional constraints can be embedded through the use of weighted geodesic distances. The applications of such a method are principally connectivity studies, multivariate analyses and fusion with other modalities.

This means a prior decomposition of a video sequence into semantically meaningful, physical objects. We develop a fast yet robust color segmentation algorithm based on DWT and k-means clustering. After spatial segmentation, a dense optical flow field is estimated for the whole image, using which a motion parameter model is estimated for each region using a least squares technique. Adjacent regions with a coherent motion are then merged together to form moving objects. This leads to segmented video.

In this paper we propose a system to extract the features from compressed MPEG video based on the motion vector information. The global features like motion activity and camera motion parameters are extracted from the decoded motion vectors and the object features such as speed, area and trajectory are obtained after the object segmentation stage. The number of objects in a given video shot is determined by the proposed K-means clustering algorithm and the object segmentation is done by applying EM algorithm.

Skin colors are modeled by a set of three Gaussian clusters, each of which is characterized by a centroid and a covariance matrix. The centroids and covariance matrices are estimated from large set of training samples after a k-means clustering process. Pixels in a color input image can be classified into skin or non-skin based on the Mahalanobis distances to the three clusters. Efficient post-processing techniques namely noise removal, shape criteria, elliptic curve fitting and face/non-face classification are proposed in order to further refine skin segmentation results for the purpose of face detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel clustering method based on a linear discriminant analysis methodology which deals with the problem of FR on a large-scale database. Contrary to traditional clustering methods such as K-means, which are based on certain "similarity criteria", the proposed here method uses a novel "separability criterion", to partition a training set from the large database into a set of K smaller and simpler subsets or maximal-separability clusters (MSCs). Based on these MSCs, a novel two-stage hierarchical classification framework is proposed. Under the framework, the complex FR problem on a large database is decomposed into a set of simpler ones, where traditional methods can be successfully applied. Experiments with a database containing 1654 face images of 157 subjects indicate that the error rate performance of a traditional method under the proposed framework is able to be greatly improved without significantly increasing computational complexity.

A tree structured K-means clustering is introduced which will hierarchically group images into similar groups. Providing the nodes of the different levels with representative image samples leads to different "image maps" similar to street maps with various resolutions of details. The user can zoom into various cluster levels to obtain more or less details if required. Further a new query refinement method is introduced. The retrieval process is controlled by learning from positive examples from the user, often called the relevance feedback of the user. The combination of the relevance feedback and the hierarchical structure together with a threedimensional visualization of the "image maps" leads to an intuitive browsing environment. The results obtained verify the attractiveness of the approach for navigation and retrieval applications.

Based on the extracted eye corners, upper eye boundaries and the position points of the eyebrows, a feature region is limited to a local searching area. Separating the local searching area into several sub-areas and performing K-means clustering in each sub-area, we can obtain a rough region of each eyebrow. The rough contour obtained by tracking the rough eyebrow region is defined as an initial snake. Then the accurate eyebrow contour can be extracted by our improved snake method. Some prior knowledge about the shape of the object is being used in both clustering and the snake method. Lastly, an application of using the extracted eyebrow contours for face recognition is presented. The experimental results show that our method can detect the eyebrow contours with high accuracy and the eyebrow contour is useful for face recognition.

The algorithm also provides symbol reliability information and block reliability information that can be used for iterative soft-decision decoding, errors-and-erasures decoding, adaptive modulation algorithms, and retransmission algorithms. The reliability information has the additional benefit that it can be determined even if amplitude scaling (due to an AGC device) is unknown. A reduced complexity algorithm has also been investigated. Numerical results are presented for a variety of modulation formats with Reed-Solomon coding and errors-and-erasures decoding in a fading channel. Compared with other techniques, results show that these algorithms, as a function of performance and complexity, perform extremely well.

IEEE Comp Soc			INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEPARATION	Conventional remote sensing classification techniques that model the data in each class with a multivariate Gaussian distribution are inefficient, as this assumption is generally not valid in practice. We present a novel, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based approach for unsupervised classification of hyperspectral imagery. ICA, employed for a mixture model, estimates the data density in each class and models class distributions with non-Gaussian structure, formulating the ICA mixture model (ICAMM). We apply the ICAMM for unsupervised classification of a test image from the AVIRIS sensor. Four feature extraction techniques namely Principal Component Analysis, Segmented Principal Component Analysis, Orthogonal Subspace Projection and Projection Pursuit have been considered as preprocessing steps for reducing the data dimensionality. The results demonstrate that the ICAMM significantly outperforms the K-means algorithm for land cover classification of hyperspectral imagery implemented on reduced data sets. Moreover, datasets extracted using Segmented Principal Component Analysis produce the highest classification accuracy.

Using probability distributions over verb subcategorisation frames, we obtained an intuitively plausible clustering of 57 verbs into 14 classes. The automatic clustering was evaluated against independently motivated, hand-constructed semantic verb classes. A series of post-hoc cluster analyses explored the influence of specific frames and frame groups on the coherence of the verb classes, and supported the tight connection between the syntactic behaviour of the verbs and their lexical meaning components.

Some people have developed complicated models ([1]), even more than 10 models per digit. Unfortunately, such models are not fit for portable device due to either huge memory demand and/or resource consume. This paper addressed on this problem and gave out some modification not only in feature extraction, better clustering method (M-F algorithm)([2]), but improved recognition algorithm (M-K-Means). For TIDIGITS speech database, the paper got over 97% string accuracy rate (for digits' length varies from 1 to 7), for speaker independent mode test. It has the advantage, simple model, (1 model per digit), less computation, easy to implement in hardware with DSP chip.

The median cut algorithm has superior data hiding qualities due to its prismic nature even though the palette is sub-optimal. In addition, considerable savings on computation time are made. The presence of the median cut algorithm in image processing packages implies that this algorithm becomes a simple and integrable tool for steganographic communication.

A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by computing a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by computing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function.

It offers a new simple and powerful soft-max adaptation rule. The adaptation process is the same as the on-line K-means clustering method except for adding random fluctuation in the distortion error evaluation process. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm can achieve efficient adaptation as high as the "neural gas" algorithm, which is reported as one of the most efficient clustering methods. It is a key to add uncorrelated random fluctuation in the similarity evaluation process for each reference vector. For hardware implementation of this process, we propose a nanostructure, whose operation is described by a single-electron circuit. It positively uses fluctuation in quantum mechanical tunneling processes.

For this purpose, we have studied data from four meteorological towers within the city of Cartagena, a Mediterranean city located at Southeast of Spain, with a complex topography for wind circulation, Semi-hourly data for wind parameter Pave been used through different hours of the day, representing the daily wind behaviour. These values, projected on a X-Y axis have been processed thorough a factor analysis in order to avoid colineality. After the factor scores were calculated from the factorial matrix, a two-step cluster analysis procedure, using both hierarchical (average linkage) and non-hierarchical techniques (k-means) was performed. This classification scheme identified five distinct wind flows, which were represented for each meteorological station using wind roses. An homogeneous behaviour for each cluster within each meteorological station was determined. Once different wind flows were identified for this area, total daily pollen concentrations were studied, associated to each cluster situation. In this sense, statistically significant differences were determined. This analysis will be further used to develop refined regression models of pollen concentrations, in order to get better results than those obtained with the whole data.

The two resulting algorithms are called COMPARE-MEANs and SORT-MEANS. The time for an iteration of K-means is reduced from O(ndk), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters and d the dimension, to O(ndgamma + k(2)d + k(2) log k) for SORT-MEANS. Here gamma less than or equal to k is the average over all points p of the number of means that are no more than twice as far as p is from the mean p was assigned to in the previous iteration. COMPARE-MEANS performs a similar number of distance calculations as SORT-MEANS, and is faster when the number of means is very large. Both modifications are extremely simple, and could easily be added to existing clustering implementations. We investigate the empirical performance of the algorithms on three datasets drawn from practical applications. As a primary test case, we use the Isodata variant of K-means on a sample of 2.3 million 6-dimensional points drawn from a Landsat-7 satellite image. For this dataset, gamma quickly drops to less than log(2)k, and the running time decreases accordingly. For example, a run with k = 100 drops from an hour and a half to six-, teen minutes for COMPARE-MEANS and six and a half minutes for SORTMEANS. Further experiments show similar improvements on datasets derived from a forestry application and from the analysis of BGP updates in an IP network.

These distortions are sensor viewing (scanning) angle dependent, thus they can be significant for data received from airborne sensors due to their wide field of view. The procedure is based solely on the digital image data and consists of several steps. First, the initial image region near nadir (minimal distortions) is clustered by an extended k-means algorithm, which automatically detects the clusters (surface types) in an image. Then, for each cluster an average line profile is calculated. These profiles (initially defined in a middle part of an image fine) are extrapolated to the whole line of an image by a polynomial approximation. Finally, from these polynomial functions the linear regression over all clusters is build using the radiative transfer equation, which allows the radiometric correction for each viewing angle in an image relative to the reference angle, usually nadir. The procedure is iterative, that is the correction is first performed for a narrow part around the initial region. Then the procedure is initialized with this newly corrected image region and repeated until the whole image is corrected. The experiments for data acquired by airborne multispectral scanner DAEDALUS AADS 1268 ATM show the effectiveness of the proposed method especially for the mosaicking and classification applications.

This algorithm was implemented in Java, and tested on a randomly selected 200-gene subset of 3000 genes from cellcycle data in S. cerevisiae. AlignACE was used to evaluate the resulting optimized cluster set for upstream cis-regulons. The optimized cluster set was found to be of comparable quality to cluster sets obtained by two established methods (complete linkage and k-means), even when provided with only a small, randomly selected subset of the data (200 vs 3000 genes), and with absolutely no supervision. MAP and specificity scores of the highest ranking motifs identified in the largest clusters were comparable.

In this paper, a clustering approach is used to segment color images. Clustering is usually done using a single point or vector as a cluster prototype. The data can be clustered in the input or feature space where the feature space is some nonlinear transformation of the input space. The idea of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) was introduced to align data along principal components in the kernel or feature space. KPCA is a nonlinear transformation of the input data that finds the eigenvectors along which this data has maximum information content (or variation). The principal components resulting from KPCA are nonlinear in the input space and represent principal curves. This is a necessary step as colors in RGB are not linearly correlated especially considering illumination effects such as shading or highlights. The performance of the k-means (Euclidean distance-based) and Mixture of Principal Components (vector angle-based) algorithms are analyzed in the context of the input space and the feature space obtained using KPCA. Results are presented on a color image segmentation task. The results are discussed and further extensions are suggested.

J	Latosinska, JN; Kasprzak, J; Utrecht, R				Latosinska, JN; Kasprzak, J; Utrecht, R			Studies of molecular dynamics of thiazides by Cl-35 NQR spectroscopy and DFT calculation	APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE			English	Article							AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS	Molecular dynamics of three derivatives of 1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), althiazide (ATZ) and chlorothiazide (CTZ), was studied by Cl-35 nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency was analyzed within the 6 known standard models. The activation energies estimated from the temperature dependence of the Cl-35 NQR frequency assuming the Bayer model were 1.07, 2.35 and 2.76 kJ/mol for HCTZ, ATZ and CTZ respectively, which confirms that HCTZ is less rigid than CTZ and ATZ is much more rigid than HCTZ, and.suggests that the mechanism of relaxation is based on small amplitude librations. The characteristic temperatures estimated from the Bayer model, with that for CTZ (332.5 K) being much higher than for HCTZ (132.1 K), mean that the intermolecular interactions in CTZ are much stronger than in HCTZ, as suggested by the melting point of CTZ being higher than that for HCTZ. For ATZ the characteristic temperature (288 K) takes an intermediate value, which suggests that the intermolecular interactions in this compound are stronger than in HCTZ and weaker than in CTZ. A significant narrowing of the resonance Cl-35 NQR line observed for all these compounds at room temperature, relative to that at the liquid nitrogen temperature, suggests an averaging of dipolar interactions as a result of fast rotation of nonquadrupole nuclei in the vicinity of the quadrupole nuclei, when 2piv(Q)tau(c) much greater than 1 (a rotation of the -NH2 group in the direct neighborhood of the chlorine nuclei) or a change in the gradient orientation with its value preserved (which is equivalent to rotation of the quadrupole nucleus Q. The influence of the rotations of the -NH2 and -CH2SCH2CH=CH2 groups (ATZ) or -CHCl2 group (TCTZ) on the Cl-35 NQR frequency was modelled by the B3LYP/6-31G* method. The frequencies of the libration vibrations calculated from the temperature dependence of the NQR resonance frequency were compared with experimental ones and those implied by the density functional theory, infrared and Raman spectra. For HCTZ the anomalies in the temperature dependence of the Cl-35 NQR frequency, the lack of hysteresis and small but notable changes in the slope and the jump in the frequency observed at 253 K which does not exceed 0.05 MHz suggest a second-order phase transition at 253 K.

Results of these algorithms depend on several parameters, e.g., the number of clusters. However, there is no theoretical criterion to determine such parameters'. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a method using mixture of PCA models trained by a variational Bayes (VB) estimation. In our method, good clustering results are selected based on the free energy obtained within the VB estimation. Furthermore, by taking an ensemble of estimation results, a robust clustering is achieved without any biological knowledge. Our method is applied to a clustering problem for gene expression data during a sporulation of Bacillus subtilis and it is able to capture characteristics of the sigma cascade.

The objective is to extract spatial clusters of spectrally related pixels having specified and distinctive spatial characteristics. K-means reclustering has three steps: spectral cluster initialization, spectral clustering and spatial re-clustering, plus an optional dimensionality reduction step. It provides an alternative to classical ATC algorithms based on anomaly detection, in which pixels are classified as type "anomaly" or "background clutter." K-means reclustering is used to cue targets of various sizes in AVIRIS imagery. Statistical performance and computational complexity are evaluated experimentally as a function of the designated number of spectral classes (K) and the initially specified spectral cluster centers.

Pioneered by Freund(1) and Schapire, (2) numerous variations of the AdaBoost algorithm have emerged, such as Breiman's arc-fs algorithms. (3) The central theme of these methods is the generation of an ensemble of a weak learning algorithm using modified versions of the original training set, with emphasis placed on the more difficult instances. The validation stage then aggregates results from each element of the ensemble using some predetermined rule. In this paper the wavelet decomposition based codebook classifier proposed by Chan et al.(4) is used as the learning algorithm. Starting with the whole training set, modifications to the training set are made at each iteration by re-sampling the original training data set with replacement. The weights used in the re-sampling are determined using different algorithms, including AdaBoost and arc-fs. The accuracies of the ensembles generated are then determined using various combination techniques such as simple voting and weighted sums. Boosting improves upon the two classifier methods (K-means and LVQ) by exploiting their inherent codebook nature.

Experiments on the magnetic remanence of honeybees have shown the presence of magnetite nanoparticles, aligned transversely to the body axis on the anterodorsal abdomen horizontal plane. These results support the hypothesis of ferromagnetic sensors for the magnetoreception mechanism. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study identified isolated magnetite nanoparticles and aggregates of these particles with a low temperature transition (52 K - 91 K). Hysteresis curves of Apis mellifera abdomens organized parallel and perpendicular to the applied magnetic field were obtained from 5K to 310K. At low temperatures, the hysteresis curves indicate a preferential orientation of the magnetic easy axis parallel to the body axis. The saturation (J(s)) and remancrit (J(r)) magnetizations, coercive field (H-c) and initial susceptibility (chi) were obtained. Results were interpreted based on the presence of magnetite nanoparticles with 50 K and 120 K mean blocking temperatures.

Because of the complexity and the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression profiles, the dimensional reduction of raw expression data and the feature selections necessary for, for example, classification of disease samples remains a challenge. To solve the problem we propose a two-level analysis. First self-organizing map (SOM) is used. SOM is a vector quantization method that simplifies and reduces the dimensionality of original measurements and visualizes individual tumor sample in a SOM component plane. Next, hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering is used to identify patterns of gene expression useful for classification of samples. Results: We tested the two-level analysis on public data from diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The analysis easily distinguished major gene expression patterns without the need for supervision: a germinal center-related, a proliferation, an inflammatory and a plasma cell differentiation-related gene expression pattern. The first three patterns matched the patterns described in the original publication using supervised clustering analysis, whereas the fourth one was novel. Conclusions: Our study shows that by using SOM as an intermediate step to analyze genome-wide gene expression data, the gene expression patterns can more easily be revealed. The "expression display" by the SOM component plane summarises the complicated data in a way that allows the clinician to evaluate the classification options rather than giving a fixed diagnosis.

Methods Official mortality data were analysed in relation to the underlying causes of death. The population of children aged 12-60 months, disaggregated by sex and age, was estimated for each year. Educational levels, income, employment status, and other socioeconomic indices were also assessed. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used for the statistical processing of time series. The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure of generalized least squares regression analysis was used to estimate the regression parameters with control of first-order autocorrelation. Spatial data analysis employed the discrimination of death rates and socioeconomic indices at the inner city district level, For classifying area-level death rates the method of K-means cluster analysis was used, Spatial correlation between variables was analysed by the simultaneous autoregressive regression method. Findings There was a steady decline in death rates during the 1980s at an average rate of 3.08% per year, followed by a levelling off. Infectious diseases remained the major cause of mortality, accounting for 43.1% of deaths during the last three years of the study. Injuries accounted for 16.5% of deaths. Mortality rates at the area-level clearly demonstrated inequity in the city's health profile: there was an increasing difference between the rich and the underprivileged social strata in this respect. Conclusion The overall mortality rate among children aged 12-60 months dropped by almost 30% during the study period. Most-of the decline happened during the 1980s. Many people still live in a state of deprivation in underserved areas. Time-series and spatial data analysis provided indications of potential value in the planning of social policies promoting well-being, through the identification of factors affecting child survival and the regions with the worst health profiles, to which programmes and resources should be Preferentially directed.

A femoral head with large necrotic lesions may progress to collapse, and ultimately require a total hip arthroplasty (THA). This paper proposes an automatic technique for segmentation and quantitative assessment of necrotic lesions of the femoral head using coronal MRI data. Quantification of ANFH consists of the following steps: (1) Rough segmentation of non-necrotic lesions of the femur by 3D grey morphological operations and 3D region growing techniques. (2) Fitting a 3D ellipse to the femoral head utilizing the anatomical information of the femur, and employing principal component analysis and simulated annealing algorithm. (3) Classification of necrotic and non-necrotic lesions of the femoral head inside the ellipse by a k-means Clustering technique. (4) Normalizing the 3-D ellipse to a sphere and extracting features such as size, orientation, centeroid, principal components, etc. of necrotic lesions. Feasibility of the method is demonstrated on 40 sets of in vivo T1-weighted MR images of actual patients.

First, a document clustering algorithm based on swarm intelligence is employed. It is derived from a basic model interpreting ant colony organization of cemeteries. Swarm intelligence for flexibility, self-organization and robustness has been applied in a variety of areas. Taking advantage of these traits, good initial clusters are obtained at first phase in CSIM. Then, we combine it with the classical k-means clustering method by using the clusters as initial centers. CSIM inherits the prominent properties of both swarm intelligence and k-means. It also offsets the weakness of those two techniques. Experimental results show the good performance of the hybrid document clustering algorithm.

It proves to be useful for understanding and suggesting significant criteria. With Gaussian clustering models, for instance, the parametrization of the variance matrix of a cluster in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition allows to propose many general clustering criteria from the simplest (k-means criterion) to the most complex. Mixture models can also deal with very different situations such as quantitative data, binary data, spatial data, missing data, partially classified samples, order constraints on clusters or outliers. This paper intends to illustrate the application of mixture models to various clustering situations from classical Gaussian models to multivariate binary observation vectors located at neighboring geographic sites.

For each of the 82 cases a standardised minimum documentation is collected, consisting of both 1000 hPa maps and surface wind speed fields covering the whole Mediterranean area. Storms are then classified according to the location of the low pressure centre, by means of a k-means cluster analysis. Thereafter the time development of representative events of each cluster is investigated considering time sequences of various fields starting from the early stage of the storms. The boundary layer structure in areas of wave generation is finally considered (vertical wind-shear, static stability, Richardson number). Concluding remarks are referred to the peculiar meteorological features of Mediterranean sea storms.

In essence, principal points are the theoretical counterparts of cluster means obtained by a k-means clustering algorithm. There has been considerable effort to find efficient estimation procedures for principal points. It is well known that under certain conditions the k-means estimator is a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the population principal points. In this paper some material on principal points is reviewed and new algorithms for the estimation of principal points in univariate distributions (univariate principal points) are proposed. Additionally, the Bootstrap approach is applied to assess the variability of the suggested estimators.

We make use of algorithms that define partitions by maximal support planes (MSP) of a convex function and have been profoundly investigated by Potzelberger and Strasser (2000). This is a wide range class containing as special cases both the well known k-means algorithm and the Kohonen (1985) algorithm. We compare the quality of the clustering procedures by first applying them to multivariate data sets and then treating a k-sample problem. For computing the test statistics the data points are replaced by their conditional expectations with respect to the MSP-partition. Monte Carlo simulations of power functions for tests that are carried out as multivariate permutation tests show a vital and decisive connection between the optimal choice of the algorithm and the tails of the probability distribution of the data. Especially for distributions with heavy tails the performance of k-means type algorithms totally breaks down.

Rather than requiring parameter choices to be predetermined, the result represents all possible levels of granularity. In this paper a hierarchical method is introduced that is fundamentally related to partitioning methods, such as k-medoids and k-means, as well as to a density based method, namely center-defined DENCLUE. It is superior to both k-means and k-medoids in its reduction of outlier influence. Nevertheless it avoids both the time complexity of some partition-based algorithms and the storage requirements of density-based ones. An implementation is presented that is particularly suited to spatial-, stream-, and multimedia data, using P-trees(1) for efficient data storage and access.

It is constructed so that it should be possible to follow the events shown in the video by moving along the lines. Content plots were previously computed by clustering together frames that are contiguous in time. We propose to cluster together frames if they are related by a short chain of similarly looking frames even if they are not adjacent on the time-line. The computational problem can be formulated as a graph clustering problem that we solve by extending the classic k-means technique to graphs. This new graph clustering algorithm is the main technical contribution of this paper.	Univ Texas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA	Schweitzer, H (reprint author), Univ Texas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.

The clusters were formed in heart models of end-systolic and end-diastolic cardiac phases. The minimum number of clusters for different lead systems, cardiac phases and in volume conductor models determined for least square error approximation of non-clustered (original) transfer model are tabulated These numbers suggested that the number current dipole sources could be reduced to less than 10% of that of the source locations. Some of the heart models segmented by the resulting clusters are presented at the end of this article.

The analysis of the data on online customers has not been given adequate effort. The difficulty of accurate assessment of online customer behaviors is due to its complexity, disorganized knowledge about it, and the lack of effective and valid tools to measure and predict it. The technology of data mining has provided the opportunity to extract interesting knowledge from large amount of data. Since the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is one of the most powerful general nonlinear modeling techniques, we have built a back office analytical system based on it and returned our classification. and prediction results back to the consumer. The purpose of the research is to develop a system to help better understand customer online purchasing behaviors and to assist the customer relationship management campaigns of e-business enterprises. The system aims to classify online customers and predict their purchasing behaviors according to their demographics and attitudes toward online shopping. The data used for model building and testing was collected through a website. A group of students at City University of Hong Kong participated in the data collection process to provide their online shopping behaviors. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with other mature classification tools, namely, K-means clustering and multiple discriminate analysis (MDA) tools. The results show better precision with the designed system.

S	Brimicombe, AJ		Zanasi, A; Brebbia, CA; Ebecken, NFF; Melli, P		Brimicombe, AJ			Cluster discovery in spatial data mining: a variable resolution approach	DATA MINING III	MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Data Mining	SEP 25-27, 2002	BOLOGNA, ITALY	Wessex Inst Technol			QUANTITATIVE METHODS; TRENDS; GIS	Spatial data mining seeks to discover meaningful patterns from data where a key dimension of the data is geographical location. This spatial dimension becomes important when data either refer to specific locations and/or have significant spatial dependence and which needs to be taken into consideration if meaningful patterns are to emerge. For point data there are two main groups of approaches. One stems from traditional statistical techniques such as k-means clustering in which every point is assigned to a spatial grouping and results in a spatial segmentation. The segmentation has k sub-regions, is usually space filling and non-overlapping (i.e. a tessellation) in which all points fall within a spatial segment. The difficulty with this approach is in defining k centroid locations at the outset of any data mining. The other broad approach searches for 'hotspots' which can be loosely defined as a localised excess of some,incidence rate. In this approach not all points are necessarily assigned to clusters. It is the mainstay of those approaches which seek to identify any significantly elevated risk above what might be expected from an at-risk background population. Definition of the population at risk is clearly critical and in some data mining applications is not possible at the outset. This paper presents a novel variable resolution approach to cluster discovery which acts in the first instance to define spatial concentrations in the absence of population at risk. The cluster centroids are then used to establish initial centroids for techniques such as k-means clustering and arrive at a segmentation on the basis of point attributes. The variable resolution technique can thus be viewed as a bridge between the two broad approaches towards knowledge discovery in mining point data sets. The technique is equally applicable to the mining of business, crime, health and environmental data. A business-oriented case study is presented here.

The basic approach is clustering procedures for extracting hidden states of the typhoon, and we also analyze the temporal dynamics of the typhoon in terms of transitions between hidden states. The clustering procedures include both spatial and spatio-temporal clustering procedures, including K-means clustering, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) combined with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The result of clustering is visualized on the "Evolution Map" on which we analyze and visualize the temporal structure of the typhoon cloud patterns. The results show that spatio-temporal clustering procedures outperform spatial clustering procedures in capturing the temporal structures of the evolution of the typhoon.

The neural memory model proposed in this paper is based upon generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs) which are the paradigms of radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NNs). With the benefit of their quick learning capability and robustness, the application of GRNNs has been rapidly increased in many disciplines. Then, within the context of a newly proposed hierarchically arranged generalized regression neural network (HA-GRNN), two psychological functions, intuition and attention, are interpreted in terms of the evolution of the HA-GRNN. Within the framework of HA-GRNN, two types of memory, namely both the long and short term memory motivated from biological and cognitive studies, are considered and a dynamic learning system is thus proposed. In the simulation study, the effectiveness of the HA-GRNN in comparison with k-means clustering method is confirmed within the context of pattern classification tasks.

In order to provide information of high value a customized recommender system is required. One of the typical information retrieval techniques for recommendation systems in Electronic Commerce is collaborative filtering which is based on the ratings of other customers who have similar preferences. However, collaborative filtering may not provide high quality recommendation because it does not consider customer's preferences on the attributes of an item and the preference is calculated only between a pair of customers. In this paper we present an improved recommendation algorithm for collaborative filtering. The algorithm uses the K-Means Clustering method to reduce the search space. It then utilizes a graph approach to the best cluster with respect to a given test customer in selecting the neighbors with higher similarities as well as lower similarities. The graph approach allows us to exploit the transitivity of similarities. The algorithm also considers the attributes of each item. In the experiment the EachMovie dataset of the Digital Equipment Corporation has been used. The experimental results show that our algorithm provides better recommendation than other methods.

This system allow ants to discriminate between nestmates and intruders, and thus to create homogeneous groups of individuals sharing a similar odor by continuously exchanging chemical cues. This phenomenon, known as "colonial closure", inspired us into developing a new clustering algorithm and then comparing it to a well-known method such as K-MEANS method. Our results show that our algorithm performs better than K-MEANS over artificial and real data sets, and furthermore our approach requires less initial information (such as number of classes, shape of classes, limitation in the types of attributes handled).

The main reasons for this are the potentially complex nature of implementing adaptation knowledge and the difficulties associated with acquiring quality knowledge in the first place and competently maintaining it over time. For these reasons most CBR systems are designed to leave the adaptation component to the expert and therefore function simply as case retrieval systems as opposed to truly reasoning systems. Here we present a competent adaptation strategy, which uses a modified regression algorithm to automatically discover and implement locally specific adaptation knowledge in CBR. The advantages of this approach are that the adaptation knowledge acquisition process is automated, localised, guaranteed to be specific to the task at hand, and there is no adaptation knowledge maintenance burden on the system. The disadvantage is that the time taken to form solutions is increased but we also show how a novel indexing scheme based. on k-means clustering can help reduce this overhead considerably.

To fuse these two data sets the sensor images are first segmented by a k-means algorithm and then features are extracted by blob analysis. These image features are compared with the features of the projected airport data using fuzzy logic in order to identify the runway in the sensor image and to improve the aircraft navigation data. This process is necessary due to inaccurate input data i.e. position and attitude of the aircraft. After identifying the runway, obstacles can be detected using the sensor image. The extracted information is presented to the pilot's display system and combined with the appropriate information from the MMW radar sensor in a subsequent fusion processor. A real time image processing procedure is discussed and demonstrated with IR measurements of a FUR system during landing approaches.

In this paper, we generated a testable hypothesis based on the current usage of ecoregions: the ecoregion classification will allow for discrimination between lakes of different water quality. The ecoregion classification should also be more effective better than a comparably scaled classification based on political boundaries, land-use class, or random grouping. To test this hypothesis we used the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) lake water chemistry data from the northeast United States. The water chemistry data were reduced to four components using principal component analysis. For comparison to an optimal grouping of these data we used K-means cluster analysis to define the extent at which these lakes could be segregated into distinct classes. Jackknifed discriminant analysis was used to determine the classification rate of ecoregions, the three alternative spatial classification methods, and the clustering algorithm. The classification based on ecoregions was successful for 35% of the lakes included in this study, in comparison to the clustered groups accuracy of 98%. These results suggest that the large scale spatial distribution of ecosystem types is more complicated than that suggested by the present ecoregion boundaries. Further tests of ecoregion delineations are needed and alternative large-scale management strategies should be investigated.

J	Berger, JD; Robertson, LD; Cocks, PS				Berger, JD; Robertson, LD; Cocks, PS			Genotype x environment interaction for yield and other plant attributes among undomesticated Mediterranean Vicia species	EUPHYTICA			English	Article						V. narbonensis; V. sativa; V. johannis	SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA; SEED YIELD; LEGUMES	In order to investigate the agricultural potential of the genus Vicia, and identify traits associated with productivity and responsiveness to environment, 34 undomesticated Mediterranean accessions representing Section Narbonensis ( V. johannis, V. narbonensis) and V. sativa were grown in five contrasting environments in northern Syria (growing season rainfall: 76-290 mm). Highly significant genotype x environment interactions were observed for all traits. For most of the components of yield, accession mean performance (productivity) was highly correlated with responsiveness across environments ( r = 0.59-0.96), as defined by joint linear regressions. Thus high yielding genotypes tended to be relatively more productive than low yielding genotypes under conditions that favoured high yields. Regression analysis revealed that mean site yields were positively correlated to rainfall (r = 0.85) and its attendant effect on growing season length as measured by cumulative season temperature and phenology ( r = 0.59-0.81). In order to examine yield related traits independently of taxonomy, genotypes were grouped into three categories using K-means clustering based on productivity and responsiveness of seed, hay and biological yield. Highly productive/responsive genotypes were tall with high harvest index, large seeds and low fecundity (seeds and pods per plant), whereas unproductive/unresponsive plants tended to be short, highly fecund, with small seeds and low harvest index. Principal components analysis showed that responsiveness, in terms of seed, hay and biological yields, was closely related to phenological plasticity. Thus highly productive/responsive genotypes were able to start flowering earlier than unproductive/unresponsive genotypes in early environments, but significantly later in late, higher rainfall environments. Plant growth habit was also related to yield responsiveness. In environments with little biomass production the proportion of erect plants was high in all three categories. In more favourable, high biomass environments, the proportion of erect plants in unproductive/unresponsive genotypes fell dramatically, but was unchanged among productive/responsive genotypes. We suggest that for unproductive/unresponsive genotypes competition for light is increased under optimal growth conditions. We argue that the optimal combination of fixed and responsive traits in high yielding genotypes results in a `compound interest-type' response to more favourable environments. Highly productive and responsive genotypes can capture resources more effectively than their low yielding counterparts, leading to a positive relationship between performance and responsiveness for most components of yield. Differences in productivity and responsiveness for seed, hay and biological yield reflected Vicia taxonomy, increasing in the following order from low to high: V. johannis, V. sativa, the small seeded V. narbonensis ( salmonea, jordanica, affinis) V. n. var. narbonensis, and finally V. n. var. aegyptiaca. V. n. var. aegyptiaca showed the most agricultural potential, since the taxon contained all the properties of productive/responsive genotypes listed above, yielding >1 t/ha under extremely arid conditions (104 mm), and >2.5 t/ha on 290 mm rainfall, confirming its potential for dry environments.

The proposed algorithm is designed to run on parallel computers of the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model type with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). A comparison is made between PFCM and an existing parallel k-means (PKM) algorithm in terms of their paxallelisation capability and scalability. In an implementation of PFCM to cluster a large data set from an insurance company, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to have almost ideal speedups as well as an excellent scaleup with respect to the size of the data sets.

Our format is both general and flexible. All IEEE formats are a subset of our format, as are all previously published floating-point formats for reconfigurable hardware. We have developed a library of fully parameterized hardware modules for format control, arithmetic operations and conversion to and from any fixed-point format. The format converters allow for hybrid implementations that combine both fixed and floating-point calculations. This permits the designer to choose between the increased range of floating-point and the increased precision of fixed-point within the same application. We illustrate the use of this library with a hybrid implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images.

The image is requantized using K-Means clustering. Then, clusters are expanded using region growing and morphological processing. This provides the most detailed level of segmentation. The next coarser segmentation levels are obtained by steadily relaxing the inter-cluster distance between the clusters that is allowed by the morphological processing. Results are demonstrated on real-world images and swathes of Brodatz textures.

However, there are still problems to solve, such as the clustering methods. Conditional K-Means Algorithm utilizes Euclidean distance taking all data distribution as sphericity, which is not the distribution of the actual data In this paper we present a new method to make use of covariance information to direct the clustering of GMMs, namely covariance-tied clustering. This method is consisted of two parts: obtaining the covariance matrices using data sharing technique based on binary tree and making use of the covariance matrices to direct clustering. The experiments results prove that this method leads to worthwhile reductions of error rates in speaker identification. Much remains to be done to explorefully the covariance information.

A good classification algorithm can give an accurate index that is able to search a fingerprint database more effectively. In this paper, we present a fingerprint classification algorithm that is based on directional fields. We compute directional fields of fingerprint image and detect singular points (cores). Then, we extract features that we define from fingerprint image. We also use k-means classifier and 3-nearest neighbor to classify feature and distinguish which fingerprint is Arch, Left Loop, Right Loop, or Whorl. Experimental results show a significant improvement in fingerprint classification performance. Moreover, the time required for the classification algorithm is reduced.

Exploring the conditional coregulation of yeast gene expression through fuzzy k-means clustering	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article								Background: Organisms simplify the orchestration of gene expression by coregulating genes whose products function together in the cell. Many proteins serve different roles depending on the demands of the organism, and therefore the corresponding genes are often coexpressed with different groups of genes under different situations. This poses a challenge in analyzing whole-genome expression data, because many genes will be similarly expressed to multiple, distinct groups of genes. Because most commonly used analytical methods cannot appropriately represent these relationships, the connections between conditionally coregulated genes are often missed. Results: We used a heuristically modified version of fuzzy k-means clustering to identify overlapping clusters of yeast genes based on published gene-expression data following the response of yeast cells to environmental changes. We have validated the method by identifying groups of functionally related and coregulated genes, and in the process we have uncovered new correlations between yeast genes and between the experimental conditions based on similarities in gene-expression patterns. To investigate the regulation of gene expression, we correlated the clusters with known transcription factor binding sites present in the genes' promoters. These results give insights into the mechanism of the regulation of gene expression in yeast cells responding to environmental changes. Conclusions: Fuzzy k-means clustering is a useful analytical tool for extracting biological insights from gene-expression data. Our analysis presented here suggests that a prevalent theme in the regulation of yeast gene expression is the condition-specific coregulation of overlapping sets of genes.

Inversions of direct arrival traveltimes and amplitudes have provided electromagnetic velocity and attenuation tomograms that have allowed critical hydrological structures and parameters to be determined. An integrated interpretation of the velocity and attenuation tomograms was performed via a k-means cluster analysis. As a result of this multivariate statistical analysis, major trends in the relationship between velocity and attenuation were identified, thus enabling us to outline the major hydrostratigraphic units of the surveyed deposit.

Palettization is one way to decrease storage and memory requirements for low-end displays. Palettization is generally approached as a clustering problem, where one attempts to find the k palette colors that minimize the average distortion for all the colors in an image. This would be the optimal approach if the image was to be displayed with each pixel quantized to the closest palette color. However, to improve the image quality the palettization may be followed by error diffusion. In this work, we propose a two-stage palettization where the first stage finds some m << k clusters, and the second stage chooses palette points that cover the spread of each of the 1 clusters. After error diffusion, this method leads to better image quality at less computational cost and with faster display speed than full k-means palettization.

Additional databases such as socio-economic databases constructed from census and survey data can be purchased to supplement customer databases. One of the difficulties in fusing separate databases however is that the information is based on two different samples and rarely can a unique individual be identified in both samples. Usually a common set of variables are used to determine the similarities between customers in the two samples, and various methods have been proposed for then predicting the missing information from one sample based on the information contained in the other sample. While some complicated methods have been proposed for data fusion, in this paper we investigate the validity of a simple clustering approach. Using a set of variables common to both samples, clusters are generated based on the k-means algorithm. The likely values of missing variables are then inferred based on the average values within the relevant cluster. An out-of-sample test set is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the fused variable predictions.

Clustering in data mining is very useful to discover distribution patterns in the underlying data. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the same partition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper, we present a new data clustering method for data mining in large databases. Our simulation results show that the proposed novel clustering method performs better than the Fast SOM combines K-means approach (FSOM+K-means) and Genetic K-Means Algorithm (GKA). In addition, in all the cases we studied, our method produces much smaller errors than both the FSOM+K-means approach and GKA.

Otherwise, they will lead to a poor clustering performance. Unfortunately, it is often hard to determine k* in advance in many practical problems. Under the circumstances, Xu et al. in 1993 proposed an approach named Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (RPCL) algorithm that can perform appropriate clustering without knowing the cluster number by automatically driving extra seed points far away from the input data set. Although RPCL has made great success in many applications, its performance is however much sensitive to the selection of the de-learning rate. To our best knowledge, there is still an open problem to guide this rate selection. In this paper, we further investigate RPCL with presenting a mechanism to dynamically control the rival-penalizing forces. Consequently, we give out a rival penalized controlled competitive learning (RPCCL) approach, which circumvents the selecting problem of the de-learning rate by always fixing it at the same value as the learning rate.

While FLANN II develops inconsistencies in clustering, influenced by data arrangements, K-FLANN bolsters this issue, through relocation of the clustered centroids. Results of the investigation are presented along with a discussion of the fundamental behavior of K-FLANN. Comparisons are made with the K-Means Clustering algorithm and the Kohonen SOM [5]. A further discussion is provided on how K-FLANN can qualify as an alternative method for fast classification.

This increases the numb of radioports and therefore it increases the infra-structure cost of the network. Optimal placement of radioports can yield significant savings. This paper proposes two algorithms for placement of radioporis in order to minim the maximum path loss experienced by wireless handsets. The first algorithm is a local heuristic search method based on the Sebestyen algorithm. The second is a hybrid of the genetic and K-means algorithms. Simulations results show that for small floor plans there is placement error in Sebestyen solutions. However, most solutions produced the hybrid algorithm are global optimums and the algorithms is two orders of magnitude more efficient than an exhaustive search.

We enhance the popular k-means clustering algorithm to integrate user-supplied domain-knowledge into the cluster generation step. This provides a convenient way to exclude scenes from the summary which are a-priori known to be irrelevant. Furthermore, we added an additional, time-constrained clustering step preceding the scene clustering step to exclude short ranges with transitional content. This makes the algorithm robust to fading and wipe-effects in the input without requiring explicit cut detection.

One approach being evaluated involves a simple two date multispectral unsupervised classification approach to map forest change at a national scale with Landsat data. Key factors are the types and consistency of change classes that emerge from the clustering algorithms and issues related to labelling these into desired change classes. The technique was investigated using two sites. Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada used 1990 and 1999 imagery. The second site of Petawawa in eastern Ontario, has fifteen images from a time period from 1984 to 2001 that were normalized and then analyzed in various image pairs. Utilizing the six visible and infrared Landsat bands from each of two dates in a K-means hyperclustering, classes of conifer, hardwood and mixedwood that had not changed were separated. Before any amalgamation, many clusters were associated with change, especially changes in vegetation on old cuts and open fields. Post-clearing ground vegetation density and type had a moderate influence on the clustering process. Pre-clearing forest type was only a factor in general terms, for example whether it was hardwood, softwood or mixedwood. Clearcuts often had several clusters associated with them, but were well detected when clusters were amalgamated. Partial cuts were only partly detected. The length of time after the cut was an important consideration in their detection. They were detectable for only 2 or 3 years after the cutting. The above approach is expected to be one of several tools used in the EOSD initiative.

Given that approximately 50% of the earth is covered in cloud at any time, one of the significant challenges in creating repeatable and robust classifications is to understand and appropriately address cloud contamination in Landsat images. The scope of many of the large area mapping projects and the associated large volumes of data to be processed suggest that unsupervised classifications and automated processes may be necessary to obtain timely results. An experiment was developed to investigate the effect of cloud contamination on unsupervised classifications. It was determined that when a small number of classes are used cloud effects in the cloud-free portion of the scene can often be managed by allocating the majority of clusters to clouds. When a large number of classes are required, clouds significantly skew the non-cloud cluster characteristics.

Friedelin, 3-alpha -hydroxyfriedelan-2-one, betulin, betulinic acid, beta -sitosterol and sitost-4-en-3-one were identified and their molar percentages were calculated by C-13 NMR spectroscopy, following a procedure recently developed by our group. The results were submitted to chemometric analysis (k-means and principal component analysis), which allowed three groups to be distinguished with respect to the content of friedelin, betulinic acid and 3-alpha -hydroxyfriedelan-2-one.

Not only is this new algorithm applicable to ellipse-shaped data clusters rather than just to ball-shaped ones like the k-means algorithm, but also it can perform appropriate clustering without knowing cluster number by gradually penalizing the winning chance of those extra seed points during learning competition. Although the existing RPCL (Xu et al. 1993) can automatically select the cluster number as well by driving extra seed points far away from the input data set, its performance is much sensitive to the selection of the de-learning rate. To our best knowledge, there is still no theoretical result to guide its selection as yet. In contrast, the proposed k*-means algorithm need not determine this rate. We have qualitatively analyzed its rival-penalized mechanism with the results well-justified by the experiments.

From one point of view it is just a subsequent cluster analysis applied to the centers of clusters obtained in the first clustering. Such a double clustering procedure attains its effectiveness especially when a certain structure of causality (which often exists in the real, large data sets) is taken into account. Since we introduce a rather broad class of algorithms - which seems to be a quite general attempt - a very specific form of presentation is necessary. We present therefore methodology for a specific dataset to make the development of analysis and interpretation of its results more concrete.

To enable classification based image or visual object retrieval, we propose a new image representation scheme called visual context descriptor (VCD) that is a multidimensional vector in which each element represents the frequency of a unique visual property of an image or a region. VCD utilizes the predetermined quality dimensions (i.e., types of features and quantization level) and semantic model templates mined in priori. Not only observed visual cues, but also contextually relevant visual features are proportionally incorporated in VCD. Contextual relevance of a visual cue to a semantic class is determined by using correlation analysis of ground truth samples. Such co-occurrence analysis of visual cues requires transformation of a real-valued visual feature vector (e.g., color histogram, Gabor texture, etc.,) into a discrete event (e.g., terms in text). Good-feature to track, rule of thirds, iterative k-means clustering and TSVQ are involved in transformation of feature vectors into unified symbolic representations called visual terms. Similarity-based visual cue frequency estimation is also proposed and used for ensuring the correctness of model learning and matching since sparseness of sample data causes the unstable results of frequency estimation of visual cues. The proposed method naturally allows integration of heterogeneous visual or temporal or spatial cues in a single classification or matching framework, and can be easily integrated into a semantic knowledge base such as thesaurus, and ontology. Robust semantic visual model template creation and object based image retrieval are demonstrated based on the proposed content description scheme.

Often the implication is that points in different clusters come from different underlying classes, whereas those in the same cluster come from the same class. Stochastically, the underlying classes represent different random processes. The inference is that clusters represent a partition of the sample points according to which process they belong. This paper discusses a model-based clustering toolbox that evaluates cluster accuracy. Each random process is modeled as its mean plus independent noise, sample points are generated, the points are clustered, and the clustering error is the number of points clustered incorrectly according to the generating random processes. Various clustering algorithms are evaluated based on process variance and the key issue of the rate at which algorithmic performance improves with increasing numbers of experimental replications. The model means can be selected by hand to test the separability of expected types of biological expression patterns. Alternatively, the model can be seeded by real data to test the expected precision of that output or the extent of improvement in precision that replication could provide. In the latter case, a clustering algorithm is used to form clusters, and the model is seeded with the means and variances of these clusters. Other algorithms are then tested relative to the seeding algorithm. Results are averaged over various seeds. Output includes error tables and graphs, confusion matrices, principal-component plots, and validation measures. Five algorithms are studied in detail: K-means, fuzzy C-means, self-organizing maps, hierarchical Euclidean-distance-based and correlation-based clustering. The toolbox is applied to gene-expression clustering based on cDNA microarrays using real data. Expression profile graphics are generated and error analysis is displayed within the context of these profile graphics. A large amount of generated output is available over the web.

It uses a probabilistic greedy Kaufman initialization to get initial solutions and K-Means as a local search algorithm. The approach is a new initialization one for K-Means. Hence, we compare it with some typical initialization methods: Random, Forgy, Macqueen and Kaufman. Our empirical results suggest that the hybrid GRASP - K-Means with probabilistic greedy Kaufman initialization performs better than the other methods with improved results. The new approach obtains high quality solutions for eight benchmark problems.

In this paper we focus on finding a partition of the rows of a given database, that is as close as possible to the partitions associated to each attribute. We evaluate the closeness of two partitions by using a generalization of the classical conditional entropy. From this perspective, we wish to construct a partition (referred to as the median partition) such that the sum of the dissimilarities between this partition and all the partitions determined by the attributes of the database is minimal. Then, the problem of finding the median partition is an optimization problem, over the space of all partitions of the rows of the database, for which we give an approximative solution. To search more efficiently the large space of possible partitions we use a genetic algorithm where the partitions are represented by chromosomes. Our genetic algorithm obtains better clustering results than the classical k-means algorithm.

Various interesting links between ASLT and classical weak limit theorem were found during the last decade, mainly for the case when zeta(k) axe normalized sums of independent variables. We assume in this work zeta(k) to be a normalized value of discrete-time martingale. We show that weak limit theorem does not imply ASLT even under good moment assumptions (an effect impossible for sums of independent variables). Our main result, Theorem 5.2, contains, however, sufficient conditions for ART under assumptions very close to-those used in weak limit theorems. An interesting new feature of this result-appearance of random limit measure G.

Identification of subgroups within the database could help elucidate clinical trends and facilitate future model building. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering were used to identify clusters in a large, heterogeneous computer-aided diagnosis database based on mammographic findings (BI-RADS(TM)) and patient age. The clusters were examined in terms of their feature distributions. The clusters showed logical separation of distinct clinical subtypes such as architectural distortions, masses, and calcifications. Moreover, the common subtypes of masses and calcifications were stratified into clusters based on age groupings. The percent of the cases that were malignant was notably different among the clusters. Cluster analysis can provide a powerful tool in discerning the subgroups present in a large, heterogeneous computer-aided diagnosis database.

In this paper, we proposed a novel united active contour model with the information of image region feature and image gradient feature for the purpose of tumor detection. Region-based method added in the model, however, introduces a statistical method into the segmentation of the image and hence becomes less sensitive to noise. The originality in this algorithm is that we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) into the statistical model description of "seed" region. This model can perform more accurate and optimal statistical description than a single Gaussian model. A K-means algorithm and an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are used for optimal parameter estimation of GMM. The experimental results show the new model has more optimal performance for image segmentation and boundary finding than classical active contour model.

Fast, accurate and reproducible segmentation of MRI is desirable in many applications. We have developed a new unsupervised MRI segmentation method based on k-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithms, which uses spatial constraints. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Markov Random Field model. The result of segmentation with a four-neighbor Markov Random Field model applied to multi-spectral MRI (5 images including one T1-weighted image, one Proton Density image and three T2-weighted images) in different noise levels is compared to the segmentation results of standard k-means and FCM algorithms. This comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms previous methods.	Univ Teheran, Tehran, Iran	Khalighi, MM (reprint author), Univ Teheran, Tehran, Iran.

However, when we need to classify the tissues according to their physiological functions, those strategies are not satisfactory. In this study, we incorporated both tissue time-activity curves (TACs) and derived "kinetic parametric curves (KPCs)" information to segment brain tissues, such as striatum, gray and white matters, in dynamic FDOPA-PET studies. Four common clustering techniques, K-mean (KM), Fuzzy C-mean (FCM), Isodata (ISO), Markov Random Fields (MRF), and our method were compared to evaluate its precision. The results show 40% and 27% less mean errors in mean difference for KPCs and TACs, respectively, than other methods. Combined KPCs and TACs based clustering method provide the ability to define brain structure effectively.

ANN has been widely used in pattern recognition, prediction and classification. In the artificial neural network approach, we compare radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and wavelet neural networks for multispectral image classification. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the neural network model for multispectral image classification. Radial basis function neural network is used for its advantages of rapid training, generality and simplicity over feed-forward backpropagation neural network. The k-means clustering is used to choose the initial radial basis centers and widths for the RBFNN. The wavelet is a localized function that is capable of detecting some features in signals. A wavelet basis function is assigned for each neuron and each synaptic weight is determined by learning. An attempt is also made to study the performance of the RBFNN with the centers and widths chosen using the classical k-means clustering.

PAIN			English	Article						complex regional pain syndrome; reflex sympathetic dystrophy; causalgia; diagnosis; patient subtypes; stages	REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; IASP DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; SYMPTOMS	This study tested for evidence supporting the clinical lore of three sequential stages of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and examined the characteristics of possible CRPS subtypes. A series of 113 patients meeting IASP criteria for CRPS underwent standardized history and physical examinations to assess CRPS signs and symptoms in four domains identified in previous research: pain/sensory abnormalities, vasomotor dysfunction, edema/sudomotor dysfunction, and motor/trophic changes. K-Means cluster analysis was used to derive three relatively homogeneous CRPS patient subgroups based on similarity of sign/symptom patterns in these domains. The resulting CRPS subgroups did not differ significantly regarding pain duration as might be expected in a sequential staging model. However, the derived subgroups were statistically-distinct. and suggested three possible CRPS subtypes: (1) a relatively limited syndrome with vasomotor signs predominating. (2) a relatively limited syndrome with neuropathic pain/sensory abnormalities predominating, and (3) a florid CRPS syndrome similar to 'classic RSD' descriptions. Subtype 3 showed the highest levels of motor/trophic signs and possible disuse-related changes (osteopenia) on bone scan, despite having directionally the briefest pain duration of the three groups. EMG/NCV testing suggests that Subtype 2 may reflect CRPS-Type 2 (causalgia). Overall, these results are consistent with limited previous work that argues against three sequential stages of CRPS, However, several distinct CRPS subtypes are suggested, and these could ultimately have utility in targeting treatment more effectively.

J	Wei, J				Wei, J			Image segmentation based on situational DCT descriptors	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						image segmentation; DCT; clustering; K-means	TEXTURE	It is of utmost importance in multimedia processing to achieve still image segmentation, i.e., to partition images into regions of coherent color and texture. In this paper we propose a novel image segmentation method using a special visual descriptor. For each pixel p, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the block centered on p together with its location in the image is employed as its content descriptor thus resulting in a long vector (v) over right arrow (p), referred to as situational DCT descriptors (SDDs). A scalar quantization step is then carried out on the DCT component of SDDs to reflect the fact that the human vision system is not of uniform discriminative sensitivity to details of different frequencies, Next the principal component analysis is conducted to drastically reduce: the dimensionality of SDDs. The adaptive K-means algorithm is then performed to arrive at the region assignment for each pixel. The final partitioning results are obtained after performing the post-processing step. Encouraging empirical performance has been demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Naldi, M				Naldi, M			A mixture model for the connection holding times in the Video-on-Demand service	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION			English	Article						traffic models; mixture models; holding time; Video-on-Demand	INTERACTIVE VIDEO; INCOMPLETE DATA; ARCHITECTURE; PROJECT; TRIALS; SYSTEM	A fundamental traffic parameter for the design of a network supporting the Video-on-Demand service is the connection holding time. This holding time is usually characterized by its average value and, possibly, by its probability density function (pdf). In this paper, a model is proposed for this density, consisting of a mixture of Gaussian pdf's, whose parameters are estimated through the combination of the K-means algorithm and of a recursive likelihood maximization procedure. The model has been applied to a data set extracted from a video catalogue. Exponential and log-normal models have been fitted to the same data set by comparison. For all three models, the chi-square statistic and the Akaike Information Criterion result to be much lower for the mixture model than for the other two. In addition, the shape of the mixture pdf resembles more closely the multimodal characteristic of the empirical data. This results have been obtained with a mixture of limited complexity, being made up of a small number of Gaussian components (three or four). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

B	Endrikhovski, S			IS&T; IS&T	Endrikhovski, S			Beyond the visual system: A cognitive model of color categorization and its application to color image quality	PICS 2002: IMAGE PROCESSING, IMAGE QUALITY, IMAGE CAPTURE, SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	Image Processing, Image Quality, Image Capture and Systems Conference (PICS2002)	APR 07-10, 2002	PORTLAND, OR	Agta Geraert Grp, Appl Sci Fict, Eastman Kodak Co, Hewlett Packard, Konica Corp, Lexmark Int Inc, Polaroid Corp, Xerox Corp			BASIC COLORS; MEMORY; OBJECTS	The paper presents a cognitive model of color categorization and discusses its applications to color image quality. The structure of color categories is argued to resemble the structure of the distribution of colors in the perceived world. This distribution can be represented as color statistics in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color categorization can be modeled through the grouping of color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). This model explains the location, and rank of color categories. The model might be considered as a first step towards developing a uniform cognitive color space. The equality of distances between color categories can be the criterion of uniformity for such a space. It is argued that some image processing techniques (e.g., gamut mapping, color quantization, segmentation, coding etc.) might be more appropriate to perform in a cognitively uniform color space.

The presented method consists of three procedures: First, the object detection procedure, in which the rough positions of moving objects in an image sequence are determined using an adaptive thresholding method; Second, the object segmentation procedure, in which pixels that have similar intensity and motion information segments are grouped using a weighted k-means clustering algorithm to the binary motion mask obtained in the object detection; Finally, the object recognition procedure, in which a neural network is used to recognize whether the segmented objects are vehicles, humans, or other objects. The experimental results demonstrate robustness not only in variations of luminance conditions, but also for occlusions among multiple moving objects.

We introduce a method of combining a self-organizing map (SOM) and a k-means clustering for analyzing and categorizing the gene expression data. The SOM is an unsupervised neural network learning algorithm and forms a mapping the high-dimensional data to two-dimensional space. However, it is difficult to find clustering boundaries from results of the SOM. On the other hand, the k-means clustering can partition the data into the clusters under the assumption of the known number of clusters. In order to understand easily the results of SOM, we apply the k-means clustering to finding the clustering boundaries from results of SOM. We have applied the proposed method to the published data of yeast gene expression and show that the method is effective for categorizing the data.

The methodology is based on calculation of the degree of similarity between multivariate time-series datasets using two similarity factors. One similarity factor is based on principal component analysis and the angles between the principal component subspaces while the other is based on the Mahalanobis distance between the datasets. The standard K-means algorithm is modified to cluster multivariate time-series datasets using similarity factors. Data from a highly nonlinear acetone-butanol fermentation example are clustered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Comparisons with existing clustering methods show several advantages of the proposed methodology.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Underwater Technology	APR 16-19, 2002	TOKYO, JAPAN	IEEE Oceanic Engn Soc, Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, US Off Naval Res Int Field Off, Asia		ambient noise imaging; acoustic daylight; second-order statistics; spatial imaging; image fusion; clustering		Acoustic daylight, second-order temporal and second-order spatial imaging are three algorithms that have been devised for ambient noise imaging. This paper proposes two enhancements (enhancement I and II) to improve the image quality obtained by spatial imaging. Enhancement I repeats the original spatial imaging algorithm for a limited number of times and achieves an improvement of up to 10.5dB. Enhancement II uses linear programming to maximize the separation between the target and non-target sets, achieving up to 2 dB benefit. Enhancement I and II are combined to produce a better result than enhancement I alone with its highest improvement at a further 7.5 dB. We also propose a fusing algorithm, using K-mean clustering with a validity measure, to combine images produced by different algorithms so as to improve the stability and false alarm rejection of the images. An average additional improvement of 2 dB is obtained when compared to direct fusing without using clustering. Better results are usually obtained if the features (i.e. results from different algorithms at a particular pixel) at one channel are sorted prior to clustering.

In each iteration and for each pixel, an energy function computed for windows of increasing size is evaluated. The initial window size is defined as a function of the separability between neighboring pixels. The increments of the window size axe a function of the internal to external entropy ratio of discs of consecutive radii. For a,given pixel, the minimum value of the energy function is preserved and used as the initial guess for the next iteration. This minimum corresponds to the estimated point in which a state of higher order emerges. The scheme proposed was tested on a set of synthetical images, and compared to the output of the iterative median filter and to the k-Means algorithm, showing better performance than these ones. Results axe shown on dermatological and fundus digital images.	Tech Univ Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark	Maletti, G (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

The basic mouth shapes are the gist which breaks away different states during continuous speech recognition or sequence lip-movement images recognition. A recognition approach based on the mouth basic shape classified, compared with that based on feature-vector directly can reduce the cases of state branch to rather great extent, shrink the searching space and expedite the convergent rate. This paper introduces experiment results of how to select the number of original clustering center and how to select features which are benefit to mouth shape classification. Arid there are 15 categories of mouth basic shape extracted from 4680 sequence images of the Chinese language by experiments. By Chinese single syllables recognizing experiments, the approach based on mouth shape categories has a higher accurate rate and speed than that without them.

Numerous chemical immobilization agents are available. We compared the efficacy and physiological effects of 2 white-tailed deer immobilizing agents: medetomidine-ketamine (M-K) antagonized with atipamezole, and xylazine-Telazol (X-T) antagonized with tolazoline. Mean induction time was longer and more variable for M-K. Mean reversal time and total down time was longer and more variable for X-T. Mean blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in subjects treated with M-K was lower immediately following inducticn. We detected no differences in mean SpO(2) at >5 minutes post induction or for mean rectal temperature or pulse rate at any time during the monitoring period between the 2 groups. Each agent appeared to offer advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific circumstances of the capture event.

In this article we deal with the grouping of rows and columns of a matrix with non-negative entries. Two rows (or columns) are considered similar if corresponding cross-distributions are close. This grouping is a dual clustering of two sets of elements, row and column indices. The introduced approach is based on the minimization of reduction of mutual information contained in a matrix that represents the relationship between two sets of elements. Our clustering approach contains many parallels with K-Means clustering due to certain common algebraic properties. The obtained results have many applications, including grouping of Web visit data.

It investigates whether and to what degree small-scale anthropogenic processes can still be recognised and identified in the spatial distribution of this type of archaeological record. The approach adopted integrates the output of extensive morphological, technological, functional, and refitting analyses into various methods of processing (including K-means analysis) and spatial visualisation. It is demonstrated that high-resolution patterns of past human behaviour can still be detected, both in small loci reflecting a limited range of activities, and in larger concentrations generated by a more extended succession of activities. Notwithstanding acknowledged post-depositional displacement, the distribution of the artefacts still provides clear spatial indications of the activities performed at two loci from the Federmesser site of Rekem that are taken as examples.

Neural network models are characterized by topology, activation function and learning rules. The wavelet neuron model is obtained by replacing an activation function with wavelet bases in the traditional neuron model. The wavelet is a localized function that is capable of detecting some features in signals. A wavelet basis function is assigned for each neuron and each synaptic weight is determined by learning. Wavelet neural networks are used in this study to process remotely sensed data and classify soil based on its moisture content. To evaluate the effectiveness of the wavelet neural networks, a soil moisture data set consisting of 750 vectors, each with three components (surface temperature, brightness temperature at L-Band (TB-L) and at S-Band (TB-S)) and some remotely sensed images are evaluated in the experiments. A comparison with Backpropagation networks is investigated for the supervised training of remotely sensed data and classification of soil moisture.

To help achieve this goal, we have developed a fast algorithm to detect hazards on a planetary surface using a single image from a descent spacecraft camera. This paper proposes a general approach of segmentation and classification for hazard detection and describes an implementation of this approach. The implemented algorithm uses local intensity clustering to segment the image into regions and then classifies these regions as hazards or part of the surface. We have tested our methodology using synthetic terrain images as well as real images.

Conventional clusters have crisp boundaries, i.e. each object belongs to only one cluster. The clusters and associations in data mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. An object may belong to more than one cluster. Researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in data mining clustering applications. Recently, two different methodologies based on properties of rough sets were proposed for developing interval representations of clusters. One approach is based on Genetic Algorithms, and the other is an adaptation of K-means algorithm. Both the approaches have been successful in generating intervals of clusters. The efficiency of the clustering algorithm is an important issue when dealing with a large dataset. This paper provides comparison of the time complexity of the two rough clustering algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a new link-based clustering approach to cluster search results returned from Web search engine by exploring both co-citation and coupling. Unlike document clustering algorithms in IR that are based on common it words/phrases shared among documents, our approach is based on common links shared by pages. We also extend standard clustering algorithm, K-means, to make it more natural to handle noises and apply it to web search results. By filtering some irrelevant pages, our approach clusters high quality pages in web search results into semantically meaningful groups to facilitate users accessing and browsing. Preliminary experiments and evaluations are conducted to investigate its effectiveness, The experimental results show that link-based clustering of web search results is promising and beneficial.

Unlike previous trash analysis systems,. this platform is able to accurately and precisely quantify the amount of foreign matter present in a sample in the presence of both illuminant degradation and fiber color variations by employing a new Bayesian Weighted K-Means (BWKM) approach to image segmentation. The design of the BWKM algorithm is presented in detail and its performance is verified and compared with other clustering techniques using both synthetic and real imagery.

This is also the case in steel manufacturing. The recorded databases in rolling process contain hundreds of features and new methods are needed to reveal the novel and useful information. In this study, the data from a hot strip rolling process was analyzed in order to identify the conditions in which retentions occur. At the beginning, basic statistical analysis and linear correlation study were used to prepare the data and to make the search for the knowledge easier. With these two tools, the dataset was reduced from its original size of over 200 features into 17%. After this, self-organizing maps, parallel coordinates display and k-means clustering were used to find out the probabilities of the common retention types. As a result, the method presented here revealed the rolling conditions for the four common retention types. And what is most important, the features presenting these conditions can be measured before the finishing mill and, thus, these rules can be used to reduce the number of retentions.

Given embryonic stein cell gene expression data, we applied several indices to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms, including hierarchical clustering, k-means, PAM and SOM. The indices were homogeneity and separation scores, silhouette width, redundant score (based on redundant genes), and WADI? (testing the robustness of clustering results after small perturbation). The results showed that the ES cell dataset posed a challenge for cluster analysis in that the clusters generated by different methods were only partially consistent. Using this data set, we were able to evaluate the advantages and weaknesses of algorithms with respect to both internal and external quality measures. This study may provide a guideline on how to select suitable clustering algorithms and it may help raise issues in the extraction of meaningful biological information from microarray expression data.

Our method uses multiresolution decomposition of images using wavelets - in the HSV colorspace - to extract parameters at multiple scales allowing a progressive (coarse-to-fine) retrieval process. Features are automatically classified into several clusters with K-means algorithm. A model image is computed for each cluster in order to represent all the images of this cluster. The process is reiterated again and again and each cluster is sub-divided into sub-clusters. The model images are stored in a tree which is proposed to users for browsing the database. The nodes of the tree are the families and the leaves are the images of the database. A paleontology images database is used to test the proposed technique. This kind of approach permits to build a visual interface easy to use for users.

Similarity-measures based on different MPEG-7 descriptors are introduced and multidimensional scaling is employed to display images in three dimensions according to their mutual similarities. With such a view the user can easily see similarity relations between images and understand the structure of the database. In order to cope with large volumes of images a k-means clustering technique is introduced which identifies representative image samples for each cluster. Representative images (up to 100) are then displayed in three dimensions using multidimensional scaling structuring. The clustering technique proposed produces a hierarchical structure of clusters - similar to street maps with various resolutions of details. The user can zoom into various cluster levels to obtain more or less details if required. Further a new query refinement method is introduced. The retrieval process is controlled by learning from positive examples from the user, often called the relevance feedback of the user. The combination of the three techniques 3D-visualization, relevance feedback and the hierarchical structure of the image database leads to an intuitive browsing environment. The results obtained verify the attractiveness of the approach for navigation and retrieval applications.

The rainfall patterns are represented by the percentage departures from the normal rainfall of 12 stations spread uniformly over South Korea. The statistical technique employed is the k-means (KM) clustering method. The Euclidean distance has been used as a measure of similarity between the patterns. Four dominant types are obtained by this method, Inter-correlations among the types suggest that the dominant patterns are distinct. The summer monsoon rainfall shows an increasing trend. Investigation of the physical processes associated with these patterns using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data clearly reveals contrasting circulation features associated with the dominant types during the summer monsoon period. In particular, contrasting circulation features are related to the position, shape and strength of the North Pacific Subtropical High.

In this study, a northern North American study region of the hemispheric gridded 5 latitude by 10 longitude 500 hPa dataset is identified and analysed from 1959 to 1996 for a sequence of six monthly periods through the fire season, beginning in April and ending in September. Synoptic types, or modes of upper air behavior. are determined objectively by the eigenvector method employing K-means Cluster analysis. Monthly burned areas from the Canadian Large Fire Database (LFDB) for the same period, 1959 to 1996, are analysed in conjunction with the classified monthly 500 hPa synoptic types. Relationships between common monthly patterns of anomalous upper flow and spatial patterns of large fire occurrence are examined at the ecozone level. Average occurrence of a monthly synoptic type associated with very large area burned is approximately 18,c of the years from 1959 to 1996. The largest areas burned during the main fire (May to August) season occur in the western Boreal and Taiga ecozones - the Taiga Plains, Taiga Shield, Boreal West Shield and Boreal Plains, Monthly burned areas are also analysed temporally in conjunction with a calculated monthly zonal index (Zi(m)) for two separate areas defined to cover western and eastern Canada, In both western and eastern Canada. high area burned is associated with synoptic types with mid-tropospheric ridging in the proximity of the affected region and low Zi(m) with weak westerlies an strong meridional flow over western Canada.

The HCM is used extensively by traffic engineers. However, it is intended as an offline decision support tool for planning and design. To meet user requirements of advanced traffic management and information systems, new LOS criteria are required for real-time intersection analysis. The objective of this research was to demonstrate a technique for development of such LOS criteria. The study used a new measure of effectiveness, called reidentification delay (RD), derived from analysis of vehicle inductive signatures and reidentification of vehicles traveling through a major signalized intersection in the city of Irvine, California. Two main issues regarding real-time LOS criteria were tackled. The first was how to determine the threshold values partitioning the LOS categories. To provide reliable real-time traffic information, the threshold values should be decided on so that RDs within the same LOS category would represent similar traffic conditions as much as possible. RDs in different LOS categories should also represent dissimilar traffic conditions. The second issue concerned the aggregation interval to use for RD in deriving LOS categories. An investigation of both fixed and cycle-based aggregation intervals was conducted. Several clustering techniques were then employed to derive LOS categories, including k-means, fuzzy, and self-organizing map approaches. The resulting real-time LOS criteria were then determined. The procedures used in this study are readily transferable to other signalized intersections for the derivation of real-time LOS.

Our method, first determines prototype vectors by means of k-means. Then, these vectors are combined with the support vectors using geometric methods to define ellipsoids in the input space, which are later translated to if-then rules. In this way, it is possible to give an interpretation to the knowledge acquired by the SVM. On the other hand, the extracted rules render possible the integration of SVMs with symbolic AI systems.

The first method is based on recursive dynamic partitioning of a 3-D volume into a number of 3-D hyper-rectangles. For each hyper-rectangle, we consider, as a potential attribute, the number of voxels (volume elements) that belong to ROIs. A hyper-rectangle is partitioned only if the corresponding attribute does not have high discriminative power, determined by statistical tests, but it is still sufficiently large for further splitting. The final discriminative hyper-rectangles form new attributes that are further employed in neural network classification models. The second method is based on maximum likelihood employing non-spatial (k-means) and spatial DBSCAN clustering algorithms to estimate the parameters of the underlying distributions. The proposed methods were experimentally evaluated on mixtures of Gaussian distributions, on realistic lesion-deficit data generated by a simulator conforming to a clinical study, and on synthetic fractal data. Both proposed methods have provided good classification on Gaussian mixtures and on realistic data. However. the experimental results on fractal data indicated that the clustering-based methods were only slightly better than random guess, while the recursive partitioning provided significantly better classification accuracy.

A majority of proposed indexing techniques in the literature are based on features extracted from the entire image. In this paper, images are segmented by the K-mean clustering algorithm in order to allow searching, and retrieving at region level. Farther, the regions are classified into object and non-object classes as we may retrieve regions based on features tailored for the corresponding type. The object class contains clumped regions while the non-object class contains regions that scattered in the entire image scenes as constrained by X-2 statistic. The performance of the retrieval of four region indexing techniques, Histogram and three Wavelet-based techniques, are evaluated. The four indexing techniques are suitable for general domain image collections. The evaluation result has shown that, although, the three wavelet-based region indexing techniques provide a good comparable performances for non-object region queries, the histogram-based region indexing technique outperforms the three wavelet-based region indexing techniques for object region queries. The histogram technique is more suitable for indexing object regions. In the other hand the wavelet-based techniques are more suitable for non-object region indexing.

The same literature laments the lack of tools available to allow policy developers, resource managers and extension providers to predict adoption rates or to monitor the participation of farmers in programs. This paper describes a "farming styles" tool that has potential to address this current situation. An understanding of the social diversity of wool producers is very important in increasing the profitability, productivity and sustainability of the Australian wool industry. By understanding the attitudes, motives and preferences of a broad range of farmers, communications and extension programs can be better targeted and designed to suit farmers who have different preferences for learning and participation, as well as different ideas about what constitutes "good" farming. The "farming styles" tool described in this paper was trialed in the Loddon catchment of Victoria. Respondents to a mailed survey (n = 366, representing a 42% response rate), from all agricultural industries in the region, were assigned to ten groups by K-Means clustering, using their responses to 3 1 attitude and goal statements about fanning. Significant behavioural differences were found between these groups in terms of their participation in natural resource management programs, their adoption of information technology and quality assurance, and their participation in learning activities. Subsequent research in other regions of Victoria has similarly identified significant behavioural differences between styles of farmer in terms of their adoption of recommended practices and their participation in industry development.

This paper describes an approach to the extraction of higher level contexts from the multidimensional low level context information, focusing on the analysis and comparison of clustering and segmentation behaviour of crisp versus fuzzy information. Context clustering is performed by using the k-means algorithm and segmentation by using a minimum-variance algorithm. The results indicate that fuzzy quantization is superior to the crisp quantization with k-means, yielding more consistent clustering. Segment borders found from the fuzzy data correspond better to the real context changes than those found from the crisp data. Copyright ((C)) 2001 IFAC.

Both microwave emissions and thermophysical. data were collected as part of the Collaborative-Interdisciplinary Cryospheric Experiment between 15 May and 25 June 2000, in the Canadian High Arctic. Each season was characterized by a running variance of the time series in the microwave emissions. The seasonal analysis was conducted through observed changes in the physical characteristics of the sea ice and the overlying snow pack. Results from a k-means clustering analysis show that variability in the microwave response can be categorized into phenomenological states that were described by Livingstone et al. [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 1987; 25(2): 174-187] as winter, early melt, melt onset and advanced melt. We describe the average thermophysical. conditions associated with each one of these 'ablation states' and interpret the relative contributions of each to the observed microwave response. Emissivities were calculated and used as part of a descriptive analysis of the seasonal variation of TB. Our results confirm other findings that the strength and pattern of the relationship are frequency dependent and relative to snow and ice dielectric properties. Useful information on the, thermodynamic state of the snow-sea-ice system can be derived from passive microwave data, since the microwave emissions respond to the general seasonal changes associated with the transition from winter to a melt ponded sea ice surface.

The map is needed as part of a larger ecosystem assessment to help determine if bear movement and habitat use patterns are affected by changing landscape conditions and human activities. An Integrated Decision Tree Approach (IDTA) was developed that incorporated unsupervised (K-means) clustering, empirically-derived DEM- and GIS-based decision rules (proximity; slopes, etc.), and maximum likelihood supervised classification of forest and vegetation classes based on field sampling. This approach was based on an earlier finding, using a 1998 Landsat image in this area, that different classifiers performed at different levels of success in various classes. The map produced with the IDTA method was determined to be approximately 80% accurate (kappa = 0.783) using 494 randomly sampled points unambiguously identified on available digital orthophotography.

The directions are chosen as those that minimize and maximize the kurtosis coefficient of the projected data. It is shown that, under certain conditions, these directions provide the largest separation for the different clusters. The projected univariate data are used to group the observations according to the values of the gaps or spacings between consecutive-ordered observations. These groupings are then combined over all projection directions. The behavior of the method is tested on several examples, and compared to k-means, MCLUST, and the procedure proposed by Jones and Sibson in 1987.

J	Deng, SL; Latifi, S; Regentova, E				Deng, SL; Latifi, S; Regentova, E			Document segmentation using polynomial spline wavelets	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						document analysis; k-means classification; polynomial spline; segmentation; wavelet transform	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION	Wavelet transforms have been widely used as effective tools in texture segmentation in the past decade. Segmentation of document images, which usually contain three types of texture information: text, picture and background, can be regarded as a special case of texture segmentation. B-spline wavelets possess some desirable properties such as being well localized in time and frequency, and being compactly supported, which make them an effective tool for texture analysis. Based on the observation that text textures provide fast-changed and relatively regular distributed edges in the wavelet transform domain, an efficient document segmentation algorithm is designed via cubic B-spline wavelets. Three-means or two-means classification is applied for classifying pixels with similar characteristics after feature estimation at the outputs of high frequency bands of spline wavelet transforms. We examine and evaluate the contributions of different factors to the segmentation results from the viewpoints of decomposition levels, frequency bands and wavelet functions. Further performance analysis reveals the advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2001 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

Decidualization is critical for embryo implantation and placental function. We characterized gene expression pattern kinetics during decidual fibroblast differentiation by microarray analysis. Of 6,918 genes analyzed, 121 genes were induced by more than twofold, 110 were downregulated, and 50 showed biphasic behavior. Dynamically regulated genes were could be fit into nine K- means algorithm- based kinetic pattern groups, and by biologic classification, into five categories: cell and tissue function, cell and tissue structure, regulation of gene expression, expressed sequence tag (EST), and "function unknown." Reprogramming of genes within specific functional groups and gene families was a prominent feature that consisted of simultaneous induction and downregulation of a set of genes with related function. We previously observed a conceptually similar process during fetal trophoblast differentiation, in which the same phenomena applied to different genes. Of the 569 dynamically regulated genes regulated by either model, only 81 of these were in common. These results suggest that reprogramming of gene expression within focused functional categories represents a fundamental aspect of cellular differentiation.

J	Zhou, Q; Robson, M				Zhou, Q; Robson, M			Automated rangeland vegetation cover and density estimation using ground digital images and a spectral-contextual classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							TEXTURE SEGMENTATION; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; ARID RANGELANDS; INDEXES; REFLECTANCE; RELAXATION; LANDSCAPES; BIOMASS; SOIL	A method to estimate vegetation cover, density and background brightness parameters in a rangeland environment from low-altitude digital images is presented. A digital still-frame camera, mounted on a 5.2 m pole, is used to acquire images of the ground. The acquired images are then processed using an Unsupervised spectral-contextual classifier to extract quantitative measurements automatically. The test results show that the extracted cover measures from the fully automated procedure provide an accuracy of 0.89 to 0.99, measured in kappa, compared with 0.36 to 0.58 and 0.79 to 0.95 from k-means clustering and maximum likelihood supervised classifications respectively. For the clump density measure, the proposed method had an error level ranging from 0 to -62%-hundreds of times less than those produced from both k-means and maximum likelihood classifications. The presented method overcomes human subjectivity inherent in other commonly used ground investigation methods for estimating vegetation cover. The results provide an accurate and objective reference for the calibration of models which relate the spectral reflectance recorded by remote sensors to quantitative measures of range condition.

J	Wu, Y; Yan, D; Sharpe, MB; Miller, B; Wong, JW				Wu, Y; Yan, D; Sharpe, MB; Miller, B; Wong, JW			Implementing multiple static field delivery for intensity modulated beams	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						IMRT; leaf sequencing; optimization; radiotherapy	DYNAMIC MULTILEAF COLLIMATION; RADIATION-THERAPY; CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY; COMPENSATION; VERIFICATION; SURVIVAL	A clinically oriented two-dimensional intensity-modulated beam delivery method is implemented using multiple static segmented fields, i.e., the "step-and-shoot" approach. Starting with a desired "ideal" intensity distribution, it creates a multiple-level intensity approximation, and then constructs a sequence of segmented fields to deliver the multiple-level intensities using multileaf collimator (MLC) and independent backup jaws. The approach starts with a simple grouping of all the nonzero intensity values into a minimum number of clusters for a user specified deviation tolerance for the ideal plan. The k-means clustering algorithm is then employed to find the optimal levels of intensity that minimize the discrepancies between the ideal and the approximated intensities, without violating the user specified deviation tolerance. The multiple-level intensities are then decomposed into a sequence of machine deliverable segments. Apart from the first segment for each gantry angle, all the other segments are arranged to minimize the total travel distance of the leaves. The first segment covers the entire irradiated area and is used for treatment verification by electronic portal imaging. The implementation issues due to the physical constraints of the MLCs are also addressed. (C) 2001 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

J	Patane, G; Russo, M				Patane, G; Russo, M			The enhanced LBG algorithm	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						clustering; unsupervised learning; LBG; GLA; LVQ; K-means; hard c-means; fuzzy c-means	LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; FUZZY ALGORITHMS; IMAGE; COMPRESSION; NETWORKS; GLVQ	Clustering applications cover several fields such as audio and video data compression, pattern recognition, computer vision, medical image recognition, etc. In this paper we present a new clustering algorithm called Enhanced LBG (ELBG). It belongs to the hard and K-means vector quantization groups and derives directly from the simpler LBG. The basic idea we have developed is the concept of utility of a codeword, a powerful instrument to overcome one of the main drawbacks of clustering algorithms: generally, the results achieved are not good in the case of a bad choice of the initial codebook. We will present our experimental results showing the ELBG is able to find better codebooks than previous clustering techniques and the computational complexity is virtually the same as the simpler LBG.

In order to conduct this study we first reviewed the literature on marketing strategy to identify its key dimensions. We then conducted a survey of 1000 senior marketing executives about the strategic marketing practices adopted in their respective firms or business units, and developed scales to describe 11 strategic marketing activities. We next performed a K-means cluster analysis using these scales to develop a taxonomy of marketing strategy types consisting of: Aggressive Marketers, Mass Marketers, Marketing Minimizers, and Value Marketers. We then observed that superior performance at the firm or SBU level was achieved when specific marketing strategy types were matched with appropriate Miles and Snow (1978) business strategy types.

J	Landre, J; Truchetet, F; Montuire, S; David, B				Landre, J; Truchetet, F; Montuire, S; David, B			Automatic building of a visual interface for content-based multiresolution retrieval of paleontology images	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							WAVELET TRANSFORM; DATABASES; DECOMPOSITION	In this article we present research work in the field of content-based image retrieval in large databases applied to the paleontology image database of the Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France, called "TRANS'TYFIPAL." Our indexing method is based on multiresolution decomposition of database images using wavelets. For each family of paleontology images we try to find a model image that represents it. The K-means automatic classification algorithm divides the space of parameters into several clusters. A model image for each cluster is computed from the wavelet transform of each image of the cluster. Then a search tree is built to offer users a graphic interface for retrieving images. So users have to navigate through this tree of model images to find an image similar to that they are requesting. Our contribution in the field is the building of the model and of the search tree to make user access easier and faster. At the end of this article we give experimental results and a description of future work that will be done to enhance our indexing and retrieval method. (C) 2001 SPIE and IS&T.

J	Legendre, P; Gallagher, ED				Legendre, P; Gallagher, ED			Ecologically meaningful transformations for ordination of species data	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						biplot diagram; canonical correspondence analysis correspondence analysis; principal-component analysis; redundancy analysis	DISSIMILARITY; COMPONENTS; DIVERSITY; DISTANCE	This paper examines how to obtain species biplots in unconstrained or constrained ordination without resorting to the Euclidean distance [used in principal-component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA)] or the chi-square distance [preserved in correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] which are not always appropriate for the analysis of community composition data. To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.

Traditionally, filter bank decomposition methods consider the energy in each band as the textural feature, a parameter that is highly dependent on image intensity. In this paper, we use fractal-based features which depend more on textural characteristics and not intensity information. To reduce the total number of features used in the segmentation, the significance of each feature is examined using a test similar to the F-test, and less significant features are not used in the clustering process. The commonly used K-means algorithm is extended to an iterative K-means by using a variable window size that preserves boundary details. The number of clusters is estimated using an improved hierarchical approach that ignores information extracted around region boundaries. (C) 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

Dual data sets are classified using an iterative k-mean algorithm based on a maximum likelihood decision ride evaluated from the Wishart polarimetric density of the 6 x 6 coherency matrix. An alternative technique is also proposed which introduces the polarimetric cross - correlation information to refine the results of classification to a small number of clusters using the conditional probability of the cross-correlation matrix. Both new multifrequency polarimetric SAR data classification methods are applied to SAR data acquired over the Nezer forest (NASA /JPL AirSAR database (1989)).

One approach for disaggregation revolves around the de-convolution of the soil-landscape paradigm elaborated during a soil survey. The descriptions of soil ma units and block diagrams in a soil survey report detail soil-landscape relationships or soil toposequences that can be used to disaggregate map units into component landscape elements. Toposequences can be visualised on a computer by combining soil maps with digital elevation data. Expert knowledge or statistics can be used to implement the disaggregation. Use of a restructuring element and k-means clustering are illustrated. Another approach to disaggregation uses training areas to develop rules to extrapolate detailed mapping into other, larger areas where detailed mapping is unavailable. A two-level decision tree example is presented. At one level, the decision tree method is used to capture mapping rules from the training area; at another level, it is used to define the domain over which those rules can be extrapolated.

We developed a method to create 3-dimensional (3-D) continuous soil layer models describing the distribution of soil materials, reworked loess vs. glacial till. Soil attribute data such as texture, bulk density and water content, in combination with penetration resistance obtained with a profile cone penetrometer on a 10-m and, were used to describe soil materials and layers. We compared crisp hierarchical clustering with fuzzy k-mean classification in creating soil layer models for a 2.73-ha site in southern Wisconsin. The continuous 3-D soil layer models were developed using horizontal ordinary kriging and vertical linear interpolation. Validation proved that the crisp 3-D soil layer model predicted soil layers more accurately than the fuzzy 3-D soil layer model. We conclude that at the working scale, the crisp classification is superior to the fuzzy classification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yendrikhovskij, SN				Yendrikhovskij, SN			Computing color categories from statistics of natural images	JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BASIC COLORS	This article presents a framework for understanding, modeling, and computing color categories on the basis of knowledge from the color imaging science. One of the main assumptions advocated in this article is that the structure of color categories originates from the statistical structure of the perceived color environment that was observed throughout an individual's life. The perceived color environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enables one to predict the location, rank, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the model predictions are consistent with data from psycholinguistic studies. The model might be applied in different areas of imaging science such as color quantization, image quality, and gamut mapping.

J	Song, BC; Ra, JB				Song, BC; Ra, JB			Automatic shot change detection algorithm using multi-stage clustering for MPEG-compressed videos	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						video classification; shot change detection; cut, fade, dissolve; feature extraction; MPEG-compressed videos; k-means clustering		Automatic shot change detection has been recognized as an important research issue for video classification. This paper proposes an automatic clustering-based algorithm for shot change detection in MPEG-compressed videos with a small number of user-defined parameters. For accurate detection of abrupt and gradual shot changes, the proper selection and extraction of features are important. We first propose a fast edge image extraction scheme in the DCT domain on the basis of AC prediction. Then, by using the features extracted from the edge images and DC images, a two-stage clustering-based algorithm is proposed for shot change detection. In the first stage, the algorithm detects abrupt shot changes by employing two-means clustering on the 2-D feature space of histogram and pixel differences between two neighboring DC frames. In the next stage, it subsequently explores gradual shot changes between two adjacent abrupt shot changes by performing a two-step clustering scheme, which uses multiple features such as an edge energy diagram and several frame difference measures. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Design and Methods: Secondary analysis of data compiled by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (n = 2,079) was employed, and network types were derived through K-means cluster analysis. Respondents' morale scores were regressed on network types, controlling for background and health variables. Results: Five network types were derived. Respondents in diverse or friends networks reported the highest morale; those in exclusively family or restricted networks had the lowest. Multivariate regression analysis underscored that certain network types were second among the study variables in predicting respondents' morale, preceded only by disability level (Adjusted R-2 = .41). Implications: Classification of network types allows consideration of the interpersonal environments of older people in relation to outcomes of interest. The relative effects on morale of elective versus obligated social ties, evident in the current analysis, is a case in point.

Unlike previous works, we present a maximum-likelihood approach to the ringing-artifact removal problem. Our approach employs a parameter-estimation method based on the k-means algorithm with the number of clusters determined by a cluster-separation measure. The proposed algorithm and its simplified approximation are applied to JPEG2000 compressed images. Our results show effective and efficient removal of ringing artifacts.

J	De Backer, S; Scheunders, P				De Backer, S; Scheunders, P			Texture segmentation by frequency-sensitive elliptical competitive learning	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						unsupervised classification; competitive learning; mixture modelling; texture segmentation	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; QUANTIZATION; LIKELIHOOD	In this paper, a new learning algorithm is proposed with the purpose of texture segmentation. The algorithm is a competitive clustering scheme with two specific features: elliptical clustering is accomplished by incorporating the Mahalanobis distance measure into the learning rules and under-utilization of smaller clusters is avoided by incorporating a frequency-sensitive term. In the paper, an efficient learning rule that incorporates these features is elaborated. In the experimental section, several experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for the segmentation of textured images. On the compositions of textured images, Gabor filters were applied to generate texture features. The segmentation performance is compared to k-means clustering with and without the use of the Mahalanobis distance and to the ordinary competitive learning scheme. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others. A fuzzy version of the technique is introduced, and experimentally compared with fuzzy versions of the k-means and competitive clustering algorithms.

J	Dalezios, I; Siebert, KJ				Dalezios, I; Siebert, KJ			Comparison of pattern recognition techniques for the identification of lactic acid bacteria	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							NUMERICAL TAXONOMY; DIFFERENTIATION; CLASSIFICATION; LACTOBACILLUS; PRODUCTS	Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate three pattern recognition methods for use in the identification of lactic acid bacteria. Methods and Results: Lactic acid bacteria (21 unknown isolates and 30 well-characterized strains), including the Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus and Oenococcus genera, were tested for 49 phenotypic responses (acid production on carbon sources). The results were scored in several ways. Three procedures, k-nearest neighbour analysis (KNN), k-means clustering and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), were applied to the data. Conclusions: k-Nearest neighbour analysis performed better with five-point-scaled than with binary data, indicating that intermediate values are helpful to classification. k-Means clustering performed slightly better than KNN and was best with fuzzified data. The best overall results were obtained with FCM. Genus level classification was best with FCM using an exponent of 1.25. Significance and Impact of the Study: The three pattern recognition methods offer some advantages over other approaches to organism classification.

J	Burrough, PA; Wilson, JP; van Gaans, PFM; Hansen, AJ				Burrough, PA; Wilson, JP; van Gaans, PFM; Hansen, AJ			Fuzzy k-means classification of topo-climatic data as an aid to forest mapping in the Greater Yellowstone Area, USA	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						digital elevation models; Fuzzy k-means; GIS; landscape classification; topo-climatic analysis; vegetation mapping		Previous attempts to quantify topographic controls on vegetation have often been frustrated by issues concerning the number of variables of interest and the tendency of classification methods to create discrete classes though species have overlapping property sets (niches). Methods of fuzzy k-means classification have been used to address class overlap in ecological and geographical data but previously their usefulness has been limited when data sets are large or include artefacts that may occur through the derivation of topo-climatic attributes from gridded digital elevation models. This paper presents ways to overcome these limitations using GIS, spatial sampling methods, fuzzy k-means classification, and statistical modelling of the derived stream topology. Using data from a ca. 3600 km(2) forested site in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we demonstrate the creation of meaningful, spatially coherent topo-climatic classes through a fuzzy k-means classification of topo-climatic data derived from 100 m gridded digital elevation models (DEMs); these classes were successfully extrapolated to adjacent areas covering a total of ca. 10 000 km(2). Independently derived land cover data and middle infrared corrected Landsat TM derived estimates of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (M-NDVI) at 575 independently sampled sites were used to evaluate the topo-climatic classes and test their extrapolation to the larger area. Relations between topo-climatic classes and land cover were tested by chi (2) analysis which demonstrated strong associations between topo-climatic class and 11 of the 15 cover classes. Relations between M_NDVI and topo-climatic classes proved to be stronger than relations between M_NDVI and the independent cover classes. We conclude that the fuzzy k-means procedure yields sensible and stable topo-climatic classes that can be used for the rapid mapping of large areas. The value of these methods for quantifying topographic controls on biodiversity and the strength of their relations with computed NDVI values warrant further investigation.

The consecutive three-day gridded NCEP data with the precipitation event on the last day over South Korea are used for the cluster analysis. With the use of the precipitation chemistry monitored data at 8 sites in South Korea, wet depositions of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ belonging to each cluster are examined to identify the deposition levels for each cluster. The result indicates that the present methodology is found to identify the deposition levels clearly and be used more practically in the field of acid rain study without heavy computational requirement.

This methodology named for its features factorial k-means analysis has a very wide range of applications since it fulfills a double objective: data reduction and synthesis, simultaneously in the direction of objects and variables; variable selection in cluster analysis, identifying variables that most contribute to determine the classification of the objects. The least-squares fitting problem proposed here is mathematically formalized as a quadratic constrained minimization problem with mixed variables. An iterative alternating least-squares algorithm based on two main steps is proposed to solve the quadratic constrained problem. Starting from the cluster centroids, the subspace projection is found that leads to the smallest distances between object points and centroids. Updating the centroids, the partition is detected assigning objects to the closest centroids. At each step the algorithm decreases the least-squares criterion, thus converging to an optimal solution. Two data sets are analyzed to show the features of the factorial k-means model. The proposed technique has a fast algorithm that allows researchers to use it also with large data sets.

Various cellular mechanisms are triggered in germ cells after exposure to stress, but the expression of only a few of the genes involved in such pathways has been studied during spermatogenesis. In the present study we determined the expression profiles of 216 stress response genes in isolated rat germ cells (pachytene spermatocytes, and round and elongating spermatids) using cDNA atlas arrays. Of the 216 genes studied, 86 were detected in pachytene spermatocytes, 82 in round spermatids, and 52 in elongating spermatids. Fifty percent (48) of the total number of genes detected during spermatogenesis were detected in all three cell types while nearly 25% (25) were expressed exclusively in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids; some cell specific transcripts were observed also. The use of the K means clustering method allowed us to group genes by their pattern of expression during spermatogenesis; five specific expression profiles were obtained and analyzed. To determine how stress response genes are regulated throughout spermatogenesis, we examined the expression of genes involved in stress response mechanisms such as heat shock proteins-chaperones, DNA repair, and oxidative stress. Genes belonging to these families were differentially expressed during germ cell development. We suggest that the differential expression of stress response genes during spermatogenesis contributes to the selectivity of the susceptibility of germ cells to stress.

Automated extraction of clusters is an important first stage in deriving ANN training data from field samples, but AFC data pose a number of challenges for many types of clustering algorithm. The fuzzy k-means algorithm recently has been extended to address nonspherical clusters with the use of scatter matrices. Four variants were proposed, each optimizing a different measure of clustering "goodness". Methods: With AFC data obtained from marine phytoplankton species in culture, the four fuzzy k-means algorithm variants were compared with each other and with another multivariate clustering algorithm based on critical distances currently used in flow cytometry. Results: One of the algorithm variants (adaptive distances, also known as the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm) was found to be robust and reliable, whereas the others showed various problems. Conclusions: The adaptive distances algorithm was superior in use to the clustering algorithms against which it was tested, but the problem of automatic determination of the number of clusters remains to be addressed.

This study uses a modified k-means clustering to improve matched filter performance. Several simple bivariate cases are examined in detail, and the interaction of filtering and partitioning is discussed. We show that clustering can reduce within-class variance and group pixels with similar correlation structures. Both of these features improve filter performance. The traditional k-means algorithm is modified to work with a sample of the image at each iteration and is tested against two hyperspectral datasets. A new "extreme" centroid initialization technique is introduced and shown to speed convergence. Several matched filtering formulations (the simple matched filter, the clutter matched filter, and the saturated matched filter) are compared for a variety of number of classes and synthetic hyperspectral images. The performance of the various clutter matched filter formulations is similar, all are about an order of magnitude better than the simple matched filter. Clustering is found to improve the performance of all matched filter formulations by a factor of two to five. Clustering in conjunction with clutter matched filtering can improve fifty-fold over the simple case, enabling very weak signals to be detected in hyperspectral images.

Many hand gesture recognition methods using visual analysis have been proposed: syntactical analysis, neural networks, the hidden Markov model (HMM). In our research, an HMM is proposed for various types of hand gesture recognition. In the preprocessing stage, this approach consists of three different procedures for hand localization, hand tracking and gesture spotting. The hand location procedure detects hand candidate regions on the basis of skin-color and motion. The hand tracking algorithm finds the centroids of the moving hand regions, connects them, and produces a hand trajectory. The gesture spotting algorithm divides the trajectory into real and meaningless segments. To construct a feature database, this approach uses a combined and weighted location, angle and velocity feature codes, and employs a k-means clustering algorithm for the HMM codebook. In our experiments, 2400 trained gestures and 2400 untrained gestures are used for training and testing, respectively. Those experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields a satisfactory and higher recognition rate for user images of different hand size. shape and skew angle.

We used DNA microarray analysis to characterize the process by which human cytotrophoblast cells differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast cells in a purified cell culture system. Of 6,918 genes analyzed, 141 genes were induced and 256 were downregulated by more than 2-fold. Dynamically regulated genes were divided by the K-means algorithm into 9 kinetic pattern groups, then by biologic classification into 6 overall functional categories: cell and tissue structural dynamics, cell cycle and apoptosis, intercellular communication, metabolism, regulation of gene expression, and expressed sequence tag (EST) and function unknown. Gene expression changes within key functional categories were tightly coupled to morphological changes. In several key gene function categories, such as cell and tissue structure, many gene members of the category were strongly activated while others were strongly repressed. These findings suggest that differentiation is augmented by "categorical reprogramming" in which the function of induced genes is enhanced by preventing the further synthesis of categorically related gene products.

J	Acharyya, M; Kundu, MK				Acharyya, M; Kundu, MK			An adaptive approach to unsupervised texture segmentation using M-Band wavelet transform	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						M-band wavelets; texture segmentation; feature extraction; multiscale representation	GABOR FILTERS; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION; BASES	The M-band wavelet decomposition, which is a direct generalization of the standard 2-band wavelet decomposition is applied to the problem of an unsupervised segmentation of two texture images. Orthogonal and linear phase Ill-band wavelet transform is used to decompose the image into M x M channels. Various combinations of these bandpass sections are taken to obtain different scales and orientations in the frequency plane. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each bandpass section to a nonlinear transformation and computing the measure of energy in a window around each pixel of the filtered texture images. The window size in turn is adaptively selected depending on the frequency content of the images. Unsupervised texture segmentation is obtained by simple K-means clustering. Statistical tests are used to evaluate the average performance of features extracted from the decomposed subbands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cuevas, A; Febrero, M; Fraiman, R				Cuevas, A; Febrero, M; Fraiman, R			Cluster analysis: a further approach based on density estimation	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						cluster algorithms; density estimates; smoothed bootstrap; level set estimation	SINGLE LINKAGE; SELECTION; CONTOUR; NUMBER	A cluster methodology, motivated via density estimation, is proposed. It is based on the idea of estimating the population clusters, which, following Hartigan (1975), are defined as the connected parts of the "substantial" support of the underlying density. The empirical clusters are defined by analogy in terms of the substantial support of a convolution (kemel-type) density estimator. The sample observations are grouped into data clusters, according to the empirical cluster they belong. An algorithm to implement the method, based on resampling ideas, is proposed. It allows either to automatically choose the number of clusters or to give this number as an input. Some theoretical and practical aspects are briefly discussed and a simulation study is given. The results show a good performance of our method, in terms of efficiency and robustness, when compared with two classical cluster algorithms: k-means and single linkage. Finally, a real-data example is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The medoid method is related to k-MEANS, With the restriction that cluster representatives be chosen from among the data elements. Although the medoid method in general produces clusters of high quality, especially in the presence of noise, it is often criticized for the Omega (n(2)) time that it requires. Our method incorporates both proximity and density information to achieve high-quality clusters in sub-quadratic time; it does not require that the user specify the number of clusters in advance. The time bound is achieved by means of a fast approximation to the medoid objective function, using Delaunay triangulations to store proximity information.

Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1-20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method las well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.

J	Lucchese, L; Mitra, SK				Lucchese, L; Mitra, SK			Colour segmentation based on separate anisotropic diffusion of chromatic and achromatic channels	IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							IMAGE SEGMENTATION; MODEL; VISION	The paper presents a new technique for segmenting images only on the basis of colour information. It is shown how segmentation can benefit from splitting colour signals into chromatic and achromatic channels and separately smoothing them through anisotropic diffusion. Operatively, this is accomplished through two independent diffusion processes: one involves only the chromatic information, conveniently embedded in a complex function, while the other affects the lightness information. The results of the two diffusions are separately segmented by k-means clustering techniques and their combination yields the final image partition into homogeneous regions. Some experimental results are reported which verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

J	Kiang, MY; Kumar, A				Kiang, MY; Kumar, A			An evaluation of self-organizing map networks as a robust alternative to factor analysis in data mining applications	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						data mining; Kohonen networks; factor analysis; data reductive; clustering analysis	NEURAL NETWORKS	Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) network is one of the most important network architectures developed during the 1980s. The main function of SOM networks is to map the input data from an n-dimensional space to a lower dimensional (usually one- or two-dimensional) plot while maintaining the original topological relations. Therefore, it can be viewed as an analog of factor analysis. Ln this research, we evaluate the feasibility of using SOM networks as a robust alternative to factor analysis and clustering for data mining applications. Specifically, we compare SOM network solutions to factor analytic and K-Means clustering solutions on simulated data sets with known underlying factor and cluster structures. The comparisons indicate that the SOM networks provide solutions superior to unrotated factor solutions in general and provide more accurate recovery of underlying cluster structures when the input data are skewed. Our findings suggest that SOM networks can provide robust alternatives to traditional factor analysis and clustering techniques in data mining applications.

The total numbers of regulated genes (tens to hundreds) correlated with phenotypic severity of the model (G alphaq > CN > CSQ > Psi epsilon RACK), but demonstrated that no single gene was consistently upregulated. Of the three models exhibiting pathological hypertrophy, only atrial natriuretic peptide was consistently upregulated, suggesting that transcriptional alterations are highly specific to individual genetic causes of hypertrophy. However, hierarchical-tree and K-means clustering analyses revealed that subsets of the upregulated genes did exhibit coordinate regulatory patterns that were unique or overlapping across the different hypertrophy models. One striking set consisted of apoptotic genes uniquely regulated in the apoptosis-prone G alphaq model. Thus, rather than identifying a single common hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene program, these data suggest that extensive groups of genes may be useful for the prediction of specific underlying genetic determinants and condition-specific therapeutic approaches.

This paper presents a variable-selection heuristic For nonhierarchical (K-means) cluster analysis based on the adjusted Rand index for measuring cluster recovery. The heuristic was subjected to Monte Carlo testing across more than 2200 datasets with known cluster structure. The results indicate the heuristic is extremely effective at eliminating masking variables. A cluster analysis of real-world financial services data revealed that using the variable-selection heuristic prior to the K-means algorithm resulted in greater cluster stability.

Image pre-processing techniques that enhance raw images are applied before defect classification by a K-means algorithm and statistical method. These generate a Bayes classifier from which a decision surface is created for a classification procedure that can categorize defective or nondefective regions. Defect detection of the test fabric image is implemented by the decision surface from the training fabric image. The advantages of using the decision surface are a reduction in the training step and the ability to rapidly classify fabric. Experimental results confirm the reliable and reasonable classification ability of the proposed system.

Although several reports of volume reliability can be found in the literature, there are no articles assessing the reproducibility of the spatial distribution of tissue. In this report, we examine the validity, volume reliability, and spatial distribution reproducibility for our K-means cluster segmentation. Validation was examined by classifying gray matter, white matter, and CST: on images constructed using an MRI simulator and digital brain phantom, with percentage volume differences of less than 5% and spatial distribution overlaps greater than 0.94 (1.0 is perfect). We also segmented repeat scan MRIs from 10 healthy subjects, with intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.92 for cortical gray matter, white matter, sulcal CSF, and ventricular CSF. The original scans were also coregistered to the repeat scan of the same subject, and the spatial overlap for each tissue was then computed. Our overlaps ranged from 0.75 to 0.86 fur these tissues. Our results support the use of K-means cluster segmentation, and the use of segmented structural MRIs to guide the analysis of functional and other images. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This methodology has been applied to a producing field. The method uses conventional techniques such as geostatistical and classical pattern recognition in conjunction with modern techniques such as soft computing (neuro-computing, fuzzy logic, genetic computing, and probabilistic reasoning). An important goal of our research is to use clustering techniques to recognize the optimal location of a new well based on 3-D seismic data and available production-log data. The classification task was accomplished in three ways; (1) k-mean clustering, (2) fuzzy c-means clustering, and (3) neural network clustering to recognize similarity cubes. Relationships between each cluster and production-log data can be recognized around the well bore and the results used to reconstruct and extrapolate production-log data away from the well bore. This advanced technique for analysis and interpretation of 3-D seismic and log data can be used to predict: (1) mapping between production data and seismic data, (2) reservoir connectivity based on multi-attribute analysis, (3) pay zone estimation, and (4) optimum well placement.

J	Jiang, MF; Tseng, SS; Su, CM				Jiang, MF; Tseng, SS; Su, CM			Two-phase clustering process for outliers detection	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						outliers; k-means clustering; two-phase clustering; MST		In this paper, a two-phase clustering algorithm for outliers detection is proposed. Tn;e first modify the traditional k-means algorithm in Phase 1 by using a heuristic "if one new input pattern is far enough away from all clusters centers, then assign it as a new cluster center". It results that the data points in the same cluster may be most likely all outliers or all non-outliers. And then we construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) in Phase 2 and remove the longest edge. The small clusters, the tree with less number of nodes, are selected and regarded as outlier. The experimental results show that our process works well. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Dysvik, B; Jonassen, I				Dysvik, B; Jonassen, I			J-Express: exploring gene expression data using Java	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PATTERNS	J-Express is a Java application that allows the user to analyze gene expression (microarray) data in a flexible way giving access to multidimensional scaling, clustering, and visualization methods in an integrated manner. Specifically, J-Express includes implementations of hierarchical clustering, k-means, principal component analysis, and self-organizing maps. At present, it does not include methods for comparing two or more experiments for differentially expressed genes. The application is completely portable and requires only that a Java runtime environment 1.2 is installed on the system. Its efficiency allows interactive clustering of thousands of expression profiles on standard personal computers.

At each grid point, soil profiles were examined morphologically by augering to 120-cm depth. In the laboratory, pH(KCI) was determined on samples from every horizon. To allow numerical analyses, all the morphological attributes were given ordinal scores. The analysis consisted of two parts. First, the master horizons were split up into subtypes using Principal Components Analysis and a non-hierarchical clustering technique. This was necessary to overcome the problem of the anisotropy of the soil profiles, which makes it impossible to pool the data of all the horizons and analyse them together. Next, the distinguished horizon subtypes were used as input for the continuous soil profile classification with the 'fuzzy k-means with extragrades' algorithm. Five different soil classes plus an extragrade class were distinguished. The distinguished soil classes exhibited a fair degree of spatial autocorrelation and correlated well with the Belgian Soil Map. The technique developed ensures the compatibility with national or global soil classification systems based on diagnostic horizons and properties on the one hand and the production of high-resolution soil classes for local use on the other. Furthermore, the developed technique allows reanalysis and optimisation of data from previous surveys. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We proved that these two methods were suitable for shade sorting since their performance was very much alike. These results have led to a study of modifications of the CCC shade sorting process by combining hierarchical and nonhierarchical algorithms into a single process in order to improve the effectiveness of shade sorting.

The study was performed using daily data (1889-1999) from the Alt Penedes region (NE Spain), and annual, spring and autumn rainfall were analysed. The variables included in the cluster analysis were spring and autumn rainfalls, which represent on average 70% of the annual rainfall. The K-means and Ward's methods led to similar classifications of the observations, whereas the average method had a lesser discrimination power. However, the combination of all of them was useful in the identification of the rainfall distribution patterns over the years and their changes with time. Patterns including dry springs and wet autumns have increased during the last decade, although any consistent trend in annual rainfall was not found.

J	Stough, TM; Brodley, CE				Stough, TM; Brodley, CE			Focusing attention on objects of interest using multiple matched filters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						feature selection; focus of attention; image database search; k-means; multiple matched filters		In order to be of use to scientists, large image databases need to be analyzed to create a catalog of the objects of interest. One approach is to apply a multiple tiered search algorithm that uses reduction techniques of increasing computational complexity to select the desired objects from the database. The first tier of this type of algorithm, often called a focus of attention (FOA) algorithm, selects candidate regions from the image data and passes them to the next tier of the algorithm, In this paper we present a new approach to FOA that employs multiple matched filters (MMF), one for each object prototype, to detect the regions of interest. The MMFs are formed using K-means clustering on a set of image patches identified by domain experts as positive examples of objects of interest. An innovation of the approach is to radically reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, used by the k-means algorithm, by taking block averages (spoiling) the sample image patches. The process of spoiling is analyzed and its applicability to other domains is discussed. Combination of the output of the MMFs is achieved through the projection of the detections back into an empty image and then thresholding, This research was motivated by the need to detect small volcanos in the Magellan probe data from Venus. An empirical evaluation of the approach illustrates that a combination of the MMF plus the average filter results in a higher likelihood of 100% detection of the objects of interest at a lower false positive rate than a single matched filter alone.

The clustering methodology is used to search for appropriate clusters in multidimensional feature space such that a similarity metric of the resulting clusters is optimized. Data points are redistributed among the clusters probabilistically, so that points that are farther away from the cluster center have higher probabilities of migrating to other clusters than those which are closer to it. The superiority of the SAKM-clustering algorithm over the widely used K-means algorithm is extensively demonstrated for artificial and real life data sets.

A dynamic cluster K-mean method was presented to classify surface types and rain areas. Based on the TMI measurements and surface observations during the Huaihe River Basin Energy and Water Cycle Experiment, the scattering index over land (SIL) was developed and a rain rate (RR) retrieval algorithm of TMI was established, in which the RR is the function of SIL and PCT85 (polarization corrected temperature at 85 GHz). Compared with the rainfall derived from the weather radar and the products of TMI(2A12) and TRMM/PR(2A25), the given surface classification method and the rain rate retrieval algorithm can provide reasonable estimates of rain areas and rain rates. On the basis of TMI measurements, four methods, the classification method, the soil wetness index (SWI) method, the polarization difference index (PDI) method, and the polarization ratio index (PRI) method, were utilized to monitor flooding and study soil wetness in the Yangtze River basin and the Huaihe River basin during summer 1998. Compared with the images provided by L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (L-SAR) and Radar Satellite (Radarsat) and the figures derived from daily rain gauge data based on the Z-index method, the four methods of flooding detection were proved to be successful, among which the PRI method was best.

In this study we numerically classified 1419 soil horizon samples using fuzzy k-means (FKM) and fuzzy k-means with extragrade (FKME) analysis. Each sample was characterized by 12 chemical and textural attributes that were used for the numerical classification. The fuzzy classes produced were mapped at various depths using a method that considered the unity of class membership and local kriging, The use of a confusion index enabled the representation of the continuous nature of membership between the classes mapped and highlighted areas where the collection of additional information may be appropriate. The resulting classes reflect sensible and practical groupings that are easily related to the natural structure of the landscape. Silt and clay contents were the most distinguishing attributes in identifying the various geological and geomorphic components, Differences in soil-forming process were well highlighted by organic C (Org. C), P, electrical conductivity (EC1:5), pH, and Cl- content. We concluded that the fuzzy clustering algorithms and geostatistical techniques provide a worthwhile approach to soil classification and representation of the soil continuum,	Univ Sydney, Dept Agr Chem & Soil Sci, Australian Cotton Cooperat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Griffith Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia	Triantafilis, J (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Dept Agr Chem & Soil Sci, Australian Cotton Cooperat Res Ctr, Ross St Bldg A03, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

The motivation behind the SOM is to transform the data to a two-dimensional grid of nodes while preserving its 'topological' structure. In neural network terminology this involves unsupervised learning. The nearest related statistical technique is cluster analysis. We employ the SOM in the task of identifying strategic groups of companies, using data which relate to the generic strategies suggested by Porter. Following identification of different groups of hotels with certain strategic emphases, the study investigates correlations between strategies followed and hotel performance. We compare and contrast the 'feature map' generated by the SOM with the results of a standard cluster analysis using the k-means method. The data also cover performance indicators and the results indicate that performance varies between strategic groups.

J	Wang, JH; Rau, JD				Wang, JH; Rau, JD			VQ-agglomeration: a novel approach to clustering	IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							VECTOR QUANTIZATION; ALGORITHM; NETWORK	A novel approach called 'VQ-agglomeration' capable of performing fast and autonomous clustering is presented. The approach involves a vector quantisation (VQ) process followed by an agglomeration algorithm that treats codewords as initial prototypes. Each codeword is associated with a gravisphere that has a well defined attraction radius. The agglomeration algorithm requires that each codeword be moved directly to the centroid of its neighbouring codewords. The movements of codewords in the feature space are synchronous, and will converge quickly to certain sets of concentric circles for which the centroids identify the resulting clusters. Unlike other techniques, such as the k-means and the fuzzy C-means, the proposed approach is free of the initial prototype problem and it does not need pre-specification of the number of clusters.

J	Grachev, AF; Magnitsky, VA; Mukhamediev, SA; Nikolaev, VA				Grachev, AF; Magnitsky, VA; Mukhamediev, SA; Nikolaev, VA			The effect of neotectonic movements on the gradients and curvatures of the Northern Eurasian lithosphere surface	IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH			English	Article							GAUSSIAN CURVATURE; DEFORMATIONS; GEODYNAMICS; SEISMICITY	The data on neotectonic vertical crustal movements (VCM) incorporated in the neotectonic map of North Eurasia on the scale 1 : 5000000 [Grachev, 1997] are used to study the geometric characteristics of surface deformations of the North Eurasia lithosphere and to map the modulus of the VCM amplitude gradient Grad, mean curvature K(mean), Gaussian curvature H, and curvature intensity K(int). Kinematic VCM patterns in main geostructural zones and in individual regions within these zones are analyzed. Multivariate statistical methods are used to reveal correlations between various geometric characteristics in both the geostructural zones distinguished on the map and individual regions. Factors influencing the variability of the study characteristics are determined. Analysis of the correlations and geometric interpretation of the results art: based on the classification of surfaces accepted in differential geometry and, in particular, on our study of gradients and curvatures of some model surfaces. It is suggested that the results obtained in this work make it possible to classify neotectonic structural forms not only according to the activity of vertical movements but also on the basis of a complex of much more subtle features (the values of specific curvature characteristics and correlations between them). It is shown that the surface-averaged curvature intensity K(int), which is introduced as the modulus of half-difference between principal curvatures, is determined most reliably as compared with other curvature characteristics. Along with the kinematic meaning of the K(int) value, this leads to the conclusion that the surface-averaged curvature intensities can be regarded as a scalar parameter that most reliably and adequately characterizes the deformation patterns in most regions. The applicability of the results obtained in this work to the determination of tectonic stress fields and crustal shortening are discussed. This paper is supplemented by appendixes that define the quantities used and their main quantitative relationships.

J	Tseng, LY; Yang, SB				Tseng, LY; Yang, SB			A genetic approach to the automatic clustering problem	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; single-linkage algorithm; genetic clustering algorithm	ALGORITHMS	In solving the clustering problem, traditional methods, for example, the K-means algorithm and its variants, usually ask the user to provide the number of clusters. Unfortunately, the number of clusters in general is unknown to the user. Therefore, clustering becomes a tedious trial-and-error work and the clustering result is often not very promising especially when the number of clusters is large and not easy to guess. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm for the clustering problem. This algorithm is suitable for clustering the data with compact spherical clusters. It can be used in two ways. One is the user-controlled clustering, where the user may control the result of clustering by varying the values of the parameter, w. A small value of w results in a larger number of compact clusters, while a large value of w results in a smaller number of looser clusters. The other is an automatic clustering, where a heuristic strategy is applied to find a good clustering. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this genetic clustering algorithm. (C) 2000 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Boundaries of the regions are determined by hyperbolas and membership values are given by one or zero in each region. The area between crisp regions is a fuzzy region, where membership values are proportional to distances to crisp regions. A new method is a direct extension of the traditional hard k-means.

The model construction is based on the model validation philosophy of architecture selection [8]. In contrast with the k-means clustering approach, the number of segments in the proposed scheme is determined completely automatically. We show that the modelling method can be strengthened by, incorporating spatial contextual information. The proposed approach speeds tip the modelling process by a factor of three. The advocated methodology is successfully applied to the problem of lip pixel segmentation in face images.

Information Web Crawlers continuously traverse the Internet and collect images that are subsequently indexed based on integrated feature vectors. As a basis for the indexing, the K-Means algorithm is used, modified so as to take into account the coherence of the regions. Based on the extracted regions, characteristic features are extracted using color, texture and shape/region boundary information. These features along with additional information such as the URL location and the date of index procedure are stored in a database. The user can access and search this indexed content through the Web with an advanced and user friendly interface. The output of the system is a set of links to the content available in the WWW, ranked according to their similarity to the image submitted by the user. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the system.

Special attention is given to moment and symmetry-based features. Several combinations of such features are fed to two clustering methods (Ward's hierarchical scheme and K-Means) and the respectively obtained classifications are compared. The results indicate the superiority of some features, also suggesting possible biological implications.

The algorithm generalizes the 3D illumination subspace model by segmenting the image into regions that have surface normals whose directions are close to each other. This segmentation is performed using a K-means clustering algorithm and requires only a few training images under different illuminations. When the linear subspace model is applied to the segmented image, recognition is robust to attached and cast shadows, and the recognition rate is equal to that of computationally more complex systems that require constructing the 3D surface of the face.

Images of a database or frames of a video sequence are scanned for faces by a Neural Network-based face detector. The extracted faces are then grouped into clusters by a combination of a face recognition method using pseudo two-dimensional Hidden Markov Models and a k-means clustering algorithm. Each resulting main cluster consists of the face images of one person. In a subsequent step the detected faces are labeled as one of the different people in the video sequence or the image database and the occurrence of the people can be evaluated. The results of the proposed approach on a TV broadcast news sequence are presented. It is demonstrated that the system is able to discriminate between three different newscasters and an interviewed person.

For this purpose, we propose the novel procedure of K-Means with connectivity constraint algorithm as a general segmentation algorithm combining several types of information including colour, motion and compactness. A new colour distance is also defined for this algorithm. The regularisation parameters are evaluated automatically using the min-max criterion. In this algorithm, the use of spatiotemporal regions is introduced since a number of frames is analyzed simultaneously and as a result the same region is present in consequent frames. Experimental results on real and synthetic colour data demonstrate the performance of the data.

Data from domains such as protein sequences, retail transactions, intrusion detection, and web-logs have an inherent sequential nature. Clustering of such data sets is useful for various purposes. For example, clustering of sequences from commercial data sets may help marketer identify different customer groups based upon their purchasing patterns. Grouping protein sequences that share similar structure helps in identifying sequences with similar functionality. Over the years, many methods have been developed for clustering objects according to their similarity. However these methods tend to have a computational complexity that is at least quadratic on the number of sequences. In this paper we present an entirely different approach to sequence clustering that does not require an all-against-all analysis and uses a near-linear complexity K-means based clustering algorithm. Our experiments using data sets derived from sequences of purchasing transactions and protein sequences show that this approach is scalable and leads to reasonably good clusters.

The model is built using the predictive validation technique advocated in [1] which has been modified to allow modelling with full covariance matrices. A subsequent grouping of the mixture components provides the basis for a Bayesian rule labelling of the pixels as lip or non-lip. We test the proposed method on a database of 145 images and demonstrate that its accuracy is significantly better than the segmentation obtained by k-means clustering. Moreover, the proposed method does not require the number of segments to be specified a priori.

As a basis for the indexing, a novel K-Means segmentation algorithm is used, modified so as to take into account the coherence of the regions. A new color distance is also defined for this algorithm. Based on the extracted regions, characteristic features are estimated using color, texture and shape information. An important and unique aspect of the algorithm is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. The development of an intelligent image content-based search engine for the World Wide Web is also presented, as a direct application of the presented algorithm.

In this paper we present a new image segmentation method using a special visual descriptor. For each pixel p, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of the block centered on p together with its location in the image is employed as its content descriptor thus resulting int a long vector (v) over right arrow (p), referred to as situational DCT descriptors (SDDs). A scalar quantization step is then carried out on the DCT component of SDDs to reflect the fact that the Human Vision System is not of uniform discrimination to details of different frequencies. Next the Principal Component Analysis is conducted to drastically reduce the dimensionality of SDDs. The adaptive K-mean algorithm is then performed to arrive at the region assignment for each pixel. The final partitioning results axe obtained after performing the post-processing step. Experimental results using this method demonstrate encouraging performances.

In a first step unsupervised clustering in the color and position space is performed in order to separate the objects. The clusters are handed over to the feature extraction, which is basically a polar subsampling and finally rotation invariant Markov models are trained on those features. After presenting a query object, the HMMs which represent the individual clusters in the images are matched against the feature sequence calculated on the query image. Those database elements whose corresponding Markov models generated the highest similarity scores are retrieved. Three different clustering techniques, namely k-means clustering, LBG-algorithm and EM-algorithm are evaluated. Retrieval efficiencies up to 56.25% have been achieved on this challenging task.

Furthermore, the accompanying audio cue will also be utilized for achieving more meaningful results. Our preliminary experimental results show that by integrating audiovisual information, meaningful events could be successfully detected and extracted.

Web search engine is the most commonly used tool for information retrieval; however, its current status is far from satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a new approach to cluster search results returned from Web search engine using link analysis. Unlike document clustering algorithms in IR that based on common words/phrases shared between documents, our approach is base on common links shared by pages using co-citation and coupling analysis. We also extend standard clustering algorithm K-means to make it more natural to handle noises and apply it to web search results. By filtering some irrelevant pages, our approach clusters high quality pages into groups to facilitate users' accessing and browsing. Preliminary experiments and evaluations are conducted to investigate its effectiveness. The experiment results show that clustering on web search results via link analysis is promising.

We compare the performance of a radial basis function (RBF) network with parameters that are determined using a modified fuzzy clustering procedure to that of an RBF network with parameters that are determined using a least-mean-square-error (classical) clustering procedure. As part of the fuzzy clustering procedure, we assume a particular functional form for the fuzzy membership function. We train and test both of the networks on simulated data and present performance results in the form of receiver operating characteristic curves.

Data for this study came from a community-based, prospective longitudinal investigation of speech/language (S/L) impaired children and matched controls who participated in extensive diagnostic and psychosocial assessments at entry into the study at 5 years of age and again at follow-up. Clustering variables were based on five DSM diagnostic categories assessed at age 19 with the University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Using Ward's method, the five binary variables were entered into a hierarchical cluster analysis. An iterative clustering method (K-means) was then used to refine the Ward solution. Finally, a series of analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to analyze group differences between clusters on measures of Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), criminal involvement, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and frequency of drug use and heavy drinking. The analysis yielded eight replicablc cluster groups, which were labeled as follows: (a) anxious (20.9%); (b) anxious drinkers (5.5%); (c) depressed (16.4%); (d) depressed drug abusers (10%); (e) antisocial (16.4%); (f) antisocial drinkers (10%); (g) drug abusers (8.2%); (h) problem drinkers (12.7%). These groups were differentiated by external criteria, thus supporting the validity of our cluster solution. Cluster membership was associated with a history of S/L impairment: A large proportion of the depressed drug abusers and the antisocial cluster group had S/L impairment that was identified at age 5. Clarification of the developmental progress of the youths in these cluster groups can inform our approach to early intervention and treatment.

For RBFN identification, k-means clustering and stepwise regression analysis are used. The practicality of applying these methods to large industrial identification problems is discussed, considering the restrictions of industrially practical input sequence design. The RBFN model has three inputs and two outputs, and the dimensionality of the identification problem poses some difficulties for nonlinear empirical model identification; specifically, the large amount of data required is a problem for plant testing and may cause computational difficulties for identification algorithms as well.

In this paper, we focus on an adaptive approach to implement a VQ technique using the online version of k-means algorithm in which the size of the codebook is adapted continuously to the statistical behavior of the image. Based on the statistical analysis of the feature space, a set of thresholds are designed such that those codewords corresponding to the low-density clusters would be removed from the codebook and hence, resulting in a higher bit-rate efficiency. Applications of this approach would be in telemedicine, where sequences of highly correlated medical images, e.g. consecutive brain slices, are transmitted over a low bit-rate channel. We have applied this algorithm on magnetic resonance (MR) images and the simulation results on a sample sequence are given. The proposed method has been compared to the standard k-means algorithm in terms of PSNR, MSE, and elapsed time to complete the algorithm.

S	Ramos, V		Boers, EJW		Ramos, V			The biological concept of Neoteny in evolutionary color image segmentation - Simple experiments in simple non-memetic genetic algorithms	APPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EvoWorkshops 2000	APR 18-20, 2001	COMO, ITALY	EvoNet, Network Excellence Evolut Comp				Neoteny, also spelled Paedomorphosis, can be defined in biological terms as the retention by an organism of juvenile or even larval traits into later life. In some species, all morphological development is retarded; the organism is juvenilized but sexually mature. Such shifts of reproductive capability would appear to have adaptive significance to organisms that exhibit it, In terms of evolutionary theory, the process of paedomorphosis suggests that larval stages and developmental phases of existing organisms may give rise, under certain circumstances, to wholly new organisms. Although the present work does not pretend to model or simulate the biological details of such a concept in any way, these ideas were incorporated by a rather simple abstract computational strategy, in order to allow (if possible) for faster convergence into simple non-memetic Genetic Algorithms, i,e. without using local improvement procedures (e.g. via Baldwin or Lamarckian learning). As a case-study, the Genetic Algorithm was used for colour image segmentation purposes by using K-mean unsupervised clustering methods, namely for guiding the evolutionary algorithm in his search for finding the optimal or sub-optimal data partition. Average results suggest that the use of neotonic strategies by employing juvenile genotypes into the later generations and the use of linear-dynamic mutation rates instead of constant, can increase fitness values by 58% comparing to classical Genetic Algorithms, independently from the starting population characteristics on the search space.

Our approach uses soft weight sharing, previously proposed for improved generalization and considers the weights not as constant numbers but as random variables drawn from a Gaussian mixture distribution; which includes as its special cases k-means clustering and uniform quantization. This approach couples the training of weights for reduced error with their quantization. Simulations on synthetic and real regression and classification data sets compare various quantization schemes and demonstrate the advantage of the coupled training of distribution parameters.

Achieving automatic context detection, usually by analysis of small hardware sensors, is a fundamental problem in human-computer interaction. However, mapping the sensor data to a context is a difficult problem involving near real-time classification and training of patterns out of noisy sensor signals. This paper proposes an adaptive approach that uses a Kohanen Self-Organizing Map, augmented with on-line k-means clustering for classification of the incoming sensor data. Over-writing of prototypes on the map, especially during the untangling phase of the Self-Organizing Map, is avoided by a refined k-means clustering of labeled input vectors.

J	Yendrikhovskij, SN				Yendrikhovskij, SN			A computational model of colour categorization	COLOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	XVth Meeting of the International-Color-Vision-Society	JUL, 1999	GOTTINGEN, GERMANY	Int Color Vis Soc		colour categorization; image statistics; clustering algorithms		The following research elaborates on understanding and modeling the colour categorization process. The structure of colour categories is argued to resemble the structure of the distribution of colours in the perceived world. This distribution can be represented as colour statistics in some perceptual and approximately uniform colour space (e.g., the CIELUV colour space). The process of colour categorization can be modeled through the grouping of colour statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) based on the minimum-distance criterion. This model explains the location and emergence of colour categories. The number of colour categories is presumably determined by a trade-off between accuracy in representation of the perceived world and simplicity of the category system. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV colour space. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this paper, an improved k-means clustering algorithm is developed to find the optimal clusters automatically. When this algorithm is applied to RBF networks, significant performance gain can be achieved with much smaller scaled network compared with the usual clustering method. Simulations and practical application show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

Conventional text miners are mostly based on the vector space model of document, which views a document simply as an n-dimensional vector of terms. To retain the information in the structure and link, we have developed a structured link vector model (SLVM), which represents a document with a vector, whose elements determined by terms, element structure and neighbor documents. For briefness and clarity, they are described in the procedure of K-means: document similarity, and cluster center. Our cluster based on SLVM performs significantly more accurate than on conventional vector space model in our experiments, its K value of K-measure increase from 0.65similar to0.73 to 0.82similar to0.86.

The proposed algorithm classifies pixels of images after Self-organizing Maps (SOM) assigns each pixel on a two-dimensional feature map. By clustering sequential spectral images, we can detect segments of features which show a distinctive spectral reflectance in the images. K-means algorithm well known as a non-hierarchical Clustering model also classifies the image pixels based on the feature vector distance between each pixel. However, K-means algorithm requires the knowledge of the optimal number of clusters to obtain a meaningful result. The most significant advantage of the proposed clustering algorithm using SOM feature map is that it guarantees to obtain a high quality clustering output without fixing the number of clusters. The proposed algorithm regards a normal distribution formed by the pixels which have a similar feature as one cluster, and divides the feature map into the optimal clusters with the boundary line between normal distributions of several clusters. In the simulation, the proposed algorithm recognized the male and female butterflies from sequential ultra-violet spectral images.

It enables the user to have a good overall view of the information contained in the documents. However, existing algorithms suffer from various aspects; hard clustering algorithms (where each document belongs to exactly one cluster) cannot detect the multiple themes of a document, while soft clustering algorithms (where each document can belong to multiple clusters) are usually inefficient. We propose WBSC (Word-based Soft Clustering), an efficient soft clustering algorithm based on a given similarity measure. WBSC uses a hierarchical approach to cluster documents having similar words. WBSC is very effective and efficient when compared with existing hard clustering algorithms like K-means and its variants.

However, this success has not been mirrored at low rotational speeds of less than 20 rpm. At such speeds the energy generated from bearing defects might not show as an obvious change in signature and thus become undetectable using conventional vibration measuring equipment, This paper presents an investigation into the applicability of acoustic emission for detecting early stages of bearing damage at a rotational speed of 1.12 rpm. Furthermore, it reviews work undertaken in monitoring bearings rotating at speeds below 20 rpm. Investigations were centered on a bearing test-rig onto which localised surface defects were seeded by spark erosion. Analysis of acoustic emission signatures associated with bearing outer race, inner race and roller defects, showed that the uniqueness of the defect signature patterns could be utilised to provide early fault diagnosis.

Equipment rotating at slow rotational speeds are particularly difficult to monitor since conventional vibration measuring equipment is not capable of measuring the fundamental frequency of operation. This paper presents a study of high frequency acoustic emissions as a tool for detecting early stages of loss of mechanical integrity in low-speed rotating machines. Furthermore, it examines the use of time series analysis techniques to aid in defect source location. Investigations were centred on a test-rig that rotated at 1.1 rpm.

Users who are not well versed with the image domain characteristics might be more comfortable in working with an Image Retrieval System that allows specification of a query in terms of keywords, thus eliminating the usual intimidation in dealing with very primitive features. In this paper we present two approaches to automatic image annotation, by finding those rules underlying the links between the low-level features and the high-level concepts associated with images. One scheme uses global color image information and classification tree based techniques. Through this supervised learning approach we are able to identify relationships between global color-based image features and some textual descriptors. In the second approach, using low-level image features that capture local color information and through a k-means based clustering mechanism, images are organized in clusters such that images that are "similar" are located in the same cluster. For each cluster, a set of rules is derived to capture the association between the localized color-based image features and the textual descriptors relevant to the cluster.

Given a large unlabeled document collection, it is often helpful to organize this collection into clusters of related documents. By using a vector space model, text data can be treated as high-dimensional but sparse numerical data vectors. It is a contemporary challenge to efficiently preprocess and cluster very large document collections. In this paper we present a time and memory efficient technique for the entire clustering process, including the creation of the vector space model. This efficiency is obtained by (i) a memory-efficient multi-threaded preprocessing scheme, and (ii) a fast clustering algorithm that fully exploits the sparsity of the data set. We show that this entire process takes time that is linear in the size of the document collection. Detailed experimental results are presented - a highlight of our results is that we are able to effectively cluster a collection of 113,716 NSF award abstracts in 23 minutes (including disk I/O costs) on a single workstation with modest memory consumption.

In this paper, we introduce the constrained clustering problem and show that traditional clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) cannot handle it. A scalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding an initial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution by performing confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of two phases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases, we show that finding the optimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how our algorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. By experiments, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L-k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L-1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L-2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L-k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.

B	Bins, J; Draper, BA			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Bins, J; Draper, BA			Feature selection from huge feature sets	EIGHTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION, VOL II, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2001)	JUL 07-14, 2001	VANCOUVER, CANADA	IEEE Comp Soc, SIEMENS, Microsoft, NEC, Pointgrey Res, SARNOFF Corp, MERL				The number of features that can be computed over an image is, for practical purposes, limitless. Unfortunately, the number of features that can be computed and exploited by most computer vision systems is considerably less. As a result, it is important to develop techniques for selecting features from very large data sets that include many irrelevant or redundant features. This work addresses the feature selection problem by proposing a three-step algorithm. The first step uses a variation of the well known Relief algorithm [11] to remove irrelevance; the second step clusters features using K-means to remove redundancy; and the third step is a standard combinatorial feature selection algorithm. This three-step combination is shown to be more effective than standard feature selection algorithms for large data sets with lots of irrelevant and redundant features. It is also shown to be no worse than standard techniques for data sets that do not have these properties. Finally, we show a third experiment in which a data set with 4096 features is reduced to 5% of its original size with very little information loss.

The experiments are performed on the Altera Excalibur board using the soft IP core 32-bit NIOS RISC processor. 172 our experiments, We compare performance of the sequential algorithm With two different accelerated versions. We consider granularity and synchronization issues when mapping an algorithm to a hybrid processor. Our results show that on the Excalibur NIOS, a 1570 speedup can be achieved over the sequential algorithm on images with 8 spectral bands where the pixels arc divided into S categories. Speedup is limited by the communication cost Of transferring data from external memory through the NIOS processor to the customized circuits. Our results indicate that future hybrid processors must either (1) have a clock rate 10X the speed of the configurable logic circuits or (2) include dual port memories that both the processor and configurable logic can access, If either of these conditions is met, the hybrid processor will show a factor of 10 speedup over the sequential algorithm.. Such systems will combine the convenience Of conventional processors with the speed of configurable logic.

The HSOM is composed of several layers of the self-organizing map (SOM) organized in a pyramidal fashion. The SOM has been used for the segmentation of multispectral MR images but the results often suffer from undersegmentation and oversegmentation. By combining the concepts of self-organization and topographic mapping with multiscale image segmentation, the HSOM is seen to overcome the major drawbacks of the SOM. The segmentation results of the HSOM are compared with those of the SOM and the k-means clustering algorithm on multispectral MR images of the human brain representing both, normal conditions and pathological conditions such as multiple sclerosis.

Multivariate statistical methods such as evolving factor analysis and k-means clustering were used to interpret the signal obtained from the analysis of gas oil samples, in which strong overlapping of the eluting aromatic component groups occurs. The presented method allows the precise determination of the elution profiles of a series of aromatic component groups and therefore can be applied for their accurate quantitative determination.

While texture is always associated with a form of repetition in the image, the repeating quantity may vary. The texture may be a color or albedo variation as in a checkerboard, a paisley print or zebra stripes. Very often in real-world scenes, texture is instead due to a surface height variation, e.g. pebbles, gravel, foliage and any rough surface. Such surfaces are referred to here as 3D textured surfaces. Standard texture recognition algorithms are not appropriate for 3D textured surfaces because the appearance of these surfaces changes in a complex manner with viewing direction and illumination direction. Recent methods have been developed for recognition of 3D textured surfaces using a database of surfaces observed under varied imaging parameters. One of these methods is based on 3D textons obtained using K-means clustering of multiscale feature vectors. Another method uses eigen-analysis originally developed for appearance-based object recognition. In this work we develop a hybrid approach that employs both feature grouping and dimensionality reduction. The method is tested using the Columbia-Utrecht texture database (CUReT) and provides excellent recognition rates. The method is compared with existing recognition methods for 3D textured surfaces. A direct comparison is facilitated by empirical recognition rates from the same texture data set. The current method has key advantages over existing methods including requiring less prior information on both the training and novel images.

Because video hotspots, which are the visual analogues of HTML hyperlinks, highly depend on a user's interest, it is very difficult to automatically extract the exact outlines of objects of interest in videos. Our approach of interactive video hotspot retrieval is to provide candidate hotspots with segmented regions of video frames when requested, and web designers using the tool for web site creation may select the area (or areas) he is interested in as a video hotspot. This segmentation algorithm follows a three step coarse-to-fine scheme. The original image is first divided into blocks and a block-merging process is applied to get a coarse segmentation. Then we represent the pre-segmented image as a graph where the value of edges in this graph are evaluated based on multi-features, and by using a minimum spanning tree searching algorithm, we merge the vertices in the graph to generate the segmented regions of the image. Finally, we refine the boundary of segmented regions on the pixel level using an improved K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation algorithm is fast and efficient and our final segmentation results compare favorably with the results obtained using manual outlining. We also provide a convenient way for the web page designer to select multiple regions as a video hotspot. Our method allows the designer to click on an image during video playback and to get a segmented image almost instantly. The extracted video hotspots can then be used for video hyperlinks, an extension of the general concept of hyperlink to interactive videos.

However the scene segmentation from video data is not an easy task In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical scene segmentation method which consists of three steps: initial segmentation, refinement, and adjustment. First, we detect initial scene boundaries using a continuous coherence computing model. As a coherence computing model, we use a short-term memory-based model in which the memory size and attention span size are not fixed. In our model, there are times when the removal of shots from the memory buffer may not follow First-In-First-Out rule. After detection of initial scene boundaries, we execute the refinement process for each scene using k-means clustering algorithm to find misses not detected in scene boundary detection. The cluster-validity analysis technique is used to find the optimal number of clusters. If a new scene boundary is found within a scene by the analysis of clustering results, the scene is split into two sub-scenes. After that, we execute the adjustment process. We choose two consecutive scenes to detect whether the scene boundary is false or not. For shots of two consecutive scenes, we also perform k-means clustering algorithm and detect desirable scene boundaries. Finally, the accurate scene segmentation results are obtained. Experimental results are presented.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Neural network ensemble techniques have been shown to be very accurate classification techniques. However, in some real-life applications a number of classifiers required to achieve a reasonable accuracy is enormously large and hence very space consuming. This paper proposes several methods for pruning neural network ensembles. The clustering based approach applies k-means clustering to entire set of classifiers in order to identify the groups of similar classifiers and then eliminates redundant classifiers inside each cluster. Another proposed approach contains the sequence of the depth-first building the tree Of classifiers according to their diversity followed by the process of tree pruning. The novel proposed methods applied to several data sets have shown that by selecting an optimal subset of neural network classifiers, it is possible to obtain significantly smaller ensemble of classifiers while achieving the same or even slightly better generalizability as when using the entire ensemble.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				This paper describes an analysis of competitive and reinitialization learning (CRL) for adaptive vector quantization (AVQ) which is a version of vector quantization (VQ) in order for digital coding of signals to adapt to changing statistics of the signal sources. The CRL has been designed for achieving equidistortion or asymptotically optimal quantization to overcome the under-utilization problem or the local minimum problem of vector quantization networks, while its performance in adaptation speed and obtained distortion level has been shown higher than the conventional AVQ algorithms such as OPTM (optimal adaptive k-means algorithm) and DOCL-II (diversity oriented competitive learning II). In this paper, after reviewing the CRL algorithm, we examine how the CRL algorithm works for various source signals such as nonstationary 2 dimensional vectors and high dimensional images.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				This paper proposes a new system for segmentation and recognition of scenery images. Most of the conventional methods for image recognition are based on rules or pattern matching. It is true that they have high accuracy. However, the generalization ability is not sufficient and they require heuristic knowledge. In addition, these methods are used on the assumption that images are segmented appropriately. The proposed system alleviates these shortcomings by effective combination of K-mean-type algorithm [4], Back Propagation algorithm (BP) and Fuzzy Inference Neural Network (FINN) [8].

The aim is to partitioning a grayscale image to disjoint regions of coherent illuminance or homogenous texture. There are many segmentation methods of region-based, contour-based or region-contour-joint approaches to deal with different type images. Here we treat color coherent region as a special texture, and we used a new texture descriptor based on local Fourier coefficients histogram adaptive for this extended texture representation. Then a texture-based image segmentation algorithm is proposed. By utilizing the texture features of a region and the K-mean cluster algorithm we obtain a coarse segmentation of an image. Then by refining the region boundary iteratively a final segmentation can be resulted. Because our texture feature is also suitable for gray-coherence region, this algorithm can protect the gray-coherence from over-segmentation. For the same time, we reprove the boundary refinement by replaced with three steps: horizontal refinement, vertical refinement and boundary integrality checking. We also proposed the pre-processing and post-processing method for this algorithm. The segmentation performance is demonstrated on several synthesis texture images and aerial images.

The system is based on a novel method combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with hierarchical multi-scale theory and Discrete Hidden Markov Models (DHMM). We use a hierarchical decision tree based on multi-scale theory. Firstly we convolve all members of the training data with a Gaussian kernel, which blurs differences between images and reduces their separation in feature space. This reduces the number of eigenvectors needed to describe the data. A principal component space is computed from the convolved data. We divide the data in this space into two clusters using the k-means algorithm. Then the level of blurring is reduced and PCA is applied to each of the clusters separately. A new principal component space is formed from each cluster. Each of these spaces is then divided into two and the process is repeated. We thus produce a binary tree of principal component spaces where each level of the tree represents a different degree of blurring. The search time is then proportional to the depth of the tree, which makes it possible to search hundreds of gestures in real time. The output of the decision tree is then input into DHMM to recognise temporal information.

Firstly we used k-means techniques to examine each pixel in the image and assigns it to one of the clusters depending on the minimum distance to obtain primary segmented image into different intensity regions. We then employ a watershed transformation technique works on that image. This includes: First, Gradient of the segmented image. Second, Divide the image into markers. Third, Check the Marker Image to see if it has zero points (watershed lines) then delete the watershed lines in the Marker Image created by watershed algorithm. Fourth, Create Region Adjacency Graph (RAG) and the Region Adjacency Boundary (RAB) between two regions from Marker Image and finally; Fifth, Region Merging according to region average intensity and edge strength (T-1, T-2), where all the regions with the same merged label belong to one region. Our approach was tested on remote sensing and brain MR medical images and the final segmentation is one closed boundary per actual region in the image.

For many algorithms of use in remote sensing, the bulk of the processing takes place in an "inner loop" with a large number of simple operations. For these algorithms, dramatic speedups can often be obtained with specialized hardware. The difficulty and expense of digital design continues to limit applicability of this approach, but the development of new design tools is making this approach more feasible, and some notable successes have been reported. On the other hand, it is often the case that processing can also be accelerated by adopting a more sophisticated algorithm design. Unfortunately, a more sophisticated algorithm is much harder to implement in hardware, so these approaches are often at odds with each other. With careful planning, however, it is sometimes possible to combine software and hardware design in such a way that each complements the other, and the final implementation achieves speedup that would not have been possible with a hardware-only or a software-only solution. We will in particular discuss the co-design of software and hardware to achieve substantial speedup of algorithms for multispectral image segmentation and for endmember identification.

Last year, we reported on an implementation of k-means clustering for multispectral images. Our implementation in reconfigurable hardware processed 10 channel multispectral images two orders of magnitude faster than a software implementation of the same algorithm. The advantage of using reconfigurable hardware to accelerate k-means clustering is clear; the disadvantage is the hardware implementation worked for one specific dataset. It is a non-trivial task to change this implementation to handle a dataset with different number of spectral channels, bits per spectral channel, or number of pixels; or to change the number of clusters. These changes required knowledge of the hardware design process and could take several days of a designer's time. Since multispectral data sets come in many shapes and sizes, being able to easily change the k-means implementation for these different data sets is important. For this reason, we have developed a parameterized implementation of the k-means algorithm. Our design is parameterized by the number of pixels in an image, the number of channels per pixel, and the number of bits per channel as well as the number of clusters. These parameters can easily be changed in a few minutes by someone not familiar with the design process. The resulting implementation is very close in performance to the original hardware implementation. It has the added advantage that the parameterized design compiles approximately three times faster than the original.

The need to measure the continuing impact of the fire on the local environment has led to the application of a number of remote sensing technologies. During and after the fire, remote-sensing data was acquired from a variety of aircraft- and satellite-based sensors, including Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). We now report on the application of a machine learning technique to the automated classification of land cover using multi-spectral and multi-temporal imagery. We apply a hybrid genetic programming/supervised classification technique to evolve automatic feature extraction algorithms. We use a software package we have developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, called GENIE, to carry out this evolution. We use multispectral imagery from the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument from before and after the wildfire. Using an existing land cover classification based on a 1992 Landsat 5 TM scene for our training data, we evolve algorithms that distinguish a range of land cover categories, and an algorithm to mask out clouds and cloud shadows. We report preliminary results of combining individual classification results using a K-means clustering approach. The details of our evolved classification are compared to the manually produced land-cover classification.

In this paper, we propose a novel color image segmentation algorithm in consideration of human visual sensitivity for color pattern variations by generalizing K-means clustering. Human visual system has different color perception sensitivity according to the spatial color pattern variation. To reflect this effect, we define the CCM (Color Complexity Measure) by calculating the absolute deviation with Gaussian weighting within the local mask and assign weight value to each color vector using the CCM values. Weighted color vectors are used in K-Means algorithm and the shape and the center position of each cluster is formed according to the color distribution in the image. We adaptively determine optimal K value, which is the number of cluster, by using the statistics of the color complexity measure that implies the complexity of the color image. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm segments the color image preserving significant features while removing unimportant details.

J	Mashor, MY				Mashor, MY			Adaptive fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for a radial basis function network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; OPTIMALITY	This paper presents a new recursive hybrid algorithm for training a radial basis function (RBF) network. The algorithm consists of a proposed clustering algorithm to position the RBF centres and the Givens least-squares algorithm to estimate the weights. This paper begins with a discussion about the problems of clustering in positioning RBF centres. Then a new clustering algorithm called adaptive fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is proposed to reduce the problems. The capability of the proposed algorithm was tested to model three data sets: one simulated and two real data sets. It was found that the algorithm provided good performance. The performance of the algorithm was then compared with adaptive k-means, non-adaptive k-means and non-adaptive fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms. Overall performance of the RBF network that used the proposed clustering algorithm was found to be much better than those that used other clustering algorithms. Simulation results also revealed that the algorithm was not sensitive to initial centres.

However for the technique to be widely adopted in practice, it should demonstrate superiority over traditional clustering methods. In this research we compared SOM neural networks with K-means algorithms to test their relative ability to generate reliable clustering solutions using real world data - Chinese consumer attitudes towards imported fruit. Results show that K-means performs better than SOM in terms of reliability, but SOM's strength is its ability to discover the "natural" number of clusters.

This paper addresses the problem of automatic index generation of movie databases based on audiovisual information. In particular, given a movie we first extract key movie events including two-speaker dialog scenes, multiple-speaker dialog scenes and hybrid scenes by using the proposed window-based sweep algorithm and the K-means clustering algorithm. Following event detection, the identity of each individual speaker in a dialog scene is recognized based on a statistical maximum likelihood approach. The identification relies on the likelihood ratio calculation between the incoming speech data and Gaussian mixture models of the speakers and the background. It is evident that the event and the speaker identity information will serve as a crucial part of the movie index table. Preliminary experimental results show that, by integrating multiple media information, we can obtain robust and meaningful event detection and speaker identification results.

The clustering problem is converted to a multimodal function optimization problem within the context of Genetic Niching. However, UNC was only formulated for using the Euclidean distance and for 2-dimensionbal data sets, which means that it could only be tested on spherically distributed 2-D data. In this paper, we extend UNC to the case of general multivariate distributions in n-D space by modifying our definition of scale and adapting the mating restriction rules and extraction procedure accordingly. Genetic Optimization makes our approach less prone to suboptimal solutions and the use of robust weights makes it less sensitive to the presence of noise. Most importantly, Genetic optimization frees our approach from the necessity of deriving prototype equations when such derivations are impossible, such as when a non-differentiable distance measure is used. This enables our approach to handle data with both numeric and qualitative attributes, and general subjective non-metric dissimilarity measures. The effectiveness of the extended UNC is demonstrated using several examples to illustrate its performance for data sets with clusters of various size, density, orientation, and noise contamination rates. The results are also compared with the K-Means and the Possibilistic C-Means.

The precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau can be studied conveniently with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). It is shown that the TMI brightness temperature at 85 GHz in the vertical polarization (TB85V) is negatively correlated to the surface rain rate, but a very low value of TB85V does not correspond to very intense surface rain rates on the Tibetan Plateau, a result that is different from what is observed in other areas of the world. For surface precipitation retrieval on the Tibetan Plateau from TMI, the effect from snow cover on precipitation retrieval is removed before analysis of precipitation. Using the dynamic cluster K-mean method, five categories of surface types and rain areas are identified on the Tibetan Plateau: dry soil, wet soil, water area, stratiform rain area, and convective rain area. The precipitation areas are screened by classification before the precipitation retrieval. Two datasets of rain-free areas and precipitation areas are formed after surface classification. Based on the dataset of rain-free areas, the value of TB85V can be simulated well by TB10V,TB19V, and TB21V when it is not raining. By means of the dataset of precipitation areas, it is revealed that the scattering index over land (SIL) is positively correlated and the polarization-corrected brightness temperature at 85 GHz (PCT85) is negatively correlated with the surface rain rate. With SIL, PCT85, and their combinations as retrieval algorithms, three precipitation retrieval formulas are proposed in which the SIL algorithm is most suitable for small rain retrieval, the PCT85 algorithm is most suitable for moderate rain retrieval, and the combined SIL and PCT85 algorithm is most suitable for relatively large rain retrieval on the Tibetan Plateau. By means of two thresholds, 265 and 245 K, for TB85V, the combination of the three formulas is applied to precipitation retrieval on the Tibetan Plateau during the Tibetan Plateau Experiment Intensive Observing Period of 1998, resulting in acceptable and encouraging surface rain-rate retrievals. Intercomparison among the TMI algorithms and the 17 Special Sensor Microwave Imager algorithms from the second Precipitation Intercomparison Project demonstrates that the comprehensive application of the TMI algorithms has good precision and error index and is suitable for precipitation retrieval on the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Chaturvedi, A; Green, PE; Carroll, JD				Chaturvedi, A; Green, PE; Carroll, JD			K-modes clustering	JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						categorical data; cluster analysis; groups; modes; latent class analysis	MARKET-SEGMENTATION	We present a nonparametric approach to deriving clusters from categorical (nominal scale) data using a new clustering procedure called K-modes, which is analogous to the traditional K-Means procedure (MacQueen 1967) for clustering interval scale data. Unlike most existing methods for clustering nominal scale data, the K-modes procedure explicitly optimizes a loss function based on the Lo norm (defined as the limit of an L-p norm as p approaches zero). In Monte Carlo simulations, both K-modes and latent class procedures (e.g., Goodman 1974) performed with equal efficiency in recovering a known underlying cluster structure. However, K-modes is an order of magnitude faster than the latent class procedure in speed and suffers from fewer problems of local optima than do latent class procedures. For data sets involving a large number of categorical variables, latent class procedures become computationally extremely slow and hence infeasible. We conjecture that, although in some cases latent class procedures might perform better than K-modes, it could out-perform latent class procedures in other cases. Hence, we recommend that these two approaches be used as "complementary" procedures in performing cluster analysis. We also present an empirical comparison of K-modes and latent class, where the former method prevails.

J	Makarenkov, V; Legendre, P				Makarenkov, V; Legendre, P			Optimal variable weighting for ultrametric and additive trees and K-means partitioning: Methods and software	JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						additive tree; K-means partitioning; optimal variable weighting; ultrametric tree	PHYLOGENETIC TREES; PROXIMITY DATA; ALGORITHM; SIMILARITY; CLUSTERS	De Soete (1986, 1988) proposed some years ago a method for optimal variable weighting for ultrametric. and additive tree fitting. This paper extends De Soete's method to optimal variable weighting for K-means partitioning. We also describe some new features and improvements to the algorithm proposed by De Soete. Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted using different error conditions. In all cases (i.e., ultrametric or additive trees, or K-means partitioning), the simulation results indicate that the optimal weighting procedure should be used for analyzing data containing noisy variables that do not contribute relevant information to the classification structure. However, if the data involve error-perturbed variables that are relevant to the classification or outliers, it seems better to cluster or partition the entities by using variables with equal weights, A new computer progam, OVW, which is available to researchers as freeware, implements improved algorithms for optimal variable weighting for ultrametric and additive tree clustering, and includes a new algorithm for optimal variable weighting for K-means partitioning.

If successful drug treatment programs are to be developed and maintained, it is imperative that they be tailored to the changing needs of a jurisdictional population. In the current study, 10,022 Washington, DC arrestees surveyed through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program are examined. Hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses are used to identify homogeneous clusters of substance users during two consecutive four-year intervals between 1990 and 1997. Drug treatment policy issues are assessed in light of the variant, temporal classifications derived in the current study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Addition of CoAlPO4-5 could effectively improve rate of color removal and the activation energy of color removal could decrease from about 110 kJ/mole to about 75 kJ/mole as the catalyst loading was increased from 0.0 g/L to 3.0 g/L. Performance of WAO on color removal would somewhat increase with catalyst loading at 145 degreesC whereas the effect of catalyst loading was not significant at 135 degreesC. With no addition of CoAlPO4-5, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value was low. This was due to difficulty of exactly measuring the true COD value of dye solution if the dye was not degraded. Via CoAlPO4-5, COD of dye solution could be effectively decreased. The rate of COD removal would increase with catalyst loading, oxygen pressure and reaction temperature. Furthermore, a maximum COD value observed, which was due to catalyzed degradation of dye molecule via CoAlPO4-5, could be characterized by a consecutive reaction scheme. Kinetic study of color removal is expressed as follows: rate = k x [dye](0.8) x W-0.5 x P " (145 degreesC) or rate = k x [dye](0.8) x W-0 x P " (135 degreesC); where k means rate constant, [] means concentration, W means catalyst loading, P means oxygen pressure and n means uncertain number.

The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is an erosion model that predicts soil loss as a function of soil erodibility (known as K-factor), as well as topographic, rainfall/runoff, cover, and support management factors. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) has assigned each soil series (minimum mapping unit) one value of K representing classes of soil erodibility. Information contained in those surveys implies that K-factor values are free of estimation errors, and remain unchanged not only across whole soil series but also over time. However, evidence provided by soil science literature challenge those assumptions. The objective of this study was to evaluate variability and uncertainty in K-factor as reported by the NCSS at Fort Hood, Texas. We obtained one K value from each of 524 soil samples collected in the late summer of 1998 following a 10 m square grid. For each soil series, sampled K means were significantly different than K values proposed by NCSS, and intraseries coefficients of variation showed variability of up to about 20%. Sampled K values disregarded NCSS soil series boundaries and departed from NCSS K values as the distance from the soil series boundary increased. The USLE estimates of soil loss using sampled K versus NCSS K were also significantly different. Limitations in K estimation from typical pedons of original soil surveys, soil misclassification, as well as changes in surface soil structure may have contributed to the differences found.

Amer Med Informat Assoc		Fuzzy K-means clustering and missing values		Fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm is a popular approach for exploring the structure of a set of patterns, especially when the clusters are overlapping or fuzzy However, the fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm cannot be applied when the data contain missing values. In many cases, the number of patterns with missing values is so large that if these patterns are removed, then the number of patterns to characterize the data set is insufficient. This paper proposes a technique to exploit the information provided by the patterns with the missing values so that the clustering results are enhanced. There are various preprocessing methods to substitute the missing values before clustering the data. However, instead of repairing the data set at the beginning, the repairing can be carried out incrementally in each iteration based on the context. It is thus more likely that less uncertainty is added while incorporating the repair work Fine-tuning the missing values using the information from other attributes further consolidates this scheme. Applications of the proposed method in medical domain have produced good performance. Keywords: Fuzzy K-means clustering and missing values.

J	Tibshirani, R; Walther, G; Hastie, T				Tibshirani, R; Walther, G; Hastie, T			Estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						clustering; groups; hierarchy; K-means; uniform distribution		We propose a method (the 'gap statistic') for estimating the number of clusters (groups) in a set of data. The technique uses the output of any clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means or hierarchical), comparing the change in within-cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate reference null distribution. Some theory is developed for the proposal and a simulation study shows that the gap statistic usually outperforms other methods that have been proposed in the literature.

This paper first introduces rough sets into image segmentation method. In this method, attribute values of each pixel of an image of interest are given by using K-means clustering, and the attribute values divide the image into many regions. By applying value reduct, which is one of the typical concepts of rough sets, to the attribute values, dissimilarities between regions are calculated. Final clustering result is obtained by merging similar regions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed image segmentation method, it was applied to an artificial generated image, and a human brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) image. The results were also compared with convention K-means clustering.

An innovative method, termed incremental splitting, is presented. Taking the K-means method as the core, the proposed approach splits only clusters with the largest total error in each iteration, This heuristic has the effect of allocating more clusters to those regions having more sample data. Consistent experimental results reveal that our method outperforms commonly used heuristics, including random initialization, binary splitting, and pair-wise nearest neighbor.

When refuelling a nuclear reactor, the data produced must be evaluated to ensure that the fuel assembly has landed properly in its position, thereby allowing the continued and safe operation of the station. The process of evaluation is time consuming because of the manual interpretation required and the large amount of data produced. This manual interpretation also requires considerable domain experience due to the nature of the domain. This paper will present an intelligent system to automate the process of the data analysis, thereby shortening the evaluation time and providing an explanation of the reasoning behind its conclusions. The intelligent system utilises a knowledge based system, neural network based classification, K-means clustering techniques and rule induction methods to evaluate the data and inform the operator of any errors encountered.

We reinterpret this function in terms of the data variance explained by a clustering, or, equivalently, in terms of the square-error classical clustering criterion that administers the K-Means and Ward methods. This analysis suggests extensions of the scoring function to situations with differently standardized and mixed scale data.

All three algorithms use the same underlying model: a naive-Bayes model with a hidden root node, also known as a multinomial-mixture model. In the first part of the paper, we perform an experimental comparison between three batch algorithms that learn the parameters of this model: the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a "winner take all" version of the EM algorithm reminiscent of the K-means algorithm, and model-based agglomerative clustering. We find that the EM algorithm significantly outperforms the other methods, and proceed to investigate the effect of various initialization methods on the final solution produced by the EM algorithm. The initializations that we consider are (1) parameters sampled from an uninformative prior, (2) random perturbations of the marginal distribution of the data, and (3) the output of agglomerative clustering. Although the methods are substantially different, they lead to learned models that are similar in quality.

J	Dhillon, IS; Modha, DS				Dhillon, IS; Modha, DS			Concept decompositions for large sparse text data using clustering	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						concept vectors; fractals; high-dimensional data; information retrieval; k-means algorithm; least-squares; principal angles; principal component analysis; self-similarity; singular value decomposition; sparsity; vector space models; text mining		Unlabeled document collections are becoming increasingly common and available; mining such data sets represents a major contemporary challenge. Using words as features, text documents are often represented as high-dimensional and sparse vectors-a few thousand dimensions and a sparsity of 95 to 99% is typical. In this paper, we study a certain spherical k-means algorithm for clustering such document vectors. The algorithm outputs k disjoint clusters each with a concept vector that is the centroid of the cluster normalized to have unit Euclidean norm. As our first contribution, we empirically demonstrate that, owing to the high-dimensionality and sparsity of the text data, the clusters produced by the algorithm have a certain "fractal-like" and "self-similar" behavior. As our second contribution, we introduce concept decompositions to approximate the matrix of document vectors; these decompositions are obtained by taking the least-squares approximation onto the linear subspace spanned by all the concept vectors. We empirically establish that the approximation errors of the concept decompositions are close to the best possible, namely, to truncated singular value decompositions. As our third contribution, we show that the concept vectors are localized in the word space, are sparse, and tend towards orthonormality. In contrast, the singular vectors are global in the word space and are dense. Nonetheless, we observe the surprising fact that the linear subspaces spanned by the concept vectors and the leading singular vectors are quite close in the sense of small principal angles between them. In conclusion, the concept vectors produced by the spherical k-means algorithm constitute a powerful sparse and localized "basis" for text data sets.

Instead of direct prediction of a continuous output variable, the method discretizes the variable by k-means clustering and solves the resultant classification problem. Predictions on new examples are made by averaging the mean values of classes with votes that are close in number to the most likely class. We provide experimental evidence that this indirect approach can often yield strong results for many applications, generally outperforming direct approaches such as regression trees and rivaling bagged regression trees.

However the manual selection of textural features in the previous approaches not only makes these segmentation methods inadaptable but could lead to the results with bias. Herein we propose an auto-feature-selection algorithm to solve the problems. This algorithm includes three steps: The feature library composed of 32 textural features was established at first. The genetic algorithm was then used to auto-select the features and give each of them different weight according to their importance. The fitness of each gene was evaluated by five factors including region dissimilarity, number of edge points, edge fragmentation, edge thickness, and curvature. Finally, K-means process classified the image into 3 different tissues using the selected features with different weights. The segmentation outcomes of various ultrasonic images by this auto-feature selection algorithm have shown better correspondence with human comprehension in comparison with the results of previous works. In addition, it provides a more adaptive way to adjust the weight of the features used for clustering process and therefore to avoid takeover by the big-value features. This problem has been paid little attention in the traditional K-means process in which all the features have the same weight.

However, regions are not only characterised in statistical terms. Structural and/or spatial properties are also important and should be both considered. This paper presents a method which incorporates statistical and spatial image properties under a unified scheme, for segmentation of MR images of the brain. It combines a pyramidal or quadtree smoothing operation with statistical segmentation performed at variable levels of the quad-tree, followed by a download boundary estimation. After the segmentation step (k-means clustering algorithm), all regions and their belonging pixels are computed and stored on a data structure suitable for the quad-tree smoothing and boundary estimation. This paper describes this technique in detail and shows some results obtained on both test and MR data.

Segmentation of moving objects in image sequences is even more difficult and computationally expensive. In this work we propose a technique for spatio-temporal segmentation of medical sequences based on K-mean clustering in the feature vector space. The motivation for spatio-temporal segmentation approach comes from the fact that motion is a useful clue for object segmentation. Two-dimensional feature vector has been used for clustering in the feature space. In this paper we apply the proposed technique to segmentation of cardiac images. The first feature used in this particular application is image brightness, which reveals the structure of interest in the image. The second feature is the Euclidean norm of the optical flow vector. The third feature is the three-dimensional optical flow vector, which consists of computed motion in all three dimensions. The optical flow itself is computed using Horn-Schunck algorithm. The fourth feature is the mean brightness of the input image in a local neighborhood. By applying the clustering algorithm it is possible to detect moving object in the image sequence. The experiment has been conducted using a sequence of ECG-gated magnetic resonance (MR) images of a beating heart taken as in time so in the space.

Internal structure features were derived from CT density and 3-D curvatures to characterize the inhomogeneous of CT density distribution inside the nodule. In the classification step, we combined an unsupervised k-means clustering (KMC) procedure and a supervised linear discriminate (LD) classifier. The KMC procedure classified the sample nodules into two classes by using the mean CT density values for two different regions such as a core region and a complement of the core region in 3-D nodule image. The LD classifier was designed for each class by using internal structure features. The forward stepwise procedure was used to select the best feature subset from multi-dimensional feature spaces. The discriminant scores output from the classifier were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method and the classification accuracy was quantified by the area, Az, under the ROC curve. We analyzed a data set of 248 pulmonary nodules in this study. The hybrid classifier was more effective than the LD classifier alone in distinguishing malignant and benign nodules. The improvement was statistically significant in comparison to classification in the LD classifier alone. The results of this study indicate the potential of combining the KMC procedure and the LD classifier for computer-aided classification of pulmonary nodules.

One approach, made practically feasible with the advent of DNA microarray technology, consists of clustering of genes into groups of coexpressed genes, i.e. genes exhibiting similar behavior in some circumstances. Among the various methods used for identification of groups of coexpressed genes, k-Means is one of the most popular. However, we show here that k-Means is a highly unreliable method of clustering, yielding high-quality solutions with low probability. We then present the Optichip software based on Genetic Algorithms, which addresses the drawback, supplying high-quality solutions in short time with very high reliability.

However, they are only partitioning a database, so it is difficult to discover the reason why each cluster is formed. This paper proposes a method to discover the knowledge of how the clusters are derived. To select the center vector of each cluster, we employ an unsupervised clustering method based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM) without giving the number of clusters, We define the degree of contribution calculated from the weights of the neural network which learned the center vectors. We then describe the knowledge discovery method from the degrees. We applied our method to the artificial data and the clustering problem. The results show that the degree of contribution is an efficient indicator to represent the knowledge of how the clusters are formed.

These data cleaning algorithms efficiently eliminate erroneous soundings from deep water (depth > 80 m) survey datasets but generate dubious soundings in shallow water. Such soundings are time consuming for an operator to validate or invalidate. In order to improve performance, we tested whether additional information could be derived from the correlation between multibeam imagery and bathymetry. The discussed methodology attempts to associate imaged objects (echo/shadow sets) with a list of suspicious soundings output by SHOM algorithms. Two approaches are considered: a ping-to-ping approach and a geographic approach. Object detection algorithms are run on the two different methods. In the ping-to-ping approach, three segmentation methods have been implemented. The first of them uses an average histogram of the file in which thresholds are set up for the segmentation. The second employs an entropy method to minimize an energy function for determining the thresholds of the segmentation. The final method, Fuzzy k Mean, plots the pixels to be segmented in a partition space whose axes are statistical variables of the pixels and then performs a segmentation depending on the way the pixels are gathered around a common centroid. The geographic approach is based on texture analysis of the mosaic. A neural network is built on a database constituted of samples (sub-areas) from the mosaic. The neural network is then used to sort groups of pixels into different classes. Boundaries of high and low backscatter areas are extracted, and the correlation between these areas and the positions of the suspicious soundings from SHOM are derived. Two datasets are examined: one from a SIMRAD EM1002S and another from an ATLAS FS20. A good correlation has been found on top of echoes in SIMRAD EM1002S data. Such areas require the expertise of hydrographers to sort the beams belonging to echoes from the erroneous ones. Other types of suspicious soundings that don't match with a corresponding feature in the imagery include isolated beams, beams in the phase/amplitude bottom detection interface, and groups of dubious beams belonging to the same ping. A strategy to invalidate these beams in the bathymetry could be easily set up means of automatic algorithms. ATLAS FS20 imagery data produced mosaics that are closer to real sidescan mosaics. Extraction of real shadow boundaries was achieved on this dataset. The segmentation tools developed are helpful for analyzing suspicious beams where the imagery presents an anomaly. The four methods implemented may be adapted to the type of data used and to the desired subtlety of the segmentation.

This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm based on the sequential k-means clustering technique. It follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm and uses a masterslave model designed to minimize comunications overhead. It will be shown that this technique compares favorably with the preceding parallel clustering algorithms.

The matrix representation of microarray data and its successive 'optimal' incisional hyperplanes that create top-down hierarchical tree are a useful platform for developing optimization algorithms to determine the 'optimal' clusters from a pairwise proximity matrix which represents completely connected and weighted graph [1]. Evolution strategy is applied to determine the 'globally optimal' incisional hyperplanes to construct hierarchical tree structure and tested with Fisher's iris and Golub's leukemia data sets. The results were compared with those of bottom-up hierarchical clustering, K-means and SOMs(Self-Organizing Maps) algorithms with promising results.

The existing evolutionary approach of image segmentation has the advantages over the other approaches such as continuous contour, non-oversegmentation, and non-thresholds, but suffers from long computation time. EISA uses a K-means algorithm to split an image into many homogeneous regions and then merges the split regions automatically using an evolutionary algorithm. The image segmentation problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the objective function is also given. EISA using a novel chromosome encoding method and a novel intelligent genetic algorithm makes the segmentation results be robust and the computation time be much shorter than the existing evolutionary image segmentation algorithms. Design and analysis of EISA are also presented. Experimental results of natural images with various degrees of noise demonstrate the effectiveness of EISA.

The method consists of four steps: segmentation; parameter extraction; cluster analysis; and classification. The parameters we compared were the parameters of Hjorth, the harmonic parameters and the relative band energy. For cluster analysis we used a modified version of the K-means algorithm. It is shown that the investigated parameters are capable of extracting information from the EEG relevant for sleep stage scoring. Using the modified K-means algorithm it is possible to find 'similar' segments and hence automate the detection of sleep stages. However, extra information e.g., the ECG (electrocardiogram) or the EOG (electrooculogram) is probably necessary for a clear discrimination between the different sleep stages.

However, this success is not mirrored at rotational speeds below 16r/min. At such speeds the energy generated from bearing defects might not show as an obvious change in signature and thus becomes undetectable using conventional vibration measuring equipment. This paper presents an investigation into the applicability of stress wave analysis for detecting early stages of bearing damage at a rotational speed of 1.12 r/min (0.0187 Hz). Furthermore, it reviews work undertaken in monitoring bearings rotating at speeds below 16 r/min.

It may be applied to large-scale gene expression data to form new hypotheses regarding gene function. In the present study, we clustered the temporal expression patterns of genes expressed in the rat hippocampus during normal development and after a kainate-induced seizure injury at postnatal day 25. We found that two different methods, Euclidean hierarchical and K-means clustering, produced slightly different results, and concluded that different clustering methods may be used to complement one another. We also found that certain genes cluster together both during development and after seizure injury consistent with the idea of sets of genes that act in concert under various conditions.

Its use in data mining is growing very fast. Traditional clustering algorithms which no longer cater to the data mining requirements are modified increasingly. Clustering algorithms are numerous which can be divided in several categories. Two prominent categories are distance-based and density-based (e.g. K-means a,ld DBSCAN, respectively?). While K-means is fast, eas? to implement, and converges to local optima almost surely, but it is also easily affected by noise. On the other hand, while density-based clustering can find arbitrary shape clusters and handle noise well, but it is also slow in comparison due to neighborhood search for each data point, and faces difficulty in setting density threshold properly. In this paper, we propose BRIDGE that efficiently merges the two by exploiting the advantages of one to counter the limitations of the other a,ld vice versa. BRIDGE enables DBSCAN to handle very large data efficiently and improves the quality of K-means clusters by removing the noisy points. It also helps the user in setting the density threshold parameter proper!,: We further show that other clustering algorithms can be merged using similar strategy. An example given in the paper merges BIRCH clustering with DBSCAN.

Clustering documents enables the user to have a good overall view of the information contained in the documents that he has. However, existing algorithms suffer from various aspects: hard clustering algorithms (where each document belongs to exactly one cluster) cannot detect the multiple themes of a document, while soft clustering algorithms (where each document can belong to multiple clusters) are usually inefficient. We propose SISC (SImilarity-based Soft Clustering), an efficient soft clustering algorithm based on a given similarity measure. SISC required only a similarity measure for clustering and uses randomization to help make the clustering efficient.

They use a measure of similarity, which characterizes the membership of a point to a group of points based on a potential function. The potential function-based algorithms (PFBA) are capable of clustering a set of experimental data, without knowing in advance the number of clusters. Also, they make no implicit assumptions on the cluster shapes and do not use any prototype vectors of the clusters. In this paper, some advantages of these algorithms over the algorithms based on distance to the prototype vectors (such as k-means and ISODATA) are studied: pseudo-gravitational effect, cluster shapes influence, singular points separation and robustness to noise.

It is well recognized that a good feature set plays a key role in a successful recognition system. Shape normalization is as well an essential step toward achieving translation, scale, and rotation invariance in recognition. Many shape normalization methods and different feature sets have been proposed in the literature. This paper first reviews five commonly used shape normalization schemes and then discusses various feature extraction techniques usually used in handwritten Chinese character recognition. Based on numerous experiments conducted on 3,755 handwritten Chinese characters (GB2312-80), we discuss the matches made between the normalization schemes and the features sets and suggest the best match between them in terms of classification performance. The nearest neighbor classifier is-as adopted in our experiments with templates obtained by using the K-means clustering algorithm.

The system presented in this paper satisfies this need by automatically generating semantic concepts for images from their low-level visual features. The proposed system is built in two stages. First, an adaptation of k-means clustering using a non-Euclidean similarity metric is applied to discover the natural patterns of the data in the low-level feature space; the cluster prototype is designed to summarize the cluster in a manner that is suited for quick human comprehension of its components. Second, statistics measuring the variation within each cluster are used to derive a set of mappings between the most significant low-level features and the most frequent keywords of the corresponding cluster. The set of the derived rules could be used further to capture the semantic content and index new untagged images added to the image database. The attachment of semantic concepts to images will also give the system the advantage of handling queries expressed in terms of keywords and thus, it reduces the semantic gap between the user's conceptualization of a query and the query that is actually specified to the system. While the suggested scheme works with any kind of low-level features, our implementation and description of the system is centered on the use of image color information. Experiments using a 21 00 image database are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed system.

The proposed technique is based on an iterative method, in which segmentation at a given iteration depends closely on the segmentation results at the previous iteration. The hyperspectral images are first coarsely segmented and then the segmentation is successively refined via an iterative spectral dissimilarity measure. The algorithm also provides reduced computational complexity and improved segmentation performance. The algorithm consists of (i) an initial segmentation based on a fixed spectral dissimilarity measure and the k-means algorithm, and (ii) subsequent adaptive segmentation based on an iterative spectral dissimilarity measure over a local region whose size is reduced progressively. The iterative use of a local spectral dissimilarity measure provided a set of values that can discriminate among different materials. The proposed unsupervised segmentation technique proved to be superior to other unsupervised algorithms, especially when a large number of different materials are mixed in complex hyperspectral scenes.

For depth estimation, we make use of census transform for robust determination of correspondence of a stereo pair. To interpolate unknown disparities, we introduced a process influenced by the K-means algorithm. For densification of the depth data, we make use of Region Competition. During the stitching, the confidence of the data is improved for the overlapped areas by multiple evaluation of the disparity data.

One of the important levels of processing is image segmentation. In this, a gray level image is segmented into some limited number of classes. One of these segmentation techniques is clustering. Cluster analysis is the formal study of algorithms and methods for grouping. Most of the K-means class of methods start with some initial seed points and grow cluster around them. There exists two basic problems related to all seed based techniques - choice of appropriate initial seed points and single seed based techniques are not effective of more complex and elongated shape. Any elongated or non-convex cluster can be considered as the union of a few distinct hyperspherical clusters. A multi-seed clustering method based on the border points proposed by Chaudhuri and Chaudhuri but, the border point extraction from remote sensing satellite imagery (RSSI) and noisy data is a difficult job. RSSI data has three basic characteristics - non-parametric, highly overlapping and non-Gaussian. The proposed seed-point detection technique is statistical based and can solve the non-parametric as well as non-Gaussian problems. Also it focuses on the non-Gaussian field as the union of several Gaussian fields. Each seed point has a core set. After finding the seed points, an initial splitting technique (IST) based on the min-min-metric operation of the parameters mode and mean of each core set is proposed. Since RSSI data is highly overlapping, so IST algorithm can not cluster properly in the overlapping region. Another type of splitting technique is introduced in the overlapping regions. For finding the pair of overlapping clusters and overlapping regions minimal spanning tree based and set theoretic based mathematical formulation have been developed in this paper. Finally, the optimal splitting technique in the overlapping region based on maximizing the between class valiance is introduced. This algorithm is tested on several real life data.

Fractal dimension extracts roughness information from images considering all available scales at once. In this work a single scale is considered at a time so that textures that do not possess scale invariance are sufficiently characterized. Single scale features are combined with multiple scale features for a more complete textural representation. Wavelets are employed for the computation of single and multiple scale roughness features due to their ability to extract information at different resolutions. Features are extracted at multiple directions using directional wavelets, and the feature vector is finally transformed to a rotational invariant feature vector that retains the texture directional information. An iterative K-means scheme is used for segmentation. The use of the roughness feature set results in high quality segmentation performance. The feature set retains the important properties of fractal dimension based features, namely insensitivity to absolute illumination and contrast.

First, image sequence analysis is used to estimate the shape and motion parameters of the person facing the camera. A spatiotemporal filter, taking into account the intensity differences between consequent frames, is applied, in order to separate the moving person from the static background. The foreground is segmented in a number of regions in order to identify the face. For this purpose, we propose the novel procedure of K-Means with connectivity constraint algorithm as a general segmentation algorithm combining several types of information including intensity, motion and compactness. In this algorithm, the use of spatiotemporal regions is introduced since a number of frames are analyzed simultaneously and as a result, the same region is present in consequent frames. Based on this information, a 3-D ellipsoid is adapted to the person's face using an efficient and robust algorithm. The rigid 3-D motion is estimated next using a least median of squares approach.

A new multispectral (MS) approach is described to characterize cerebral ischemia in a time-independent fashion. MS analysis of five MR parameters (mean diffusivity, diffusion anisotropy, T2, proton density, and perfusion) was employed to characterize the progression of ischemic lesion in the rat brain following 60 minutes of transient focal ischemia. k-Means (KM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) classification methods were employed to define the acute and subacute ischemic lesion. KM produced an estimate of lesion volume that was highly correlated with postmortem infarct volume, independent of the age of the lesion. Overall classification rates for KM exceeded FCM at acute and subacute time points as follows: KM, 90.5%, 94.4%, and 95.9%; FCM, 82.4%, 90.6%, and 82.6% (for 45 minutes, 180 minutes, and 24-120 hours post MCAO groups). MS analysis also offers a formal method of combining diffusion and perfusion parameters to provide an estimate of the ischemic penumbra (KM classification rate = 70.3%). (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This paper presents a novel approach for training a multiresolution, hierarchical wavelet basis function (WBF) neural network for the three-dimensional characterization of defects from magnetic flux leakage signals. Gaussian radial basis functions and Mexican hat wavelet frames are used as scaling functions and wavelets respectively. The centers of the basis functions are calculated using a dyadic expansion scheme and a k-means clustering algorithm. The results indicate that significant advantages over other neural network based defect characterization schemes could be obtained, in that the accuracy of the predicted defect profile can be controlled by the resolution of the network. The feasibility of employing a WBF neural network is demonstrated by predicting defect profiles from both simulation data and experimental magnetic flux leakage signals.

In this paper, we propose the use of a variable scale factor which is a function of the iteration number. For the vector quantization of image data, we show that it offers faster convergence than the modified K-means algorithm with a fixed scale factor, without affecting the optimality of the codebook.

J	Sierra, A; Corbacho, F				Sierra, A; Corbacho, F			Reclassification as supervised clustering	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								In some branches of science, such as molecular biology, classes may be defined but not completely trusted. Sometimes posterior analysis proves them to be partially incorrect. Despite its relevance, this phenomenon has not received much attention within the neural computation community. We define reclassification as the task of redefining some given classes by maximum likelihood learning in a model that contains both supervised and unsupervised information. This approach leads to supervised clustering with an additional complexity penalizing term on the number of new classes. As a proof of concept, a simple reclassification algorithm is designed and applied to a data set of gene sequences. To test the performance of the algorithm, two of the original classes are merged. The algorithm is capable of unraveling the original three-class hidden structure, in contrast to the unsupervised version (K-means); moreover, it predicts the subdivision of one of the original classes into two different ones.

We analyzed four CT images through two pointwise classifiers (the first classifier is based on the maximum-likelihood criterion and the second classifier is based on the k-means clustering algorithm) and one contextual Bayesian classifier (ICM algorithm - Iterated Conditional Modes) using an a priori Potts-Strauss model. A feature extraction procedure using the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance and the Karhunen-Loeve transformation was also performed. Both the classification and the feature selection procedures were found to be in agreement with the predicted discrimination given by the separation of the linear attenuation coefficient curves for different materials.

J	Veprek, P; Bradley, AB				Veprek, P; Bradley, AB			An improved algorithm for vector quantizer design	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						vector quantization		Vector quantization is an essential tool in signal processing. Although many algorithms for vector quantizer design have been developed, the classical generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) is still widely used, mainly for its simplicity and relatively good performance. Recently, Lee et al. [6] proposed an intuitive modification of the K-means algorithm (MKMA). In this letter, we propose an improved algorithm that uses the standard GLA embedded in a codevector reassignment loop. The algorithm achieves better performance by targeting specifically those sections of the codebook that contribute most to the overall reconstructed signal distortion. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both the traditional GLA and MKMA in a variety of scenarios.

The training set is K-means clustered and locally most entropic colored Gaussian joint input-output probability density function (pdf) estimates are formed per cluster, The number of clusters is chosen such that the resulting overall colored Gaussian mixture exhibits minimum differential entropy upon global cross-validated shaping. Numerical studies on real data and synthetic data examples drawn from the literature illustrate and support these theoretical developments.

The searching capability of genetic algorithms is exploited in order to search for appropriate cluster centres in the feature space such that a similarity metric of the resulting clusters is optimized. The chromosomes, which are represented as strings of real numbers, encode the centres of a fixed number of clusters. The superiority of the GA-clustering algorithm over the commonly used K-means algorithm is extensively demonstrated for four artificial and three real-life data sets.

J	Yendrikhovski, SN				Yendrikhovski, SN			Color categorization and structure of perceptive experience	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article								This paper is an attempt to develop a coherent framework for understanding, simulating, and predicting color categories. The process of color categorization can be understood as a structuring of preceding color experience on the basis of statistical distribution of light in observers' environment. A proposed computational model of color categorization includes: 1) distribution of R, G, B pixel values representing a sample of 630 color images of natural scenes (analogue of physical light experience); 2) transformation of the R, G, B pixel values into L*u*v* coordinates of the CIELUV color space (analogue of the process of color perception); 3) distribution of the L*u*v* coordinates representing the sample of the color images (analogue of perceived color experience); 4) k-means clustering algorithm of the L*u*v* coordinates representing the sample of the color images (analogue of the process of color categorization); 5) location and oreder of color clusters (analogue of location and order of color categories). The proposed computational model enables us to predict the location and order of color categories, being consistent with psycholinguistic data.

During the study 15 077 dives were recorded. The duration of dives was 2.0 +/- 2.3 min and diving depth was 17.2 +/- 22.5 m (maximum 18.7 min and 288 m, respectively). Haulout periods occurred 3 +/- 2 times per day (duration = 44.0 +/- 98.1 min). The overall distance swum per day was 48.1 +/- 23.2 km. Three dive types were differentiated using a combination of hierarchical and k-means clustering, one V-shaped grouping and two U-shaped groupings. The most common dive type was U(1); these dives were the deepest and longest type (depth = 28 +/- 32 m, duration = 185 +/- 146 s), and bottom time occupied a significant fraction of the total dive time (120 +/- 120 s). These dives are likely foraging dives. Lactation is energetically demanding for bearded seals, and females do forage while they have dependent pups.

J	Owens, WH				Owens, WH			Error estimates in the measurement of anisotropic magnetic susceptibility	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						anisotropic magnetic susceptibility; measurement errors; Hext	ROCK	Hext's (1963) first-order analysis for error estimation in measurements of second-rank tensors is applied to the torque meter and the orthogonal-coil induction instrument, both representatives of the class of instruments that measures differences in magnetic susceptibility. The conventional measurement design for the torque meter is rotatable; an efficient and nearly rotatable design is proposed for the orthogonal-coil instrument. Error estimates are derived for a set of anisotropy parameters, K-mean, H and mu. The applicability of a first-order analysis is discussed and illustrated by simulation studies.

J	Wharrad, HJ; Jefferson, D				Wharrad, HJ; Jefferson, D			Distinguishing between physiological and essential tremor using discriminant and cluster analyses of parameters derived from the frequency spectrum	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						physiological tremor; essential tremor; frequency spectrum; discriminant analysis	FINGER TREMOR; PROPRANOLOL; POPULATION; AMPLITUDE	Three parameters, root mean square (rms) acceleration, frequency and shape, were calculated from the frequency spectrum in 20 patients with essential tremor. Tremor was measured in two postures (with the arms outstretched - 'postural' tremor and with the arm supported and hand relaxed - 'rest' tremor) in the dominant and non-dominant hands using a piezo-electric accelerometer. These data were compared with data obtained from accelerometric measurements of physiological tremor in 81 adults. Step-wise discriminant analysis was applied to the data to identify which variables best discriminated between essential and physiological tremor. K-means cluster analysis was used to identify any sub-groups within the essential tremor data. The analysis identified four variables, which together, best distinguished between physiological and essential tremor, these were postural amplitude and frequency, and rest shape (non-dominant hand) and postural shape (dominant hand). Using these variables 94.74% of cases were correctly classified into the physiological and essential tremor groups. Cluster analysis on the amplitude values for postural tremor (but not for the other parameters or postures measured) suggested that two sub-groups were present in this sample of essential tremor patients. Discriminant analysis and K-means cluster analysis on parameters derived from the frequency spectrum of tremor measured in different postures can be used to distinguish pathological tremors from physiological tremor and provide a way of identifying possible sub-groups in essential tremor.

J	Lai, AHS; Yung, NHC				Lai, AHS; Yung, NHC			Lane detection by orientation and length discrimination	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						camera parameter estimation; center line detection; edge detection; lane detection	ALGORITHM; VISION	This paper describes a novel lane detection algorithm for visual traffic surveillance applications under the auspice of intelligent transportation systems, Traditional lane detection methods for vehicle navigation typically use spatial masks to isolate instantaneous lane information from on-vehicle camera images. When surveillance is concerned, complete lane and multiple lane information is essential for tracking vehicles and monitoring lane change frequency from overhead cameras, where traditional methods become inadequate, The algorithm presented in this paper extracts complete multiple lane information by utilizing prominent orientation and length features of lane markings and curb structures to discriminate against other minor features. Essentially, edges are first extracted from the background of a traffic sequence, then thinned and approximated by straight lines, From the resulting set of straight lines, orientation and length discriminations are carried out three-dimensionally with the aid of two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate transformation and K-means clustering, By doing so, edges with strong orientation and length affinity are retained and clustered, while short and isolated edges are eliminated, Overall, the merits of this algorithm are as follows. First, it works well under practical visual surveillance conditions. Second, using K-means for clustering offers a robust approach. Third, the algorithm is efficient as it only requires one image frame to determine the road center lines. Fourth, it computes multiple lane information simultaneously. Fifth, the center lines determined are accurate enough for the intended application.

J	Lucas, C; Zipser, EJ				Lucas, C; Zipser, EJ			Environmental variability during TOGA COARE	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							WESTERN PACIFIC; WAVE DISTURBANCES; DRY AIR; MESOSCALE; CONVECTION; HEIGHT	This study provides quantitative estimates of the thermodynamic and kinematic structures of the troposphere during various convective regimes observed during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocran-Atmosphere Response Experiment. The data source is the upper air soundings from six stations in the intensive flux array. A correction algorithm has: been applied to the humidity data to remove biases between the stations. The data an: analyzed using the nonhierarchical clustering method known as k means. Eleven thermodynamic clusters and 20 kinematic clusters are selected. The thermodynamic clusters are grouped into four general categories based on their midtropospheric equivalent potential temperature. Deep convective activity varies with the thermodynamic structure of the environment. When the "dry intrusion" group is observed, convection is suppressed. The "fair weather" category corresponds to undisturbed periods with light winds and small mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). The largest MCSs and the majority of the rainfall occur with the "active" and "convective recovery" categories. The kinematic clusters are also divided into four general categories based on the strength, direction, and depth of the low-level zonal Row. The timing of the clusters is related to the intraseasonol oscillation (ISO). Dry phases of the ISO are characterized by the "low-level easterly" category. During transition periods between the easterly and westerly phases of the ISO, the "calm" category is often seen. The "moderate shear westerly" group is seen just before the strongest westerlies.

The authors assessed the effect of state changes upon such findings. Within-subject 3D MRIs were assessed for ventricular and brain volumes during periods of [partial] remission and of exacerbation of psychosis, Additional scans at comparable within-subject SAPS were used to assess rates of change in volumes that were independent of SAPS changes. Correlations of changes of ventricle and brain volumes vs. change of SAPS cores between scans revealed that ventricle volumes decreased during a period of psychotic exacerbation and increased at a time of [partial] remission (r(p) = -0.666; P < 0.0005); conversely, brain volumes increased during psychotic exacerbation and decreased at [partial] remission (r(p) = + 0.448; P = 0.032). Scans at comparable SAPS scores suggested that the majority of patients had rates of ventricular expansion comparable to controls (0.9 +/- 0.6 cc/year), though two patients appeared to have rates of ventricular increase of 4.5 +/- 2.1 cc/year (Lilliefores P = 0.036; K-means clustering F = 17.75). Exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenia is accompanied by evidence of brain swelling, especially of periventricular brain, with incroachment of brain substance upon ventricular volumes. Controlled for state changes, the majority of schizophrenics show rates of ventricular expansion or brain atrophy indistinguishable from controls. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, studies that have evaluated serotonergic pharmacotherapy for reducing drinking have yielded conflicting results. One explanation for these findings is a general failure to distinguish alcohol subgroups that may be differentiated on the basis of serotonergic abnormalities. However, in 1996, Kranzler and colleagues reported that Type B alcoholics, who are characterized by high levels of premorbid vulnerability, alcohol dependence severity, and comorbid psychopathology, showed less favorable drinking outcomes in response to treatment with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, than with placebo. This medication effect was not seen in Type A alcoholics, i.e., those with lower risk/severity of alcoholism and psychopathology. The aim of the present study was to explore the validity of differential responding by alcohol-dependent subtypes using the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline. Methods: A k-means clustering procedure was applied to a sample of alcohol-dependent subjects enrolled in a 14-week, placebo-controlled trial of 200 mg/day of sertraline, classifying them into lower-risk severity (Type A: n = 55) and higher-risk/severity (Type B: n = 45) subgroups. Results: A significant interaction between alcoholic subtype and medication condition was found, confirming the findings of Kranzler and colleagues that alcoholic subtypes responded differentially to serotonergic medication. Somewhat at variance with their results, however, the present study showed that the lower risk/severity (Type A) subjects had more favorable outcomes when treated with sertraline compared to placebo. Conclusions: Alcoholic subtypes differentially responded to sertraline when used as a treatment to reduce alcohol drinking, with one subtype having more favorable outcomes. Subtyping alcoholics may help to resolve conflicting findings in the literature on serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence.

J	Burrough, PA; van Gaans, PFM; MacMillan, RA				Burrough, PA; van Gaans, PFM; MacMillan, RA			High-resolution landform classification using fuzzy k-means	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy k-means; fuzzy sets; digital elevation models; landform classification; geographical information systems	SOIL; LOGIC; ELEVATION; EROSION	Previous attempts to devise automated methods of landscape classification have been frustrated by computational issues related to the size of the data set and the fact that most automated classification methods create discrete classes while 'natural' interpreted landscape units often have overlapping property sets. Methods of fuzzy k-means have been used by other workers to overcome the problem of class overlap but their usefulness may be reduced when data sets are large and when the data include artefacts introduced by the derivation of landform attributes from gridded digital elevation models. This paper presents ways to overcome these limitations using spatial sampling methods, statistical modelling of the derived stream topology, and fuzzy k-means using the Distance metric. Using data from Alberta, Canada, and the French pre-Alps it is shown how these methods may easily create meaningful, spatially coherent landform classes from high resolution gridded DEMs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Remund, QP; Long, DG; Drinkwater, MR				Remund, QP; Long, DG; Drinkwater, MR			An iterative approach to multisensor sea ice classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						maximum a posteriori classification; maximum likelihood classification; radiometer; sea ice; sea ice classification; scatterometer	APERTURE RADAR DATA; RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT; SCATTEROMETER DATA; EXTENT; OCEAN; SNOW	Characterizing the variability in sea ice in the polar regions is fundamental to an understanding of global climate and the geophysical processes governing climate changes. Sea ice can be grouped into a number of general classes with different characteristics. Multisensor data from NSCAT, ERS-2 and SSM/I are reconstructed into enhanced resolution imagery for use in ice-type classification. The resulting twelve dimensional data set is linearly transformed through principal component analysis to reduce data dimensionality and noise levels. An iterative statistical data segmentation algorithm is developed using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) techniques. For a given ice type, the conditional probability distributions of observed vectors are assumed to be Gaussian. The cluster centroids, covariance matrices, and a priori distributions are estimated from the classification of a previous temporal image set. An initial classification is produced using centroid training data and a weighted nearest-neighbor classifier. Though validation is limited, the algorithm results in an ice classification that is judged to be superior to a conventional k-means approach.

J	Shyu, RC; Wang, JF; Lee, JY				Shyu, RC; Wang, JF; Lee, JY			Improvement in connected Mandarin digit recognition by explicitly modeling coarticulatory information	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						connected Mandarin digit recognition; segmental k-means algorithm; coarticulatory information; multi-section Bayesian template; level-building algorithm	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SPEECH RECOGNITION	The most successful training scheme for recognition of connected spoken digits is the segmental k-means algorithm, which implicitly captures the coarticulatory information of connected speech iteratively to establish reliable reference patterns. However, when this algorithm is applied to Mandarin digits, the obtained performance is inferior to that of English. Hence, a novel approach is proposed to build reliable reference patterns of connected Mandarin digits. Our method is to partition each training digit into three sections and they represent the coarticulation interacting with the preceding digit, the characteristic of the digit itself and the coarticulation interacting with the succeeding digit respectively. In this manner, the coarticulatory information is caught explicitly. Then we model these three sections separately using three Bayesian templates and a resultant multi-section Bayesian template is constructed for each reference Mandarin digit. The experimental result shows that the new method outperforms the segmental k-means by 3.2% when using a multi-speaker speech database.

J	Tseng, LY; Yang, SB				Tseng, LY; Yang, SB			A genetic clustering algorithm for data with non-spherical-shape clusters	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; genetic clustering algorithm; non-spherical-shape clusters		In solving clustering problem, traditional methods, for example, the K-means algorithm and its variants, usually ask the user to provide the number of clusters. Unfortunately, the number of clusters in general is unknown to the user. The traditional neighborhood clustering algorithm usually needs the user to provide a distance d for the clustering. This d is difficult to decide because some clusters may be compact but others may be loose. In this paper, we propose a genetic clustering algorithm for clustering the data whose clusters are not of spherical shape. It can automatically cluster the data according to the similarities and automatically find the proper number of clusters. The experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm. (C) 2000 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bagarello, V; Iovino, M; Tusa, G				Bagarello, V; Iovino, M; Tusa, G			Factors affecting measurement of the near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							MULTISTEP OUTFLOW EXPERIMENTS; GUELPH PERMEAMETER; TENSION-INFILTROMETER; INFILTRATION RATES; INVERSE METHOD; STEADY FLOW; SINGLE-RING; CLAY SOIL; ONE-STEP; FIELD	Different techniques and different technique application procedures are available to determine soil hydraulic conductivity (K). The objective of this study was to determine the dependence of the K values on the selected technique and application procedure. Soil hydraulic conductivity was determined on a sandy loam soil in the near-saturated zone by the pressure infiltrometer, the tension infiltrometer field techniques, and the inverse method applied to laboratory outflow multistep experiments. Other experiments included a study of ascending and descending pressure heads (h) On the K values measured by the tension infiltrometer technique, and the effect of contact material on ponded infiltration rates. Differences between ascending and descending K means and coefficients of variation were <20% for low pressure heads (h less than or equal to -120 mm). Three successive pending infiltration runs produced mean field-saturated hydraulic conductivities decreasing from 42.7 to 81.8 mm h(-1) to 12.9 to 20.6 mm h(-1) whether or not contact material was present on the infiltration surface. The mean values of K obtained by the selected three methods ranged between 47.1 to 71.9 mm h(-1) at saturation and 0.2 to 2.6 mm h(-1) at h = -120 mm. The K(h) relationships obtained by the pressure with tension infiltrometer and multistep techniques were essentially overlapping. The pressure infiltrometer produced K(h) relationships that were different from those determined by the two Other techniques. In conclusion, ponded infiltration measurements were not usable for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity, but contact material and ascending vs. descending direction had no substantial effect on infiltration rate.

J	Bennett, SJ; Hayward, MD; Marshall, DF				Bennett, SJ; Hayward, MD; Marshall, DF			Morphological differentiation in four species of the genus Lolium	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						cluster analysis; Lolium; morphological variation; principal component analysis; plant taxonomy	POPULATIONS; POACEAE	Three hundred and sixteen accessions belonging to four species of the genus Lolium were analysed for morphological differentiation following field trials. Principal component analysis (PCA) was shown to explain over 74% of the variation with the date of ear emergence, spike height and flag leaf length and width being responsible for the major differentiation. L. perenne separated into two groups following PCA, cluster analysis and k-means clustering, as a result of floral initiation in the sowing year. Those accessions that did not attain floral initiation until the second year were found to be from northern Europe. The inbreeder L. temulentum was separated from the three outbreeding species, L. perenne, L. multiflorum and L. rigidum, which are themselves distinct from each other although there is some introgression between them, especially between L. multiflorum and L. rigidum. The results are discussed in relation to selection of a core collection of Lolium accessions.

J	Osman, H; Blostein, SD				Osman, H; Blostein, SD			Probabilistic winner-take-all segmentation of images with application to ship detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; cluster analysis; image segmentation; SAR imagery; target detection	SAR IMAGES; WAKE DETECTION; MODEL; ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	A recent neural clustering scheme called "probabilistic winner-take-all (PWTA)" is applied to image segmentation, It is demonstrated that PWTA avoids underutilization of clusters by adapting the form of the cluster-conditional probability density function as clustering proceeds. A modification to PWTA is introduced so as to explicitly utilize the spatial continuity of image regions and thus improve the PWTA segmentation performance. The effectiveness of PWTA is then demonstrated through the segmentation of airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of ocean surfaces so as to detect ship signatures, where an approach is proposed to find a suitable value for the number of clusters required for this application. Results show that PWTA gives high segmentation quality and significantly outperforms four other segmentation techniques, namely, 1) K-means, 2) maximum likelihood (ML), 3) backpropagation network (BPN), and 4) histogram thresholding.

J	Ng, MK				Ng, MK			K-means-type algorithms on distributed memory computer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH SPEED COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; clustering; k-means-type algorithm; parallel algorithms	PARALLEL ALGORITHMS; CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS; VALIDITY	Partitioning a set of objects into homogeneous clusters is a fundamental operation in data mining. The k-means-type algorithm is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large numerical and categorical data sets. An efficient parallel k-means-type algorithm for clustering data sets on a distributed share-nothing parallel system is considered. It has a simple communication scheme which performs only one round of information exchange in every iteration. We show that the speedup of our algorithm is asymptotically linear when the number of objects is sufficiently large. We implement the parallel k-means-type algorithm on an IBM SP2 parallel machine. The performance studies show that the algorithm has nice parallelism in experiments.

A K-mean cluster analysis identified seven subgroups of patients, representing four clinical distinct, meaningful patterns of change: early improvement, late improvement, relapsing after discharge, and a severe chronic course. Main findings: the subgroups had unique correlates among socio-demographic, diagnostic, and treatment-related characteristics. One of the relapsing groups had a high rate of Cluster C personality disorders, whereas the other had low participation in the anxiety programme. The group with severe chronic course showed occupational maladjustment and high number of both Axis I and II disorders. Implications: anxiety patients should participate in anxiety-treatment programmes, Cluster C patients should be followed and monitored For relapse, and severe chronic patients should be offered specialised treatment for their co-existing substance abuse and/or eating disorders.

The methodology developed includes image classification by fuzzy k-means clustering and fusion of memberships by fuzzy set theoretic operators. The two date images have been geometrically coregistered and classified for the identification of land classes individually. The fuzzy memberships of the classified output images have been integrated by using fuzzy logic operators like algebraic sum and gamma (gamma) operator. The classification accuracy of the resultant land classes in the integrated images was verified with the ground data collected in situ. The resultant images have been evaluated by kappa (kappa) statistic and it was found that output from the image of fuzzy algebraic sum operator scored high in generating the land classes, with an overall accuracy of 95%.

J	Levia, DF; Page, DR				Levia, DF; Page, DR			The use of cluster analysis in distinguishing farmland prone to residential development: A case study of Sterling, Massachusetts	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						farmland conversion; residential development; cluster analysis; land degradation	LAND VALUES; CONVERSION; GROWTH; PRICES	Residential development of farmland is one of the primary driving forces of land degradation in both rural and urban fringe areas throughout the world. The loss of prime agricultural land is of great concern to planning offices and organizations seeking to preserve open space. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of cluster analysis as a possible tool for the identification of farms prone to residential development. Eighty-four farms in Sterling, Massachusetts, were separated into two groups by k-means nonhierarchical cluster analysis using farm size, slope, and distance to the nearest city center and highway as surrogates of farmland conversion. Discriminant analysis showed that the two groups derived from the cluster analysis were 98.8% accurate (P < 0.0000). Results from the statistical analysis may serve as a starting point for the identification of individual farms prone to residential development. To explain the driving forces of farmland conversion to residential uses, interviews should be conducted with farmers, landowners, and land buyers. The use of multivariate statistical techniques to identify farms in jeopardy of residential development, in conjunction with qualitative assessments that explain the probability of development of individual farms, may prove a useful strategy to understand and predict farmland conversion.

J	Su, MC; Chang, HT				Su, MC; Chang, HT			Fast self-organizing feature map algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						neural networks; self-organizing feature map; unsupervised learning	NEURAL NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION	We present an efficient approach to forming feature maps. The method involves three stages. In the first stage, we use the K-means algorithm to select N-2 (i.e., the size of the feature map to be formed) cluster centers from a data set, Then a heuristic assignment strategy is employed to organize the N-2 selected data points into an N x N neural array so as to form an initial feature map. If the initial map is not good enough, then it will be fine-tuned by the traditional Kohonen self-organizing feature map (SOM) algorithm under a fast cooling regime in the third stage. By our three-stage method, a topologically ordered feature map would be formed very quickly instead of requiring a huge amount of iterations to fine-tune the weights toward the density distribution of the data points, which usually happened in the conventional SOM algorithm, Three data sets are utilized to illustrate the proposed method.

J	Adachi, K				Adachi, K			Nonmetric multidimensional scaling with clustering of subjects	JAPANESE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						multidimensional scaling; clustering; three-way data; stimulus similarity; non-metric multidimensional scaling		A new nonmetric multidimensional scaling method is devised to analyze three-way data concerning inter-stimulus similarities obtained from many subjects. It is assumed that subjects are classified into a small number of clusters and that the stimulus configuration is specific to each cluster. Under this assumption, the classification of subjects and the scaling used to derive the configurations for clusters are simultaneously performed using an alternating least-squares algorithm. The monotone regression of ordinal similarity data, the scaling of stimuli and the K-means clustering of subjects are iterated in the algorithm. The method is assessed using a simulation and its practical use is illustrated with the analysis of real data. Finally, some extensions are considered.

For the clustering problem, a heuristic algorithm is exploited by combining the tabu search heuristic with two complementary functional procedures, called packing and releasing procedures. The algorithm is numerically tested for its effectiveness in comparison with reference works including the tabu search algorithm, the K-means algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm.

Leptin administration to lean and ob/ob mice activates a novel metabolic program that depletes adipose tissue. Although this response is physiologically distinct from that evident after food restriction, the molecular nature of these differences is as yet unknown. Expression monitoring of 6500 genes using oligonucleotide microarrays in wild-type, ob/ob, and transgenic mice expressing low levels of leptin revealed that differences in ambient leptin levels have dramatic effects on the phenotype of white adipose tissue. These data identified a large number of genes that are differentially expressed in ob/ob mice. To delineate the components of the transcriptional program specifically affected by leptin, the level of the same 6500 genes was monitored in wild-type and ob/ob mice at various times after leptin treatment or food restriction. A novel application of k-means clustering identified 8 clusters of adipose tissue genes whose expression was different between leptin treatment and food restriction in ob/ob mice and 10 such clusters in wild-type experiments. One of the clusters was repressed specifically by leptin in both wild-type and ob/ob mice and included several genes known to be regulated by SREBP-1/ADD1. further studies confirmed that leptin decreases the levels of SREBP-1/ADD1 RNA and transcriptionally active SREBP-1/ADD1 protein in white adipose tissue. Future studies of the molecular basis for the apparent coordinate regulation of the other clusters of leptin-regulated genes may reveal additional mechanisms by which leptin exerts its weight-reducing effects.

J	Viovy, N				Viovy, N			Automatic Classification of Time Series (ACTS): a new clustering method for remote sensing time series	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SATELLITE DATA; GLOBAL VEGETATION; INDEX; PHENOLOGY; IMAGES; SCALE	Automatic classification methods have often been used as a first step for land cover mapping. The principle of such methods is to determine clusters of pixels with similar radiometric temporal behaviour based on their statistical properties. This allows a segmentation of the image into regions with similar radiometric properties. Most automatic classification of remote sensing data are based on the K-mean or dynamical clustering method. The latter method has two limitations. (i) It is necessary to fix the number of clusters, but this parameter is, in general, unknown. (ii) It is very slow and does not work correctly when the dimension of the problem and the number of samples become large which is typically the case for classification of remote sensing data at large scale. To avoid these limitations we have developed a new method called ACTS (Automatic Classification of Time Series), which is based on both hierarchical and dynamical clustering principles. First of all, the method is really 'automatic' since it determines, automatically, the number of clusters. Secondly, the method is very fast and does not show a degradation of the results with large dimensions or data sets. Application to synthetic data sets shows that in most cases ACTS is able to retrieve all the clusters of the image independently of the dimensions of the problem. Comparison of classifications based on actual global 8 km NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) composites using both ACTS and a K-mean method show very similar results but the convergence for ACTS is 20 times faster than the K-mean method using '10-day' composites. The ability of ACTS to work with problems of large dimensions enables clustering of multi-year time series of NDVI. ACTS is here applied to the clustering of a 12-year time series of 10-day composites (1982-1993). The results show that the seasonal signal is dominant. The clusters are mainly representative of seasonal land cover regions. Moreover, the regions are more clearly delineated in comparison with the classification based on only one year of data. Such improved clustering can help avoid some confusion between biomes. Finally, ACTS is applied to 'deseasonalized' time series to investigate the interannual variability of the NDVI. The areas of higher variability are located in the tropical regions with a strong influence of Fl Nine events. A small positive trend in NDVI is visible in high latitudes. However, several problems linked to the quality of the data are clearly visible. For instance, the decrease of NDVI following the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and the drift in calibration with the change from NOAA 9 to NOAA 11 in 1988 are visible in most of the regions. This unfortunately limits the possible interpretation of the signal and emphasizes the need to improve the preprocessing of AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data for interannual variability applications.

J	Perkowitz, M; Etzioni, O				Perkowitz, M; Etzioni, O			Towards adaptive Web sites: Conceptual framework and case study	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						adaptive Web sites; conceptual clustering; data mining		Today's Web sites are intricate but not intelligent; while Web navigation is dynamic and idiosyncratic, all too often Web sites are fossils cast in HTML. In response, this paper investigates adaptive Web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by learning from visitor access patterns. Adaptive Web sites mine the data buried in Web server logs to produce more easily navigable Web sites. To demonstrate the feasibility of adaptive Web sites, the paper considers the problem of index page synthesis and sketches a solution that relies on novel clustering and conceptual clustering techniques. Our preliminary experiments show that high-quality candidate index pages can be generated automatically, and that our techniques outperform existing methods (including the Apriori algorithm, K-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and COBWEB) in this domain.

Variables explaining a significant proportion of simulated yield Variance are crop water (sum of precipitation and irrigation) and temperature during the growing season. A multiple linear regression model is developed to represent simulated yield response to these variables. Seven agro-climatic regions are defined based on K-mean cluster analysis of temperature and precipitation data from 329 meteorological stations and provincial crop yield data. The yield functions derived from the validated crop model were then used with the gridded agro-climatic database to conduct a spatial analysis of climate change impacts on national wheat production. Climate change scenarios with and without sulfate aerosols developed from the Hadley Centre (HCGG and HCGS) and Canadian Climate Centre (CCGG and CCGC) are tested.

In this paper, we explore the use of determinant (volume) criteria for clustering. We derive an algorithm called the minimum scatter volume (MSV) algorithm, that minimizes the scatter volume, and another algorithm called the minimum cluster volume (MCV) that minimizes the sum of the volumes of the individual clusters. The behavior of MSV is shown to be similar to thai of K-means, whereas MCV is more versatile.

J	Acton, ST; Mukherjee, DP				Acton, ST; Mukherjee, DP			Scale space classification using area morphology	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						image classification; nonlinear filters; scale space	MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY; ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; WATERSHEDS; ALGORITHM	We explore the application of area morphology to image classification. From the input image, a scale space is created by successive application of an area morphology operator. The pixels within the scale space corresponding to the same image location form a scale space vector. A scale space vector therefore contains the intensity of a particular pixel for a given set of scales, determined in this approach by image granulometry. Using the standard k-means algorithm or the fuzzy c-means algorithm, the image pixels can be classified by clustering the associated scale space vectors. The scale space classifier presented here is rooted in the novel area open-close and area close-open scale spaces. Unlike other scale generating filters, the area operators affect the image by removing connected components within the image level sets that do not satisfy the minimum area criterion. To show that the area open-close and area close-open scale spaces provide an effective multiscale structure for image classification, we demonstrate the fidelity, causality, and edge localization properties for the scale spaces, The analysis also re reveals that the area open-close and area close-open scale spaces improve classification by clustering members of similar objects more effectively than the fixed scale classifier. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate the reduction in intraregion classification error and in overall classification error given by the scale space classifier for classification applications where object scale is important, In both visual and objective comparisons, the scale space approach outperforms the traditional fixed scale clustering algorithms and the parametric Bayesian classifier for classification tasks that depend on object scale.

J	Escribano, R; Hidalgo, P				Escribano, R; Hidalgo, P			Spatial distribution of copepods in the north of the Humboldt Current region off Chile during coastal upwelling	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM			English	Article							DEL-SUR BAY; CALANUS-CHILENSIS; DYNAMICS; WATERS; ANTOFAGASTA; ZONE	During the austral spring (December 1996), numerical abundance of copepod species (Crustacea: Copepoda) was estimated from 53 sampling stations scattered over the coastal waters off Mejillones Peninsula, northern Chile. Samples were obtained from two depth strata; 0-50 m and 50-200 m depth. Oceanographic data over the three-day cruise indicated that coastal upwelling was actively occurring during the survey. A total of 19 species was identified, of which four of them, Paracalanus parvus, Oncaea conifera, Oithona similis and Calanus chilensis, accounted for more than 80% of the whole copepod assemblage in terms of numerical abundance. Using the K-means exploratory analysis the 53 locations were grouped into two clusters: an upwelling type and a non-upwelling type. The former characterized by locations nearshore, with low temperature (<17 degrees C) and high chlorophyll-a (>13.4 mg m(-3)), while the latter had warmer waters (>18 degrees C) and low chlorophyll-a (<4.8 mg m(-3)). Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), distance to shoreline and temperature at 10 m depth (T10) were all significant variables (P<0.05) for clustering analysis. There was a strong negative correlation between T10 and chl-a (P<0.01). The same clustering technique, based on species abundance, suggested the presence of a unique cluster, whose composition was dominated by P. parvus, O. similis, Acartia tonsa and Centropages brachiatus. Stepwise multiple regression showed that these species were also strongly correlated to chi-a and T10. Altogether these analyses suggest that water mass circulation during upwelling is the driving force for structuring spatial patterns of copepod distribution. In addition, a vertical distribution parameter suggested that copepods, independently of time of the day, tended to remain in a large proportion in near surface waters. possibly constrained by a shallow oxygen minimum layer. This implies that advection during active upwelling may cause large fractions of populations being transported offshore, allowing zooplankton export to more oceanic waters. Rapid turnover rates of copepods growing continuously year-round, may act as a mechanism to compensate population losses during persistent coastal upwelling.

Its main idea is to incorporate a signal bias-compensation operation and a PMC noise-compensation operation into its iterative training process. This makes the resulting speech HMM models more suitable to the given robust speech recognition method using the same signal bias-compensation and PMC noise-compensation operations in the recognition process. Experimental results showed that the speech HMM models it generated outperformed both the clean-speech HMM models and those generated by the conventional k-means algorithm for two adverse Mandarin speech recognition tasks. So it is a promising robust training algorithm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

K-means analysis indicated that a two-cluster solution was optimal with Type Bs (28%) exhibiting greater premorbid risk factors, alcohol and psychosocial severity, drinking consequences, psychopathology, higher stage of change, and less coping confidence in comparison to less severe Type As (72%). After baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three 10-week group treatments (DWI Education, Coping Skills, Interactional), and reassessed at termination, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Type B was associated with more severe symptoms after treatment, but there was no evidence for patient-treatment matching effects. Although Type A/B may be an important theoretical model for guiding alcoholism research, it usefulness and efficiency for treatment matching, planning, or placement purposes is questioned.

This questionnaire was completed by three separate samples; 1284 mainly first-year students from six British universities, 466 first-year students from a Scottish technological university; and 219 students from a 'historically disadvantaged' South African university. Analyses of these data were designed to explore the patterns of response found in sub-groups which varied in terms of their levels of attainment and contexts. Maximum likelihood analysis of the largest sample confirmed the expected three factors of deep, surface apathetic, and strategic approaches to studying, and almost identical patterns were also found in the other two samples, and in students having contrasting levels of attainment. There were, however, some interesting minor differences in the South African sample. K-means relocation cluster analysis was then carried our on the largest sample and produced clusters with generally coherent patterns of response. However, one persistent low attainment cluster showed unexpected, dissonant patterns of response, combining moderately high scores on the sub-scales of both deep and surface apathetic approaches, associated with low scores on the strategic approach.

J	Park, IK; Yun, ID; Lee, SU				Park, IK; Yun, ID; Lee, SU			Automatic 3-D model synthesis from measured range data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hierarchical decomposition; K-means clustering; NURBS; range data; 3-D surface model	SURFACE	In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct 3-D surface model from a set of range data, based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) surface-fitting technique. It is assumed that the range data is initially unorganized and scattered 3-D points, while their connectivity is also unknown. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: initial model approximation employing K-means clustering, hierarchical decomposition of the initial model, and construction of NURBS surface patch network. The initial model is approximated by both polyhedral and triangular model. Then, the initial model is represented by a hierarchical graph, which is efficiently used to construct the G(1) continuous NURBS patch network of the whole object, Experiments are carried out on synthetic and real range data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the initial model as well as the NURBS patch network are constructed automatically with tolerable computation. The modeling error of the NURBS model is reduced to 10%, compared with the initial mesh model.

J	Park, DC				Park, DC			Centroid neural network for unsupervised competitive learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						centroid; forgetting; learning gain; neural network; unsupervised learning	IMAGE COMPRESSION; MAP	An unsupervised competitive learning algorithm based on the classical k-means clustering algorithm is proposed, The proposed learning algorithm called the centroid neural network (CNN) estimates centroids of the related cluster groups in training date. This paper also explains algorithmic relationships among the CNN and some of the conventional unsupervised competitive learning algorithms including Kohoneo's self-organizing map (SOM) and Kosko's differential competitive learning (DCL) algorithm. The CNN algorithm requires neither a predetermined schedule for learning coefficient nor a total number of iterations for clustering, The simulation results on clustering problems and image compression problems show that CNN converges much faster than conventional algorithms with compatible clustering quality while other algorithms mag give unstable results depending on the initial values of the learning coefficient and the total number of iterations.

The 1995-1998 Delta Project was designed to increase breast cancer screening among disadvantaged African American women with limited literacy skills by educating their health care professionals about breast health. The research team intended to provide onsite training and appropriate educational materials; however, they found no suitable materials. This article presents the results of an assessment of available materials and defines the need for suitable materials. Methods. Nineteen organizations that develop cancer-related publications submitted materials intended for African American audiences. Sixty-one documents were examined for readability and cultural sensitivity. The Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), Flesch-Kincaid (F-K), and Cultural Sensitivity Assessment Tools (CSAT) were used in testing. Results. The mean FRE score of 65 yielded a F-K mean grade level of 7.5 (desired level: 3.5). Using CSAT, 16 documents (26%) were eliminated because they had no visuals. Twenty-two publications (37%) were culturally sensitive for all audiences and 19 (31%) were for white audiences. Four (6%) pieces specifically addressed African American women. Conclusions. Printed educational materials on breast cancer do not adequately provide information to undereducated, economically disadvantaged African American women.

The technique is particularly effective when spikes overlap temporally. It is capable of identifying the exact number of neurons contributing to a recording and of creating reliable spike templates. The procedure is based on fuzzy clustering and its performance is controlled by minimizing a cluster-validity index which optimizes the compactness and separation of the identified clusters. Application examples with synthetic spike trains generated from real spikes and segments of background noise show the advantage of the fuzzy method over conventional template-creation approaches in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

With the assumption of increased processing capability of a node in the connectionist network, we show how a broader class of problems can be solved. As the proposed approach is a stochastic search technique, it avoids getting stuck in local optima. Robustness of the approach is demonstrated on several multi-modal functions with different numbers of variables, Optimization of a well-known partitional clustering criterion, the squared-error criterion (SEC), is formulated as a function optimization problem and is solved using the proposed approach, This approach is used to cluster selected data sets and the results obtained are compared with that of the K-means algorithm and a simulated annealing (SA) approach. The amenability of the connectionist approach to parallelization enables effective use of parallel hardware.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a significant role in the development of hypertensive cardiac and vascular remodeling. Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT(1) A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH). Methods. Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI greater than or equal to 125 g/m(2)), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification). Results. The prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0.0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r(2) = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis. Two subgroups of patients were identified (cluster 1, N = 70; cluster 2, N = 57), and each differed significantly with regards to the presence and degree of TOD and patterns of RAAS gene polymorphisms (F, 15.97 for ACR; F, 7.19 for IMT; F, 217.03 for LVMI; F, 3.91 for ACE; F, 4.06 for AGT; and F, 5.22 for AT(1); df 1 to 214, P < 0.02, for each one of the variables examined). Conclusion. The D allele of the ACE gene may be an independent risk factor for the development of target organ damage, and evaluating it could be useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in EH. Unfavorable patterns of RAAS genotypes seem to predispose patients to subclinical cardiovascular disease in EH.

Its position is better described by a fractionally occupied four-fold split site, but the rms displacement remains the largest of all of the atoms in the structure. Difference Fourier maps of this Sr site show a residual nuclear density with lobes in the directions of the split-atom positions. The Ga and Ge atoms appear to be fully disordered on the three distinct framework sites. The measured atomic displacement parameters are used to derive estimates of the following thermodynamic related quantities: Debye temperature, 271 K; mean velocity of sound, 2600 m/s; temperature of the Einstein "rattler", 85 K; mean free path of heat-carrying phonons, 5.36 Angstrom; and lattice thermal conductivity, 0.008 W/cm-K.

It consists of two subsystems: cluster detection and cluster fusion. The cluster detection is performed by a competitive neural network or the k-means algorithm, followed by an algorithm which obtains connected clusters. The cluster fusion involves a procedure that is based on the theory of equivalence relations. Proofs are given for the significant properties that we have found. It is not necessary to specify the number of regions in advance, which is a significant improvement over the standard competitive-style strategies.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used as representations for the cluster centers, and rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL), originally developed for domains with static, fixed-dimensional features, is extended. State merging operations are also incorporated to favor the discovery of smaller HMMs. Simulation results show that our extended version of RPCL can produce a more accurate cluster structure than k-means clustering.

Previous research [3] proposes a scheme for extracting recurrent patterns from noise free signal without temporal warping. To handle noise and non-linear temporal warping, Threshold Finite State Machine (TFSM) is proposed to perform spatial-temporal data modeling. The TFSM is first roughly initialized. A variance of Segmental K-means is used to train the TFSM. The training results give us both the patterns embedding in the signal sequence and the trained TFSM that can be used to represent and detect the patterns.

It's based on K-means algorithm in HSI space and has the advantage over those based on the RGB space. Both the hue and the intensity components are fully utilized. In the process of hue clustering, the special cyclic property of the hue component is taken into consideration. The paper gives the definition of the distance and the center in the hue space, based on which the hue-clustering algorithm is implemented.

In this approach, each voxel was described in terms of shape index derived from curvatures on the voxel. The voxels inside the nodule were aggregated via shape histogram to quantify how much shape category was present in the nodule. Topological features were introduced to characterize the morphology of the cluster constructed from a set of voxels with the same shape category. In the classification step, a hybrid unsupervised/supervised structure was performed to improve the classifier performance. It combined the k-means clustering procedure and the linear discriminate classifier: Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid classifier bused on the topological and histogram features to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

The sampled discrete time series is first mapped onto a phase space by the method of delays. The vector series in phase space is partitioned into a finite number of clusters by the k-means technique. The determinant of the within class scatter matrix provides an estimate of the hyper-ellipsoidal volume of the partitioned phase space. The objective is to observe for significant difference in the hyper-ellipsoidal scatter volume between the original data and its corresponding surrogate realizations. The surrogate data sets were generated by the iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform technique (IAAFT). The null hypothesis addressed here is that the original data is a static nonlinear transform of a linearly correlated noise. The data sets analyzed include the uterine electromyography obtained during active labor.

Most conventional shot change detection algorithms use only one kind of frame-by-frame difference feature such as pixel difference or histogram difference. So they can be applied to only specific situations. And another problem is the determination of appropriate threshold value to check the existence of shot changes. To overcome these problems we use several kinds of features simultaneously and propose a modified k-means clustering algorithm which changes initial cluster center adaptively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works well.

By first processing a color image via the proposed color sigma filter, pixels within the same semantic region become more concentrated around their centroid in the perceptual color coordinate system. A k-mean algorithm is then designed to automatically differentiate the image into non-overlapping semantic objects.

Our algorithm formulates a design methodology for this set of packetized streams such that it best covers, in a global expected distortion sense, a collection of possible packet erasure channels with respect to a probability distribution over the collection The resulting set of streams is suitable for Internet multicast to a collection of receivers with various packet loss characteristics. The algorithm is essentially a K-means algorithm, and in one simulation, reduces the expected distortion by over 4 dB with only 4 streams.

By first processing a color image via the proposed color sigma filter, pixels within the same semantic region become more concentrated around their centroid in the perceptual color coordinate system. A k-mean algorithm is then designed to automatically distinguish the image into non-overlapping semantic regions, of which centroids with similar color features are merged automatically. Because of the periodicity in the hue component, we apply two manifolds to completely cover the hue vector, and fuse distinguished regions from both manifolds to obtain the final image segmentation. The computational complexity of our algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of pixels, and no priori information is assumed. We download sample images from the internet randomly and apply the proposed algorithm to illustrate the performance of our procedure.

In this approach, each voxel was described in terms of shape index derived from curvatures on the voxel. The voxels inside the nodule were aggregated via shape histogram to quantify, how much shape category was present in the nodule. Topological features were introduced to characterize the morphology of the cluster constructed fi om a set, of voxels with the same shape category. In the classification step, a hybrid unsupervised/supervised structure was performed to improve the classifier performance. It combined the k-means clustering procedure and the linear discriminate classifier. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to evaluate the :accuracy of the classifiers. Our results demonstrate the-feasibility of the hybrid classifier based on the topological and histogram features to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

In this work we employ a Gabor filter bank for texture analysis of mammograms to detect microcalcifications. A subset of the Gabor filter bank with a certain central frequency and different orientations is used to obtain the Gabor-filtered images. The filtered images are then subjected to a histogram based threshold to obtain binary images. Feature vectors are computed using the binary images. A k-means clustering algorithm with a variance scaled Euclidean distance is used for segmentation of the image.

In this paper, a novel approach to clustering is proposed for performing unsupervised image segmentation based upon a,generalization of the standard K-means clustering algorithm. By incorporating a new term into the objective function of the K-means algorithm, boundaries between regions in the resulting segmentation are forced to occur at the same locations as edges in the observed image. A straightforward iterative algorithm is derived for minimizing this edge-adaptive K-means objective function. The result is an efficient segmentation algorithm that reconstructs boundaries in the image more accurately than standard methods.

Our approach employs a parameter estimation method based on the k-means algorithm with the number of clusters determined by a cluster separation measure. The proposed algorithm and its simplified approximation are applied to JPEG2000 compressed images to demonstrate their effectiveness.

For robust determination of correspondences of a stereo pair, we make use of census transform, a kind of non-parametric local transform. Census transform summarizes focal image structure as a bit string, and gives very goad stereo-matching results without such processes as image pyramids, bi-directional search, complicated matching evaluation, and too much edge detection dependent interpolation. To interpolate unknown disparities, we introduced a process influenced by the K-means algorithm And then use of 3-channel images and overlapping of the maps give multiple disparity values for one pixel, which enables screening of very confident values. We have obtained very good results on such complex scenes as contain branches and leaves of trees.

Requirements of any such system include speed and minimal end-user effort. Athena satisfies these requirements through linear-time classification and clustering engines which axe applied interactively to speed the development of accurate models. Naive Bayes classifiers are recognized to be among the best for classifying text. We show that our specialization of the Naive Bayes classifier is considerably more accurate (7 to 29% absolute increase in accuracy) than a standard implementation. Our enhancements include using Lidstone's law of succession instead of Laplace's law, under-weighting long documents, and over-weighting author and subject. We also present a new interactive clustering algorithm, C-Evolve, for topic discovery. C-Evolve first finds highly accurate cluster digests (partial clusters), gets user feedback to merge and correct these digests, and then uses the classification algorithm to complete the partitioning of the data. By allowing this interactivity in the clustering process, C-Evolve achieves considerably higher clustering accuracy (10 to 20% absolute increase in our experiments) than the popular K-Means and agglomerative clustering methods.

It consists of a variant of the popular k-means algorithm in which cluster medians (most centered cluster points) are used instead of the conventional cluster means. Two main aspects of the k-medians algorithm deserve special attention: computing efficiency and initialization. Efficiency issues have been studied in previous works. Here we focus on initialization. Four techniques are studied: Random selection, Supervised selection, the Greedy-Interchange algorithm and the Maxmin algorithm. The capabilities of these techniques are assessed through experiments in two typical applications of Clustering; namely, Exploratory Data Analysis and Unsupervised Prototype Selection. Results clearly show the importance of a good initialization of the k-medians algorithm in all the cases. Random initialization too often leads to bad final partitions, while best results are generally obtained using Supervised selection. The Greedy-Interchange and the Maxmin algorithms generally lead to partitions of high quality, without the manual effort of Supervised selection.

This paper proposes an algorithm for the segmentation of the moving object with accurate boundary using color and motion focusing on the HVS perception in the general image sequence. The proposed algorithm is composed of three parts: color segmentation, motion analysis, and region refinement and merging part. In the color segmentation phase, K-Means algorithm is used in consideration of the sensitivity of the human color perception to get the boundaries that HVS perceives. The global and local motion estimation are performed in parallel with color analysis. After that, Bayesian clustering using color and motion provides more accurate boundary. In the final stage, regions are merged taking into account their motion. The experimental results of the proposed algorithm show the accurate moving object boundary coinciding with the boundary that HVS perceives.

These children had been referred to a children's mental health centre for neuropsychological assessment. In study 1, K-means cluster analysis (k = 12) was applied to the PIC clinical scales in an attempt to replicate the 12 clusters identified by Gdowski, Lachar, and Kline (1985). Partial cluster replication was achieved. Examination of the obtained clusters revealed significant overlap, suggesting that fewer clusters would represent an optimal solution. In study 2, a two-stage cluster analysis yielded a seven-cluster solution consistent with several key forms of psychopathology previously reported in the literature using specific neuropsychological populations. Identified subtypes included profiles characterized as: normal, cognitive deficit, cognitive deficit with internalized psychopathology, cognitive deficit with social impairment, cognitive deficit with hyperactivity, cognitive deficit with both internalized and externalized psychopathology, and combined internalized and externalized psychopathology without a cognitive deficit component.

This paper generalizes the classical approach where each class is represented by a typical point in R(p) (class center) to the case where (a) the data u(1) = (x(1),y(1)), (x(2),y(2)),... is an element of R(p+q) are partitioned into an explanatory part x(k) is an element of R(p) and a response part y(k) is an element of R(q) and (b) each class is represented by a regression hyperplane. The class-specific linear regression functions can be combined to a global one, and classes with similar response functions are visualized as neighbours in the map. In analogy to classical cluster analysis, we define an optimum regression-type SOM by a (discrete or continuous) generalized clustering criterion (K-criterion) and propose SOM algorithms derived from k-means, MacQueen's sequential approach, or from stochastic approximation. The resulting SOMs can be applied, e.g., in segmented credit scoring or for response surface approximation.

In order to overcome these local minima we propose to use the Metropolis rule for acceptance of possible transfers and a simulated annealing-type algorithm for two-mode nonoverlapping partitioning. We show the performance of the algorithm by some examples, the results obtained are encouraging. We also prove the monotonicity of the method of Baler et al. (1997) for two-mode partitioning based in a k-means scheme.

To determine the effectiveness of unsupervised clustering (training) algorithms, the J-M distance has been widely used for evaluation. The J-M distance, also called the Bhattacharrya distance, is a measure of statistical separability of pairs of classes and defined as the average difference between the two-class density functions. A separability measure can be performed on the training data to estimate the expected error in the classification for various feature combinations. There are other methods of merit measure based on determining the separability between two classes at a time such as the transformed divergence, Mahalanobis distance, normalized city block, and Euclidean distance. In this study, we evaluate and compare the performance of different unsupervised training algorithms such as the K-means, the simple competitive learning,..., etc using the J-M distance, the transformed divergence, Mahalanobis distance, normalized city block, and Euclidean distance.

Korean has the complex structure and composition rules which makes it difficult to distinguish character-components from background or noise, using only color and size information. For this, we propose to use of shape information as well as color and size information. To represent the shape information, cluster-based templates are obtained from target characters using K-means clustering algorithm. The proposed method consists of three components: image segmentation, noise filtering, and text region detection. After segmenting an image into connected components with uniform color and size, the non-character components are removed by some heuristics. Then, to accurately discriminate character-components from noise, the segmented results are filtered by matching with cluster-based templates, as well as color and size information. And then text region is located from the profile analysis of the character-components. To assess the validity of the proposed method, the experiments are performed with a variety of images such as videos, web images, scanned images.

In the first step, two ellipses corresponding to the head and the body of the person in each identified based on ellipse fitting of the outline of the person in each image. The fitting is based on a fast direct least squares method using the constraint that forces a general conic to be an Ellipse. In order to achieve head/body segmentation, a K-means algorithm is used to minimise the fitting error between the points and the two ellipsoids. In the second step, a 3-D ellipsoid model corresponding to the head of the person is identified using an extension of the above method. Robustness and outlier removal can be achieved if 3-D ellipsoid model estimation technique is used in conjunction with the Median of Least Squares (MedLS) technique, which minimises the median of the errors corresponding to each 3-D point. An interesting application of the proposed method is the combination of the 3-D ellipsoid model with a generic face model which is adapted to the face images to provide information only for the high-detail front part of the head, while the 3-D ellipsoid is used for the back of the head, which is usually not visible.

We employ a large number K of initial prototypes to cluster the feature vectors into many small clusters via the standard k-means algorithm, iterate the process of computing new fuzzy prototypes and reassigning the feature vectors until the prototypes become fixed and then merge the K clusters into a smaller number K' of classes. We test the algorithm on both simple and difficult data sets, using a modified Xie-Bene validity measure.

The method uses categorization viewpoints as a priori knowledge, where a categorization viewpoint is a finite set of consistent category names. A set of documents retrieved by initial keywords is decomposed by categorization viewpoints and each decomposition is scored by clearness or entropy. The user selects an appropriate decomposition by considering the score. The decomposition is recursively performed until a category structure of reasonable size is obtained. Experimental results show that the sets of documents decomposed by the proposed method have higher precision than those decomposed by clustering (K-means). It is also shown that both the scores based on clearness and entropy of the decomposition have relatively high correlation with the precision.

A dominant component AM-FM analysis is performed on the image, and estimates of the locally dominant amplitude and frequency modulations are extracted at each pixel. Modulation domain density clustering is then applied to estimate the maximum number of textured regions that might be present in the image. The feature space is augmented with horizontal and vertical spatial information prior to the application of k-means clustering to arrive at an initial image segmentation. Connected components labeling with minor region removal and morphological smoothing are then applied to yield the final segmentation. We demonstrate the technique on several synthetic and natural images.

The most important problem in the equalization using RBF is the fast searching off the correct centers (channel states). The k-means clustering algorithm has been used to find the desired channel states. In this paper, the problem can be transformed into finding the representative centers suitable for channel states using the interrelation among the elements of the center set. The computer simulation results show its fast convergence speed and less training iteration than the equalization using the traditional k-means clustering algorithm.

The data used in the analysis are generated in a mixture modeling framework. The methods included are some hierarchical methods, k-means as implemented in the FAST-CLUS procedure of SAS and cluster analysis by means of normal mixtures with the NORMIX program. We demonstrate that the poor recovery found in some studies for normal mixture type of clustering is partly due to the use of bad initial values, and partly due to the specification of covariance structure within the cluster. We further find that an important factor in the relative success of FASTCLUS lies in the initial seed selection.

Boundaries of the regions are determined by hyperbolas and membership values are given by one or zero in each region. The area between crisp regions is a fuzzy region, where membership values are proportional to distances to crisp regions. Though the traditional hard k-means is a limit of the usual fuzzy k-means, results of the latter are fuzzy and then are not the same as results of the former. On the other hand a new method can produce the same results as those by the hard k-means. An algorithm for neural networks is given and a numerical example is illustrated.

Compared with the traditional K-means (or GLA, or LBG) algorithm, the MD algorithms achieve better clustering performance with far less computation time. However, the searching of the optimal partitioning hyperplane of a multidimensional cluster is a difficult problem in the MD algorithms. In this paper, a new partition technique based on tabu search (TS) approach is presented for the MD algorithms. Experimental results show that the tabu search based MD algorithm can produce a better clustering performance than the K-means and MD algorithms.

Segmentation of document images, which usually contain three types of texture information: text, picture and background, can be regarded as a special case of texture segmentation. B-spline wavelets possess some desirable properties such as being well localized in time and frequency, and being compactly supported, which make them a good approach to texture analysis. In this paper, cubic B-spline wavelets are applied to document images; thereafter, each texture is featured by several regional and statistical characteristics estimated at the outputs of high frequency bands of spline wavelet transforms. Then three-means classification is applied for classifying pixels which have similar features. We also examine and evaluate the contributions of different factors to the segmentation results from the viewpoints of decomposition levels, frequency bands and feature selection, respectively.

A number of correlations are identified between types of radiance relationships and tropical anticyclonic circulations, equatorial divergences, climatic frontal zones and other large-scale structure-forming phenomena on the ocean surface. The application of cluster analysis to the generalization, compression and assimilation of satellite data about ocean colour is shown to be promising.

The algorithms are based on the Baum-Welch algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm for Bidden Markov Models (HMMs). By making use of a training signal, the algorithms are applied block-wise to sequential disjoint subintervals of the whole observation interval. We study the effects of block length in terms of the bit error rate (BER), the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated channel impulse response, and its Cramer-Rao lower bound. Our simulation results show that the BER performance does not suffer even for a short block length when a good initial estimate is available.

The main assumption is that the structure of color category systems originates from the statistical structure of the perceived color environment. This environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enable to predict the location, order, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the predictions are consistent with Berlin and Kay(1) and Boynton and Oslon(2) data.

However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. Huang's (Huang 1998) K-Modes algorithm extended the K-Means algorithm to clustering categorical data set. The algorithm replaces the means of clusters with modes and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimize the clustering cost function. This paper presents an algorithm that can be applied to both the K-Means and K-Modes algorithms to set up and refine the starting conditions from a given data set. The refined starting conditions lead the algorithms to convergence to "better" local maxims.

The motivation for our work stems from the individual effectiveness of various data mining mechanisms ie: (1) class identification via unsupervised datavector cluster formation, (2) datavector simplification and feature selection via attribute discretisation, and (3) symbolic rule extraction via the association of symbolic rules with the structural parameters of a trained neural network (NN). The basic operational concept involves the pipelined application of various unsupervised and supervised mechanisms ie: (1) k-means, (2) Chi-2, (3) local cluster (LC) network training, and (4) rule extraction from a trained LC network. The featured methodology will be tested and analysed using several well-known datasets.

However, there are situations when the clustering output of the self-organising network does not render distinct clusters. In this paper, we present a technique to automate the data mining task of data clustering, i.e. to automate cluster identification/demarcation by drawing upon a synergy between the self-organising neural networks and statistical data clustering techniques. The implied hybrid of diverse data clustering techniques provides an improved strategy to (a) discover hidden similarities between data items; (b) group similar data items into distinct and well-defined clusters-i.e. with explicit boundaries between different clusters and defined cluster membership characteristics; and (c) visualise the emergent data clusters in a 2D and 3D manner. Our proposed solution is implemented in terms of a Data Clustering Workbench (DCW)-an all-encompassing (exploratory) data mining application.

Moreover, the physical models of chromosomes have been introduced in order to take into account the rotation of chromosomes in the flowcytometer. By this modification, the lengths of chromosomes and the intensity distribution of chromosome fluorescence can be estimated from chromosome profile data measured by the flowcytometer. But the clustering results did not converged identically in some experiments and the distribution of the rotation angles was unnatural. So, we introduced simulated annealing to improve the convergence of our SOM algorithm. We compared the clustering results of this method with those of K-means method and SOM method.

In this paper, we consider the problem of segmenting an image into multiple regions possibly undergoing different motions. To this end we use level sets of functions evolving according to certain partial differential equations. Contrary to numerous other motion segmentation algorithms based on level sets, we compute accurate motion boundaries without relying on intensity boundaries as an accessory. This will be illustrated on examples where intensity boundaries are hardly visible and yet motion boundaries are accurately identified. The main benefit of the level set representation is in its ability to handle variations in the topology of the level sets. As a result, it is only necessary to know the total number of distinct motion classes and their parameters. We describe an automatic initialization procedure that is based on feature point correspondences and K-means clustering in a 6-parameter space of affine parameters. We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real images with both real and synthetic motion.

One way to cope with this massive volume is to organize the data so that pixels with similar spectral content are clustered together in the same category. This provides both a compression of the data and a segmentation of the image that can be useful for other image processing tasks downstream. The classic approach for segmentation of multidimensional data is the k-means algorithm; this is an iterative method that produces successively better segmentations. It is a simple algorithm, but the computational expense can be considerable, particularly for clustering large hyperspectral images into many categories. The ASAPP (Accelerating Segmentation And Pixel Purity) project aims to relieve this processing bottleneck by putting the k-means algorithm into field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. The standard software implementation of k-means uses floating-point arithmetic and Euclidean distances. By fixing the precision of the computation and by employing alternative distance metrics (we consider the "Manhattan" and the "Max" metrics as well as a linear combination of the two), we can fit more distance-computation nodes on the chip, obtain a higher degree of fine-grain parallelism, and therefore faster performance, but at the price of slightly less optimal clusters. We investigate the effects of different distance metrics from both a theoretical (using random simulated data) and an empirical viewpoint (using 224-channel AVIRIS images and 10-channel multispectral images that are derived from the AVIRIS data to simulate MTI data).

For this purpose, we propose the novel procedure of K-Means with connectivity constraint algorithm as a general segmentation algorithm combining several types of information including color, motion and compactness. In this algorithm, the use of spatiotemporal regions is introduced since a number of frames is analyzed simultaneously and as a result the same region is present in consequent frames. Experimental results in real image sequences evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

J	Garver, DL; Holcomb, JA; Christensen, JD				Garver, DL; Holcomb, JA; Christensen, JD			Heterogeneity of response to antipsychotics from multiple disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEUROLEPTIC RESPONSE; PSYCHOSES; ENLARGEMENT; HYPOTHESIS; ONSET	Background: Antipsychotic response after the initiation of neuroleptic treatment shows wide variation in schizophrenic patient populations. In this overview, the authors suggest that the variance in antipsychotic drug response within schizophrenia can be reduced by resolving the schizophrenias into several discrete "endophenotypes," each with different etiologic underpinnings. Method: Studies relating differences in the relative speed or completeness of antipsychotic response to differences in distribution of 2 biological markers with possible etiologic significance are reviewed. Such studies had assessed recently hospitalized, neuroleptic-free patients undergoing exacerbation of nonaffective psychotic disorders. Prior to initiation of neuroleptic, the cohort of patients had been assessed fur the quantity of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in plasma (pHVA) and had undergone the first of 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies for analyses of ventricle volumes. A second MRI was subsequently performed during a period of (partial) remission to determine within-patient stability of ventricular volumes. These selected studies assessed the distribution of pHVA and distribution of rates of ventricular change, with non-normal distributions resolved by K-means clustering. The speed and completeness of neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic response were related to 3 clusters of patients delineated by modal distributions of pHVA and of apparent rates of ventricular change. Results: At least 3 unique "endophenotypes" of the "group of the schizophrenias" can be defined with respect to speed and completeness of antipsychotic response. Each endophenotype appears to show at least one unique biological feature that differentiates it from a normal comparison group. A rapidly responsive psychosis was associated with excessive production of dopamine, as identifiable by elevation of pHVA and a "good-prognosis" course. A delayed-response psychosis had low-to-normal pHVA, clinically demonstrated persistent negative symptoms, and was associated with an excessive rate of change in ventricle volume between exacerbations of psychosis and (partial) remissions. Finally, a nonresponsive psychosis could be characterized as having both low-to-normal pHVA and rate of change of ventricle volumes similar to that of controls. Additional studies revealed that each of the endophenotypes had high rates of the psychoses in family members. The good-prognosis course of the rapidly responsive group of studied patients was also found in their family members who had psychotic disorders. Similarly, the prominent negative symp toms of the delayed-response probands were reflected as a prominent trait in their family members also afflicted with psychosis. The endophenotypes tended to "breed true" in terms of prognosis and negative symptoms. Conclusion: Major differences in antipsychotic response patterns appear to be associated with patient and family characteristics that may be related to differences in the etiology and consequent pathophysiology of illness.

J	Eason, K; Richardson, S; Yu, LZ				Eason, K; Richardson, S; Yu, LZ			Patterns of use of electronic journals	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article								On the basis of a twenty-two month transaction log of SuperJournal and using K-Means cluster analysis, this paper classifies a spectrum of user behaviour with electronic journals into a typology of eight categories of user (or eight patterns of use): the searcher, the enthusiastic user, the focused regular user, the specialised occasional user, the restricted user, the lost user, the exploratory user and the tourist. It examines the background and experience with SuperJournal of each type of user to illuminate its formation. The examination shows that the contents (both coverage and relevance) and ease of use of a system as they were perceived by the user were the most significant factors affecting patterns of use. Users' perceptions of both factors were affected by a range of intervening factors such as discipline, status, habitual approach towards information management, availability of alternative electronic journal services, purpose of use, etc. As any service is likely to attract a great variety of users, so will it lead to differing patterns of use. This paper demonstrates the need for a service to meet the requirements of users with these varied patterns.

Often, however, addicts are considered members of a single, homogeneous group. These erroneous designations may indeed prevent the successful rehabilitation of substance abusers. In the present study, hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses are used to identify a typology of substance users from a sample of 1,580 St. Louis arrestees surveyed through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program. Five clusters are yielded in the present analysis. The analyses illustrate not only that drug-rising classifications differ between criminal and non-criminal populations, but that arrestee populations themselves vary interjurisdictionally. Given these findings, implications for local and regional drug treatment programs are assessed.

J	Bradley, PS; Mangasarian, OL				Bradley, PS; Mangasarian, OL			k-plane clustering	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						clustering; k-mean; linear regression		A finite new algorithm is proposed for clustering m given points in n-dimensional real space into k clusters by generating k planes that constitute a local solution to the nonconvex problem of minimizing the sum of squares of the 2-norm distances between each point and a nearest plane. The key to the algorithm lies in a formulation that generates a plane in n-dimensional space that minimizes the sum of the squares of the 2-norm distances to each of m(1) given points in the space. The plane is generated by an eigenvector corresponding to a smallest eigenvalue of an n x n simple matrix derived from the m(1) points. The algorithm was tested on the publicly available Wisconsin Breast Prognosis Cancer database to generate well separated patient survival curves. In contrast, the k-mean algorithm did not generate such well-separated survival curves.

In this paper, Resilient Backpropagation (RPROP) with a weight decay term is proposed to train RBF networks and used to differentiate surfaces of 3D object in range images and to classify eight different Machine Learning data set for classification purpose. We show the advantages of resilient backpropagation for the RBF network structure within this classification context. The network structure is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning layers. Experimental results show that radial basis function network trained with resilient backpropagation can be successfully applied to differentiate of surfaces of 3D object in range images as well as to the classification of Machine learning problems.

The proposed algorithm exploits the inherent data-parallelism in the k-means algorithm. We analytically show that the speedup and the scaleup of our algorithm approach the optimal as the number of data points increases. We implemented our algorithm on an IBM POWERparallel SP2 with a maximum of 16 nodes. On typical test data sets, we observe nearly linear relative speedups, for example, 15.62 on 16 nodes, and essentially linear scaleup in the size of the data set and in the number of clusters desired. For a 2 gigabyte test data set, our implementation drives the 16 node SP2 at more than 1.8 gigaflops.

J	Breunig, MM; Kriegel, HP; Sander, J				Breunig, Markus M.; Kriegel, Hans-Peter; Sander, Joerg			Fast Hierarchical Clustering Based on Compressed Data and OPTICS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								One way to scale up clustering algorithms is to squash the data by some intelligent compression technique and cluster only the compressed data records. Such compressed data records can e.g. be produced by the BIRCH algorithm. Typically they consist of the sufficient statistics of the form (N, X, X(2) ) where N is the number of points, X is the (vector-)sum, and X(2) is the square sum of the points. They can be used directly to speed up k-means type of clustering algorithms, but it is not obvious how to use them in a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm e.g. to the centers of compressed subclusters produces a very weak result. The reason is that hierarchical clustering algorithms are based on the distances between data points and that the interpretaion of the result relies heavily on a correct graphical representation of these distances. In this paper, we introduce a method by which the sufficient statistics (N, X, X(2) ) of subcluster can be utilized in the hierarchical clustering method OPTICS. We show how to generate appropriate distance information about compressed data points, and how to adapt the graphical representation of the clustering result. A performance evaluation using OPTICS in combination with BIRCH demonstrates that our approach is extremely efficient (speed-up factors up to 1700) and produces high quality results.

Increasing database sizes strain the scalability of many data mining algorithms. Data clustering is one of the fundamental techniques in data mining solutions. The many clustering algorithms developed face new challenges with growing data sets. Algorithms with quadratic or higher computational complexity, such as agglomerative algorithms, drop out quickly. More efficient algorithms, such as K-Means EM with linear cost per iteration, still need work to scale up to large data sets. This paper shows that many parameter estimation algorithms, including K-Means, K-Harmonic Means and EM, can be recast without approximation in terms of Sufficient Statistics, yielding an superior speed-up efficiency. Estimates using today's workstations and local area network technology suggest efficient speed-up to several hundred computers, leading to effective scale-up for clustering hundreds of gigabytes of data. Implementation of parallel clustering has been done in a parallel programming language, ZPL. Experimental results show above 90% utilization.

In this approach, each voxel was described in terms of shape index derived from curvatures on the voxel. The voxels inside the nodule were aggregated via shape histogram to quantify how much shape category was present in the nodule. Topological features were introduced to characterize the morphology of the cluster constructed from a set of voxels with the same shape category. The properties such as curvedness and CT density were also built into the representation. In the classification step, a hybrid unsupervised/supervised structure was performed to improve the classifier performance. It combined the k-means clustering procedure and the linear discriminate (LD) classifier. The performance of the hybrid classifier was compared to that of LD classifier alone. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers. We also compared the performance of the hybrid classifier with those of physicians. The classification performance reached the performance of physicians. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid classifier based on the topological and histogram features to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

Through an enhanced virtual environment with various visualization modes, this master model permits for the first time an accurate characterization and understanding of prostate cancer distribution patterns. The construction of the statistical volumetric model is characterized by mapping all of the individual models onto a generic prostate site model, in which a self-organizing scheme is used to decompose a group of contours representing multifold tumors into localized tumor elements. Next crucial step of creating the master model is the development of an accurate multi-object and non-rigid registration/warping scheme incorporating various Variations among these individual models in true 3-D. This is achieved with a multi-object based principle-axis alignment followed by an affine transform, and further fine-tuned by a thin-plate spline interpolation driven by the surface based deformable warping dynamics. Based on the accurately mapped tumor distribution, a standard finite normal mixture is used to model the cancer volumetric distribution statistics, whose parameters are estimated using bath the K-means and expectation-maximization algorithms under the information theoretic criteria. Given the desired number of tissue samplings, the prostate needle biopsy site selection is optimized through a probabilistic self-organizing map thus achieving a maximum likelihood of cancer detection. We describe the details of our theory and methodology, and report our pilot results and evaluation of the effectiveness of the algorithm in characterizing prostate cancer distributions and optimizing needle biopsy techniques.

In previous models, definition of the initial contour is left to the operator. In addition, previous models show poor convergence towards boundary concavities. The new method consists of the following steps. 1) An adaptive K-means clustering algorithm generates uniform regions with inaccurate boundaries for the tissues in the image. 2) Boundaries of the desired tissue are extracted from the regions generated in the Step 1. Certain points on the boundaries are considered as the vertices of the initial contour. 3) Since the results of Step 1 may not include detail boundary information in some regions, a correction algorithm using neighborhood information is applied. 4) Dynamic contour model of Lobregt and Viergever is applied, but in defining the external forces, a deflection in the radial direction is implemented in the manner defined by Prince and Xu. This uses the idea of solenoidal external forces to help track boundary concavities. By convergence of this step, through diminishing velocity and acceleration of all vertices, the procedure is completed. Experimental results show that the proposed method tracks the concavities quite well. In addition, the initial contours for tissues with closed boundaries are obtained automatically, thereby no initial contour needs to be defined by the operator.

The analyzed algorithms were two batch methods (the Lloyd LEG algorithm and the Neural Gas method) and one on-line technique (K-means algorithm). These methods obtain reduced subsets of codewords for representing bigger data sets. The experiments were designed for speaker dependent and independent tests and consisted in evaluating the reduced training files for speech recognition purposes. In all the studied cases, the results shown a reduction of learning patterns of near 2 orders of magnitude respect to the original training sets without heavily affecting the speech recognition accuracy. The savings in time after using these quantization techniques, made us to consider this reduction results as excellent since they help to approximate the speech matching responses to almost real time. The main contribution of this work refers to an original use of competitive learning techniques for efficient vector quantization of speech data and so, for reducing the memory size and computational costs of a speech recognizer.

The algorithm is a hybrid of the B-tree and the k-means clustering procedure. K-tree supports on-line dynamic tree construction. The properties of the resulting search tree and clustering codebook are comparable to that of codebooks obtained by TSVQ, the commonly used recursive k-means algorithm for constructing vector quantization search trees. The K-tree algorithm scales up to larger data sets than TSVQ, produces codebooks with somewhat higher distortion rates, but facilitates greater control over the properties of the resulting codebooks. We demonstrate the properties and performance of K-tree and compare it with TSVQ and with k-means.

The proposed method uses the self-organizing map to approximate the probability density function of the image patterns. The map is post-processed, by the k-means clustering algorithm, in order to detect groups of neurons whose weights are similar. Each segmented image of the sequence is generated by correlation its pixels and cluster found in the map. The best number of clusters is dependent on the application To validate the segmentation procedure, we used a segmented sequence to measure successfully the variation of the interventricular septum width.

In this method, the K-means algorithm is first used to partition the training data for each class into several clusters, and the cluster center and the radius for each cluster are calculated. Then, a fuzzy system design method that uses a fuzzy rule to represent a cluster is proposed such that a fuzzy classifier can be efficiently constructed to correctly classify the training data. The proposed method has the following features: (a) it does not need prior parameter definition; (b) it only needs a short training time; and (c) it is simple. Finally, two examples are used to illustrate and examine the proposed method for the fuzzy classifier design.

The basic idea here is to automate segmentation for on-line operations. This is needed for such critical applications as internet communication, video indexing, target tracking, visual guidance, remote control, and motion detection. The method is composed of an edge-suppressed clustering (learning) and principal component thresholding (classification) step. In the learning phase, image clusters are well formed in the (R,G,B) space by considering only the non-edge points. The unknown number (N) of mutually exclusive image segments is learned in an unsupervised operation mode developed based on the cluster fidelity measure and K-means algorithm. The classification phase is a correlation-based segmentation strategy that operates in the K-L transform domain using the Otsu thresholding principal. It is demonstrated experimentally that the method is effective and efficient for color images of natural scenes with irregular textures and objects of varying sizes and dimension.

Our result provides that the space through which the factorization occurs will have the same strong countability property (e.g., strong countable dimension) as the original one had. Taking into consideration the class of compact Hausdorff spaces, this result extends all previous ones of its type. Our factorization theorem will simultaneously include factorization for weak infinite-dimensionality and for Property C, that is, for C-spaces. A corollary to our result will be that for any weight alpha and any finitely homotopy dominated CW-complex K, there exists a Hausdorff compactum X with weight wX less than or equal to alpha and which is universal for the property X tau K and weight less than or equal to alpha. The condition X tau K means that for every closed subset A of X and every map f : A --> K, there exists a map F : X --> K which is an extension of f. The universality means that for every compact Hausdorff space Y whose weight is less than or equal to alpha and for which Y tau K is true, there is an embedding of Y into X. We shall show, on the other hand, that there exists a CW-complex S which is not finitely homotopy dominated but which has the property that for each weight alpha, there exists a Hausdorff compactum which is universal for the property X tau S and weight less than or equal to alpha.

Moreover, the physical models of chromosomes have been introduced in order to take into account the rotation of chromosomes in the flowcytometer. The self-organizing map algorithm has been improved so that it can modify the characteristic parameters of chromosome physical models. By this modification, the lengths of chromosomes and -the intensity distribution of chromosome fluorescence can be estimated from chromosome profile data measured by the flowcytometer. But the clustering results does not converged identically in some experiments. So, we introduced genetic algorithm to re-select the proper set of physical models from those estimated by some SOM experiments. We compared the clustering results of this method with those of K-means method and SOM method without GA.

Truncating the data to only a few bits per pixel in each spectral channel permits a more compact hardware design, enabling greater parallelism, and ultimately a more rapid execution. It also enables the storage of larger images in the onboard memory. In exchange for faster clustering, however, one trades off the quality of the produced segmentation. We find, however, that the clustering algorithm can tolerate considerable data truncation with little degradation in cluster quality. This robustness to truncated data can be extended by computing the cluster centers to a few more bits of precision than the data. Since there are so many more pixels than centers, the more aggressive data truncation leads to significant gains in the number of pixels that can be stored in memory and processed in hardware concurrently.

In the case of optical images, an in-board cloud cover detection module will allow to transmit only useful (i.e. weakly cloudy) images. In order to derive such a module, we propose a method to detect cloudy areas from subsampled images. For a pixel ground surface of about 100 x 100 m(2), cloudy areas appear as the highest radiometric value homogeneous areas. The algorithm presented in this paper is based on the k-means method. Its main originality is to improve classical results by introducing isotropic spatial information. Input data are the sorted components of a vector composed of radiometric values for each pixel and its neighbours (4-connexity). Then a classical k-means method with constraints on the cloudy class gravity center is used on these vectors. We tested the method on a set of 206 subsampled SPOT XS and 138 SPOT P images and their manmade interpretation masks. To evaluate the quality of our results, we used the probability of false alarm (PFA) depending on the number of pixels which have been wrongly declared cloudy, and the probability of non detection (PND) depending on the number of pixels which have been wrongly declared non cloudy. We obtained rather good PFA(< 1%) and PND (< 30%), and compared these values with results obtained with other methods.

We formulate the segmentation problem as an optimisation problem and adopt evolutionary strategy of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for the clustering of small regions in colour feature space. The present approach uses k-Means unsupervised clustering methods into GA, namely for guiding this last Evolutionary Algorithm in his search for finding the optimal or sub-optimal data partition, task that as we know, requires a non-trivial search because of its intrinsic NP-complete nature, To solve this task, the appropriate genetic coding is also discussed, since this is a key aspect in the implementation. Our purpose is to demonstrate the efficiency of CA to automatic and unsupervised texture segmentation. Some examples in Colour Maps are presented and overall results discussed.

An image where each pixel is represented by its class provides a single picture (not hundreds of channels) for the analyst to interpret, Opportunities for fine-grain parallelism in this computationally intensive calculation motivate the consideration of specialized hardware. We are developing an FPGA-based implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm, because FPGAs can provide considerable speedup yet are sufficiently flexible to permit the testing of variants and tradeoffs. Assigning pixels to classes requires a definition of spectral similarity. The standard choice is the Euclidean distance (sum of the squared differences between the pixel and the cluster center taken on a coordinate by coordinate basis). We consider two alternative distances: the Manhattan (sum of the absolute coordinate differences) and the Mar (maximum of the absolute differences). The Euclidean distance is optimal in the sense of minimizing within-class variance, but requires computing many squares. The Manhattan and Max distances eliminate this squaring, and furthermore reduce the number of bits needed to store intermediate calculations. We conducted two sets of experiments to assess the tradeoff between quality of clustering and efficiency of hardware implementation. The first considered an idealized setup for assessing mis-classification rates and their effect on within-class variance. The second evaluated within-class variance for real 224-channel AVIRIS data sets. Both experiments confirmed that the highest quality clusters are achieved using the Euclidean metric, and quantified the difference. In comparing the faster, alternative distances, we found with the AVIRIS data that the results depended on which image was used; however, the idealized experiment showed a clear preference for the Manhattan metric.

During the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) optimization phase, training vectors near the separation margins, are likely to become support vector and must be preserved. Conversely: training vectors far from the margins are not in general taken into account for SVM's design process. SVM-KM groups the training vector in many cluster: Clusters formed only by a vector that belongs to the same class label can be disregard and only cluster centers are used. On the other hand, clusters with more than one class label are unchanged and all training vectors belonging to them are considered. Cluster with mired composition are likely to happen near the separation mar-gins and they may hold same support vectors. Consequently the number of vectors in a SVM training is smaller and the training tints can be decreased without compromising the generalization capability of the SVM.

Methods of open-loop and closed-loop multivariable identification based on neural networks are evaluated in this paper. Neural networks of multilayer perceptron and radial basis function types are employed. Radial basis function neural network is configured with training by k-means clustering (centers), nearest neighbor algorithm (widths) and pseudo-inverse (weights adjustment) techniques. Multilayer perceptron neural network employs the back-propagation algorithm through of a supervised learning. Two multivariable processes are assessed in this paper. The MISO (multi-input, single-output) identification in closed-loop of a horizontal balance process, consisting of two propellers driven by two DC motors is realized. The MISO identification configuration is realized with two inputs and a single output. Another process is a MIMO (multi-input, multioutput) nonlinear system with two inputs and two outputs and governed by difference equations.

With such a view the user can easily see relations and color similarity between images and understand the structure of the data base. In order to cope with large volumes of images a modified version of k-means clustering technique is introduced which identifies representative image samples for each cluster. Representative images (up to 100) are then displayed in two dimensions using MDS structuring. The modified clustering technique proposed produces a hierarchical structure of clusters - similar to street maps with various resolutions of details. The user can zoom into various cluster levels to obtain more or less details if required The results obtained verify the attractiveness of the approach for navigation and retrieval applications.

The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: a database-building stage and a searching stage. In the database-building stage, we partition the image data set into a pre-defined number of clusters by using the MacQueen K-means clustering algorithm. The searching stage has the two steps to choose proper clusters and to find the best match among all the images included in the chosen clusters. In order to reduce the heavy computational cost in the searching stage, we propose two kinds of fast exhaustive searching algorithms based on the multi-resolution feature space, which guarantee a perfect retrieval accuracy of 100%. By applying these two algorithms to the searching stage, we can find the best match with very high search speed and accuracy. In addition, we consider a retrieval scheme producing multiple output images including the best match. Intensive simulation results show that the proposed schemes provide a prospective search performance.

Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-of-detail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, out method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that H-BLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization. The versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated using examples from visual data mining.

Cluster analysis tools are particularly vulnerable to the presence of variables that are essentially noise variables, because such variables can mask the true cluster structure of the data leading to poor cluster recovery. It is therefore essential to reduce the influence of unimportant variables by assigning importance weights to all variables involved in a cluster analysis. One other associated problem in cluster analysis is that the different measurement scales of different variables can cause some variables to dominate a cluster analysis solely because of the magnitudes of their readings and not because of importance. Variable standardization is the technique commonly used to solve this problem. This paper looks at the issues surrounding variable weighting and standardization, and proposes algorithms for addressing the difficulties associated with it in fuzzy K-means cluster analysis.

These regions are considered as clusters, and each cluster is characterized by a prototype example or center. The proposed approach determines the cluster centers corresponding to the original image regions by minimizing an objective function inspired from the Akaike information criterion. This approach improves classical K-means algorithm by overcoming the local solutions problem.

The results concerning single crystals (composition Cu-16.9 wt.% Zn-7.7 wt.% Al, nominal M(s) of 273 K) and polycrystals (Cu-15.8 wt.% Zn-8.3 wt.% Al, nominal M(s) of 230 K, mean grain size of 1 mm) are reported for two training protocols (sequence of one thermomechanical cycle of education followed by one stress free thermal cycle to check the TWME or twenty consecutive thermomechanical cycles followed by one or two checking thermal cycles). The capacity of the trained specimen for producing work under an antagonist compressive stress is also studied and the behaviour of the deformation of the specimen under such a condition at different temperatures is analysed in terms of a competition between the contributions of the different variants: trained variants with an intrinsic deformation in the direction of the tensile stress of the training process, trained variants with an intrinsic deformation which is not well orientated with respect to this direction (in the polycrystal) and new variants with an intrinsic deformation in the direction of the compressive stress which can replace the educated variants.
