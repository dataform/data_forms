This paper reviews some of the theory of principal points and redefines them in terms of self-consistent points. An anthropometrical problem which initiated the theoretical developments is described. Four methods of estimation, ranging from normal theory maximum likelihood to the usual k-means algorithm in cluster analysis, are introduced and applied to the example. Finally, a leave-one-out method is used to assess the performance of the four methods.		FLURY, BD (reprint author), INDIANA UNIV,DEPT MATH,SWAIN HALL E,BLOOMINGTON,IN 47405, USA.

Biological, behavioral, and psychological variables were assessed through survey among 719 (641 females, 78 males) obese members of The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA). All variables were subjected to principal components analyses which extracted 12 biological and 12 psychological components. A two-cluster solution from a k-means clustering on biological components was replicated via Ward's method. Agreement between the solutions was significant (Phi = .33, Kappa = .19, p < .05). The solution was validated through entering psychological component scores into discriminant analysis. One significant function (p < .001) substantially separated the clusters. A component measuring early onset/familial history powerfully discriminated between the clusters. Early onset obese were more obese, more active, and restricted caloric intake to a greater degree. Late onset obese were more likely to be ''settled down,'' engage in substance abuse, eat at night, and have diabetes (p < .05). Results were substantially consistent with those of prior research.

Absolute arterial blood flow assessed as a function of time can be a valuable aid in the analysis of functional significance of arterial lesions and obstructions. An absolute volumetric blood flow measurement technique using a motion immune dual-energy subtraction technique is being investigated, where the kVp and filtration are switched at 30 Hz. The low- and high-energy images are corrected for scatter and veiling glare before subtraction. In this technique, the absolute arterial blood flow is calculated by combining the videodensitometric analysis of spatial and temporal aspects concerning the contrast propagation through the arterial bed using tissue suppressed energy subtracted images. The blood flow measurement technique was validated using a pulsatile pump and a flow chamber imaged over a Humanoid chest phantom. A 20-MHz Doppler flow probe was used to validate the measurement of phasic volumetric blood flow. The measured (M) and known (K) mean blood flow for the entrance vessel technique and the videodensitometric calibration technique were related by M=1.14K -0.12 ml/s (r2=0.98) and M=1.12K-0.23 ml/s (r2=0.90), respectively. The results indicate that phasic volumetric blood flow can be measured using a CCD) camera in conjunction with real time dual-energy subtraction.

We discuss a clustering strategy that explicitly reflects the tradeoff between simplicity and precision of a data representation. The resulting clustering algorithm jointly optimizes distortion errors and complexity costs. A maximum entropy estimation of the clustering cost function yields an optimal number of clusters, their positions, and their cluster probabilities. Our approach establishes a unifying framework for different clustering methods like K-means clustering, fuzzy clustering, entropy constrained vector quantization, or topological feature maps and competitive neural networks.

This paper presents an algorithm based on simulated annealing to solve the machine-component grouping problem for the design of cells in a manufacturing system. The proposed algorithm has been tested on sample problems and its sensitivity to some of its parameters, investigated. When compared with the K-means algorithm, the algorithm fares better for large problems. It is also easy to implement.

The major work is divided into two tasks: the characterizing system hardware and its associated data acquisition software and the characterizing algorithms. The characterizing system hardware consists mainly of a workstation computer, a receiver/pulser with gated peak detector, various monitoring devices that include a spectrum analyzer and a digital oscilloscope, a microcomputer-based 3D-positioning controller, and an A/D converter. The characterization algorithms used are based on neural network and pattern recognition techniques. It is found that artificial neural network techniques provide far better classification results as compared to the pattern recognition techniques. A multilayer backpropagation neural network is developed for characterizing the transducers, which provides a classification accuracy of 94%. Two other multilayer neural networks-sum-of-products and a newly devised neural network called hybrid sum-of-products-have a classification accuracy of 90% and 93%, respectively. The most successful pattern recognition technique for this application is found to be the perceptron, which provides a classification accuracy of 77%. The least successful pattern recognition technique is found to be Bayes' theorem method, which provides an accuracy of 46%. The competitive learning technique provides poor results as compared to the K-Means for preclustering.

The tool conditions considered include tool breakage, several states of tool wear, and chatter. Force, vibration, and power sensors are used in this study to monitor the three components of the cutting force, i.e. acceleration of the tool holder in two perpendicular directions, and the spindle motor current respectively. A total of 11 monitoring indices (signature features) are selected to describe the signature characteristics of various tool conditions. A linear fuzzy equation is proposed to describe the relationship between the tool conditions and the monitoring indices. The proposed methodology is verified experimentally using a total of 396 cutting tests performed at 52 different cutting conditions. The proposed methodology is also compared with that of several classification schemes, including the K-mean and the Fisher's pattern recognition methods, the nearest neighbor method and the fuzzy C-mean method. The results indicate an overall 90% reliability of the proposed methodology for detecting tool conditions regardless of the variation in cutting conditions.

A new method combining self-organization learning and K-means clustering is used for the training of the feature map, and an efficient adaptive nearby-search coding method is designed based on the "locality" of the self-organization, which has been shown to save about 50% computation without degradation in recognition rate compared to the full-search coding. Various experiments for different choices of parameters in the system were conducted on the TI 20 word data base with best recognition rates as high as 99.5% for both speaker-dependent and multispeaker-dependent tests.

The common current practice is to prepare a sales forecast by using purchase intent and observed historical patterns in purchase rates given level of intent. The authors show that the accuracy of sales forecasts based on purchase intent can be improved by first using certain kinds of segmentation methods to segment the panel members. The main empirical finding is that more accurate sales forecasts appear to be obtained by applying statistical segmentation methods that distinguish between dependent and independent variables (e.g., CART, discriminant analysis) than by applying simpler direct clustering approaches (e.g., a priori segmentation or K-means clustering). The results further reveal that meaningful segments are present and identifiable that vary in their subsequent purchase rates for a given level of intent. This identification has important implications for areas such as target marketing, as it indicates which customer segments will actually fulfill their intentions. One key substantive finding is that households in a (demographic/product-usage-based) segment having an a priori high propensity to purchase are also more likely to fulfill a positive intention to purchase.

J	JONSSON, SAT; JONSSON, H				JONSSON, SAT; JONSSON, H			CLUSTERS IN A COHORT OF UNTREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA - PROGNOSTIC IMPORTANCE, ATYPICAL CASES AND THE FAMILIAL VERSUS SPORADIC DISTINCTION	ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						SCHIZOPHRENIA; PROGNOSIS; SUBTYPE	TARDIVE-DYSKINESIA; PSYCHOSIS; BIRTH	In search of features of prognostic importance, a cohort of patients admitted to a mental hospital in 1925 was investigated by means of multivariate clustering techniques. Using K-means cluster analysis or Q-factor analysis, a group containing cases with unfavourable prognosis was isolated. Other groups derived were prognostically heterogeneous. One group of patients, in early phases similar to good prognosis schizoaffective psychoses, could be distinguished and characterized by non-symptom items. There was initial periodicity and onset was acute. They were, on average, younger than the other subjects and there was no personality deviation or emotional disturbance before onset of disease. A family history of mental illness was rare. Two of the factors were positively and negatively characterized by items covering familial history of mental illness, thus seemingly confirming the familial vs sporadic distinction in the subclassification of schizophrenia. Though the clinical pictures were distinctively different at the time when the ratings underlying the analysis were made, approximately the same proportion of cases in the two groups had independently been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia - also taking the course of illness into account. It could furthermore be shown that the population at risk - siblings and children of subjects - as well as the observed number of years at risk in these groups were significantly smaller in the sporadic group than in the familial group. This was a combined effect of a lower fertility in subjects and parents in the sporadic group and a higher rate of drop out due to mortality and other reasons among siblings of these subjects. The same tendency was indicated when subjects with and without family history irrespective of factor belongingness were compared. It cannot be concluded that the familial vs sporadic distinction is without relevance in the research on schizophrenia, but its essence may easily be obscured, if the population at risk is not taken into account.

J	KIA, SJ; COGHILL, GG				KIA, SJ; COGHILL, GG			UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING AND CENTROID ESTIMATION USING DYNAMIC COMPETITIVE LEARNING	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article								In this paper, an unsupervised learning algorithm is developed. Two versions of an artificial neural network, termed a differentiator, are described. It is shown that our algorithm is a dynamic variation of the competitive learning found in most unsupervised learning systems. These systems are frequently used for solving certain pattern recognition tasks such as pattern classification and k-means clustering. Using computer simulation, it is shown that dynamic competitive learning outperforms simple competitive learning methods in solving cluster detection and centroid estimation problems. The simulation results demonstrate that high quality clusters are detected by our method in a short training time. Either a distortion function or the minimum spanning tree method of clustering is used to verify the clustering results. By taking full advantage of all the information presented in the course of training in the differentiator, we demonstrate a powerful adaptive system capable of learning continuously changing patterns.

The method involves prediction of k + 1 continuous classes resulting from a fuzzy k-means with extragrades grouping procedure, onto a fine grid. The prediction of individual class memberships is optimised by using ordinary kriging of log-ratio transformed memberships with a non-linear back transformation. The resulting k + 1 rastered maps can be manipulated in var-ious ways to produce isogram, choropleth or chorochromatic maps. In addition to potentially providing more soil information to the user this procedure also has implications in cartography and for geographic information systems. An example is given from a 6 km x 8 km area in the eastern part of the Netherlands.

J	JONES, RL				JONES, RL			EXTRACTABLE RUBIDIUM IN SURFACE HORIZONS OF ILLINOIS SOILS	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	56TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOIL SCIENCE SOC OF AMERICA	NOV 01-06, 1992	MINNEAPOLIS, MN	SOIL SCI SOC AMER				Several studies suggest that extractable Rb at very low levels may play an important role in K activity. Rubidium extracted with normal neutral NH4OAc was determined in a suite of surface horizons to characterize its concentration relative to soil-forming factors and to extractable K. Mean extractable Rb (n = 59) was 138 mumol kg-1 soil, and accounted, on the average, for 1.31% of total Rb. Alfisols had significantly less extractable Rb than Mollisols, which was attributed to lower clay contents and a higher degree of weathering in the Alfisols. The mean atom percent of extractable Rb relative to extractable Rb plus K was 0.58% (range 0.07-1.40). Available K, as measured by the fertility quick-test procedure, was inversely proportional to the atom percent of extractable Rb, perhaps because a portion of the extractable Rb had occupied nonextractable sites in phyllocilicates with the addition of K fertilizer.

Subjects were 1,058 men and 1,194 women from a number of samples of normal adults (Strack, 1991b). Ward's (1963) agglomerative hierarchical procedure yielded five clusters for men and four for women that were replicated in subsequent K-means nonhierarchical analyses. Correlates of cluster membership obtained from subgroups of subjects on four personality measures provided strong evidence for the classification.

The premise of the study is that automatic unsupervised computer methods may be employed to choose a "good" initial configuration for a data set. The numbers of clusters, entities, variables describing each entity, the minimum number of points per cluster, the cluster overlap index, and the variation within the clusters were variables selected to build each data set in the simulation. Jancey's clustering algorithm partitioned each data set three times, once for each of the initialization strategies. For each capture of the data produced by Jancey's algorithm, a value of the Corrected Rand Statistic, the dependent evaluation variable in the study, was calculated. The results of the study strengthen the argument that determining initial configurations via unsupervised computer methods can be superior to those obtained randomly.

(d, k) means that any two consecutive ones in the code bit stream are separated by at least d zeros and by at most k zeros. The minimum separation d and the maximum separation k are imposed in order to reduce intersymbol interference and extract clock control from the received bit stream, respectively. This letter recommends to use as the outer code a unidirectional-byte-error-correcting code instead of an ordinary byte-error-correcting code. If we devise the mapping of the code symbols of the outer code onto the codewords of the inner code, we may improve the error performance. Examples of the mappings are described.

The responses of a population of 318 spinothalamic tract (STT) cells to mechanical stimulation of the skin were recorded in anesthetized macaque monkeys by several teams of investigators. The responses were subjected to k-means cluster analysis, a multivariate statistical procedure. 2. For an analysis that pertained to the responsiveness of the neurons, the mean responses to four standard mechanical stimuli (Brush, Pressure, Pinch, and Squeeze) were used. Although no true clusters were found, the cells could be partitioned into four groups (called clusters a, b, c, and d) that responded progressively more vigorously to the stimuli. 3. For an analysis that pertained to the selectivity of the cells for various stimulus intensities, from innocuous to highly noxious, the data were normalized by taking the ratio of the mean response evoked by each stimulus to the sum of the responses and multiplying by 100. This procedure does not have a bias toward selection of any particular number of clusters and resulted in three clusters of STT cells. 4. Cluster 1 STT cells responded best to Brush. Cluster 2 cells responded weakly to Brush and Pressure and maximally to Pinch. Cluster 3 cells responded weakly to Brush, Pressure, and Pinch and maximally to Squeeze. 5. The response states of STT cells with respect to mechanical stimulation of the skin can be defined by their cluster assignments on the basis of the responsiveness (clusters a-d) and selectivity (clusters 1-3) of the cells. The response states of newly recorded STT cells can be determined by discriminant analysis from the nearest centroids of the two types of clusters in the reference population of STT cells. 6. No consistent changes in response state were detected when a second series of mechanical stimuli was applied 1 cm from the site stimulated initially or when the stimulus series was alternately repeated at the initial site and at progressively more proximal sites. However, when the stimulus series was applied five times to the initial site, the response state of five of eight cells tested showed a change. Although a change in response state required repetitive damage, even a single stimulus series increased background activity and responses to Brush at undamaged sites. 7. The background activity and responses to Brush and Pressure of all five STT cells recorded in the superficial laminae increased after repeated testing. The background activity of five STT cells recorded in the nucleus proprius also increased, but the responses of only three of the cells to Brush and Pressure increased. However, one cell that showed no change belonged to cluster 1, and the other was tested with a minimally damaging pattern of stimulation. 8. The response states of STT cells could also be changed by descending control systems. Stimulation of the SI cortex or cerebral peduncle preferentially inhibited the responses to Brush and therefore shifted the selectivity of the cells tested. Stimulation in the periaqueductal gray produced a preferential decrease in responses to compressive noxious stimuli and decreased responsiveness. 9. The cluster analyses used in this study for classifying STT cells provide an improvement over those used in previous work from our laboratory. Furthermore, the two types of clusters, reflecting the responsiveness and selectivity of STT cells, describe the response states of these cells with respect to mechanical stimulation of the skin and provide a convenient baseline against which to assess changes due to pathological or physiological manipulations.

The method presented in this paper allows the reconstruction of functional relations within a group of neurons as recorded by a single microelectrode. Data are sampled at 10 or 13 kHz. Prominent spikes produced by one or more single cells are selected and sorted by K-means cluster analysis. The activities of single cells are then related to the background firing of neurons in their vicinity. Auto-correlograms of the leading cells, auto-correlograms of the background cells (mass correlograms) and cross-correlograms between these two levels of firing are computed and evaluated. The statistical probability of mutual interactions is determined, and the statistically significant, most common interspike intervals are stored and attributed to real pairs of spikes in the original record. Selected pairs of spikes, characterized by statistically significant intervals between them, are then assembled into a working model of the system. This method has revealed substantial differences between the information processing in the visual cortex, the inferior colliculus, the rostral ventromedial medulla and the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus. Even short 1-s records of the multiple neuronal activity may provide meaningful and statistically significant results.

The algorithm is based on a split-and-merge technique. The type-I splitting is guided by density of data over strips at different directions around the centroid of the data. The type-II splitting is the usual K-means clustering algorithm (K=2) and rechecked with the help of a merging technique. A theorem on the convergence of this algorithm is proved.

Hard partitions are obtained as a result of KM cluster analysis, i.e. each object belongs to only one definite cluster. The FCM algorithm optimizes the degree of membership of objects in all the clusters - each object may thus belong to more than one cluster. The results of FCM are influenced by a parameter which controls the 'degree of fuzziness'. This influence is studied and a method is suggested which makes the manifold of data obtained by FCM convenient and clear. The discussion of the partitions obtained shows that the FCM analysis yields valuable additional information on outliers and hybrids, i.e. less typical members of the clusters. The results of KM and FCM cluster analysis support the interpretation of the Si-29 NMR data on the basis of a structural model for the calcium aluminosilicate glasses.

J	PAPPAS, TN				PAPPAS, TN			AN ADAPTIVE CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							GIBBS RANDOM-FIELDS; STOCHASTIC RELAXATION; RESTORATION	The problem of segmenting images of objects with smooth surfaces is considered. The algorithm we present is a generalization of the K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in an iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an eight-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces, show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented and results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details. They can be used in image recognition and as crude representations of the image. The caricatures are easy to display or print using a few grey levels and can be coded very efficiently. In particular, segmentation of faces results in binary sketches which preserve the main characteristics of the face, so that it is easily recognizable.

The methods used are the map-to-map correlation method and the k-means clustering method. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are also presented. It is seen that 75 per cent of the charts can be classified into six distinct types by the map-to-map method. Six distinct types also are obtained by the k-means method. The first four dominant EOFs explain 52 per cent of the variance. Intercorrelations and contingency tables among the types obtained by these methods and visual examination suggests that the dominant patterns are similar, irrespective of the method used. It is also seen that the monsoon rainfall for the country as a whole and the spatial patterns may have no relationship. Even during normal monsoon years, the spatial patterns may be different. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods used are discussed.		KULKARNI, A (reprint author), INDIAN INST TROP METEOROL,POONA 411008,INDIA.

Method: The authors used the Psychotherapy Supervision Inventory to rate 53 videotaped supervision sessions of 34 different supervisors. They also used the variable of the rater's perception of the excellence of the supervisor as a teacher. The data were subjected to a cluster analysis and a K-means analysis. Discriminant function analyses were applied to the comparison of the behavior of 19 supervisors with two different residents and the behavior of all 34 supervisors with residents in three different years of training. The relationship between rater-perceived excellence and Psychotherapy Supervision Inventory scores was analyzed by using stepwise multiple regression. Results: There was a high level of agreement among the four raters' judgments of supervisors' excellence. Empathy accounted for 72% of the variance in rater-perceived excellence and focus on the therapist accounted for an additional 5%. When empathy was dropped from the equation, experimental orientation accounted for 60% of the variance in ratings of excellence, clarification and interpretation accounted for an additional 16%, and depth accounted for another 3%. Conclusions: In the context of established relationships, supervisors have stable behavior patterns. Rater-perceived excellence is related to the supervisor's focusing on the resident's immediate experiences and making many synthesizing comments in depth. The Psychotherapy Supervision Inventory can be used to orient supervisors to supervision and provide feedback about their behavior.

J	MCBRATNEY, AB; DEGRUIJTER, JJ				MCBRATNEY, AB; DEGRUIJTER, JJ			A CONTINUUM APPROACH TO SOIL CLASSIFICATION BY MODIFIED FUZZY K-MEANS WITH EXTRAGRADES	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article								The need for a more continuous approach to soil classification is discussed, and methods based on the mathematical constructs known as fuzzy sets are considered most appropriate for this. A centroidal grouping method, fuzzy k-means with extragrades, which quantifies the intragrading and extragrading of soil individuals is described. An example of the application of this technique to an area of 4800 ha at Wesepe in The Netherlands is presented. The results show that the technique could create a classification that reflects the main pedological features of the area in a continuous way. Although there may be problems in selecting the optimal number of groups and degree of fuzziness, we conclude that the method is most promising and worthy of consideration when any type of quantitative soil classification is required.

Partial sum and nearest neighbouring distance methods are proposed to speed up the K-MEANS clustering algorithm with Euclidean distance norm. Use of the Mahalanobis distance norm instead of the Euclidean distance norm is identified for the effective exploration of the real structure of the data. Lower triangular matrix and Expanded distance function approaches are proposed to speed up the Mahalanobis distance based K-MEANS algorithm. Further, use of the Dynamic clustering method for optimal global partition of the data is identified and use of the Lower triangular matrix approach to speed up Dynamic clustering is proposed. Other methods to speed up the Dynamic clustering process are identified. Use of the image auto-correlation property is identified for further speeding up of the proposed methods in the clustering of image data.

Four algorithms are investigated for classification of daily weather states: k-means clustering, fuzzy clustering, principal components, and principal components coupled with k-means clustering. A semi-Markov model with a geometric distribution for within-class lengths of stay is used to describe the evolution of weather classes. A hierarchical modified Polya urn model is used to simulate precipitation conditioned on the regional weather type. An information measure that considers both the probability of weather class occurrence and conditional precipitation probabilities is developed to quantify the extent to which each of the weather classification schemes discriminates the precipitation states (rain-no rain) at the precipitation stations. Evaluation of the four algorithms using the information measure shows that all methods performed equally well. The principal components method is chosen due to its ability to incorporate information from larger spatial fields. Precipitation amount distributions are assumed to be drawn from spatially correlated mixed exponential distributions, whose parameters varied by season and weather class. The model is implemented using National Meterological Center historical atmospheric observations for the period 1964-1988 mapped to 5-degrees x 5-degrees grid cells over the eastern North Pacific, and three precipitation stations west of the Cascade mountain range in the state of Washington. Comparison of simulated weather class-station precipitation time series with observational data shows that the model preserved weather class statistics and mean daily precipitation quite well, especially for stations highest in the hierarchy. Precipitation amounts for the lowest precipitation station in the hierarchy, and for precipitation extremes, are not as well preserved.

Subjects also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Methods of Coping Scale (MOC), and the Level of Expressed Emotion Scale (LEE). The five personality subtypes that emerged were consistent across two clustering methods (K-means and complete linkage). Subtypes members differed on subscales of the BSI, MOC, and LEE. Results support the relevance of personality traits and disorders in assessing psychopathology in psychiatric patients. Results also support the relevance of subtyping these patients according to MCMI-II results.

EFFECT OF STIMULUS TEMPORAL FREQUENCY ON THE REPRESENTATION OF MOVING BAR PATTERNS IN PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX OF MONKEYS	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; ADAPTING MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; CORTICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MULTIPLE-POINT STIMULI; TACTILE DISCRIMINATION; AWAKE MONKEYS; SIMPLE CELLS; PSYCHOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS; CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS	1. To assess the mechanisms used by cortical neurons to sense motion across the skin, we applied pulsatile stimuli to a series of adjacent positions on the glabrous skin of the hand using a computer-controlled OPTACON stimulator. We describe responses of 129 single neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of alert monkeys to a horizontal bar pattern that was displaced proximally or distally in 1.2-mm steps at 10-, 20-, and 40-ms intervals (100, 50, and 25 Hz, respectively). These frequencies span the range in which apparent motion is transformed perceptually in humans from a smooth uninterrupted sweep into a series of distinct pulses that are resolved as separate events. The experiments are thus designed to decipher the neural correlates distinguishing continuous motion from discrete taps. 2. Cortical receptive fields mapped with moving bar patterns spanned 5-24 rows on the tactile array (16.2 +/- 5.4, mean +/- SD). Over 40% of the fields encompassed 18 or more rows (greater-than-or-equal-to 21.6 mm), allowing these neurons to integrate spatial information from an entire image displayed on the OPTACON. Cortical receptive fields are considerably larger than those of mechanoreceptors mapped with the same moving bar patterns (4.2 +/- 2.3 rows, mean +/- SD), reflecting convergent inputs in subcortical and cortical relays. Responses were either relatively uniform across the field or strongest at the initial point of entry, depending on the frequency of stimulation. A sharply defined field center was absent from most of the cells recorded in this study. 3. Temporal frequency of stimulation appears to be a major determinant of cortical firing patterns. Low-frequency stimuli are more effective in activating cortical neurons, producing more spikes per sweep and greater phase-locking to individual stimuli than do high frequencies. The total spike output of cortical neurons is proportional to the pulse interval over the range 10-40 ms, increasing linearly by an average of 5.9 spikes/10-ms increase in pulse period. Peak firing rates and modulation amplitude are also highest when pulses are presented at long intervals, falling significantly as the stimulation frequency rises. The reduction in firing at high pulse rates is apparently due to central mechanisms, as both rapidly adapting and Pacinian corpuscle afferents display nearly constant spike outputs and uniform sensitivity within the field when tested with identical bar patterns. Central networks thus behave as low-pass filters, reducing cortical responses to rapidly applied sequential stimuli. 4. The total spike output of cortical neurons during a sweep is considerably larger than that of mechanoreceptors at all frequencies tested. Total spikes per sweep in the cortex average 9.4 at 100 Hz and rise to 27.3 at 25 Hz. By contrast, in the periphery, total output rises from 3.6 to 4.4 spikes/sweep over this range. The increased cortical responsiveness is due to both larger receptive field size as well as an increase in gain at low frequencies. 5. Average firing rates of cortical neurons do not directly represent the temporal frequency of stimulation by a one-for-one spike code, as in the periphery. Cortical firing rates rise more slowly than the stimulation frequency over the range 25-100 Hz, increasing by an average of only 0.21 spikes/s per 1-Hz increase in pulse frequency. Average firing rates are higher than the stimulus frequency when pulses are stepped across the field at 25 Hz, with gain ranging from 1.3 to 2.9 spikes/pulse. Mean rates are close to the input frequency at 50 Hz and drop to approximately one-half the input frequency at 100 Hz. 6. These effects of temporal frequency appear to be mediated by two central mechanisms, amplification and inhibition. We propose that amplification results from convergent inputs that prolong the spike trains evoked by individual pulses, leading to merger of successive responses when stimuli are applied at intervals < 40 ms. The increased response duration may result from disparities of conduction velocities of sensory afferents and in central pathways, leading to asynchronous excitatory inputs. Recurrent intracortical networks, or intrinsic bursting properties, may also prolong evoked responses of cortical neurons. At high frequencies, the preceding stimulus appears to reduce the responsiveness of cortical neurons to subsequent stimuli with a time course resembling that of in-field inhibition. Inhibition damps fluctuations in firing patterns, thus smoothing the spike train and eliminating representation of individual pulses as separate events. 7. The spike trains evoked in the cortex by the moving bar patterns are more variable, longer in duration, and less tightly phase locked to the stimulus pulses than are the mechanoreceptor responses evoked by the same stimuli. Cortical firing patterns show considerable diversity and differ in their degree of phase-locking to individual OPTACON pulses, their duration and probability of firing, and their average firing rates. We have used k-means cluster analysis to subdivide the population into three groups (phasic, burst, and modulated neurons) on the basis of the modulation amplitude of the spike trains. 8. The temporal frequency of stimulation appears to be signaled by the internal pattern of firing within the spike train rather than by average firing rates. Phasic and burst neurons are apparently well suited to represent temporal frequency by oscillation of their spike trains; they signal the moment of skin contact by the probes as a synchronous burst of impulses. By contrast, modulated neurons show the weakest stimulus-linked fluctuations in firing patterns over the entire range tested. Their activity appears relatively independent of stimulation rate; these cells may signal other stimulus features. Phasic neurons accurately depict the timing of stimulus pulses by their instantaneous firing rates; peaks are observed in their interspike interval histogram at intervals corresponding to the stimulation period. The instantaneous firing rates of burst and modulated neurons appear independent of frequency; peak activity occurs in the same time bin regardless of frequency. The modal interval occurs at 1-3 ms in burst neurons and at approximately 10 ms for modulated neurons. 9. Our data suggest that perception of punctate or moving sensations may be related to the frequency modulation of cortical spike trains. Low-frequency stimuli feel pulsatile or punctate; their cortical responses display strong oscillations in excitability between bursts of impulses and silent intervals, the timing of which is directly linked to the individual stimulus pulses. The strong spike bursts of phasic and burst neurons may provide the physiological substrate for the distinct sensations evoked at low pulse rates. High-frequency stimuli appear to move smoothly across the skin. They are signaled by continuous firing at relatively steady rates. Central neuronal processing attenuates the bursts evoked by sequential pulses and smooths out variations in firing during the period of stimulation, resulting in spike trains similar to those evoked by stroking the skin.

To analyse the features obtained the 'chainmap' procedure is used. The acoustic processor is implemented using a TMS320C25 DSP which interfaces directly to a transputer array. Requirements considered include the accuracy to represent the speech signal, real-time processing capacity and flexibility. Speech samples using five independent speakers are used to assess the acoustic features extracted by the processor. The system has been further developed to allow satisfactory processing using 12 speakers.		ARRIOLA, Y (reprint author), STAFFORDSHIRE POLYTECH,DEPT ELECT & ELECTR ENGN,STAFFORD ST18 0AD,ENGLAND.

Two upstream sites were characterized by high densities of sensitive taxa, predominantly mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, and two downstream sites showed high densities of tolerant taxa, especially true flies, annelids, Baetis mayflies, and gastropods. Despite the small sample size, some statistical techniques proved useful. The first two components of correspondence analysis were used to confirm the existence of both seasonal and spatial trends in the benthic macroinvertebrate populations of the stream. Neither component alone, however, ordinated the samples with respect to these trends. Combinations of the first two components were required. A standard clustering technique, k-means clustering with squared Euclidean distance, further confirmed the seasonal trend. Nonmetric clustering, not widely used in the analysis of ecological data, was necessary to confirm the spatial trend. Nonmetric clustering was also able to identify a small number of ''significant'' taxa, i.e. taxa that reliably served as indicators of spatial position on the stream.

Using Monte Carlo simulation, we show that significant benefits are associated with replicated starting configurations that incorporate seed selection procedures based on a hierarchical clustering of sample points drawn from the original data matrix. A real-world application of the approach is then presented.	UNIV PENN,WHARTON SCH,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104	HELSEN, K (reprint author), UNIV CHICAGO,GRAD SCH BUSINESS ADM,CHICAGO,IL 60637, USA.

C. Koch] trees grown under eight combinations of orchard floor management and irrigation was determined by leaf and soil analyses. Orchard floor management practices were weedy-unmowed, weedy-mowed, weed control with herbicides, and weed control by disking, with trees either irrigated or nonirrigated. The element most affected by treatment was K. Mean leaf K for the two sample years was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in the weedy plots (0.56% K) than in those where weeds were controlled (0.76% K), suggesting a highly competitive effect of weeds for K with young pecan trees. Weed competition also suppressed leaf Ca and Mg, but presence of weeds or sod resulted in higher soil pH and higher leaf Zn. Leaf concentrations of N, P, B, Cu, and Fe were not significantly affected by the treatments.

This approach segments closed shapes into segments and explores the characteristic relations between consecutive segments to make classifications at a finer level. The algorithm can tolerate a lot of shape contour perturbation and a moderate amount of occlusion. An orientation scheme is described to make the overall classification insensitive to shape orientation. Excellent recognition results have been reported. A distinct advantage of the approach is that the classifier does not have to be trained again when a new class of shapes is added.

Biological and psychological variables were separately subjected to principal components analyses. Fifteen biological and five psychological components were extracted. A three-cluster solution was selected from a K-means clustering on biological components, replicated via Ward's method, and validated via a discriminant analysis on psychological components. Cluster 1, 'android obesity', contained 75 percent of the males and was characterized by 'masculine phenotypy', 'poor conditioning' and 'adverse serum lipids', and less 'feminine' responding on the MMPI. Cluster 2, 'gynoid obesity', was low on components measuring physical stress and masculine phenotypy, was 95 percent female, moderately obese compared to clusters 1 and 3, and had a relatively healthy profile. Cluster 3 had elevations on overall fatness and physiological and psychological stress, and low scores on a 'healthy blood synthesis' component. This cluster, labeled 'morbidly obese', was the most obese and had profiles suggesting adverse effects of obesity.

The approach is developed for objective functional type (K-means or fuzzy K-means) algorithms, and its ability to detect 'good' clusters amongst noisy data is demonstrated. The approach presented is applicable to a variety of fuzzy clustering algorithms as well as regression analysis.

The system consists of a 3-D positioning mechanism, a motion controller, a pulser/receiver with gated-peak detector, a digitizing oscilloscope, a spectrum analyzer, and a host computer. Pattern recognition techniques were used to classify and reduce the dimensionality of the transducers. It was found that the K-Means algorithm was the most successful algorithm for classifying the transducers while the Bayes' decision rule gave the worst performance. Feature reduction was found to be successful through the K-L transformation algorithm. Details of hardware and software implementation as well as the pattern recognition characterizing techniques and results obtained are presented. Overall comparison and discussion of the characterizing techniques are also described.

A very fast and simple histogram-based segmentation scheme for polyhedral objects and reliable segmentation methods based on modified K-means and Unsupervised Fuzzy Partition-Optimum Number of Clusters (UFP-ONC) algorithms are presented. These methods are computationally and implementationally simple, work for both polyhedral and curved objects, are robust enough to deal with noisy features, and perform well without any knowledge of the type and number of objects present. Modifications to the K-means and UFP-ONC algorithms are necessary to deal with periodic features such as the orientation angle of the normal. The combination of orientation angle and mean curvature is shown to produce the best results, and the modified UFP-ONC algorithm is shown to perform better in terms of detecting more meaningful clusters, picking the optimum number of clusters and handling noisy data. Experimental results on range images obtained from the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan illustrate that the proposed methods are effective.

Two versions were fabricated: the first using 1.9-mu-m-thick gold and the second using a high-temperature superconductor (HTS), YBa2Cu3O7, 0.6-mu-m thick. The devices were identically packaged and tested at 77 K. It was found that the HTS resonator had a surface resistance, R(s), about six to nine times lower than the Au one. At 45 K, the R(s) of the HTS resonator decreases by another factor of 4 compared with its 77 K value. For the HTS resonator, (i) R(s) varies as f2 and (ii) R(s) degrades with resonator power density as the RF current density, J(c), approaches typical dc measured values. Five identical HTS resonators were fabricated. At 77 K, mean and standard deviations on R(s) were mu = 1.42 and sigma = 0.46 m-OMEGA/sq., respectively. The measured sigma/mu ratio of 0.3% on the fundamental suggests that narrow passband filters can readily be implemented.

The method includes k-means clustering and constrained block clustering as special cases. Possibilities for evaluating the resulting matrix include calculation of relative contributions to measures of block sharpness, comparison of partitions and construction of consensus tables. A new measure for comparing rearranged data matrices is suggested. The distributional properties of final results produced under different starting conditions are examined. The performance of the algorithm is tested on binary vegetation data from the Italian Alps.		PODANI, J (reprint author), INT CTR ENVIRONM & MARINE SCI & TECHNOL,VIA BEIRUT 7,I-34100 TRIESTE,ITALY.

MULTIVARIATE DATA-ANALYSIS APPLIED TO THE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF MICROBIAL STARTERS FOR BREAD DOUGH FERMENTATION	REVISTA DE AGROQUIMICA Y TECNOLOGIA DE ALIMENTOS			Spanish	Article								Stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and K-means clustering (KMC) have been applied to classify ninety-five combinations of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria inoculated to bread doughs. Data from the evaluation of thirty-two fermentative, rheological and baking characteristics were used for the analysis. By SDA, the variables that best discriminated among the quality groups defined by sensory attributes of bread were found to be gas production, total titratable acidity, pH and bread volume. The best classification of samples was obtained with edibility, aroma and loaf shape, and the worse one with taste and crumb texture. Overlapping was observed between the confidence regions of extreme quality groups for all the sensory attributes evaluated, when the canonical variables were plotted; the best separation was obtained with edibility, loaf shape, aroma and grain. The grouping of samples in three clusters by KMC led to a good separation. Two of the clusters could be defined as high and low quality classes. Results from both multivariate data analysis methods were in agreement, thus allowing the definition of high and low quality groups and providing a procedure to select the best suited combinations of microorganisms leading to a defined level of bread quality.

The only corresponding fuzzy algorithm are the well known fuzzy k-means or FUZZY ISODATA of Dunn and its generalizations by Bezdek and by Gustafson and Kessel. The authors show how to generate two other fuzzy algorithms which are the analogous of known hard algorithms: the minimization of the fuzzy determinant and of the product of fuzzy determinants. By comparison between the hard and fuzzy methods it appears that the latter yield more often the global optimum, rather than merely a local optimum. This result and the comparison between the different algorithms, together with their specific domains of application, are illustrated by a few numerical examples.

J	BROWN, JS				BROWN, JS			PRINCIPAL COMPONENT AND CLUSTER ANALYSES OF COTTON CULTIVAR VARIABILITY ACROSS THE UNITED-STATES COTTON BELT	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							MAIZE GERMPLASM; INBRED LINES; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; PEDIGREE DATA; ASSOCIATIONS; MULTIVARIATE	Though few examples of multivariate analyses of agronomic trials exist in the literature, such analyses can provide useful additional information as a supplement to normal univariate analyses. In this study, data from the Regional Cotton Variety Tests were used to study the interrelationships of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars based on agronomic and fiber trait measurements. The study of agronomic variability among cultivars was reflective, in part, of genetic variability, and gave graphical, nonnumerical assessments of genetic variability. Principal component, hierarchical (Ward's minimum variance) cluster, and nonhierarchical (k-means) cluster analyses were computed on data from seven of the nine regions of the tests. Check cultivars were common across regions, enabling comparisons of results within and across regions. Three-dimensional plots displayed results of the principal component and k-means cluster analyses, while results from Ward's minimum variance clustering were presented as dendrograms. Cultivars in the Mississippi Delta, Central, and Texas High Plains regions did not cluster tightly, whereas cultivars in the Eastern, New Mexico, and San Joaquin Valley regions clustered comparatively tightly. This implies greater intercultivar differences in the first three regions than in the latter three, which shows the genetic bases of the first three to be broader. New Mexico Acala cultivars clustered less tightly than Acala cultivars in the San Joaquin Valley, likewise implying a broader genetic base in the New Mexico cultivars. Check cultivars tended to cluster as outliers outside their region of adaptation.		BROWN, JS (reprint author), NORTHRUP KING CO,DEPT QUANTITAT GENET,STANTON,MN 55081, USA.

Symptoms were rated in accordance with a rating protocol containing 33 items based on Leonhard's descriptions of cycloid psychoses. The patients were followed up through parish registers and hospital records. Of 42 cases considered to be cycloid psychosis at index admission, 34 were prognostically verified. The symptom ratings of the 154 patients were analysed by K-means cluster analysis to test whether the patients with cycloid psychoses would separate from the rest of the material. With a 2-cluster solution, 30 of 34 cases (88%) were contained in the same cluster. The sensitivity of the ratings was therefore judged to be acceptable. Specificity was low, however, since 19 cases in the cluster were differently diagnosed. A subcohort of 64 patients, satisfying at least 5 items of the rating protocol, was then analysed by Q-factor analysis to test whether nuclear cases of cycloid psychosis differ from symptomatically related syndromes. No such differences could be statistically verified; no symptom profile specifically indicating cycloid psychosis could be found. Prominent confusion symptoms appear, however, to be prognostically favourable, whereas motility symptoms without confusion seem to indicate an unfavourable course.

A correspondence analysis shows a strong underlying gradient in the data set which induces an extraordinary horsehoe effect. This gradient follows closely the altitude component. Applying the k-means clustering method on U.T.M. squares produces geographically compact groups which are largely hierarchically nested. This indicates strong regional trends in the ecological data set. As homogeneous groups may also be artefacts created by the clustering algorithms on a continuous gradient, the relevance of the borders between homogeneous areas is tested. In general, k-means borders correspond to the main breaking lines between adjacent U.T.M. squares. They can be referred to as natural borders.

Four groups were identified: mild RA (Group 3), very severe RA (Group 4), and 2 groups intermediate in severity (Groups 1 and 2). Group 2, the largest of the clusters (n = 89), appeared to have greater tolerability of RA as measured by severity and psychological variables, and took the drug almost twice as long as other groups, although improvement was not greater nor side effects fewer. All groups improved over a mean of 1.9 years, and the degree of improvement was not related to the initial severity classification. Improvement occurred almost equally in all clusters, and the relative ranking of the groups was maintained at study closure.

When the feature's range is discrete with N unordered outcomes, the optimal partition, that is, the partition minimizing an expected loss, is usually found by an exhaustive search through all possible partitions. Since the number of possible partitions grows exponentially in N, this approach is impractical when N is larger than about 10 or 20. In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm that finds a locally optimal partition for an arbitrary loss function, in time linear in N for each iteration. The algorithm is a K-means like clustering algorithm that uses as its distance measure a generalization of Kullback's information divergence. Moreover, we prove that the globally optimal partition must satisfy a nearest neighbor condition using divergence as the distance measure. These results generalize similar results of Breiman et al. to an arbitrary number of classes or regression variables and to an arbitrary number of bins. We also provide experimental results on a text-to-speech example, and we suggest additional applications of the algorithm, including the design of variable combinations, surrogate splits, composite nodes, and decision graphs.

With K-means clustering the collecting sites are grouped based on four climatological variables to create relatively homogeneous regions of origin with respect to agro-ecological characteristics. Stepwise Discriminant Analysis confirmed the minimization of variation within regions. Regional description with respect to agro-ecological characteristics is given. According to farmers' estimations, average grain yield is lowest in western mountainous regions, and highest in southern parts of the country, which illustrates the tendency of landraces to produce more straw rather than grain dry matter under high rainfall conditions. Other data, however, show that farmers in southern regions supposedly have overestimated yield levels. Landrace groups as distinguished by farmers are morphologically identified, to provide a systematical description of visible variation. Distribution patterns of the various landrace groups are indicated. Only few landrace groups are widely distributed, whereas most others are regionally concentrated. Genetic diversification is found in the heterogeneous nature of landraces and in the cultivation of different landraces per region or village. Large proportions of T. aestivum were found in T. durum populations in the mountainous regions in the west of the country, where farmers apparently desire a species mixture.

Our experiment has revealed that the M multiphoton process was exclusively enhanced in the M stage array driven by a dc voltage bias source, and that pair tunneling at each stage occurs simultaneously. Each Josephson element is a quasiplanar type Josephson weak-link made of niobium films with small capacitance and bridge length shorter than 3.49-xi, where the ideal Josephson effect can be expected. Current is a natural common variable in a series array. It is therefore reasonable that fluctuation of the Josephson phase phi-k is effectively reduced in the series array, and that phi-k is locked on a common value, where k means the k-th junction (k = 1,2,3...N). A new phenomenological model is described.	INST PHYS & CHEM RES,WAKO,SAITAMA 351,JAPAN	MATSUI, T (reprint author), MINIST POSTS & TELECOMMUN,COMMUN RES LAB,KOGANEI,TOKYO 184,JAPAN.						Anderson P.

J	WILSON, LL; LETTENMAIER, DP; WOOD, EF				WILSON, LL; LETTENMAIER, DP; WOOD, EF			SIMULATION OF DAILY PRECIPITATION IN THE PACIFIC-NORTHWEST USING A WEATHER CLASSIFICATION SCHEME	SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Review							POINT PROCESS MODELS; RAINFALL	A weather classification scheme was coupled with a semi-Markov model to represent the coincident occurrence of rain/no rain states at a single rain gauge and classes representing regional atmospheric circulation patterns, as identified from National Meteorological Center gridded observations for a large area of the North Pacific. Weather classes were identified from daily observations of surface pressure and 850 mb pressure height at five selected ten degree latitude by ten degree longitude cells using a K-means clustering algorithm, which was applied on a month-by-month basis. The number of climate classes, K, for each month was chosen based on a preliminary analysis of the model's ability to describe statistics of observed precipitation occurrences at the Stampede Pass, Washington weather station. The length of stay distributions within each precipitation occurrence/weather class were assumed to be geometric, and the precipitation amounts for each class and season were fitted with a mixed exponential distribution. Parameters of the length of stay distributions, transition probabilities, and precipitation amounts were estimated from the period of record 1975-84. The fitted model was used to simulate a ten year sequence of daily precipitation. It was found that the semi-Markov model of climate class/wet-dry states preserved the length of wet and dry day runs reasonably well, with the exception of months with long average run lengths. Likewise, the occurrence frequencies of the climate classes were reasonably well preserved with a few exceptions. An exploratory analysis of the properties of wet and dry period runs for those classes and months whose run frequencies were poorly preserved showed that the log survivor functions and variance time curves were also poorly preserved, which suggests that more complex distributions may be required for some of the run length distributions.

Cholesterol esters often deposit during hypercholesterolemia. We investigated whether a high K diet would influence cholesterol ester deposits in stroke prone SHR rats. Stroke prone SHR rats were fed for 3 months a basic diet containing 4% cholesterol, 14% coconut oil and 7% NaCl. One group of 13 rats had normal (.5%) K in the diet. Another group of 10 rats ate high (2.1%) K. Mean intraarterial BPs averaged 165 mmHg in the normal K group and 161 mmHg in the high K group (NS). The serum cholesterol averaged 229 mg/dl in the normal K group and 214 in the high K group (NS). Total aortic cholesterol esters per rat averaged 187-mu-g in normal K vs 68-mu-g in high K, measured by gas chromatography. Thus high K reduced cholesterol ester deposits by 64% (p < .0003), even though BPs and cholesterol levels were quite similar in the two groups. Both high cholesterol and high BP injure endothelial cells and increase invasion of monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells into the intima and increase endothelial permeability to proteins. With high plasma cholesterol, these processes lead to atherosclerosis with cholesterol ester deposition. The high K diet, by protecting endothelial cells, can greatly decrease this cholesterol ester deposition. This effect could possibly be useful for preventing heart attacks in human hypertension.

A major problem dealing with these distributions is to determine the associated probabilities P(j). In order to strike out the computations of the coefficients P(j), Bartholomew (1961) discusses a conditional test for testing the homogeneity of k means against a total ordered alternative. In this paper we deal with the case of testing the face of a particular obtuse cone, the tree order cone, against the cone. In this situation it is shown that the corresponding conditional test seems to perform quite well, as long as it is more powerful than the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for values of the parameters close to the null hypothesis far from zero, both tests having comparable power for other alternatives.

Given k independent samples, the posterior distribution of this product is derived, both when the standard deviations are known and when they are unknown. In the case of the product of medians, the analysis is straightforward, being closely related to the analysis of a sum of k means. In the case of the product of means, the analysis is more complex, in particular, when the standard deviations are unknown.

In order to determine whether the degree of tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine induced by pellet implantation procedure in the rat depends on the dose used and the kinetic parameters, the effect of implantation of different number of pellets on tolerance-dependence and elimination kinetics of morphine from serum was determined. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted subcutaneously with pellets. Each pellet contained 75 mg of morphine free base. Three schedules of implantation were used. They included 2 pellets during a 3-day period (2/3), 4 pellets during a 3-day period (4/3) and 6 pellets during a 7-day period (6/7). Placebo pellets which did not contain morphine were implanted in rats which served as controls. 3. The degree of tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine increased as the number of morphine pellets implanted increased. 4. In separate groups of rats implanted with pellets, elimination kinetics of morphine was studied using radioimmunoassay. The kinetic parameters were: area under serum morphine concentration time curve (AUC0 --> infinity), serum concentration of morphine extrapolated to time zero (C(max)), half-life (t1/2), elimination rate constant (k), mean residence time (MRT) and total body clearance (Cl(t)). 5. The AUC0 --> infinity and C(max) increased in proportion to the number of pellets implanted. The t1/2, k, MRT and Cl(t) values for 2/3 and 4/3 schedules did not differ, but for 6/7 schedule were significantly different from the other two schedules. The degree of tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine was directly related to the AUC0 --> infinity and C(max). The longer t1/2 and MRT and lower Cl(t), and k values in 6/7 schedule may reflect a saturation of glucuronic acid transferase. the main enzyme metabolizing morphine in the liver, and may account for the greater degree of tolerance and physical dependence.

Analytical procedures include K Means Clustering, Cattell's rp statistic, and Pearson r. Although drug use was found to be associated with various forms of psychiatric diagnoses, it was not found to be associated with any particular form of psychopathology. The 16PF profiles of groups of users of different substances were not homogeneous within groups. Some similarity, however, was found among profiles of alcoholics. No evidence could be found to support the contention that groups of substance abusers yield the particular profile pattern on the 16PF that was ascribed to them in an earlier meta-analyses. Due to the inadequacies of the 16PF in diagnosing psychiatric conditions, it is suggested that a more fruitful direction of future research might be to use Cattell's Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ).

It also compares the 16PF scores of a new sample of nonusers with scores of matched groups of heavy, chronic users of cocaine, amphetamine, opiates, and barbiturates/sedative hypnotics, as well as combined groups of stimulant users, depressant users, and a combined group of users of all substances. No significant differences were found among drug user groups, but the profile of the nonuser group was distinctive. K-Means Cluster Analyses, as well as Cattell's Similarity and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Co-efficients, were used to compare profiles of these new samples with the 19 groups described in an earlier meta-analysis of published 16PF studies. Data from the new samples did not cluster with data from other published research, although certain specific similarities appeared in more detailed correlational analyses. Methodological problems are discussed, and it is recommended that in future studies drug user groups be more carefully selected and defined, sample descriptions be more thorough and complete, complete profile information be routinely provided, and efforts be made to explore the utility of the Cattell CAQ in studies of drug users/misusers.

The k-means-type methods produce good results, but usually the quality of the representation depends on an initial cluster configuration. Also this does not allow a variable number of clusters for a given error tolerance. The proposed method removes these disadvantages by an adaptive sequential insertion of new clusters in those areas, where the largest errors occur. This can be done more efficiently by using multidimensional Voronoi diagrams and local procedures. The data points can be weighted and arbitrarily distributed in the Euclidean space. The weight of each point may be chosen by the user depending on the importance or correctness of that point. At the same time the method produces a hierarchical multidimensional triangulation of the data at different levels of accuracy.

However, it has some important drawbacks: long training times and sensitivity to the presence of local minima. Another problem is the network topology; the exact number of units in a particular hidden layer, as well as the number of hidden layers need to be known in advance. A lot of time is often spent in finding the optimal topology. In this article, we consider multilayer networks with one hidden layer of Gaussian units and an output layer of conventional units. We show that for this kind of networks, it is possible to perform a fast dimensionality analysis, by analyzing only a small fraction of the input patterns. Moreover, as a result of this approach, it is possible to initialize the weights of the network before starting the back propagation training. Several classification problems are taken as examples.

We make the observation that a variant of k-means learning, Jancey's, actually provides a more apt counterpart to ART operation. In addition, since redundacy occurs in the search initiated by the reset mechanism in fast learning situations, we suggest an alternative strategy for the practical design of the network. The analogy with k-means based clustering leads to the identification of vigilance as a threshold-like measure comparable to parameters in these algorithms.

This paper introduces a new clustering algorithm which can jump out of a local minimum for a clustering problem with a large number of classes. This algorithm is developed from an interactive one which employs four operations to change the cluster distribution; knowledge about how to get a lower local minimum of the metric has been implanted into the new algorithm. Without interactive operation the new algorithm can try more changes to a cluster distribution, thereby enhancing its chance of reaching a better result. Because a machine can select an operation much faster than a human operator the new algorithm also needs less time to reach the final clustering result. All these points have been demonstrated by experiment.

Recently, an alternative algorithm based on an earlier idea (Duda and Hart, Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis (1973); Ismail and Kamel, Pattern Recognition 22, 75-89 (1989)) has been proposed; in comprehensive experiments we verify that this alternative is superior to K-means. Both techniques suffer from the complexity of the cost function surface they are descending, and a consequent inclination to fall into poor local minima. A popular solution to this problem is to rerun the chosen iterative procedure from many randomly chosen starting positions, saving the best. We introduce here an alternative strategy to form the starting position for such a multiple run which consists of perturbing an existing result in an attempt to improve its poor aspects. This "controlled configuration change" has comparable complexity with random initialisation but usually produces superior clustering results. Comprehensive experiments confirm this result.

The problem is known to have local minimum solutions which are usually what the K-means algorithm obtains. The simulated annealing approach for solving optimization problems is described and is proposed for solving the clustering problem. The parameters of the algorithm are discussed in detail and it is shown that the algorithm converges to a global solution of the clustering problem. We also find optimal parameters values for a specific class of data sets and give recommendations on the choice of parameters for general data sets. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of the approach are presented.		SELIM, SZ (reprint author), KING FAHD UNIV PETR & MINERALS,DEPT SYST ENGN,DHAHRAN 31261,SAUDI ARABIA.
