J	Barbier, Y				Barbier, Y			Comparison of two different geographic units for the study of biogeography of Crabronini and Sphecinae in France, Belgium and Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg (Hymenoptera : Sphecidae)	ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE			French	Article								The objective of this work is to compare the results obtained with two different geographical units (OGU - Operational Geographic Unit): administrative divisions and UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) squares. The taxonomic group studied here is formed by two groups of Hymenoptera Sphecidae: the Sphecinae subfamily and the Crabronini tribe. The following techniques are used in order to describe the biogeographic structure: multivariate analysis and non-hierarchic clustering (k-means). Mediterranean OGUs are clearly separated from the others. Oriental OGUs are then separated from the others. Mountains OGU are then separated from the others. The two kinds of OGUs are able to find strong structures in the data. However, administrative divisions do not allow a fine study of the structure. On the other hand, in spite of their significance, UTM OGU are suffering from the great heterogeneity of the covered surfaces. These heterogeneities are due to the UTM projection and to the border line regions that are weakly covered.

J	Corte-Real, J; Qian, B; Xu, H				Corte-Real, J; Qian, B; Xu, H			Circulation patterns, daily precipitation in Portugal and implications for climate change simulated by the second Hadley Centre GCM	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							SCALE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; DAILY TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; REGIONAL SCALES; GRID-BOX; MODEL; VARIABILITY; WEATHER; PROBABILITIES; INFORMATION; SCENARIOS	Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a k-means clustering algorithm, daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) fields over the northeastern Atlantic and Western Europe, simulated by the Hadley Centre's second generation coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (HADCM2) control run (HADCM2CON), are validated by comparison with the observed daily MSLP fields. It is clear that HADCM2 reproduces daily MSLP fields and its seasonal variability over the region very well, despite suffering from some deficiencies, such as the systematic displacement of the atmospheric centres of action. Four daily circulation patterns, previously identified from the observed daily MSLP fields over the area and well related to daily precipitation in Portugal, were also well classified from the daily MSLP fields simulated by HADCM2. The model can also simulate rather successfully the relationships between the four daily circulation patterns and daily precipitation in southern Portugal. However. compared with observations, daily precipitation intensities simulated by the model are too weak in southern Portugal. Nevertheless, HADCM2 represents a considerable improvement relative to the UKTR experiment. The results described here imply that it is doubtful whether regional precipitation scenarios provided by HADCM2 can be directly applied in impact studies and that a downscaling technique, based on daily circulation patterns, might be successful in reproducing local and regional precipitation characteristics. Moreover, the four circulation patterns call also be clearly identified in the two perturbed experiments, one under greenhouse gases forcing only (HADCM2GHG) and the ether under additional forcing of sulphate aerosol (HADCM2SUL), although changes in the frequencies of occurrence of certain circulation patterns are found. Nevertheless, the observed links between regional precipitation in southern Portugal and large-scale atmospheric circulation seem likely to hold in the model's perturbed climate. It is therefore credible to use those links to downscale large-scale atmospheric circulation from GCM simulations to obtain future precipitation scenarios in southern Portugal.

J	Meneveaux, D; Bouatouch, K				Meneveaux, D; Bouatouch, K			Synchronisation and load balancing for parallel hierarchical radiosity of complex scenes on a heterogeneous computer network	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article						hierarchical radiosity; wavelets; partitioning; clustering; visibility; parallel algorithms; MPI; computer network		In this paper ae propose a SPMD parallel hierarchical radiosity algorithm relying on a novel partitioning method which may apply, to any kind of archilectural scene. This algorithm is based on MPI (Message Passing Interface), a communication library which allows the use of either a heterogeneous set of concurrent computers or a parallel computer or both. The database is stored on a common directory and accessed by all the processors (through NFS in case of a network of computers). As the objective is to handle complex scenes such as building interiors, to cope with the problem of memory size, only a subset of the database resides in memory of each processor. This subset is determined with the help of a partitioning into 3D cells, clustering and visibility calculations. A graph expressing visibility between the resulting clusters is determined partitioned (with a new method based on classification of K-means type) and distributed amongst all the processors. Each processor is responsible for gathering energy (using the Gauss-Seidel method) only for its subset of clusters. In order to reduce the disk transfers due to downloading these subsets of clusters, we use an ordering strategy based on the traveling salesman algorithm. Dynamic load balancing relies on a task stealing approach while termination is detected by configuring the processors into a ring and moving a token around this ring. The parallel iterative resolution is of group iterative type. Its mathematical convergence is proven in the appendix.

To show cluster analysis as a potentially useful tool in defining common outcomes empirically and in facilitating the assessment of preferences for health states. Data Sources. A survey of 224 patients with ventricular arrhythmias treated at Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. Study Design/Methods. Physical functioning was measured using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), and mental status and vitality using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 items (SF-36). A "k-means" clustering algorithm was used to identify prototypical health states, in which patients in the same cluster shared similar responses to items in the survey. Principal Findings. The clustering algorithm yielded four prototypical health states. Cluster 1 (21 percent of patients) was characterized by high scores on physical functioning, vitality, and mental health. Cluster 2 (33 percent of patients) had low physical function but high scores on vitality and mental health. Cluster 3 (29 percent of patients) had low physical function and low vitality but preserved mental health. Cluster 4 (17 percent of patients) had low scores on all scales. These clusters served as the basis of written descriptions of the health states. Conclusions. Employing a clustering algorithm to analyze health status survey data enables researchers to gain a data-driven, concise summary of the experiences of patients.

The period analysed includes days belonging to December, January and February, from 1976 to 1980. The data list consists of thermal, pressure, cloud cover, humidity, wind and precipitation values recorded at four different stations in Catalonia. The classification includes 14 clusters which accurately explain the winter synoptic variety of the country. All cluster features are discussed in detail and a study concerning transitions between these clusters is presented. Three groups (1, 3 and 7) are related to high pressure weather types, clusters 4, 5 and 8 to cold sectors of mid-latitude depressions and clusters 2 and 9 can be associated with cyclonic conditions with western circulation. The weather types related to extended precipitation are included in clusters 6 and 10 which are linked to eastern surface circulation. The obtained classification is then applied in a study concerning daily minimum temperature anomalies. The spatial distribution of these anomalies are analysed for each significant weather type. The clusters related to widely extended frost risk are finally identified (groups 4, 8 and 14). Copyright (C) 1999 Royal Meteorological Society.

J	Chan, LA; Nasrabadi, NM				Chan, LA; Nasrabadi, NM			Automatic target recognition using vector quantization and neural networks	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						target recognition; vector quantization; neural networks; wavelet decomposition; FLIR imagery	ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; DESIGN; SHIFT	We propose an automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithm that uses a set of dedicated vector quantizers (VQs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). For each target class at a specific range of aspects, the background pixels of an input image are first removed. The extracted target area is then subdivided into several subimages. A dedicated VQ codebook is constructed for each of the resulting subimages. Using the K-means algorithm, each VQ codebook learns a set of patterns representing the local features of a particular target for a specific range of aspects. The resulting codebooks are further trained by a modified learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm, which enhances the discriminatory power of the codebooks. Each final codebook is expected to give the lowest mean squared error (MSE) for its correct target class and range of aspects. These MSEs are then input to an array of window-level MLPs (WMLPs), where each WMLP is specialized in recognizing its intended target class for a specific range of aspects. The outputs of these WMLPs are manipulated and passed to a target-level MLP, which produces the final recognition results. We trained and tested the proposed ATR algorithm on large and realistic data sets and obtained impressive results using the wavelet-based adaptive product VQs configuration.

We describe a clustering procedure based on a sequential k-means algorithm with additional I refinements that is able to handle high-throughput data in the order of hundreds of thousands of data items measured on hundreds of variables. The practical motivation for our algorithm is oligonucleotide fingerprinting-a method for simultaneous determination of expression level for every active gene of a specific tissue-although the algorithm can be applied as well Co other large-scale projects like EST clustering and qualitative clustering of DNA-chip data. As a pairwise similarity measure between two p-dimensional data points, x and y, we introduce mutual information that can be interpreted as the amount of information about x in y,and vice versa. We show that For our purposes this measure is superior to commonly used metric distances, for example, Euclidean distance. We also introduce a modified version of mutual information as a novel method for validating clustering results when the true clustering is known. The performance of our algorithm with respect to experimental noise is shown by extensive simulation studies. The algorithm is tested on a subset of 2029 cDNA clones coming from 15 different genes From a cDNA library derived from human dendritic cells. Furthermore, the clustering of these 2029 cDNA clones is demonstrated when the entire set of 76,032 cDNA clones is processed.

Person authentication results coming: from several modalities (e.g., still image, speech), are combined by using fuzzy k-means (FKM) and fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) algorithms, and median radial basis function (MRBF) network The quality measure of the modalities data is used for fuzzification. Two modifications of the FKM and FVQ algorithms, based on a novel fuzzy vector distance definition,are proposed to handle the fuzzy data and utilize the quality measure. Simulations show that fuzzy clustering: algorithms have better performance compared to the classical clustering algorithms and other known fusion algorithms. MRBF has better performance especially when two modalities are combined. Moreover, the use of the quality via the proposed modified algorithms increases the performance of the fusion system.

For N patterns and k centers each with M features, in this paper, we first design an O(kM) time optimal parallel algorithm for one pass process of clustering with the k-means method on a linear array of processors with a wider bus network using N1+1/epsilon processors with one bus network, where c is any constant and c greater than or equal to 1. Then, based on the proposed algorithm, two O(k) and O(1) time optimal parallel clustering algorithms are also derived using MN1+1/epsilon and kMN(1+1/epsilon) processors with M row and MN row bus networks, respectively. These results improve the best known bounds and achieve cost optimal in their time and processor complexities. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yin, PY				Yin, PY			Genetic algorithms for polygonal approximation of digital curves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						genetic algorithms; polygonal approximation; fitness function; partially matched cross-over (PMX); learning strategy	PIECEWISE LINEAR-APPROXIMATION; DOMINANT POINTS; DIGITIZED-CURVES; K-MEANS	In this paper, three polygonal approximation approaches using genetic algorithms are proposed. The first approach approximates the digital curve by minimizing the number of sides of the polygon and the approximation error should be less than a prespecified tolerance value. The second approach minimizes the approximation error by searching for a polygon with a given number of sides. The third approach, which is more practical, determines the approximating polygon automatically without any given condition. Moreover, a learning strategy for each of the proposed genetic algorithm is presented to improve the results. The experimental results show that the proposed approaches have better performances than those of existing methods.

J	Wan, CH; Harrington, PD				Wan, CH; Harrington, PD			Self-configuring radial basis function neural networks for chemical pattern recognition	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							PYROLYSIS MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; SELECTION	Construction of radial basis function neural networks (RBFN) involves selection of radial basis function centroid, radius (width or scale), and number of radial basis function (RBF) units in the hidden layer. The K-means clustering algorithm is frequently used for selection of centroids and radii. However, with the K-means clustering algorithm, the number of RBF units is usually arbitrarily selected, which may lead to suboptimal performance of the neural network model. Besides, class membership and the related probability distribution are not considered. Linear averaging (L-A) was devised for selection of centroids and radii for the RBFs and computing the number of RBF units. The proposed method considers the class membership and localized probability density distribution of each class in the training sets. The parameters related to the network construction were investigated. The network was trained with the QuickProp algorithm (QP) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and evaluated with the poly(chlorobiphenyl) (PCB) mass spectra and an Italian olive oil reference data set. The prediction accuracy of PCB data sets was better than 94%, and the prediction accuracy with Italian olive oil data sets achieved 100% with RMSEP as low as 2.4 x 10(-3). The training times were usually about a second on a personal computer.

This research addresses one of its major problems: the selection of the "best" subset of variables on which to cluster. If this selection is not made carefully, "noisy" variables that contain little clustering information can cause misleading results. To help isolate potentially noisy variables prior to clustering, the authors discuss a new algorithm, the Heuristic Identification of Noisy Variables (HINoV). They demonstrate its robustness with artificial data. In addition, the authors illustrate the potential of HINoV to yield more managerially useful market segments (clusters) when applied to two real marketing data sets. Implementation of HINoV is straightforward and will help avoid a major problem in using K-means cluster analysis for market segment definition, as well as for other similar types of research.

J	Abuelgasim, AA; Ross, WD; Gopal, S; Woodcock, CE				Abuelgasim, AA; Ross, WD; Gopal, S; Woodcock, CE			Change detection using adaptive fuzzy neural networks: Environmental damage assessment after the Gulf War	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION SATELLITE DATA; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; MIXED PIXELS; LANDSAT TM; FEATURES; MAPS	This article introduces an adaptive fuzzy neural network classifier for environmental change detection and classification applied to monitor landcover changes resulting from the Gulf War. In this study, landcover change is treated as a qualitative shift between landcover categories. The Change Detection Adaptive Fuzzy (CDAF) network learns fuzzy membership functions for each landcover class present at the first image date based on a sample of the image data. An image from a later date is then classified using this network to recognize change among familiar classes as well as change to unfamiliar landcover classes. The CDAF network predicts landcover change with 86% accuracy representing an improvement over both a standard multidate K-means technique which performed at 70% accuracy and a hybrid approach using a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC)/K-means which achieved 65% accuracy. In this study, we developed a hybrid classified based on conventional statistical methods (MLC/K-means classifier) for comparison purposes to help evaluate the performance of the CDAF network. The CDAF compared with existing change detection methodology has two features that lead to significant performance improvements: 1) new landcover types created by a change event automatically lead to the establishment of new landcover categories through an unsupervised learning strategy, and 2) for each pixel the distribution of fuzzy membership values across possible categories are compared to determine whether a significant change has occurred.

This is accomplished by either varying a fuzzy parameter or the number of clusters. Once the observations or subsets have been identified, the analyst can then compute regression diagnostics to confirm their degree of influence in regression. Bootstrapping and high-breakdown procedures were used to confirm the influence of the previously identified subsets. This fuzzy clustering strategy is applied to the modified data on wood-specific gravity and an augmented production dataset. Both datasets have been previously presented in the literature.

J	Muller, SV; Racoviteanu, AE; Walker, DA				Muller, SV; Racoviteanu, AE; Walker, DA			Landsat MSS-derived land-cover map of northern Alaska: extrapolation methods and a comparison with photo-interpreted and AVHRR-derived maps	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Circumpolar Remote Sensing Symposium	JUN 22-25, 1998	DUNDEE, SCOTLAND				KUPARUK RIVER BASIN; ACTIVE-LAYER THICKNESS; ARCTIC TUNDRA; VEGETATION INDEX; ENERGY; FLUX; GROWTH; SCALE; RESPONSES; LANDSCAPE	Vegetation maps of Arctic areas are needed for a variety of tundra ecosystem and climate change studies and for extrapolating from relatively small, well-known sites to broader regions. We made a preliminary land-cover map of northern Alaska by extrapolating a Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS)-derived classification of the Kuparuk River Region (KRR) to all of northern Alaska. We used a 26-scene mosaic that was previously made by the EROS Data Center, and a K-means unsupervised classification algorithm to produce eight broad land-cover categories. The northern Alaska-MSS map (NA-MSS) has the following land-cover categories and respective percentage coverage within the 200 000km(2) Arctic Slope: Dry Prostrate-shrub Tundra and Barrens, 8%; Moist Graminoid, Prostrate-shrub Tundra, 22%; Moist Tussock-graminoid, Dwarf-shrub Tundra, 4%; Moist Dwarf-shrub, Tussock-graminoid, Tundra, 28%; Moist Low-shrub Tundra and other Shrublands, 19%; Wet Graminoid Tundra, 9%; Water, 6%; Clouds and ice, <1%; Shadows, 4%. Ancillary data were used to improve the classification for a region of sandy tundra not encountered in the KRR and to separate shadows in the mountains from water and wetlands elsewhere. The NA-MSS map helps to define the distribution of a recently described moist nonacidic (calcareous) tundra and areas of shrublands that are of broad interest to the tundra- and climate-change modelling communities. A boundary separating moist acidic tundra from moist nonacidic tundra stretches across all of northern Alaska (about 850 km). Shrub-dominated tundra is prevalent in the southern and western (warmer, wetter) portions of the map. We created difference maps for comparing the northern Alaska-MSS (NA-MSS) map to the Major Ecosystems of Alaska (MEA) map and a map derived from a time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer images (NA-AVHRR). Compared to the other maps, the NA-MSS map provides more detailed information for moist tundra areas and shows more shrub-dominated vegetation with different spatial distributions than the other two maps. An accuracy assessment of the map will be performed in 1999.

J	Ando, H; Suzuki, S; Fujita, T				Ando, H; Suzuki, S; Fujita, T			Unsupervised visual learning of three-dimensional objects using a modular network architecture	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						three-dimensional object recognition; unsupervised learning; clustering; modular networks; mixture of autoencoders; multiple views	MONKEY INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; 3-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS; NEURAL-NETWORK; EM ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION; ORGANIZATION; SHAPES	This paper presents a modular network architecture that learns to cluster multiple views of multiple three-dimensional (3D) objects. The proposed network model is based on a mixture of non-linear autoencoders, which compete to encode multiple views of each 3D object. The main advantage of using a mixture of autoencoders is that it can capture multiple non-linear sub-spaces, rather than multiple centers for describing complex shapes of the view distributions. The unsupervised training algorithm is formulated within a maximum-likelihood estimation framework. The performance of the modular network model is evaluated through experiments using synthetic 3D wire-frame objects and gray-level images of real 3D objects. It is shown that the performance of the modular network model is superior to the performance of the conventional clustering algorithms, such as the K-means algorithm and the Gaussian mixture model.

J	Pena, JM; Lozano, JA; Larranaga, P				Pena, JM; Lozano, JA; Larranaga, P			An empirical comparison of four initialization methods for the K-Means algorithm	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						K-Means algorithm; K-Means initialization; partitional clustering; genetic algorithms		In this paper, we aim to compare empirically four initialization methods for the K-Means algorithm: random, Forgy, MacQueen and Kaufman. Although this algorithm is known for its robustness, it is widely reported in the literature that its performance depends upon two key points: initial clustering and instance order. We conduct a series of experiments to draw up tin terms of mean, maximum, minimum and standard deviation) the probability distribution of the square-error values of the final clusters returned by the K-Means algorithm independently on any initial clustering and on any instance order when each of the four initialization methods is used. The results of our experiments illustrate that the random and the Kaufman initialization methods outperform the rest of the compared methods as they make the K-Means more effective and more independent on initial clustering and on instance order. In addition, we compare the convergence speed of the K-Means algorithm when using each of the four initialization methods. Our results suggest that the Kaufman initialization method induces to the K-Means algorithm a more desirable behaviour with respect to the convergence speed than the random initialization method.

J	Corte-Real, J; Xu, H; Qian, BD				Corte-Real, J; Xu, H; Qian, BD			A weather generator for obtaining daily precipitation scenarios based on circulation patterns	CLIMATE RESEARCH			English	Article						weather generator; downscaling; precipitation; daily circulation patterns; southern Portugal		Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering algorithm, 4 daily circulation patterns, which are associated with daily precipitation in southern Portugal, have been identified from observed daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) fields over the northeastern Atlantic and western Europe. A weather generator based on daily circulation patterns was calibrated with 3 different schemes to simulate daily precipitation occurrence and a 2-parameter gamma distribution was applied to generate daily precipitation amounts on rain days in southern Portugal. Parameters of the weather generator were estimated for every month in the winter half of the year (October to March) subject to each of the 4 daily circulation patterns. The weather generator was validated by hindcast using independent observational data. The synthetic daily precipitation series generated from the weather generator kept most of the important attributes of the observed series, such as the empirical distribution of daily precipitation amounts, the autocorrelation structure of the sequence of wet and dry days, the distributions of durations of wet and dry spells, and even the distributions of precipitation totals on several consecutive days. Furthermore, the daily MSLP fields over the northeastern Atlantic and western Europe simulated by the Hadley Centre's second generation coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (HADCM2) control run (HADCM2CON) were validated by comparison with observed daily MSLP fields. It is clear that HADCM2 is able to reproduce very well daily MSLP fields and their seasonal variability over the region. Four daily circulation patterns, associated with daily precipitation in Portugal, identified from the observed daily MSLP fields over the area, were also classified well from the simulated daily MSLP fields. The weather generator was then applied to the sequence of daily circulation patterns in simulated MSLP fields of HADCM2CON, and validated. Essentially, the conclusions of previous validation analysis remained the same in the present case. The results imply that the weather generator can reproduce well important features of the 'present climate', including local precipitation in southern Portugal, and can therefore be applied to obtain future precipitation scenarios from daily MSLP fields simulated by the 2 transient experiments of HADCM2, HADCM2GHG (greenhouse gases) and HADCM2SUL (greenhouse gases plus sulphate aerosols). However, it should be kept in mind that the use of the weather generator in obtaining future precipitation scenarios is dependent on the assumption that the present relationship between local precipitation and large-scale atmospheric circulation will remain valid in the future changing climate.

Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans have been determined. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to group the compounds into five groups according to their activity patterns against the four microorganisms. K-Means cluster analysis was then used to confirm these groupings and to show the differences in the activity patterns of the groups. Ten molecular properties of the terpenoids, either calculated via molecular modelling or determined by direct measurement, were then used as variables in a forward stepwise discriminant analysis to identify which variables discriminated between groups. Low water solubility of Group IV compounds, mainly hydrocarbons and acetates, was found to be associated with their relative inactivity. The remaining groups, all containing oxygenated terpenoids, showed characteristic but distinct activity patterns towards the four test organisms. Hydrogen bonding parameters were found to be associated with antimicrobial activity in all cases. Activity against Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa was associated with a combination of a hydrogen bonding and size parameters. This was not found to be the case for the Gram-positive S. aureus or the yeast C. albicans. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The resulting categories bear strong resemblances to major vocational typologies of persons and jobs, especially models proposed by Holland, Gottfredson, Ackerman, and Prediger. Applications of self-organizing neural networks are suggested for psychological assessment in general and career assessment in particular.

J	Slater, MD; Basil, MD; Maibach, EW				Slater, MD; Basil, MD; Maibach, EW			A cluster analysis of alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors in the general population	JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL			English	Article							TYPOLOGY; HEALTH	Objective: Alcohol use typologies have previously focused on chronic alcohol abusers and alcohol-dependent populations. This empirical typology was created to profile lifestyle patterns associated with nonclinical patterns of alcohol use. Method: This study used two surveys sent to a commercial mailback panel, sampled to construct a study population demographically representative of the general U.S. population (N = 2,910). A K-means cluster analysis of alcohol use predictor variables and alcohol use generated the typology. Results: The results suggest five distinct psychobehavioral clusters, referred to by the modal patterns of alcohol use for each cluster: nondrinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, episodic drinkers and regular heavy drinkers. These clusters were found to have predictive validity using related health behaviors, psychosocial variables, personality self-descriptors, and media use as criteria. In particular, moderate drinkers had double the income of any other cluster and showed consistently healthy exercise, cigarette use, and diet patterns as well as a relatively high ranking of health as a personal value. Episodic drinkers had the highest levels of sensation-seeking and drug use and were not health oriented in values and behaviors, although their total weekly consumption was only marginally greater than the moderate drinkers. Conclusions: The profile of the moderate drinker cluster is consistent with concerns about lifestyle confounds in the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health. The episodic drinker profile is consistent with relatively high risk behaviors; this cluster may be a good target for harm-reduction education and intervention efforts.

DESIGN: The circadian rhythm was extracted from diurnal heart rate (KR) variations, and patterns of HR rhythm were compared in centenarians and controls. SETTING: Centenarians living in the metropolitan area of Tokyo and in Aichi prefecture in 1992. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty centenarians underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter) monitoring. The control group, comprised of 100 clinically healthy subjects who underwent similar Holter monitoring, was subdivided, by age, into two groups: the younger controls (age range 23 to 54 years, mean age 41) and the older controls (age range 55 to 82 years, mean age 69). MEASUREMENTS: Harmonic analysis was used to approximate the 24-hour RR interval (the interval between two neighboring R waves on the electrocardiogram) data obtained by Holter monitoring to a summation of three cosine waves with 24-hour, 12-hour, and 8-hour periods. The power of the period was adjusted for the goodness of curve-fit. The power of each period and the circadian acrophase (the timing of the peak in a 24-hour rhythm) were compared among the centenarians, older controls, and younger controls. HR rhythms were classified by k-means cluster analysis based on the power of the period. The prevalence of each pattern was compared among the three age groups. In the centenarians, the relationship between clinical parameters (activities of daily living, cognitive function, nutritional status, and present illness) and patterns of HR rhythm was investigated. RESULTS: The power of the 24-hour period in the centenarians was significantly smaller than that in the older (P < .05) and younger (P < .001) controls. The power of the 8-hour period in the centenarians was significantly larger than that in the younger controls (P < .05). Advances or delays in the circadian acrophase were frequently observed in the centenarians compared with the younger controls. The power of each period did not differ between centenarians with (n = 11) and without (n = 39) overt diseases capable of altering HR rhythms. Five patterns of HR rhythm were identified: 24-hour period dominant (n = 84), 24-hour+12-hour period (n = 18), 12-hour period dominant (n = 11), 8-hour period dominant (n = 7), and low goodness of curve-fit (n = 30). The 8-hour period dominant pattern and the low goodness of curve-fit pattern were observed commonly in the centenarians, whereas the 24-hour period dominant pattern and the 24-hour+12-hour period pattern were observed frequently in the younger controls. Patterns of HR rhythm were not related to clinical parameters in the centenarians. CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythm of HR changed with aging: there was reduction in the power of the 24-hour period, augmentation in the power of the 8-hour period, and a shift in the circadian acrophase.

J	Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A				Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A			Robustness properties of k means and trimmed k means	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						breakdown point; cluster analysis; influence function; qualitative robustness	DISTRIBUTIONS; ESTIMATORS; POINT	The generalized k means method is based on the minimization of the discrepancy between a random variable (or a sample of this random variable) and a set with ii points measured through a penalty function Phi. As in the M estimators setting (k = 1), a penalty function, Phi, with unbounded derivative, Psi, naturally leads to nonrobust generalized k means. However, surprisingly the lack of robustness extends also to the case of bounded Psi; that is, generalized k means do not inherit the robustness properties of the M estimator from which they came. Attempting to robustify the generalized k means method, the generalized trimmed ic means method arises from combining fi means idea with a so-called impartial trimming procedure. In this article study generalized k means and generalized trimmed k means performance from the viewpoint of Hampel's robustness criteria; that is, we investigate the influence function, breakdown point, and qualitative robustness, confirming the superiority provided by the trimming.

J	Karabashev, GS				Karabashev, GS			On the feasibility of an objective classification of vertical profiles of DOM fluorescence in the active layer of the ocean	OKEANOLOGIYA			Russian	Article								To classify the DOM fluorescence profiles, observation data from nine expeditions run by the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology was treated with the K-mean technique of cluster analysis implemented in the PC software package of Class-Master. These materials cover the waters of diverse trophicity mainly in the tropical zone of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. They are presented as the DVD and OVD subsamples for the layers of 0-50 and 0-200 m having 397 and 200 members, respectively. Satisfactory quality of clustering was obtained when the number of clusters K for these layers equaled to 22 and 21. The results of clustering offer a clearer view of a relationship between an oceanological situation and the types of DOM fluorescence profiles. It is shown that the profiles from aquatic areas, influenced by a powerful river run-off, exceed the profiles from eutrophic upwelling regions in fluorescence intensity of the surface layer and must be considered as an "upper" limit of the DOM fluorescence profiles occurring in the ocean. A new type of profiles with a subsurface maximum was discovered in the waters of moderate bioproductivity. This indicates the occurrence of local submerged sources of fluorescing DOM in natural marine environment. The classes of DOM fluorescence profiles, ordered in ascendance of surface fluorescence, were demonstrated to be related to as an indicator of the total bioproductivity of waters, It is argued that cluster analysis can be successfully applied to the classification of various oceanological information.

Adopting the Bayesian framework, we propose to perform annealed maximum a posteriori estimation to compute optimal clustering solutions. In order to accelerate the optimization process, an efficient multiscale formulation is developed. We present a prototypical application of this method for unsupervised segmentation of textured images based on local distributions of Gabor coefficients. Benchmark results indicate superior performance compared to K-means clustering and proximity-based algorithms. In a second application the histogram clustering method is utilized to structure image databases for improved image retrieval. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To overcome the limitations of a modal approach to locate the error sensors, an alternative strategy, referred to as the error sensor plane concept, is proposed. The basic objective of the error sensor plane concept is to create a quiet cross-section in the duct so that the noise from the primary source cannot propagate over this section. To create this quiet cross-section, a network of error microphones is located in the cross-section of the duct. To determine the required number of error microphones and their location in the quiet cross-section, a model simulating a multi-channel ANC system for a circular duct is developed. Using this model, it was deduced that to achieve good control performance, the maximum distance between adjacent error sensors had to be minimized, as well as the distance between the error sensors and the duct wall. To determine the optimal location of the error sensors, the k mean algorithm is implemented. A scale model was used in a laboratory setup to verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy to control high order modes in a circular duct, The obtained results demonstrate that, for the control to be effective, the maximum distance between each error sensor, and the limit of its zone of influence should be less or equal to 1/3 of the wavelength for the frequency considered, i.e. when D-max/lambda(cf) < 1/3.

Gesture is one of the most natural means of enhancing human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques to the level of human communication. This research aims to recognize one-stroke pictorial gestures from visual images, and to develop a graphic/text editing system running in real time. The tasks are performed through three steps: moving-hand tracking and trajectory generation, key-gesture segmentation, and gesture recognition by analyzing dynamic features. A gesture vocabulary consists of 48 gestures of three types: (1) six editing commands; (2) six graphic primitives; and (3) alphanumeric characters-26 alphabetic and 10 numerical. A meaningful gesture part is segmented by a spotter using the phase-based velocity constraints. Some dynamic features are obtained from spatio-temporal trajectories and quantized by the K-means algorithm. The quantized vectors were trained and tested using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Experimental results show about 88.5% correct recognition rate, and also the practical potential for applying these techniques to several areas such as the remote control of robots or of electronic household appliances, or object manipulation in VR systems.

The sampling was carried out in two different areas of southern Galician waters, northwestern Spain, in shallow water (<10 m) with mixed rocky-sandy bottoms (juvenile and postpubertal adult areas) and deep water (>20 m) with soft bottoms (adult habitat). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of morphometric variables and a nonhierarchic K-means cluster of PCA scores differentiated two morphometric groups defined as juvenile and adult phases. A significant change in allometry of cheliped size was detected in juvenile males with a break point at a 109-mm carapace length (CL). This point may indicate a change in the relative growth of juveniles, separating the immature and adolescent phases. Histological analysis of a subsample of males showed that sperm were present in most adolescent crabs, but not in immature crabs. Bivariate morphometric linear discriminant functions allow for the identification of juvenile and adult males (classified previously by K-means cluster) with over 99% correct classification using CL and the length or height of the right cheliped. Carapace length at the onset of sexual maturity was estimated to be 132.7 mm (50% of adult males), although in a broad range, 112-165 mm, the size of juveniles and adults overlap. The life history of male spider crabs shows 3 phases differentiated by the relative growth rate of chelipeds separated by two 2 critical molts: prepubertal molt (immature-adolescent) determines a slight increase in allometry, and pubertal or terminal molt (adolescent-adult) determines an increase in the relative size and allometry of chelipeds and the onset of functional maturity. Females showed only 2 phases separated by the terminal molt. Growth of chelipeds in females showed no changes in allometry and was similar to juvenile males. Juvenile females presented a smaller relative width and a higher allometry of the abdomen with regard to adult females. Unlike juvenile females with a flat abdomen, adult females with a domed abdomen have well-developed pleopods, gonads, and seminal receptacles. Carapace length at the onset of sexual maturity was estimated to be 130.4 mm (50% of adult females). The range of overlap of the size of juveniles and adults (114-143 mm) was smaller than in males.

J	Yoon, HS; Soh, J; Min, BW; Yang, HS				Yoon, HS; Soh, J; Min, BW; Yang, HS			Recognition of alphabetical hand gestures using hidden Markov model	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						gesture recognition; hidden Markov model(HMM)		The use of hand gesture provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help achieve easy and natural comprehension for HCI. Many methods for hand gesture recognition using visual analysis have been proposed such as syntactical analysis, neural network (NN), and hidden Markov model (HMM)s. In our research, HMMs are proposed for alphabetical hand gesture recognition. In the preprocessing stage, the proposed approach consists of three different procedures for hand localization, hand tracking and gesture spotting. The hand location procedure detects the candidated regions on the basis of skin color and motion in an image by using a color histogram matching and time-varying edge difference techniques. The hand tracking algorithm finds the centroid of a moving hand region, connect those centroids, and produces a trajectory. The spotting algorithm divides the trajectory into real and meaningless gestures. In constructing a feature database, the proposed approach uses the weighted rho-phi-nu feature code, and employ a k-means algorithm for the codebook of HMM. In our experiments, 1,300 alphabetical and 1,300 untrained gestures are used for training and testing, respectively. Those experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields a higher and satisfactory recognition rate for the images with different sizes, shapes and skew angles.

The resulting cluster centers are then used for computing the final results in one step, The procedure is flexible, fast to compute, and the numbers of clusters in the data are obtained in a data-driven manner. Applying the algorithm to synthetic fMRI data yields perfect separation of "anatomic," i.e., time-invariant, and "functional," i.e., time-varying, information for a standard off-on paradigm and a typical functional contrast-to-noise ratio of two and higher, In addition, an EPI-fMRI data set of the human motor cortex was analyzed to demonstrate the performance of this novel approach in vivo.

We extend a well-known image histogram to multi-dimensions with some modifications and make use of it to elucidate differences between the images. The framework herein introduced is based on a comparison of the images in their multi-dimensional histogram space rather than in a spatial domain. Due to its flexibility, this approach is preferred as an alternative image comparison technique. The performance of the method is confirmed on simulated and real medical images and compared with the results from related conventional counterparts.

J	Ng, MK; Huang, Z				Ng, MK; Huang, Z			Data-mining massive time series astronomical data: challenges, problems and solutions	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; time series; astronomical data; data preprocessing techniques	STAR	In this paper we present some initial results of a project which uses data-mining techniques to search for evidence of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) from very large time series database. MACHOs are the proposed materials that probably make the "dark matter" surrounding our own and other galaxies. It was suggested that MACHOs may be detected through the gravitational microlensing effect which can be identified from the light curves of background stars. The objective of this project is two-fold, namely, (i) identification of new classes of variable stars and (ii) detection of microlensing events. In this paper, we present the major characteristics of the time series astronomical data, data preprocessing techniques to process these time series, and some domain-specific techniques to separate candidate variable stars from the nonvariant ones. We discuss the use of the Fourier model to represent the time series and the k-means based clustering method to classify variable stars. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A methodology for the delineation of soil mapping units in an alluvial plain of Western Peloponnese, Greece, was investigated. A detailed soil survey of an area of 300 ha was used to obtain the basic soil data for evaluating the performance of the proposed methodology. The methodology consists of the following steps: (a) data collection from borings and representative soil profiles, (b) definition of the soil mapping units in the study area, (c) determination of the range of the diagnostic variables for each mapping unit from field observations and statistical analysis of the analytical data from representative soil profiles, (d) determination of the class of each diagnostic variable by observation at a network of boring points, (e) subjective assignment of numerical values to soil variables at the bore points, (f) estimation of the Values of each soil variable at the points of a regular grid using the interpolation methods kriging and inverse squared distance, (g) application of the fuzzy set theory to the interpolated data and the production of thematic fuzzy maps, and (h) validation of the results through a number of independent test borings. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology can produce soil maps of recent alluvial plains with acceptable accuracy and cost.

J	Krishna, K; Murty, MN				Krishna, K; Murty, MN			Genetic K-means algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						clustering; genetic algorithms; global optimization; K-means algorithm; unsupervised learning		In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) that finds a globally optimal partition of a given data into a specified number of clusters. GA's used earlier in clustering employ either an expensive crossover operator to generate valid child chromosomes from parent chromosomes or a costly fitness function or both. To circumvent these expensive operations, we hybridize GA with a classical gradient descent algorithm used in clustering viz., K-means algorithm. Hence, the name genetic K-means algorithm (GKA). We define K-means operator, one-step of K-means algorithm, and use it in GKA as a search operator instead of crossover. We also define a biased mutation operator specific to clustering called distance-based-mutation. Using finite Markov chain theory, we prove that the GKA converges to the global optimum. It is observed in the simulations that GKA converges to the best known optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result. It is also observed that GKA searches faster than some of the other evolutionary algorithms used for clustering.

J	Jahng, SG; Hong, HK; Choi, JS				Jahng, SG; Hong, HK; Choi, JS			Simulation of Rosette scanning infrared seeker and counter-countermeasure using K-means algorithm	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Rosette scan; seeker; counter-countermeasure; countermeasure; K-means algorithm	FIELD-OF-VIEW; DYNAMIC SIMULATION; RETICLE; DESIGN	The rosette-scanning infrared seeker (RSIS) is a tracker that a single infrared detector scans the total field of view (TFOV) in a rosette pattern, and then produces 2D image about a target. Since the detected image has various shapes in accordance with the target position in the TFOV, it is difficult to determine a precise target position from the obtained image. In order to track this type of target, therefore, we propose an efficient tracking method using the K-means algorithm (KMA). The KMA, which classifies image clusters and calculates their centers, is used to cope with an countermeasure (CM) such as an IR flare. To evaluate the performance of the RSIS using the KMA dynamically, we simulate the RSIS in the various conditions, and discuss the tracking results.

J	Trigo, IF; Davies, TD; Bigg, GR				Trigo, IF; Davies, TD; Bigg, GR			Objective climatology of cyclones in the Mediterranean region	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; CYCLOGENESIS; VARIABILITY; TRACKS	An objective cyclone detection and tracking analysis is performed over an Is-yr period, for the Mediterranean basin. The high-resolution (1.125 degrees x 1.125 degrees grid) European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data used in this study proved to be particularly suitable for the detection and tracking techniques and to identify subsynoptic-scale Mediterranean lows, which have often been underestimated in previous studies. The major characteristics of Mediterranean cyclones are examined and compared with other Northern Hemisphere depressions. Both cyclogenesis and cyclolysis regions are identified in the domain of study. In addition, characteristics of Mediterranean depressions, such as cyclone duration and intensity, as well as their persistence throughout the year, are shown to be quite variable for different formation areas. Overall, the regions where cyclogenesis is mainly controlled by topography, like the Gulf of Genoa and south of the Atlas Mountains, seem to generally account for the most intense events. Finally, a statistical analysis based on a k-means clustering procedure summarizes trajectory information obtained from the Ig-yr climatology. The method proved to be efficient in grouping cyclone paths from similar cyclogenesis regions and with similar characteristics of movement, showing generally more clusters in the western Mediterranean than in the eastern part of the basin.

The method is applied using household survey data for Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, First, principal component analysis is used to extract a set of factors from the original variables for both local government area (LGA) data and a combined set of LGA and individual dwelling data. Second, factor scores are calculated and cluster analysis is used to determine the composition of housing submarkets. Third, hedonic price equations are estimated for each city as a whole, for a priori classifications of submarkets, and for submarkets defined by the cluster analysis. The weighted mean squared errors from the hedonic equations are used to compare alternative classifications of submarkets. In Melbourne, the classification derived from a K means clustering procedure on individual dwelling data is significantly better than classifications derived from all other methods of constructing housing submarkets.. In some other cases, the statistical analysis produces submarkets that are better than the a priori classification, but the improvement is not significant. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

A principal component axis of a random vector X is self-consistent if each point on the axis corresponds to the mean of X given that X projects orthogonally onto that point. A large class of symmetric multivariate distributions are examined in terms of self-consistency of principal component subspaces. Elliptical distributions are characterized by the preservation of self-consistency of principal component axes after arbitrary linear transformations. A "lack-of-fit" test is proposed that tests for self-consistency of a principal axis. The test is applied to two real datasets.

The methods were evaluated in the diagnosis of female urinary incontinence in terms of prediction accuracy of classifiers, on the basis of patient data. The best methods were discriminant analysis, logistic regression, C4.5 a nd Galactica. Practically no statistically significant differences existed between the prediction accuracy of these classification methods. We consider that machine-learning systems C4.5 and Galactica are preferable for automatic construction of medical decision aids, because they can cope with missing data values directly and can present a classifier in a comprehensible form. Galactica performed nearly as well as C4.5, The results are in agreement with the results of earlier research, indicating that genetic algorithms are a competitive method for constructing classifiers from medical data.

J	Digalakis, VV				Digalakis, VV			Online adaptation of hidden Markov models using incremental estimation algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						hidden Markov models; incremental estimation; online adaptation; speech recognition	SPEAKER ADAPTATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	The mismatch that frequently occurs between the training and testing conditions of an automatic speech recognizer can be efficiently reduced by adapting the parameters of the recognizer to the testing conditions. Two measures that characterize the performance of an adaptation algorithm are the speed with which it adapts to the new conditions, and its computational complexity, which is important for online applications. Recently, a family of adaptation algorithms for continuous-density hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognizers have appeared that are based on constrained reestimation of the distribution parameters. These algorithms are fast, in the sense that a small amount of data is required for adaptation. They are, however, based on reestimating the model parameters using the batch version of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The multiple iterations required for the EM algorithm to converge make these adaptation schemes computationally expensive and not suitable for online applications, since multiple passes through the adaptation data are required. In this paper, we show how incremental versions of the EM and the segmental k-means algorithm can be used to improve the convergence of these adaptation methods, reduce the computational requirements, and make them suitable for online applications.

The Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Parent Rating Scales for Children (PRS-C) norming data were collected for 2029 6- to 11-year-old children at 116 sites representing various regions of the United States. The PRS-C has 130 items that are rated by the parent on a 4-point scale of frequency, ranging from " never " to " almost always ". The Ward method of cluster analysis was used to identify the initial centroids or cluster seeds in this norming sample. An iterative clustering method, a K-means procedure, was used to refine the Ward cluster solution. A nine-cluster solution was selected based on both rational and empirical considerations. The resulting clusters were labeled adapted, physical complaints/worry, average, well-adapted, minimal problems, attention problems, internalizing, general psychopathology-severe, and disruptive behavior problems. The nine-cluster solution is similar to those of Achenbach (1991), Thompson, Kronenberger, and Curry (1989), and other researchers. At the same time, some significant differences exist. The resulting typology points the way toward future cluster studies of child psychopathology and normal behavioral development by delineating additional research and theoretical directions.

We discuss the basic requirements on a clustering algorithm for fMRI data. It is shown that with respect to easy adjustment of the quantization error and reproducibility of the results DCA outperforms the standard h-means algorithm. In contrast to currently used clustering methods for fMRI, like k-means or fuzzy k-means, DCA extracts the appropriate number and initial shapes of representative signal time courses from data properties during run time. With DCA we simultaneously calculate a two-dimensional projection of cluster centers (MDS) and data points for online visualization of the results, We describe the new DCA method and show for the well-studied motor task that it detects cortical activation loci and provides additional information by discriminating different shapes and phases of hemodynamic responses. Robustness of activity detection is demonstrated with respect to repeated DCA runs and effects of different data preprocessing are shown. As an example of how DCA enables further analysis we examined activation onset times. In areas SMA, M1, and S1 simultaneous and sequential activation (in the given order) was found.

The data set analyzed consists of usages of brands (product category: household cleaners) in different usage situations. The proposed feedforward neural network model results in a two Segment solution that is confirmed by appropriate tests. On the other hand, the K-means algorithm Fails in discovering any somewhat stronger cluster structure. Classification of respondents on the basis of external criteria is better for the neural network solution. We also demonstrate the managerial interpretability of the network results.

J	Dvoenko, SD				Dvoenko, SD			Modeling of behavior and intelligence - A nonhierarchical divisive clustering algorithm	AUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL			English	Article								In cluster analysis, the choice of the number of clusters is a rather complicated problem. In the design of clustering algorithms, either the number of clusters is predefined or some partitioning method is specified in which the final decision is taken on the basis of heuristic criteria. Two distinct classification techniques, hierarchical algorithms and isodata nonhierarchical algorithms, are generally used. A K-mean clustering algorithm employing both these techniques is designed. It generates a sequence of clusters that usually do not form a hierarchy. The properties of the sequence permit the exclusion of partitions that are obviously not optimal. The final choice is made from the remaining clusterings. A relationship between the designed algorithm and the shortest-open-path graph-cutting algorithm is established. The algorithm a's applied to study the data on irises.	Tula State Univ, Tula, Russia	Dvoenko, SD (reprint author), Tula State Univ, Tula, Russia.		Timofeeva, Marina/P-3391-2014				Aivazyan S.

We propose here a genetic algorithm (GA) for performing cluster analysis. GAs have been used profitably in a variety of contexts in which it is either impractical or impossible to directly solve for a globally optimal solution to complex numerical problems. In the present case, our GA clustering technique attempted to maximize a variance-ratio (VR) based goodness-of-fit criterion defined in terms of external cluster isolation and internal cluster homogeneity. Although our GA-based clustering algorithm cannot guarantee to recover the cluster solution that exhibits the global maximum of this fitness function; it does explicitly work toward this goal (in marked contrast to existing clustering algorithms, especially hierarchical agglomerative ones such as Ward's method). Using both constrained and unconstrained simulated datasets, Monte Carlo results showed that in some conditions the genetic clustering algorithm did indeed surpass the performance of conventional clustering techniques (Ward's and K-means) in terms of an internal (VR) criterion. Suggestions for future refinement and study are offered. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kramer, A; Konigsberg, LW				Kramer, A; Konigsberg, LW			Recognizing species diversity among large-bodied hominoids: a simulation test using missing data finite mixture analysis	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION			English	Article						species recognition; paleospecies; finite mixture analysis; missing data replacement; k-means; craniometrics; Pongo; Gorilla; Pan; Homo	ESTIMATING SEXUAL DIMORPHISM; HOMO-ERECTUS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; VARIABILITY; COEFFICIENT; CLADISTICS; STATISTICS; HYPOTHESIS; COMPONENTS; VALUES	A persistent problem in paleoanthropology is the recognition of intra-vs. inter-specific differences within fossil samples. Exacerbating this situation is the often fragmentary nature of the fossils themselves, thus precluding rote applications of many multivariate approaches designed for complete case analyses. In this paper we apply finite mixture analysis to samples of large-bodied hominoids to test this procedure's efficacy in clustering individuals by species without a priori knowledge of group membership. In addition, we stochastically remove individual specimens and measurements,, simulating small, incomplete fossil samples, and re-apply the finite mixture procedure to test how often it correctly assigns these "fragmentary" specimens. Finite mixture analysis can be highly accurate, even when confronted with small sample sizes and missing data. For example, a combination of 124 chimpanzees and humans are correctly identified in one analysis, and the accuracy drops only 2% to become 98% when the total sample size is reduced to 16 and missing data patterns are applied. In comparisons to better known methods that have been used to recognize groups in the fossil record, such as k-means, the benefits of finite mixture analysis are readily apparent. First, k-means is unable to accommodate missing data, an obvious deficiency when investigating the fossil record. Second, in direct comparisons of their ability to accurately assign "unknowns" to taxa, finite mixture performed at least as well as, and often better than, k-means in our analyses. A potential test that can be used to identify species in the fossil record, derived from comparisons of results generated from a general vs. a restricted (isometry-corrected) finite mixture analysis, is presented.

Four different methods are evaluated for the process of segmentation of the objects of interest: The K-means clustering algorithm, the fuzzy K-means (FKM) algorithm, self-organizing maps (SOMs) and seeded region growing algorithm. The technique of active surface is then subsequently applied to refine the segmentation results, employing a deformable generalised cylinder as geometric primitive. The final ventricular models are presented in VRML 2.0 format. The same process is repeated for all the 3D volumes of the cardiac cycle. The radial displacement between end systole and end diastole is calculated for each point of the active surface and is encoded in colour on the VRML vertex, using the RGB colour model. Using the VRML 2.0 specifications, morphing is performed showing all cardiac phases in real time. The expert has the ability to view the objects and interact with them using a simple internet browser. Preliminary results of normal and abnormal cases indicate that very important pathological situations (such as infarction) can be visualised and thus easily diagnosed and localised with the assistance of the proposed technique.

Structured diagnostic interviews were conducted on 443 headache sufferers from a community sample, which was randomly split to allow replication. Hierarchical cluster analysis of symptoms in both subsamples revealed two distinct (P<.001) clusters: (1) unilateral pulsating pain, pain aggravated by activity, and photophobia and phonophobia, and (2) bilateral pressing/tightening pain, mild to moderate intensity, and absence of nausea/vomiting. These clusters were consistent with IHS migraine and tension-type classifications, respectively. Replication using a non-hierarchical clustering technique, k-means cluster analysis, revealed a migrainelike patient cluster, reflecting more frequent pulsating, unilateral pain; more severe pain; and pain aggravated by activity; nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. A tensionlike patient cluster,vas also identified, reflecting more frequent pressing/tightening pain, mild to moderate pain, bilateral location, and absence of nausea/vomiting. These patient clusters were consistent across subsamples. International Headache Society diagnoses corresponded with classification based upon statistically derived clusters (P<.001),These results indicate that headache symptoms cluster empirically in a manner consistent with IHS criteria fbr migraine and tension-type headaches. Criterion overlap problems regarding pain intensity and duration were identified. Overall, these data support migraine and tension-type headache as distinct entities, and provide support for the IHS diagnostic criteria with minor modifications.

J	Zheng, GL; Billings, SA				Zheng, GL; Billings, SA			An enhanced sequential fuzzy clustering algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article							VECTOR QUANTIZATION	A sequential fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed based on a modification to the objective function used in the fuzzy competitive learning algorithm. The new learning algorithm can be used to enhance the excitation on the non-winning centroids and to reduce the excitation on the winning centroid when the fuzziness parameter is close to unit. The excitation on the winning centroid can be further reduced when the input pattern is far away from the winning centroid. An excitation-inhibition mechanism can also be introduced into the learning such that the non-winning centroids move towards the input pattern while the winning centroid moves away from the input pattern when the winning centroid is far away from the input pattern. The new algorithm overcomes the problem of underutilization of centroids found in the k-means or related clustering algorithms and in the fuzzy competitive learning algorithm when the fuzziness parameter is close to unity. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the IRIS data set.

J	Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A; Matran, C				Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A; Matran, C			Asymptotics for trimmed k-means and associated tolerance zones	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						asymptotics; clustering methods; distribution freeness; robustness; tolerance zones; trimmed k-means	PRINCIPAL POINTS; DISTRIBUTIONS	Impartial trimming procedures with respect to general 'penalty' functions, di, have been recently introduced in Cuesta-Albertos et al. (1997. Arm. Statist. 25, 553-576) in the (generalized) k-means framework. Under regularity assumptions, for real-valued samples, we obtain the asymptotic normality both of the impartial trimmed k-mean estimator (Phi(x) = x(2)) and of the impartial trimmed k-median estimator (Phi(x) = x). In spite of the additional complexity coming from the several groups setting, the empirical quantile methodology used in Butler (1982. Arm. Statist. 10, 197-204) for the LTS estimator (and subsequently in Tableman (1994. Statist. Probab. Lett. 19, 387-398) for the LTAD estimator) also works in our framework. Besides their relevance for the robust estimation of quantizers, our results open the possibility of considering asymptotic distribution-free tolerance regions, constituted by unions of intervals, for predicting a future observation, generalizing the idea in Butler (1982).

J	Brown, JC				Brown, JC			Computer identification of musical instruments using pattern recognition with cepstral coefficients as features	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							TIMBRES; TRANSFORM	Cepstral coefficients based on a constant Q transform have been calculated for 28 short (1-2 s) oboe sounds and 52 short saxophone sounds. These were used as features in a pattern analysis to determine for each of these sounds comprising the test set whether it belongs to the oboe or to the sax class. The training set consisted of longer sounds of 1 min or more for each of the instruments. A k-means algorithm was used to calculate clusters for the training data, and Gaussian probability density functions were formed from the mean and variance of each of the clusters. Each member of the test set was then analyzed to determine the probability that it belonged to each of the two classes; and a Bayes decision rule was invoked to assign it to one of the classes. Results have been extremely good and are compared to a human perception experiment identifying a subset of these same sounds. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America. [S0001-4966(99)00703-1].

Early versions of the river invertebrate prediction and classification system (RIVPACS) used TWINSPAN to classify reference sites based on the macro-invertebrate fauna, followed by multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) for prediction of the fauna to be expected at new sites from environmental variables. This paper examines some alternative methods for the initial site classification and a different technique for prediction. 2. A data set of 410 sites from RIVPACS II was used for initial screening of seventeen alternative methods of site classification. Multiple discriminant analysis was used to predict classification group from environmental variables. 3. Five of the classification-prediction systems which showed promise were developed further to facilitate prediction of taxa at species and at Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) family level. 4. The predictive capability of these new systems, plus RTVPACS II, was tested on an independent data set of 101 sites from locations throughout Great Britain. 5. Differences between the methods were often marginal but two gave the most consistently reliable outputs: the original TWINSPAN method, and the ordination method semi-strong hybrid multidimensional scaling (SSH) followed by K-means clustering. 6. Logistic regression, an alternative approach to prediction which does not require the prior development of a classification system, was also examined. Although its performance fell within the range offered by the other five systems tested, it conveyed no advantages over them. 7. This study demonstrated that several different multivariate methods were suitable for developing a reliable system for predicting expected probability of occurrence of taxa. This is because the prediction system involves a weighted average smoothing across site groupings. 8 Hence, the two most promising procedures for site classification, coupled to MDA, were both used in the exploratory analyses for RIVPACS III development, which utilized over 600 reference sites.

The morphological features considered include many common measures (such as dendritic radii and the number of dendritic segments) and three new quantifiable measures: 1) the area of influence of the dendritic tree as calculated in an operator-independent manner by using Minkowski sausages; 2) the complexity of tortuousity along each dendritic segment as represented by the 3D bending energy; and 3) the coverage factor as calculated by using the Bouligand-Minkowski fractal dimension, which is more accurate than the commonly used box-counting algorithm. We evaluated four clustering approaches including the k-means and Ward's hierarchical clustering methods. By using these highly quantifiable methods to group the cells into classes, the present work has extended and reassessed the analysis of 68 ganglion cells from the tiger salamander previously classified by Toris et al. ([1995] J. Comp. Neurol. 352:535-559). Though substantiating the number of classes (5) previously proposed by Toris et al., the results obtained here indicate a number of discrepancies among the members of each class, especially regarding the border between two classes, originally called the medium simple and the medium complex cells. Such an effect has motivated the proposal of new names for the medium simple and medium complex classes, now called small highly complex and medium cells, respectively. Also included in the present article are comprehensive statistics of each class, correlations among all the adopted shape measures, and examples of the cells from each class. The resultant classes that emerged were compared using their electrotonic characteristics and physiological profiles. J. Comp. Neurol. 404:33-51, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The widespread use of multimedia information (images, video, audio etc.) makes necessary applications capable of storing, and therefore retrieving, it. Information extracted from images is usually complex and high dimensional. The extraction of non-textual low-level indexing features from images is now a research field, and this process principally suffers because of the computational cost of the high dimensionality of those features. A new way to classify and match low-level features extracted from images, for retrieval purposes, is presented in this paper. M-tree and R-tree structures are used, as well as an incremental version of the k-means classification algorithm. This set of algorithms is used to solve the problem of low performance when retrieving previously catalogued images.

The data were employed in the k-means clustering algorithm after grey-level thresholding, and the resulting normal distribution parameters were used in a maximum likelihood classification. In order to achieve an unbiased classification result, post-classificational manual interpretation was used for selecting the best possible class combination with the aid of ground data and field checks. Wind activity was found on early Holocene anchored inland dunes, glaciofluvial deposits, and in localised areas on fell slopes. Aeolian processes are mainly operative in the mountain birch woodland and treeless tundra north of the Scots Pine forest zone. Sixty-three current localities with a total area of deflated surfaces of circa 10 km(2) (1000 ha) were identified in the study region.

Using an imaging spectrograph, hyper-spectral signatures of vegetation samples are gathered online. A classifier not only distinguishes soil and vegetation but also recognises different vegetation classes. As the reflectance of plants varies with plant stress, depending on the unknown field situation, a representative set of field samples must be collected for training on a specific field. Manually collecting a representative set of samples requires user-knowledge and time and is not economically feasible. Semi-supervised labelling based on k-means clustering, enables a system to automatically collect, label and train the classifier for a set of hyper-spectral data samples. Using this system to selectively spray on weeds only would result in acceptable weed hit rates of 89% or higher and significant reductions in herbicide use (15-67%), depending on the actual weed density in the field.

This algorithm discovers automatically clusters in numerical data without prior knowledge of a possible number of classes, without any initial partition, and without complex parameter settings. It uses the stochastic and exploratory principles of an ant colony with the deterministic and heuristic principles of the K-mean algorithm. Ants move on a 2D board and may load or drop objects. Dropping an object on an existing heap of objects depends on the similarity between this object and the heap. The K-means algorithm improves the convergence of the ant colony clustering. We repeat two stochastic/deterministic steps and introduce hierarchical clustering on heaps of objects and not just objects. We also use other refinements such as an heterogeneous population of ants to avoid complex parameters settings, and a local memory in each ant. We have applied this algorithm on standard databases and we get very good results compared to the K-means and ISODATA algorithms.

Gene expression of tissue samples can be quantitatively analyzed by hybridizing fluor-tagged mRNA to targets on a cDNA microarray. Ratios of average expression level arising from co-hybridized normal and pathological samples are extracted via image segmentation, thus the gene expression pattern are obtained. The gene expression in a given biological process may provide a fingerprint of the sample development, or response to certain treatment. We propose a K-mean based algorithm in which gene expression levels fluctuate in parallel will be clustered together. The resulting cluster suggests some functional relationships between genes, and some known genes belongs to a unique functional classes shall provide indication for unknown genes in the same clusters.

By replacing the Euclidean distance in the objective function other cluster shapes than the simple (hyper-)spheres of the fuzzy c-means algorithm can be detected, for instance ellipsoids, lines or shells of circles and ellipses. We propose a modified distance function that is based on the dot product and allows to detect a new kind of cluster shape and also lines and (hyper-)planes.

Model order information of this type is required by several pattern recognition applications. The BM technique provides a novel approach to this parameter estimation problem and is comparable in terms of both accuracy and computations to other popular mode estimation techniques currently found in the literature and automatic target recognition applications. This paper explains the methodology used in the BM approach to mode estimation. Also, this paper quickly reviews other common mode estimation techniques and describes the empirical investigation used to explore the relationship of the BM technique to other mode estimation techniques. Specifically, the accuracy and computational efficiency of the BM technique are compared quantitatively to the a mixture of Gaussian (MOG) approach and a k-means approach to model order estimation. The stopping criteria of the MOG and k-means techniques is the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).

The harvesting of fruit, until recently, has been performed manually and is quite labor intensive. An automatic robot harvesting system that uses machine vision to locate and extract the fruit would free the agricultural industry from the ups and downs of the labor market. The environment in which robotic fruit harvesters must work presents many challenges due to the inherent variability from one location to the next. This paper takes a step towards this goal by outlining a machine vision algorithm that detects and accurately locates oranges from a color image of an orange tree. Previous work in this area has focused on differentiating the orange regions from the rest of the picture and not locating the actual oranges themselves. Failure to locate the oranges, however, leads to a reduced number of successful pick attempts. This paper presents a new approach for orange region segmentation in which the circumference of the individual oranges as well as partially occluded oranges are located. Accurately defining the circumference of each orange allows a robotic harvester to cut the stem of the orange by either scanning the top of the orange with a laser or by directing a robotic arm towards the stem to automatically cut it. A modified version of the K-means algorithm is used to initially segment the oranges from the canopy of the orange tree. Morphological processing is then used to locate occluded oranges and an iterative circle finding algorithm is used to define the circumference of the segmented oranges.

This paper describes an algorithm which combines the calculation of the centres and variances of the Gaussian nodes to improve the response of a RBF neural network. The selection of the centres is made using a modified Version of the K-means algorithm and the variances are based on the sample variance-covariance matrices of the input values associated with the centres. Applications to classification and function approximation problems are considered.

The high resolution reflectance imagery collected seasonally as part of the Boreal Eco-system and Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) presents an opportunity to increase overall understanding of this complicated interplay. A research project is currently underway to compare and contrast two methods of separating understory from overstory in this imagery, one "directly" through classification and the other "indirectly" through end-member analysis of a high spectral resolution data set. Winter imagery is investigated to assess the best method(s) of classification into crown and snow understory. Simple thresholds are considered, followed by unsupervised and supervised classification tests by variation of scene type, tree-type, number of classes and number of wavelength channels. K-Means (Iterative Optimization) Clustering reveals that less than four classes is insufficient to effectively separate the land-cover classes for both tree-types investigated and that more than four classes leads to trivial division of existing classes. Results from this unsupervised classification are used to build training areas for Maximum-Likelihood supervised classifications. JM (Bhattacharya) distances are calculated, and it is shown that three channels provide optimum separability for both tree-types. A working methodology for winter image classification is proposed.

We emphasize the close relationship between the NN approach and classical clustering methods. In particular, we show how SOMs are derived by stochastic approximation from a new continuous version (K-criterion) of a finite-sample clustering criterion proposed by Anouar et al. (1997). In this framework we determine the asymptotic behaviour of Kohonen's method, design a new finite-sample version of the SOM approach of the k-means type, and propose various generalizations along the lines of classical 'regression clustering', 'principal component clustering', and 'maximum-likelihood clustering'.

However, in many cases approximative sets of different types are of interest. For example, approximation of a distribution by circles is important in allocating communication stations, the circles being interpreted as working areas of the stations. The paper covers two related topics. First we propose a heuristic algorithm to find k circles of a given radius r that fit with the planar data set. Then we analyse the problem of consistency: does a sequence of sample-based sets of optimal circles converge to the class of optimal circles for the population? The positive answer is given for arbitrary finite-dimensional normed linear spaces.

Because large numbers of images are being processed, the emphasis is on rapid computation, The algorithm achieves computational efficiency by dividing the image into bins of a pre-chosen size and performing a binary opening operation for each bin with a 2x2 structuring element on each bin having sufficient pixels within the threshold range. Thresholding can be either above a high backscatter level to highlight bright proud objects or below a low backscatter level to highlight low backscatter shadow-like objects. The morphological opening highlights contiguous pixels within the threshold range without distortion and eliminates objects smaller than the structuring element. A connected component algorithm was used to locate ail identified contiguous pixels and to tabulate their centroids and sizes. The identified objects were then screened as possible targets by checking the proximity of bright and dark objects within some threshold radius and (optionally) chosen direction of each other. The chosen targets were either graphed (in interactive mode) or archived (in batch mode). Algorithm performance was evaluated by comparison with other target identification algorithms and was found to be compatible. An advanced interactive mode allows using different structuring elements and different morphological operations for possible improvement of the batch mode algorithm. The algorithm, while potentially effective for target identification, is primarily useful for false target identification. By operating on standard survey images the algorithm can isolate areas of potential false target proliferation. Spatial statistical methods, based on k-nearest neighbor distributions and hierarchical and k-means clustering were used to delineate regions of high false target density within: the survey area.

After critical analysis of Bart Kosko's DCL-AVQ + FAM neuro-fuzzy system, we developed our Straitjacket + F-wing system. Straitjacket neural system is an improved version of Kohonen's feature mapping according to convergence and termination conditions. F-wing fuzzy system bases on the feature map produced by Straitjacket and provides faster and more exact estimator interface than Bart Kosko's FAM, using fuzzy wing functions instead of fuzzy hyperpyramids. At the end of the paper we perform a test on artificial database comparing the efficiency of our approach with Kosko's system, discriminant analysis, hierarchic and K-mean clustering.

It belongs to the hard and K-means vector quantization groups. We started from the definition of a new mathematical concept we called utility of a codeword. Although some previous authors introduced a homonymous utility concept, our meaning and computational complexity are totally different. The utility we introduced permits us to identify well in which cases the LEG algorithm fails to find global optimum codebooks. Starting from a mathematical analysis of the properties of the utility, we propose a sub-optimal strategy that has a very low time complexity. Our results show that with an overhead of no more than 5% in respect of the LEG algorithm, we succeed in finding better results above all in complex application fields, as for example when the number of codewords increases.

The MARS project was designated to combine a variety of approaches and to develop a set of methods for the employment of biological indicators in pollution monitoring and environmental quality assessment. In total, nine ship cruises to four coastal sampling sites were conducted; 765 fish and 384 mussel samples were analysed for biological and chemical parameters. Additional information on the chemical background at the sampling sites was derived from sediment samples, collected at each of the four sampling sites. Based on the available chemical data in sediments and black mussel (Mytilus edulis) a pollution gradient between the selected sites, was established. The chemical body burden of flounder (Platichthys flesus) from these sites, though, did not reflect this gradient equally clear. In contrast, the biological information derived from measurements in fish samples displayed significant a regional as well as a temporal pattern. A multivariate bioindicator data matrix was evaluated employing a factor analysis model to identify relations between selected biological indicators, and to improve the understanding of a regional and temporal component in the parameter response. In a second approach, applying the k-means algorithm on the data matrix, two significantly different clusters of samples, characterised by the current health status of the fish, were extracted. Using this classification a temporal, and in the second order, a less pronounced spatial effect was evident. Tn particular, during July 1996, a clear sign of deteriorating environmental conditions was extracted from the biological data matrix.

In this paper other regional approaches have been tested in the flysh region in northern Slovakia. Sub-regions were constructed using hydrologic reasoning based on basin properties and K-means clustering of 17 physiographic basin characteristics and annual summer flood statistics from 43 basins. Regional formulae for the computation of the mean annual summer flood and its standard deviation were derived. Comparison of flood quantiles computed from data and from the formulae showed similar results for all tested methods. The practical applicability of the derived formulae is limited and possible reasons for this are discussed.

In this paper, we present a model in which the pdf is expressed as the convolution of two densities. We focus on the special case where one of the convolved densities is a M-Gaussian mixture, and the other is a mixture of N impulses. We present the reestimation formulae for the parameters of the M x N convolutional model, and suggest two ways for initializing them, the residual K-Means approach, and the deconvolution from a standard HMM with MN Gaussians per state using a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal assignment of Gaussians. Both methods result in a compact representation that requires only O(M + N) storage space for the model parameters, and O(MN) time for training and decoding. We explain how the decoding time can be reduced to O(M + kN), where k < M. Finally results are shown on the 1996 Hub-rf Development test, demonstrating that a 32 x 2 convolutional model can achieve performance comparable to that of a standard 64-Gaussian per state model.

The extended model (a) focuses on the conditional joint distribution of state durations given the length of utterances, rather than on state transition probabilities; (b) extends the dependency of observation densities to current, as well as neighboring states; and (c) introduces a local averaging procedure to smooth the outcome associated to transitions from successive states. A set of efficient iterative algorithms, based on segmental K-means and Iterative Conditional Modes, for the implementation of the extended model, is also presented. In applications to the recognition of segmented digits spoken over the telephone, the extended model achieved about 23% reduction in the recognition error rate, when compared to the performance of HMMs.	Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA	Li, JY (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.

First, image sequence analysis is used to estimate the shape and motion parameters of the person facing the camera. The foreground object is segmented in a number of subobjects, in order to identify the facial region. For this purpose, we propose the novel procedure of K-Means with connectivity constraint algorithm as a general segmentation algorithm combining several types of information including intensity, motion and compactness. In this algorithm, the use of spatiotemporal regions is introduced since a number of frames is analyzed simultaneously and as a result the same region is present in consequent frames. Based on this information, a 3D ellipsoid is adapted to the person's face using an efficient and robust algorithm. The rigid 3D motion is estimated next using a least median of squares approach. Finally a VRML file is created containing all the above estimated information; this file may be viewed by using any VRML 2.0 compliant browser.

This paper presents three applications for hyper-spectral data streams, vector quantization, region autofocus, and K-means clustering, on the SIMD Pixel Processor (SIMPil). In SIMPil, art image sensor array (focal plane) is integrated on top of a SIMD computing layer to provide direct coupling between sensors and processors, alleviating I/O bandwidth bottlenecks while maintaining low power consumption and portability. Simulation results with sustained operation throughputs of 500-1500 Gops/sec support real-time performances and promote focal plane processing on SIMPil.

We suggest exploiting the separability of color information which, represented ina suitable 3D space, may be "projected" onto a 2D chromatic subspace and onto a ID luminance subspace. One can first compute the chromaticity coordinates (mu',upsilon') of colors and find representative clusters in such a 2D space, by using a 2D k-means algorithm, and then associate these clusters with appropriate luminance values, by using a ID k-means algorithm, a simple dimensionally reduced version of the previous one. Experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our technique is reported.

For a reliable and robust inference process, the unsupervised learning algorithm has to guarantee that the extracted structures are typical for the data source. In particular, it has to reject all structures where the inference is dominated by the arbitrariness of the sample noise and which, consequently, can be characterized as overfitting in unsupervised learning. This paper summarizes an inference principle called Empirical Risk Approximation which allows us to quantitatively measure the overfitting effect and to derive a criterion as a saveguard against it. The crucial condition for learning is met if (i) the empirical risk of learning uniformly converges towards the expected risk and if (ii) the hypothesis class retains a minimal variety for consistent inference. Parameter selection of learnable data structures is demonstrated for the case of k-means clustering and Monte Carlo simulations are presented to support the selection principle.

The association algorithms are chosen in such a rt cry, that they span very different methods to carry out measurement association. The paper includes brief descriptions of the association algorithms with the modification proposed by the authors for the angle-only estimation. The performance evaluation is based on a versatile set of figures of merit. This way not only estimation errors bur also some track stability characteristics can be taken into account in the comparison.

In this paper, we argue the case for using neural networks as a viable data mining tool that can provide statistical insights and models from large data-sets. We demonstrate how Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps, an unsupervised learning neural network paradigm, can be efficaciously used for data mining purposes, in particular for data clustering applications. We show that high-dimensional data can be projected to a lower dimension and that data can be clustered together whilst preserving essential information. The Kohonen Map based data-clustering technique is applied to the 1991 World Bank social economics indicators, to show how multi-dimensional data sets can be reduced to two-dimensional (feature) maps, manifesting clusters of similar data items.

There are no generally accepted objective criteria for choosing a suitable segmentation currently. Wallace introduced the Minimum Message Length (MML) Principle as an objective method for comparing different models for explaining a body of data. In this paper, we use the ML principle to provide an objective criterion for the comparison of different image segmentations of the same image. This is done by constructing an MML two-part message for the image. Experimen tal results are presented for different segmentation schemes based on thresholding such as histogram thresholding, k-means clustering, an MML classifcation scheme snob, and fuzzy c-meaas. The application of a filtering technique before thresholding is also considered.

Existing algorithms that optimally solve this problem employ branch-and-bound or dynamic programming techniques. Some heuristic methods, such as K-MEANS, C-MEANS and basic ISO-DATA, offer an approximate solution. In this paper we present a genetic algorithm based solution that produces near-optimal results for clustering problems with considerably reduced execution time compared to branch-and-bound and dynamic programming techniques. In order to further reduce the execution time, a parallel implementation of genetic algorithms (called PSGA) and a distributed genetic algorithm (called DGA) are introduced. Our encoding uses a permutation of objects and we use a dynamic programming algorithm for fitness computation. All these methods are evaluated on two test problems using a network of workstations.

In the past, more traditional mathematical programming techniques have been used to address this problem, but with limited success due to its combinatorial nature. Because simulated annealing is a search-based technique, an optimal solution is not guaranteed, but past research has demonstrated that search-based heuristics can provide reasonable solutions without the difficulties associated with the more traditional formulations. In this paper, the simulated annealing methodology is used to solve a large lockbox location problem at several differing levels of cost. The results compare favourably to solutions obtained from a K-means clustering heuristic.

Under assumption of gaussian distribution of data the proposed clustering method reduces to a deterministic algorithm which appears to be an extension of the standard k-means algorithm. The robustness of the proposed method is shown on a magnetic resonance (MR) images database containing 65 volumetric (3D) images.

Traditional registration and subtraction techniques can be applied to extract temporal differences when the object is rigid or corresponding points are obvious. However, in radiological imaging, loss of the depth information, the elasticity of object, the absence of clearly defined landmarks and three-dimensional positioning differences constraint the performance of conventional registration techniques. In this paper, we propose a new method in order to detect interval changes accurately without using an image registration technique. The method is based on construction of so-called pattern histogram and comparison procedure. The pattern histogram is a graphic representation of the frequency counts of all allowable patterns in the multi-dimensional pattern vector space. K-means algorithm is employed to partition pattern vector space successively. Any differences in the pattern histograms imply that different patterns are involved in the scenes. In our experiment, a pair of chest radiographs of pneumoconiosis is employed and the changing histogram bins are visualized on both of the images. We found that the method can be used as an alternative way of temporal change detection, particularly when the precise image registration is not available.

This method will help evaluate the effects of joint preserving treatments for femoral head osteonecrosis from MR data. The disease is characterized by tissue changes (death of bone and marrow cells) within the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head. Due to the fuzzy appearance of lesion tissues and their different intensity patterns in various MR sequences, we proposed a semi-automatic multispectral segmentation of MR data introducing data constraints (anatomical and geometrical) and using a classical K-means unsupervised clustering algorithm. The method was applied on ON patient data. Results of volumetric measurements and configuration of various tissues obtained with the semiautomatic method were compared with quantitative results delineated by a trained radiologist.

J	Schmitz, GPJ; Aldrich, C				Schmitz, GPJ; Aldrich, C			Combinatorial evolution of regression nodes in feedforward neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						evolutionary algorithms; genetic algorithms; combinatorial optimisation; combinatorial search; orientated ellipsoidal radial basis functions; multilayer perceptrons; neural network design	RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; LEARNING ALGORITHM	A number of techniques exist with which neural network architectures such as multilayer perceptrons and radial basis function networks can be trained. These include backpropagation, k-means clustering and evolutionary algorithms. The latter method is particularly useful as it is able to avoid local optima in the search space and can optimise parameters for which no gradient information exists. Unfortunately, only moderately sized networks can be trained by this method, owing to the fact that evolutionary optimisation is very computationally intensive. In this paper a novel algorithm (CERN) is therefore proposed which uses a special form of combinatorial search to optimise groups of neural nodes. Oriented, ellipsoidal basis nodes optimised with CERN achieved significantly better accuracy with fewer nodes than spherical basis nodes optimised by k-means clustering. Multilayer perceptrons optimised by CERN were found to be as accurate as those trained by advanced gradient descent techniques. CERN was also found to be significantly more efficient than a conventional evolutionary algorithm that does not use a combinatorial search. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tyree, EW; Long, JA				Tyree, EW; Long, JA			The use of linked line segments for cluster representation and data reduction	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						cluster representation; density linkage; cluster analysis; data reduction; k-means		Regardless of how one searches for clusters in data, the resulting cluster structures are often modelled as their respective centroids. However, the use of centroids in this manner implies the clusters are hyperspherical in shape. If the cluster shape is not hyperspherical, using the distance between individual observations and the centroid as a metric of an observation's cluster membership can be misleading. This report proposes the use of a linked line segment based model of cluster structure which is not biased towards any particular cluster shape. The effectiveness of the linked line segment approach is demonstrated in a data reduction exercise using simulated and real world data. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

We focus on the classification of a specific type of tiles whose production can be affected by external factors, such as humidity, temperature, origin of clays and pigments. Variations on these uncontrolled factors provoke small differences in the colour and the texture of the tiles that force to classify all the production. A constant and non-subjective classification would allow avoiding devolution from customers and unnecessary stock fragmentation. The aim of this work is to simulate the human behaviour on this classification task by extracting a set of features from tile images. These features are induced by definitions from experts. To compute them we need to mix colour and texture information and to define global and local measures. In this work, we do not seek a general texture-colour representation, we only deal with textures formed by non-oriented coloured-blobs randomly distributed. New samples are classified using Discriminant Analysis functions derived form known class tile samples. The last part of the paper is devoted to explain the correction of acquired images in order to avoid time and geometry illumination changes.

Colour or multi-spectral image segmentation usually involves search and clustering techniques in a three or higher dimensional spectral space - an exercise which is considered computationally expensive. This paper presents a new colour segmentation method for colour image analysis with its application to plant leaf area measurement. A three dimensional (3D) histogram for an RGB colour image is established basing on an octree data structure. The histogram represents the colour distribution of the image in the RGB colour space on which a 3D Gaussian filter is applied to smooth out small maxima of this distribution. The colour space is then searched to find out all the major maxima. Around each maxima, a covering cube with a controlled side width is established. These maxima and covering cubes are considered to be potential colour classes. Each cube may expand according to the value of surrounding neighbours. Once enough modes and their cover cubes have been found, a k-means clustering algorithm is used to classify these maxima into a predetermined number of classes. Then, the classified modes and the colour covered by the cubes are used as training samples for a Bayes classifier which can be used to classify all the pixels in the image. A statistical relaxation method is then used as a find segmentation. This method can either be supervised or unsupervised, depending on the different requirements of specific applications. The octree data structure significantly reduces the colour space to be searched and consequently reduces computational cost. An extension of this method can also be applied to multi-spectral image analysis.

It is based on the concept of cluster as a high density region of points. The search space is modelled as a set of d-dimensional cells. A sample of points is chosen and located into the appropriate cells. Cells are iteratively split as the number of points they receive increases. The regions of the search space having a higher density of points are considered good candidates to contain the true centers of the clusters. Preliminary experimental results show the good quality of the estimated centroids, with respect to the random choice of points. The accuracy of the clusters obtained by running the K-Means algorithm with the two different initialisation techniques - random starting centers chosen uniformly on the datasets, and centers found by our method - is evaluated and the better outcome of the K-Means by using our initialisation method is shown.

The baseline method combines the terms of all the articles of each newsgroup in the training set to represent the newsgroups as single vectors. After training, the incoming news articles are classified based on their similarity to the existing newsgroup categories. We propose to use the following techniques to improve the classification performance of the baseline method: (1) use routing (classification) accuracy and the similarity values to refine the training set; (2) update the underlying term structures periodically during testing; and (3) apply k-means clustering to partition the newsgroup articles and represent each newsgroup by k vectors. Our test collection consists of the real news articles and the 519 subnewsgroups under the REC newsgroup of NETNEWS in a period of 3 months. Our experimental results demonstrate that the technique of refining the training set reduces from one-third to two-thirds of the storage. The technique of periodical updates improves the routing accuracy ranging from 20% to 100% but incurs runtime overhead. Finally, representing each newsgroup by Ic vectors (with k = 2 or 3) using clustering yields the mast significant improvement in renting accuracy, ranging from 60% to 100%, while causing only slightly higher storage requirements.

Equipment rotating at low rotational speeds presents an increased difficulty to the diagnostician [1-4, 23], since conventional vibration measuring equipment is not capable of measuring the fundamental frequency of operation. Also, component distress at low operational speeds does not necessarily show an obvious change in vibration signature. This paper presents a study of high-frequency stress wave analysis as a means of detecting the early stages of the loss of mechanical integrity in low-speed machinery. Investigations were centred on the rotating biological contactor (RBC) which is used for sewage treatment in small communities and rotates between 0.6 and 1 r/min (0.0167 Hz). The mechanism of stress wave generation was the relative movement between mating components experiencing loss of mechanical integrity, e.g. the loss of tightening torque between clamped components.

Part 1 of this work presented a study of the high-frequency stress wave (SW) technique as a means of monitoring low-speed RBCs (1 r/min). While the present authors were involved with the development of a monitoring system for RBCs, they also used the opportunity to assess the viability of the application of SWs to monitoring low-speed bearings having bore diameters ranging from 80 to 125 mm. It is concluded that the mechanism of SW generation was the relative movement between mating components experiencing a loss of mechanical integrity, e.g. the loss of tightening torque between the clamped components of RBCs.

Radial basis function neural network is used for its advantages of rapid training, generality and simplicity over feedforward backpropagation neural network. The genetic k-means clustering is used to choose the initial radial basis centers and widths for the RBFNN. An attempt is also made to study the performance of the RBFNN with the centers and widths chosen using the classical k-means clustering The results showed that genetic algorithms give global optimal centers and widths for the RBFNN. The results also indicated that this hybrid technique can be used in soil moisture classification and prediction.

J	Hammah, RE; Curran, JH				Hammah, RE; Curran, JH			On distance measures for the fuzzy K-means algorithm for joint data	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article								The analysis of data collected on rock discontinuities often requires that the data be separated into joint sets or groups. A statistical tool that facilitates the automatic identification of groups of clusters of observations in a data set is cluster analysis. The fuzzy K-means cluster technique has been successfully applied to the analysis of joint survey data. As is the case with all clustering algorithms, the results of an analysis performed with the fuzzy K-means algorithm for discontinuity data are highly dependent on the distance metric employed in the analysis. This paper explores the significant issues surrounding the choice and use of various distance measures for clustering joint survey data. It also proposes an analogue of the Mahalanobis distance norm (used for data in Euclidean space) for clustering spherical data. Sample applications showing the greater flexibility and power of the new distance measure over the originally proposed distance metric for spherical data are given in the paper.

J	Gopal, KV; Kowalski, J				Gopal, KV; Kowalski, J			Slope analysis of Auditory Brainstem Responses in children at risk of central auditory processing disorders	SCANDINAVIAN AUDIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory brainstem responses; central auditory processing disorders; slope vectors; orphological analysis; cluster technique	BINAURAL INTERACTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MIDDLE-LATENCY; STEM; ADULTS	The method of slope vectors was used to quantify Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) obtained from nine normal children and nine children at risk for central auditory processing disorders (CAPD) with language impairment, for monaural and binaural stimulation conditions. Slopes thus obtained were subjected to K-Means Cluster Analysis. Distinction between the two groups was obtained only for binaural stimulation conditions, wherein all normal children were grouped under cluster 1 with higher slope values and 6 out of 9 CAPD children were grouped under cluster 2 with lower slopes. The results suggest that there may be several subcategories among children who are found to be at risk for CAPD. One of the subcategories may comprise children who exhibit poor ABR morphology, especially during binaural stimulation conditions, which could be due to binaural interference.

The clustering techniques define the centers of the radial basis functions used by these networks. Therefore, the main purpose is to verify the influence of different clustering techniques in the performance of RBF networks. The K-Means MacQueen (4), widely used for the centers choice in RBF networks, is contrasted with others clustering techniques, such as, Optimal Adaptive K-Means Chinrungrueng and Sequin (5), DHB Duda and Hart (9), DHF Ismail et al (g), AFB Ismail and Kamel (6) and ABF Ismail and Kamel (6). The authors of these techniques claim that they are more likely to converge to an optimal or near-optimal configuration. Initially, the algorithms and a complete description of each technique are presented. Finally, using these techniques the RBF performance in a pattern recognition task is evaluated.

J	Brinkmann, WAR				Brinkmann, WAR			Application of non-hierarchically clustered circulation components to surface weather conditions: Lake Superior basin winter temperatures	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS	An S-mode principal component analysis was applied to the correlation and covariance matrices of a 700 hPa height window centered over eastern North America. The first five components were retained and rotated. K-means clustering algorithm was applied to the four solutions to generate 22 circulation types for each. Regression models were built, relating monthly mean temperature anomalies to monthly circulation type frequencies. The results were compared to those obtained in an earlier study using a correlation-based approach to classify the same data set. It was found that i) the amount of within-type variability is comparable for the two and that ii) the difference between cold and warm days of a circulation type is for both classification approaches an anomaly located to the east of the lake. A detailed analysis of this difference indicated that some information is contained in the scores for the first five principal components land could therefore be used to improve the regression results) but that some is contained in the higher order components and was thus lost. Differences in the PC scores between warm and cold days were used to divide the circulation types into warm and cold subtypes. This improved the regression results but the best results were still inferior to those that had been obtained with the correlation-based classification.

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) grouped together the SEA and many of the non-SEA subgroups, and grouped together elements with similar chemical properties. K-means cluster, correlation and principal component analyses supported the HCA. Logistic models were created using continuous, discrete and a combination of continuous and discrete elemental data in order to predict the SEA or non-SEA origin of samples. The predictive values of the models were 68-100%, the most successful models simultaneously using both continuous and discrete concentration data.

J	Chen, CW; Luo, JB; Parker, KJ				Chen, CW; Luo, JB; Parker, KJ			Image segmentation via adaptive K-mean clustering and knowledge-based morphological operations with biomedical applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						cardiac imaging; clustering; Gibbs random field; image segmentation; K-mean; morphological operations	GIBBS RANDOM-FIELDS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM	Image segmentation remains one of the major challenges in image analysis, since image analysis tasks are often constrained by how web previous segmentation is accomplished. In particular, many existing image segmentation algorithms fail to provide satisfactory results when the boundaries of the desired objects are not clearly defined by the image-intensity information. In medical applications, skilled operators are usually employed to extract the desired regions that may be anatomically separate but statistically indistinguishable. Such manual processing is subject to operator errors and biases, is extremely time consuming, and has poor reproducibility. We propose a robust algorithm for the segmentation of three-dimensional (3-D) image data based on a novel combination of adaptive K-mean clustering and knowledge-based morphological operations. The proposed adaptive K-mean clustering algorithm is capable of segmenting the regions of smoothly varying intensity distributions. Spatial constraints are incorporated in the clustering algorithm through the modeling of the regions by Gibbs random fields, Knowledge-based morphological operations are then applied to the segmented regions to identify the desired regions according to the a priori anatomical knowledge of the region-of-interest. This proposed technique has been successfully applied to a sequence of cardiac CT volumetric images to generate the volumes of left ventricle chambers at 16 consecutive temporal frames. Our final segmentation results compare favorably with the results obtained using manual outlining. Extensions of this approach to other applications can be readily made when a priori knowledge of a given object is available.

The study of H(2)1/Zn2+ = 1:1 mixture in DMF-d(7) revealed that Zn2+ is bound to the His-imidazolyl group. The results of IR experiments on the 1:1 dried material suggested that the Glu-carboxyl group still remains in the form of -COOH. Mass spectrometry showed that Zn2+ in H(2)1/Zn2+ attracts water molecules under the ionization conditions of fast atom bombardment. The temperature (T) dependence of H-1 NMR of H(2)1/Zn2+ = 1:1 in DMF-d(7), studied in the temperature range 218-323 K, revealed that the Zn2+ unit undergoes protonation and hydration at low temperatures (below 253 K). The chemical shifts (S) of the amide protons were nevertheless linearly dependent on temperature over the range 218-323 K, meaning that the 1:1 solution obeys the common reaction equilibrium and that the averaged main-chain folding of the peptide moiety is conserved. Based on this finding, the distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics analyses were carried out using the distance information on 61 H-1-H-1 pairs, extracted from the rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment on this solution (300 K). These analyses revealed that the averaged main-chain folding of the Glu-Thr-ne-His is just superimposed on that of the Zn2+ binding sites of proteases forming a single helix with the Glu carboxyl group situated in the vicinity of the His imidazole group, or is directly but distally bound to Zn2+ (in the case of gamma-COOGlu-). The hydrogen bond between gamma-COOGlu- and the H2O on Zn2+ was also found in comparatively higher energy area. Gel chromatography of the dried material obtained from H(2)1/Zn2+ = 1:1 mixture gave only [(H1)(2)Zn] (2), as a discrete compound. The coordination atoms to Zn2+ in 2 were assigned as Glu amide (N-) and His imidazole nitrogens. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

The method makes use of K-means clustering and mathematical morphology. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the computer-generated boundaries compare favourably to those drawn by human observers. The boundaries may be used in biomechanical modelling of the interaction between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket. The limb/socket interface determines the quality of prosthetic fit, therefore knowledge of this interface is important for the improvement of socket design in order to achieve patient comfort and mobility.

Our work is motivated by the fact that no measurement can be made perfect and addition of noise is not an uncommon phenomenon for telemetric data. Here we tried to show how the classical k-means algorithm should be modified to take carl of the noise/imprecision. Experimental results on Fisher's Iris data and a Nutrition data are demonstrated.

Methods: Sixty-six patients with advanced renal disease (Study B, baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 7.5-24 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) were randomly assigned to a low protein diet (L, 0.575 g/kg/d), or a very low protein diet (0.28 g/kg/d) supplemented either with a ketoacid-aminoacid mixture (diet K) or with a mixture of essential aminoacids (diet J). Thirty patients with moderate renal disease (Study A, baseline GFR 25-80 ml/min/1.73 m2) were randomly assigned to a usual protein diet (M, 1.2 g/kg/d), diet L, or diet K. Mean follow-up was 14 months. Results: In Study B, GFR decline differed among the three diets (p = 0.028). Pairwise comparisons showed that the mean +/- SE GFR decline in ml/min/mo in diet K [-0.250 +/- 0.072] was slower than in diet J [-0.533 +/- 0.074] (p = 0.008) despite similar achieved protein intakes. The mean GFR decline in diet L [-0.394 +/- 0.068] was intermediate between, and did not differ significantly from the rates of decline in the other two groups. In Study A, consistent with a hemodynamic effect, the mean GFR decline varied directly with the reduction in protein intake in diets M, L and K (p = 0.028) during the first four months of follow-up, but thereafter did not differ among the diet groups (p = 0.76). Conclusion: The study suggests that supplementation of a very low protein diet with the ketoacid-aminoacid mixture used in this feasibility study slowed the progression of advanced renal disease more than supplementation with an amino acid mixture.

J	Franca, A; Loi, A; Davies, WJ				Franca, A; Loi, A; Davies, WJ			Selection of annual ryegrass for adaptation to semi-arid conditions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						canopy temperature; drought resistance; Lolium rigidum; semi-arid environment	CANOPY TEMPERATURE; STRESS; AVOIDANCE; RESPONSES; RICE	A collection of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) from Sardinia was evaluated for the main agronomic and physiological traits in a dense sward. Five other annual ryegrasses, among selected and commercial materials, were grown as comparator. The infra-red canopy temperature was used as an indirect evaluation method of the dehydration avoidance, and selection index for adaptation to water stress during the reproductive phase. The quantitative characters were analyzed using principal component analysis and K-means clustering. The results suggested an annual ryegrass drought-resistant ideotype: tall size, wide flag leaves and spikes with a high number of spikelets. A commercial material, imported from the USA and used as a control, showed clearly different morphological and temperature traits, probably due to an improper certification as L. rigidum of seeds distributed in Italy. Two local progenies (P15 and 32) and two natural populations ('Chiaramonti' and 'Nurra') showed clear drought-resistance traits: dehydration avoidance, wide flag leaf, high seed production capability even with late flowering. It was concluded that the infrared thermometer can help in the understanding of ryegrass responses to water stress in field conditions. This methodological approach could be suggested for screening programmes aimed at introducing new forage cultivars for the semi-arid environments to the seed market. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

MS analysis used a four-dimensional MS model consisting of an estimate of the average apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC(av)), T2, proton density, and perfusion. Four classification methods were investigated: (a) multivariate gaussian (MVG); (b) k-nearest neighbor (k-NN); (c) k-means (KM); and (d) fuzzy c-means (FCM). MVG and k-NN classifiers are supervised methods requiring labeled training data to characterize the stroke lesion. Unsupervised classifiers (KM, FCM) do not require previous statistics or labeled training data, resulting in potentially greater clinical usefulness. All MS methods provided significant correlation with postmortem findings beyond the use of ADC(av), alone (partial correlation given the ADC(av) estimate: MVG, .66; k-NN, .75; HM, .68; FCM, .70). This study demonstrates that MS analysis provides an improved estimate of ischemic lesion volume over that obtained from ADC alone.

An algorithm is presented which, for a given benzenoid system G bounded by a simple circuit Z with n vertices, computes the Wiener index of G in O(n) time. Also we show that benzenoid systems have a convenient dismantling scheme, which can be derived by applying breadth-first search to their dual graphs. Our last result deals with the clustering problem of sets of atoms of benzenoids systems. We show how the k-means clustering algorithm (for points in Euclidean space) can be efficiently implemented in the case of benzenoids. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To define objectively and describe a set of clinically relevant health states that encompass the typical effects of depression on quality of life in an actual patient population. Our model was designed to facilitate the elicitation of patients' and the public's values (utilities) for outcomes of depression. Data Sources. From the depression panel of the Medical Outcomes Study. Data include scores on the IF-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) as well as independently obtained diagnoses of depression for 716 patients. Follow-up information, one year after baseline, was available for 166 of these patients. Methodology. We use k-means cluster analysis to group the patients according to appropriate dimensions of health derived from the SF-12 scores. Chi-squared and exact permutation tests are used to validate the health states thus obtained, by checking for baseline and longitudinal correlation of cluster membership and clinical diagnosis. Principal Findings. We find, on the basis of a combination of statistical and clinical criteria, that six states are optimal for summarizing the range of health experienced by depressed patients. Each state is described in terms of a subject who is typical in a sense that is articulated with our cluster-analytic approach. In all of our models, the relationship between health state membership and clinical diagnosis is highly statistically significant. The models are also sensitive to changes in patients' clinical status over time. Conclusions. Cluster analysis is demonstrably a powerful methodology for forming clinically valid health states from health status data. The states produced are suitable for the experimental elicitation of preference and analyses of costs and utilities.

J	Hammah, RE; Curran, JH				Hammah, RE; Curran, JH			Fuzzy cluster algorithm for the automatic identification of joint sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES			English	Article							VALIDITY	The task of identifying and isolating joint sess or subgroups of discontinuities existing in data collected from joins surveys is not a trivial issue and is fundamental to rock engineering design. Traditional methods for carrying put the task have been mostly based on the analysis of plots of the discontinuity orientations or their clustering. However, they suffer from their inability to incorporate the extra data columns collected and also lack in objectivity. This paper proposes a fuzzy K-means algorithm, which has the capability of using the extra information on discontinuities, as well as their orientations in exploratory data analysis. Apart from taking into account the hybrid nature of the information gathered on joints (orientation and non-orientation information), the new algorithm also makes no a priori assumptions as to the number of joint sets available. It provides validity indices (performance measures) for assessing the optimal delineation of the data set into fracture subgroups. The proposed algorithm was tested on two simulated data sets in the paper. In the first example, the data set demanded the analysis of discontinuity orientation only, and the algorithm identified both the number of joint sets present and their proper partitioning. In the second example, additional information on joint roughness was necessary to recover the true structure of the data set. The algorithm was able to converge on the correct solution when the extra information was included in the analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, CW; Kim, SY				Kim, CW; Kim, SY			Segmentation of sport center members in Seoul based on attitudes toward service quality	JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Sport center managers are likely to maximize member satisfaction by developing products or services that are tailored to the different groups of sport center members. A necessary step, then, is to identify different segments of sport center members. This study attempts to identify sport center segments in Seoul, Korea, as determined by the members' attitudes toward 33 service items. A 2-stage cluster analysis approach in which the Ward's minimum variance method is used at the first stage and the K-means method is used at the second stage was employed by using the SPSS statistical package. This yielded 5 member segments that were then analyzed by employing ANOVA or chi-square to determine how they differ in their attitudes toward service attributes, demographics, socioeconomics, motivations, and usage patterns. For those variable responses showing a difference, an analyses of the nature of differences helped profile the members in the 5 segments.

J	Huang, ZX				Huang, ZX			Extensions to the k-means algorithm for clustering large data sets with categorical values	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; cluster analysis; clustering algorithms; categorical data		The k-means algorithm is well known for its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. In this paper we present two algorithms which extend the k-means algorithm to categorical domains and domains with mixed numeric and categorical values. The k-modes algorithm uses a simple matching dissimilarity measure to deal with categorical objects, replaces the means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. With these extensions the k-modes algorithm enables the clustering of categorical data in a fashion similar to k-means. The k-prototypes algorithm, through the definition of a combined dissimilarity measure, further integrates the k-means and k-modes algorithms to allow for clustering objects described by mixed numeric and categorical attributes. We use the well known soybean disease and credit approval data sets to demonstrate the clustering performance of the two algorithms. Our experiments on two real world data sets with half a million objects each show that the two algorithms are efficient when clustering large data sets, which is critical to data mining applications.

J	Carretti, NG; Ditto, A; Guidoni, CG				Carretti, NG; Ditto, A; Guidoni, CG			Vitamin B-12 levels in pregnancy influence erythropoietin response to anemia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY			English	Article						erythropoietin; vitamin B-12; pregnancy; anemia		Objective: to discover whether vitamin B-12 levels influence erythropoietin (EPO) response during pregnancy. Study design: 117 pregnant women after the 27th week were divided into three groups according to log vitamin B-12 concentrations. EPO (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), Hemoglobin (Hb) and medium corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC) were measured in these patients. The tests used were: calculation of simple statistic, regression coefficient and t-independent test with level of significance. An exclusive partitioned cluster method (K-means procedure) was used. Results: For the lowest vitamin B-12 levels there is an unexpected lack of difference in plasma EPO levels between anemic and nonanemic patients. In fact EPO levels were high even in nonanemic women. The only parameter of the blood count that seems to change in relation to vitamin B-12 concentration is the MCHC. Conclusions: These results suggest that low vitamin B-12 levels inhibit the suppression of EPO response in nonanemic pregnant women probably through MCHC modifications.

Thus, it benefits from properties of deterministic and stochastic search. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm actually assimilated the advantages of the both components. It may be therefore regarded as an accelerated global optimization method whose convergence is theoretically proved. According to the complexity of the quantization problem, the convergence rate is shown (numerically) to approach that of a coordinate descent algorithm, which is an iterative updating of a single codevector at a time (generalized Lloyd algorithm GLA, i,e,, K-means). The new method is investigated and compared with GLA and a globally operating stochastic relaxation technique. The comparison was made with respect to quality, reliability, and efficiency and applied to four categories of data: an easy to grasp example, patterns derived from the EEG, Gauss-Markov, and image sources.

J	Hoya, T				Hoya, T			Graph theoretic techniques for pruning data and their applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						data-pruning algorithms; graph theoretic techniques; pattern classification		In pattern recognition tasks, we usually do not pay much attention to the arbitrarily chosen training set of a pattern classifier beforehand. This correspondence proposes several methods for pruning data sets based upon graph theory in order to alleviate redundancy in the original data set while retaining the original data structure as far as possible. The proposed methods are applied to the training sets for pattern recognition by a multilayered perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and the locations of the centroids of a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The advantage of the proposed graph theoretic methods is that they do not require any calculation for the statistical distributions of the clusters. The experimental results in comparison both with the k-means clustering and with the learning vector quantization (LVQ) methods show that the proposed methods give encouraging performance in terms of computation for data classification tasks.

J	Davis, JM; Eder, BK; Nychka, D; Yang, Q				Davis, JM; Eder, BK; Nychka, D; Yang, Q			Modeling the effects of meteorology on ozone in Houston using cluster analysis and generalized additive models	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ozone; cluster analysis; meteorology; generalized additive models; Houston	SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; UNITED-STATES; TRENDS	This paper compares the results from a !;ingle-stage clustering technique (average linkage) with those of a two-stage technique (average linkage then k-means) as art of an objective meteorological classification scheme designed to better elucidate ozone's dependence on meteorology in the Houston, Texas, area. When applied to twelve years of meteorological data (1981-1992), each clustering technique identified seven statistically distinct meteorological regimes. The majority of these regimes exhibited significantly different daily 1 h maximum ozone (O-3) concentrations, with the two-stage approach resulting in a better segregation of the mean concentrations when compared to the single-stage approach. Both approaches indicated that the largest daily Ih maximum concentrations are associated with migrating anticyclones that occur most often during spring and summer, and not with the quasi-permanent Bermuda High that often dominates the southeastern United States during the summer. ns a result, maximum ozone concentrations are just as likely during the months of April, May, September and October as they are during the summer months. Generalized additive models were then developed within each meteorological regime in order to identify those meteorological covariates most closely associated with O-3 concentrations. Three surface wind covariates: speed, and the u and v components were selected nearly unanimously in those meteorological regimes dominated by anticyclones, indicating the importance of transport within these O-3 conducive meteorological regimes.

J	Athanassopoulos, AD; Triantis, KP				Athanassopoulos, AD; Triantis, KP			Assessing aggregate cost efficiency and the related policy implications for Greek local municipalities	INFOR			English	Article						measurement and evaluation of local municipality performance; data envelopment analysis; stochastic frontiers; tobit models; fuzzy K-means cluster analysis; local Greek municipalities	UNMASKING MULTIVARIATE OUTLIERS; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; LEVERAGE POINTS; PUBLIC-SECTOR; GOVERNMENT	The assessment of local government performance is a major issue for a number of industrial countries since local municipalities are assuming increasingly more responsibility in terms of providing essential services to their taxpayers. In fact, the decentralisation of decision-making from central governments to local municipalities has made the measurement and evaluation of their performance critical. In this paper, a two stage methodology is proposed as a comprehensive approach to measure the performance of local municipalities. During the first stage, efficiency performance is measured using mathematical programming and econometric frontier approaches. A second stage is proposed where the impact of policy making factors on the efficiency measures obtained from the first stage is evaluated. The policy implications of cost efficiency are investigated by grouping local municipalities within clusters of similar performance characteristics and also by identifying the determinants of their cost efficiency using censored regression models. The approach is implemented by studying the performance of Greek local municipalities.

Actions of the neuropeptides YGGFMRFamide and proctolin	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							FMRFAMIDE-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CRAYFISH MUSCLE; SCHISTOCERCA-GREGARIA; K+ CURRENT; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; APLYSIA-CALIFORNICA; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; ARACHIDONIC-ACID	The resting K(+) conductance (G(K,r)) Of locust jumping muscle and its modulation by two neuropeptides, proctolin (Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr) and YGGF-MRFamide (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH,), were investigated using the two-electrode voltage clamp. At a physiological [K(+)](o), of 10 mM, G(K,r) accounts for similar to 90% of the membrane resting conductance, and the resting membrane potential differs by less than or equal to 1 mV from E(K) (mean: -74 mV). There is a K(+) conductance that slowly activates on hyperpolarization (G(K,H)) and that seems to be largely located in the transverse tubules. Steady-state activation of G(K,H) was analyzed by tail current measurements. GK,H is activated partially at EK but accounts for probably less than or equal to 50% of total resting K(+) conductance. Raising [K(+)](o) caused a large increase in G(K,r) and in maximal steady state GK,H without shifting the voltage sensitivity of G(K,H). YGGFMRFamide and proctolin reduce GK,H, mainly affecting the maximal steady-state conductance. The voltage-insensitive component of the resting K(+) conductance is also reduced. The conductance suppressed by the peptides exhibited an outwardly rectifying instantaneous current/voltage-characteristic that is quite similar to that of G(K,H) The actions of the two peptides appeared to be identical, but proctolin was by some two orders of magnitude more potent than YGGFMRFamide. The effects of both peptides are mediated by G proteins. They are mimicked by phorbol esters but do not seem to be initiated by either branch of the phospholipase C-dependent intracellular pathways. The properties of the resting K(+) conductance in locust muscle and other invertebrate muscles are compared. The biological significance of peptide-induced reduction in resting K(+) conductance is discussed in view of the known property of proctolin to support tonic force as opposed to FMRFamide-peptides that support quick leg movements.

J	Staal, MA; Greene, RL				Staal, MA; Greene, RL			Classification accuracy in the measurement of MMPI/MMPI-2: Profile similarity	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT			English	Article							MMPI; ELEVATION; SCATTER; SHAPE; CONFIGURATIONS; COMPARABILITY; SAMPLE	The classification of "well-defined" and "nonrestrictive" MMPI-2 codetypes has be come a recent topic of debate in the field. An empirical assessment of similarity algorithms incorporating aspects of elevation, shape, and scatter measurement was conducted using both well-defined and nonrestrictive MMPI and MMPI-2 profiles. Discriminant analysis clearly was the most accurate at classifying the different codetype profiles examined, a performance unparalleled by Cattell's rp, Osgood and Suci's D-2, Or the K-means iterative-partitioning method. The ability of the three remaining measures to differentiate and classify a given profile depended largely on the codetype being investigated and whether nonrestrictive or well-defined data were used. Differences in classification accuracy between MMPI and MMPI-2 profiles are discussed, as well as the empirical comparability between the different algorithms.

J	Park, SH; Yun, ID; Lee, SU				Park, SH; Yun, ID; Lee, SU			Color image segmentation based on 3-D clustering: Morphological approach	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						color image segmentation; Gaussian smoothing; clustering; mathematical morphology; closing adaptive dilation		In this paper, a new segmentation algorithm for color images based on mathematical morphology is presented. Color image segmentation is essentially a clustering process in 3-D color space, but the characteristics of clusters vary severely, according to the type of images and color coordinates. Hence, the methodology employs the scheme of thresholding the difference of Gaussian smoothed 3-D histogram to get the initial seeds for clustering, and then uses a closing operation and adaptive dilation to extract the number of clusters and their representative values, and to include the suppressed bins during Gaussian smoothing, without a priori knowledge on the image. This procedure also implicitly takes into account the statistical properties, such as the shape, connectivity and distribution of clusters. Intensive computer simulation has been performed and the results are discussed in this paper. The results of the simulation show that the proposed segmentation algorithm is independent of the choice of color coordinates, the shape of clusters, and the type of images. The segmentation results using the k-means technique are also presented for comparison purposes. (C) 1998 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Family scales from the California study were submitted to focus groups, translated, and standardized on a sample of 209 parents. A panel of experts then revised the scales to make them relevant to Quebec families and to health promotion. Data from the new and revised scales were collected on 509 Quebec couples (1,018 spouses) and were clustered separately by gender, using K means. The procedure classified all respondents into family types that paralleled the original typology. Discriminant analyses indicated that family profile variables significantly distinguished family types. Comparisons with family, stress, and health variables further differentiated among the types and expanded their meaning. The study demonstrates a method for redefining and extending family data in health research with different cultural groups.

J	Furlong, MJ; Smith, DC				Furlong, MJ; Smith, DC			Raging Rick to Tranquil Tom: An empirically based multidimensional anger typology for adolescent males	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article							CHILD-BEHAVIOR PROFILE; INFORMATION-PROCESSING MECHANISMS; CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; PROACTIVE AGGRESSION; TRAIT ANGER; AGED 6-11; HOSTILITY; CLASSIFICATION; DISORDERS; PATTERNS	Anger-related problems among children and youth are sf considerable interest to school psychologists and others concerned about the prevention and reduction of school violence. Both research and clinical efforts, however, have suffered from a lack of conceptual clarity with regard to anger, an emotion that is highly correlated with aggressive behavior. This article reviews efforts to categorize anger-related patterns among youth and proposes an empirically derived typology for males based upon a multidimensional conceptualization of anger in school settings. Utilizing a two-stage clustering procedure (hierarchical and K-means procedures), six anger preference styles were described for a sample of 200 participants in grades 6-12. As a heuristic to aid in the interpretation of the six styles, they were labeled "Raging Rick" (Cluster 1 : Extreme Anger subtype), "Bitter Bill" (Cluster 2: Cynical subtype), "Dynamic Don" (Cluster 3: Impulsive subtype), "Sociable Sam" (Cluster 4: Prosocial subtype), "Suppressive Sal" (Cluster 5: Low Arousal-Low Coping subtype), and "Tranquil Tom" (Cluster 6: Low Arousal-High Coping subtype). External validity of the resultant groupings was evaluated by comparing subgroup profiles on both teacher and self-reported ratings of anger and aggression within school settings.

J	Kollias, VJ; Kalivas, DP				Kollias, VJ; Kalivas, DP			The enhancement of a commercial geographical information system (ARC/INFO) with fuzzy processing capabilities for the evaluation of land resources	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						geographical information systems; fuzzy sets; soil classification; land evaluation	SOIL PROPERTIES; K-MEANS; CLASSIFICATION	The paper presents the design considerations of FUZZYLAND; a geographical information system with fuzzy processing capabilities. The GIS package ARC/INFO was augmented with new commands to allow the easy application of fuzzy sets theory methods to geographical data. The system was programmed in AML (the ARC/INFO Macro Language) and operates as a set of ARC/INFO commands. This type of development makes the system very easy to use and allows complete control of every stage of the process. Examples of the operation of the FUZZYLAND system are presented, through a case study which demonstrates its application for the classification of the soils of an area of Western Greece in thematic classes according to their (a) degradation from agricultural uses and (b) to their suitability for growing alfalfa. The proposed system maintains all the advantages of the GIS ARC/INFO but enhances it in three ways: (1) it can easily manipulate the natural variation of soil properties; (2) users are allowed to express their subjective view on the stored data in the form of membership grades; and (3) it presents a more precise and realistic classification and assessment of land resources.

J	Church, AH; Waclawski, J				Church, AH; Waclawski, J			The relationship between individual personality orientation and executive leadership behaviour	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review							KIRTON ADAPTION-INNOVATION; BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR; ORGANIZATION-DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS; JOB-PERFORMANCE; META-ANALYSIS; MULTIRATER FEEDBACK; SUPERVISOR RATINGS; INFLUENCE TACTICS; COGNITIVE-STYLE; SELF-RATINGS	The following study was undertaken to explore the link between individual differences in personality orientation and subsequent leadership behaviours in the workplace. More specifically, relationships among two measures of personality and one measure of transformational-transactional leadership style were investigated using data collected from 253 senior executives (and their direct reports) from a highly diversified global corporation. After an initial examination of the personality variables using a correlational approach, a k-means cluster analysis was used to generate four distinct 'groups' based on the mean personality orientation or style exhibited. These groups were labelled accordingly in order to reflect the dispositional characteristics among each cluster of executives: (1) innovators for change or inventors; (2) analytical coordinators or managers; (3) organized pragmatists or implementors; and (4) enthusiastic idealists or motivators. Subsequent ANOVA models using these cluster groups yielded significant differences with respect to the perceptions of both executives and their direct reports of their leadership behaviour. In general, inventors and motivators were found to be more transformational in their leadership style than managers and implementers. These results are discussed in terms of the characteristics of each personality cluster and their respective linkages to the leadership behaviours observed by self and others.

Each filter is specially designed to match the shape of the compressed breast border and to preferentially attenuate the x-ray beam in the peripheral region of the breast. To be practical, this method should require the use of only a limited number of custom built filters. It is hypothesized that this would be possible if compressed breasts can be classified into a finite number of shapes. A study was performed to determine the number of shapes. Based on the parabolic appearances of the outer borders of compressed breasts in mammograms, the borders were fit with the polynomial equations y = ax(2) + bx(3) and y = ax(2) + bx(3) + cx(4). The goodness-of-fit of these equations was compared. The a,b and a,b,c coefficients were employed in a K-Means clustering procedure to classify 470 CC-view and 484 MLO-view borders into 2-10 clusters. The mean coefficients of the borders within a given cluster defined the "filter" shape, and the individual borders were translated and rotated to best match that filter shape. The average rms differences between the individual borders and the ''filter'' were computed as were the standard deviations of those differences. The optimally shifted and rotated borders were refit with the above polynomial equations, and plotted for visual evaluation of clustering success. Both polynomial fits were adequate with rms errors of about 2 mm for the 2-coefficient equation, and about 1 mm for the 3-coefficient equation. Although the fits to the original borders were superior for the 3-coefficient equation, the matches to the "filter" borders determined by clustering were not significantly improved. A variety of modified clustering methods were developed and utilized, but none produced major improvements in clustering. Results indicate that 3 or 4 filter shapes may be adequate for each mammographic projection (CC and MLO-view). To account for the wide variations in exposures observed at the peripheral regions of breasts classified to be of a particular shape, it may be necessary to employ different filters for thin, medium and thick breasts. Even with this added requirement, it should be possible to use a small number of filters as desired. (C) 1998 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. [S0094-2405(98)00106-0].

A radial collective flow of K+ mesons is predicted to exist in central Au + Au collisions, which manifests in a characteristic "shoulder-arm" shape of the transverse mass spectrum of the midrapidity K+ mesons. The K+ radial flow arises from the repulsive K+ mean field in nuclear matter. In spite of a strong reabsorption and rescattering the attractive K- mean field leads as well to a collective radial flow of K- mesons. The K- radial flow, however, is different from that of K+ mesons and can be observed by a characteristic "concave" structure of the transverse mass spectrum of the K- mesons emitted at midrapidity. The kaon radial hows can therefore serve as a novel tool for the investigation of kaon properties in dense nuclear matter.

For this purpose, we build language models for printable characters (letters), based on the Brown corpus. We consider two classes of models for the text generation process: the n-gram language model and various decision tree based language models. In the first part of the paper, we compare the most popular smoothing algorithms applied to the former. We conclude that the bottom-up deleted interpolation algorithm performs the best in the task of n-gram letter language model smoothing, significantly outperforming the back-off smoothing technique for large values of n. In the second part of the paper, we consider various decision tree development algorithms. Among them, a K-means clustering type algorithm for the design of the decision tree questions gives the best results. However, the n-gram language model outperforms the decision tree language models for letter language modeling. We believe that this is due to the predictive nature of letter strings, which seems to be naturally modeled by n-grams, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Corte-Real, J; Qian, BD; Xu, H				Corte-Real, J; Qian, BD; Xu, H			Regional climate change in Portugal: Precipitation variability associated with large-scale atmospheric circulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						regional climate change; circulation pattern; K-means clustering; singular spectrum analysis; precipitation variability; Portugal	WEATHER REGIMES; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; ANOMALIES; FIELD	Four major circulation patterns, associated with daily precipitation in Portugal, are classified from daily sea level pressure fields over the northeastern Atlantic and western Europe, based on the K-means clustering algorithm coupled with principal component analysis. A rainy pattern is clearly identified with a probability of rain of 74.6%, as well as two distinct dry patterns, one prevailing in summer and the other occurring frequently in winter; a blocking-like pattern with a probability of rain of 36.8% has also been identified. These patterns are quasi-stationary, normally persisting for 1 week and sometimes even for 1 month, especially the dry ones; they represent the principal weather regimes associated with precipitation in Portugal. Interannual variations in monthly precipitation associated with the circulation patterns are also investigated; results show that these variations match fluctuations in the frequencies of occurrence of both the rainy and the dry patterns. The decreasing trend of March monthly rainfall in southern Portugal is closely related to corresponding trends in the frequencies of both the rainy pattern and the summer dry pattern. Long term trends are not significant either in other monthly rainfall sequences or in the frequencies of different circulation patterns. Interannual variations seem, in most months, to be quasi-periodic. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is performed on these sequences to detect quasi-periodic oscillations. Relationships between oscillations in rainfall and in frequencies of occurrence of circulation patterns are studied. Results show that four weather circulation patterns or weather regimes are important for investigating regional climate change in Portugal and its relationship with variability of large-scale atmospheric circulation.

Using ELISAs, we compared the ability of liver fluke homogenates (LFH), excretory/secretory (ES) products, and CL1 to discriminate between seropositive (infected) and seronegative (noninfected) individuals within a population of 95 patients from the Bolivian Altiplano. A high prevalence of human fascioliasis has been reported in this region. The division between the seropositive and seronegative individuals was poorly defined when LFH was used as the antigen. A greater discrimination between these populations was achieved with both ES and CLI. A K-means cluster analysis using the combined ES and CL1 ELISA data identified a cluster of seropositive individuals. Cathepsin L1 detected a subset (20) of these seropositive individuals while ES detected all 26; however, ES detected nine additional individuals that were in the seronegative cluster. The ratio of the mean absorbance readings between seropositive and seronegative individuals was markedly improved by using conjugated second antibodies to IgG4, the predominant isotype elicited by infection. In these IgG4-ELISAs, CL1 again identified fewer individuals as seropositive than did ES, but improved the discrimination between the seropositive and seronegative individuals and thus provided a more conclusive diagnosis. Sera obtained from patients infected with schistosomiasis mansoni, cysticercosis, hydatidosis, and Chagas' disease were negative in these assays, which demonstrated the specificity of the IgG4-ELISA for detecting fascioliasis, Twenty of the 95 patients (21%) were seropositive for fascioliasis by the CL1 IgG4-ELISA, confirming the earlier reports of the high prevalence of disease in this region. A standardized diagnostic test for human fascioliasis, based on an ELISA that detects IgG4 responses to CL1, could be available to all diagnostic centers if sufficient quantities of recombinant CLI can be produced.

To analyze the electrophoretic patterns of tear proteins from diabetic (DIDRY) and non-diabetic (DRY) patients with dry-eye disease in comparison with the patterns in healthy subjects (CTRL). The patterns were classified using multivariate statistical methods. Methods. A total of 119 eyes were examined in this study (50 DIDRY, 39 DRY, 30 CTRL). The patients were primarily grouped according to the results of the basic secretory test (BST) and subjective symptoms (burning, foreign body sensations, tearing, "dryness" of the eyes). Patients with values less than or equal to 10/5' plus subjective symptoms were classified as dry-eye patients. Tear proteins were separated by sodium-dodecyl-sulfate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Digital image analysis was done using the ScanPacK (Biometra, Gottingen, Germany). A data set was created from each electrophoretic pattern. The data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of discriminance, k-means cluster analysis and with a factor analysis before k-means cluster analysis as a data reduction tool. Results. The protein patterns of the three groups were significantly different (Wilks' lambda: 0.1425; P < 0.01): P < 0.05 (CTRL - DRY), P < 0.00005 (CTRL-DIDRY), and P < 0.0005 (DIDRY-DRY). There were more peaks/electrophoretic lane in the DRY and DIDRY groups (P < 0.05) than CTRL. Classification of all samples as DRY and CTRL gave the following results: known patterns 97% correct; unknown patterns 71.4% correct. Classification in DIDRY, DRY or CTRL was 92% correct for known patterns and 43% for unknown patterns. Using k-means cluster analysis, 72% of patients previously classified as "dry-eye" according to the BST value were classified as "dry-eye" based on their electrophoretic data too. Conclusions. Analysis of protein patterns and statistical evaluation are suitable for the detection of dry eyes. Tear-protein pattern analysis can provide more information on the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, this new method might be more reliable than the BST value for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

In the second part of the paper, a formal cluster analysis is introduced to calculate cluster-distance distributions. Method: Total experimental ionization cross-sections were least-square fitted and compared with the calculation by various theoretical methods. Monte-Carlo track-structure code Kurbuc was used to examine and compare the spectrum of the secondary electrons generated by using functions given by Born-Bethe, Jain-Khare, Gryzinsky, Kim-Rudd, Mott and Vriens' theories. The cluster analysis in track structure was carried out using the k-means method and Hartigan algorithm. Results: Data are presented on experimental and calculated total ionization cross-sections: inverse mean free path (IMFP) as a function of electron energy used in Monte-Carlo track-structure codes; the spectrum of secondary electrons generated by different functions for 500 eV primary electrons; cluster analysis for 4 MeV and 20 MeV alpha-particles in terms of the frequency of total cluster energy to the root-mean-square (rms) radius of the cluster and differential distance distributions for a pair of clusters; and finally relative frequency distribution for energy deposited in DNA, single-strand break and double-strand breaks for 10 MeV/u protons, alpha-particles and carbon ions. Conclusions: There are a number of Monte-Carlo track-structure codes that have been developed independently and the benchmarking presented in this paper allows a better choice of the theoretical method adopted in a track-structure code to be made. A systematic bench-marking of cross-sections and spectra of the secondary electrons shows differences between the codes at atomic level, but such differences are not significant in biophysical modelling at the macromolecular level. Clustered-damage evaluation shows: that a substantial proportion of dose (similar to 30%) is deposited by low-energy electrons; the majority of DNA damage lesions are of simple type; the complexity of damage increases with increased LET, while the total yield of strand breaks remains constant; and at high LET values nearly 70% of all double-strand breaks are of complex type.

We present justification for the use of standard finite normal mixture model for MR images and formulate image quantification as a distribution learning problem. The finite mixture network parameters are updated such that the relative entropy between the true and estimated distributions is minimized. The new learning scheme achieves flexible classifier boundaries by forming winner-takes-in probability splits of the data allowing the data to contribute simultaneously to multiple regions. Hence, the result is unbiased and satisfies the asymptotic optimality properties of maximum likelihood. To achieve a fully automatic quantification procedure that can adapt to different slices in the MR image sequence, we utilize an information theoretic criterion that we have introduced recently, the minimum conditional bias/variance (MCBV) criterion. MCBV allows us to determine the suitable number of mixture components to represent the characteristics of each image in the sequence. We present examples to show that the new method yields very efficient and accurate performance compared to expectation-maximization, K-means, and competitive learning procedures.

K-mean cluster analysis was applied to partition a sample of 128 patients, 101 with various PDs and 27 with axis I disorders only, into four groups representing different courses. The course was defined on the basis of global functioning (Health Sickness Rating Scale [HSRS]) at admission, discharge, and 3-years follow-up evaluation. The four courses were labeled good, fair, late improvement, and poor, demonstrating great variation in the short-term course among patients with PDs. Predictors were studied by means of polychotomous logistic regression using the patients with a fair course as the reference group. The dichotomy no PD/cluster C versus cluster A/B predicted a good versus a fair course, A poor work status the last year before admission and irregular discharge predicted a poor or late improvement course versus a fair course, also when controlling for PD clusters. None of the included variables discriminated between patients with a poor versus late improvement course, Copyright (C) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company.

J	Ashton, EA				Ashton, EA			Detection of subpixel anomalies in multispectral infrared imagery using an adaptive Bayesian classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						classification; multispectral; segmentation; subpixel; target detection	TEXTURED IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	The detection of subpixel targets with unknown spectral signatures and cluttered backgrounds in multispectral imagery is a topic of great interest for remote surveillance applications, Because no knowledge of the target is assumed, the only way to accomplish such a detection Is through a search for anomalous pixels. Two approaches to this problem are examined in this paper, The first is to separate the image into a number of statistical clusters by using an extension of the well-known k-means algorithm, Each bin of resultant residual vectors is then decorrelated, and the results are thresholded to provide detection, The second approach requires the formation of a probabilistic background model by using an adaptive Bayesian classification algorithm, This allows the calculation of a probability for each pixel, with respect to the model, These probabilities are then thresholded to provide detection, Both algorithms are shown to provide significant improvement over current filtering techniques for anomaly detection in experiments using multispectral IR imagery with both simulated and actual subpixel targets.

This new learning technique determines the parameters of the input layer (including the covariance matrices or so-called receptive fields) and the parameters of the output layer in the RBF nets globally, instead of separately training the input layer by the K-means algorithm and the output layer by the least-squares learning as done in most of the existing RBF learning methods. In addition, coordinated competitive learning (CCL) and adaptive algorithms are proposed to approximate the EM algorithm for considerably speeding up the learning of the original and alternative ME models as well as the NRBF and ENRBF nets. Furthermore, the two ME models are linked to the recent proposed Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) learning system and theory such that not only the architecture of ME and RBF nets is shown to be more preferred than multilayer architecture, but also a new model selection criterion has been obtained to determine the number of experts and basis functions. A number of experiments are made on the prediction of foreign exchange rate and trading investment as well as piecewise nonlinear regression and piecewise line fitting. As shown in these experiments, the EM algorithm for NRBF nets and ENRBF nets obviously outperforms the conventional RBF learning technique, CCL speeds up the learning considerably with only a slight sacrifice on performance accuracy, the adaptive algorithm gives significant improvements on financial predication and trading investment, as well as that the proposed criterion can select the number of basis functions successfully. In addition, the ENRBF net and the alternative ME model are also shown to be able to implement curve fitting and detection. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yung, HC; Lai, HS				Yung, HC; Lai, HS			Segmentation of color images based on the gravitational clustering concept	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						image segmentation; clustering; gravitational clustering; Markovian model; force effective function; RGB color space; objective evaluation; boundaries; segmented regions		A new clustering algorithm derived from the Markovian model of the gravitational clustering concept is proposed that works in the RGB measurement space for color image. To enable the model to be applicable in image segmentation, the new algorithm imposes a clustering constraint at each clustering iteration to control and determine the formation of multiple clusters, Using such constraint to limit the attraction between clusters, a termination condition can be easily defined. The new clustering algorithm is evaluated objectively and subjectively on three different images against the K-means clustering algorithm, the recursive histogram clustering algorithm for color (also known as the multi-spectral thresholding), the Hedley-Yan algorithm, and the widely used seed-based region growing algorithm. From the evaluation, it is observed that the new algorithm exhibits the following characteristics: (1) its objective measurement figures are comparable with the best in this group of segmentation algorithms; (2) it generates smoother region boundaries; (3) the segmented boundaries align closely with the original boundaries; and (4) it forms a meaningful number of segmented regions.

In this study we compare the classification capabilities of the I-dimensional Kohonen neural network with two partitioning (Hartigan and Spath k-means) and three hierarchical (Ward's, complete linkage, and average linkage) cluster methods in 2,580 data sets with known cluster structure. Overall, the performance of the Kohonen networks was similar to, or better than, the performance of the other methods.

J	Tasdizen, T; Akarun, L; Ersoy, C				Tasdizen, T; Akarun, L; Ersoy, C			Color quantization with genetic algorithms	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						color image quantization; genetic algorithms; clustering	INFINITE POPULATION-SIZE; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; CONTINUOUS SPACE; OPTIMIZATION; MUTATION	The need for quantization of color images arises because of limitations of image display and hardcopy, data storage and data transmission devices. Many of the present algorithms for color quantization find non-optimal solutions, giving rise to visible shifts in color and false contours when the number of quantization colors is small. This paper describes a new approach to finding the optimal solutions of the color image quantization problem using a genetic algorithm. The nature and the difficulty of the problem and its formulation are discussed. Then genetic algorithms (GAs) are presented and the representation of the problem with this method is explained. The effect of the parameters such as mutation and crossover probabilities and population size on the quality of solutions is studied. Solutions obtained with genetic algorithms are compared with those of heuristics and the K-means clustering algorithm and the superior quality of the results of the GA is shown.

Infrared and Raman spectra of cobalt hydroxide at different degrees of deuteration are presented and assigned to the internal, librational and translational modes. The D...O distance of 252.8 pm and the wavenumbers of the OH and OD stretching modes (3604 and 2665 cm(-1), 90 K, mean values of the unit-cell group modes) do not exclude the formation of weak trifurcated hydrogen bonds. The librational and translational vibrations of E-u species are strongly coupled as shown by the respective isotopic shifts.

The image segmentation is performed by thresholding a parametric image approximating the original image. Using the mean squared error between the original and the constructed image as the cost function, the segmentation problem is transformed into an optimisation process where parametric parameters are determined that minimise the defined cost function. The cost function is iteratively minimised using an unsupervised learning rule to adjust the parameters, and a parametric image is constructed at each iteration, based on obtained parameters. The cell region is extracted by thresholding the final parametric image, where the threshold is one of the image parameters. Application results to real cervical images are provided to show the performance of the proposed segmentation approach. Experimental segmentation results are presented for the proposed optimal algorithm for synthetic cell images corrupted by variant levels of noise; these results are compared with the K-means clustering method and Paves classifier in terms of classification errors.

J	Hastie, T; Simard, PY				Hastie, T; Simard, PY			Metrics and models for handwritten character recognition	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						nearest neighbor classification; invariance	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS	A digitized handwritten numeral can be represented as a binary or greyscale image. An important pattern recognition task that has received much attention lately is to automatically determine the digit, given the image. While many different techniques have been pushed very hard to solve this task, the most successful and intuitively appropriate is due to Simard, Le Cun and Denker (1993). Their approach combined nearest-neighbor classification with a subject-specific invariant metric that allows for small rotations, translations and other natural transformations. We report on Simard's classifier and compare it to other approaches. One important negative aspect of near-neighbor classification is that all the work gets done at lookup time, and with around 10,000 training images in high dimensions this can be exorbitant. In this paper we develop rich models for representing large subsets of the prototypes. One example is a low-dimensional hyperplane defined by a point and a set of basis or tangent vectors. The components of these models are learned from the training set, chosen to minimize the average tangent distance from a subset of the training images-as such they are similar in flavor to the singular value decomposition (SVD), which finds closest hyperplanes in Euclidean distance. These models are either used singly per class or used as basic building blocks in conjunction with the K-means clustering algorithm.

J	Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Gordaliza, A; Matran, C				Cuesta-Albertos, JA; Gordaliza, A; Matran, C			Trimmed best k-nets: A robustified version of an L-infinity-based clustering method	STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS			English	Article						best k-nets; trimmed best k-nets; k-means; trimmed k-means; bridging objects; clustering methods; consistency; robustness		The "impartial trimming" methodology in clustering analysis was initially designed (see Cuesta-Albertos et al., 1997) to gain protection against outliers and bridging objects (objects intermediate between clusters). In this work the methodology is applied to best k-nets. We include a study of optimal regions, which parallels that of trimmed k-means, showing that only non-pathological regions arise from impartial trimming procedures. Also we prove the strong consistency of the method by suitably varying the level of trimming with the size of the sample. A section is devoted to comparing the performance in a real data set of the suggested procedure with that of trimmed k-means. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Due to the application-specific nature of image registration methodology, the use of preexisting techniques for new applications requires validation. A quantitative approach was developed based on the Zubal segmented human anatomical phantom [4] in conjunction with blood flow biodistribution data to simulate the activity distribution of a typical PET flow study. Known rotations and translations were applied to the resulting flow software phantom. Poisson noise and spatial resolution of the PET scanner were included in the sinograms created by forward-projection and the reconstructed images were coregistered against a non-transformed reference image using three existing methods: minimisation of standard deviation in the pixel ratio (SPR) [1], multi-resolution maximisation of mutual information (MMI) [2] and K-means variance minimisation (CVM) [3]. Assessment based on the transformation matrices shows comparable performance in the range of the transformations assessed (0-15 degrees rotations, 0-15 pixels translations). Assessment based on correlation, residual image and ROI-based results suggest an advantage of MMI for the specific application considered.

The standard fuzzy c-means is regarded as a regularization of the crisp k - means, and hence other regularization methods can be studied as fuzzy versions of the crisp c - means. A new algorithm for calculating membership values is derived, whereas calculation of cluster centers is similar to the standard method. The nearest prototype classification functions which has been derived from the standard fuzzy c - means is transformed into the corresponding method within the present method of quadratic regularization. It should be noted that the present method yields piecewise linear classification functions.

The K-means algorithm over Changle Li's [Li (1988)] coefficient is used to classify the noisy image in regions of homogenous statistics. This kind of information is used as a guide for choosing the best window size for parameter estimation in the MAP filtering. This paper is based on the multiplicative model for the speckle and considers different densities to describe the "a priori" knowledge. It suggests a new adaptive filtering algorithm based on MAP approach and clustering.

The algorithm involves 3D adaptive K-Means clustering of the gray-scale and texture features images calculated from the envelope image. The segmentation problem was formulated as a Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation problem. The method was demonstrated successfully on in vivo breast data with texture features calculated on the cooccurrence matrices. A major difficulty in the proposed algorithm is the choice of the texture features which characterize the different tissues. In the case of ultrasonic data, two major classes of parameters exist, acoustical and textural parameters. In this work both acoustic and texture characterization are taken into account in the segmentation process.

The RSI, which is also another random field, has been adopted to distinguish real texture images with small window size. In this paper, the probability density function of RSI is assumed to be the Gaussian, MRF, making the extraction of the texture features easy. The proposed textured image segmentation consists of two stages: texture feature extraction and clustering the feature parameters. In the extraction stage, toe use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which is widely used for incomplete data problem. Then, the extracted texture parameters are clustered by using the k-means algorithm. The experiment shows good segmentation results for both synthetic and various real images.

They are designed to operate on a portion of the image while scanning the document, thus, they pr a pipeline architecture and lend themselves to real-time implementation. The first algorithm is based on adaptive thresholding and uses local edge information to switch between global thresholding and adaptive local thresholding determined from the statistics of a local image window. The second thresholding algorithm is based on tracking the foreground and background levels using clustering based on a variant of the K-means algorithm The Mo approaches may be used independently or may be combined for improved performance. Results are presented illustrating the algorithms' performance for document and pictorial images.

The surface observation data from 64 stations over South Korea are averaged hourly for the non-precipitating days belonging to each cluster to get diurnally varying micrometeorological data that are required for the estimation of the dry deposition velocity. With the use of the monitored SO2 and NO2 concentrations at 31 sites in South Korea, the estimated deposition velocity belonging to each cluster and the supplement of some empirical constants used in the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM), the dry deposition fluxes of SO2 and NO2 are estimated using the inferential method over South Korea. The classified meteorological clusters can lead to identify the SO2 and NO2 concentration levels without any further requirement other than to know the synoptic class for the next day. The classified synoptic cluster that is related with the high pollution level is not necessarily coincide with the cluster that has a high deposition velocity. The estimated annual mean dry deposition flux over South Korea is about 8.07 t km(-2) yr(-1) for SO2 and 3.8 t km(-2) yr(-1) for NO2 which are corresponding to 45% and 40% of the annual total emission rate respectively. However, in the eastern parts of Korea except for the regions where high emission sources are located the dry deposition fluxes exceed the emission rates. This suggests a significant horizontal transport of pollutants from west to east due to prevailing westerly winds and local circulations.

The algorithm uses an unsupervised neural network and K-means method to classify: image pixels based ori image local spatial-frequency information. The short-time Fourier transform employs large size window function to extract more neighborhood information. The problems of introducing large size windows in classifying larger transient regions are also investigated. High segmentation resolution is obtained by an novel image extrapolation approach and a re-classification procedure for transient areas.

These situations include acceptance sampling, bioequivalence testing, combination drug testing and others. In such situations it is proper to place the hypothesis to be established as the alternative hypothesis and the opposite statement as the null hypothesis. Of these situations we focus on those in which the alternative hypothesis specifies a polyhedral cone for a normal mean vector. A commonly used test is the likelihood ratio (LR) test. The test statistic is a minimum of several t-statistics and yet the critical value is still a t-percentile. In addition, although the test size is exactly alpha, it is only attained as a limit. We generalize these results to the case of convex cone. The test statistic is expressed as a distance measure. The size property is established by an argument more complex than those previously given for polyhedral cones. A convex but nonpolyhedral cone can be encountered in comparing two polynomial regressions of degree 2 or higher. For the case of bioequivalence testing, the LR test is superior to most existing procedures. We also consider the case when the alternative region is a double cone and obtain new and improved results.

Conventional qualitative data interpretation methods that are based on control charts, such as Shewart, CUSUM, and EWMA control charts, are focused upon detection of changes from steady state value, so they are not suitable for describing transient or dynamic behavior. But the proposed method continuously updates its detection limit, or center of duster, so it can handle transient or dynamic behavior. Thus it can be applied to fault diagnosis of chemical process by combining with cause-effect digraph model, RCED(Reduced Cause Effect Digraph). The usefulness of the proposed data interpretation method and cause-effect digraph model are illustrated using their application to the water supply unit of a utility boiler plant. The proposed data interpretation method can be used for not only change detection but also data compression. As the proposed method can store the value that minimizes the SSE between the retrieved data and the original data, it shows better data compression result compared to other conventional data compression methods such as Box Car, Backward Slope, Combined Box Car and Backward Slope algorithm and Swinging Door Trending.

Rectae WOLF), P. canescens BESS., P. argentea L. s.l, P. collina WIBEL (sect. Argenteae WOLF) and P. goldbachii RUPR. (sect. Chrysanthae WOLF) was studied using multivariate statistical methods. According to k-means clustering, P. canescens stands closer to P. heidenreichii of the sect. Rivales than to P. argentea. P: collins, the other representative of sect Argenteae, is not connected with P. canescens at all. Therefore, P. canescens should belong to sect. Rivales and not to Sect. Argenteae. In Potentilla argentea s.l., P. impolita WAHLENB., P. argentea L. var. argentea, var. decumbens (JORD.) LEHM., var, demissa (JORD.) LEHM., var, grandiceps (ZIMMETER) ROUY et E.G.

P. impolita specimens did not cluster out into a separate cluster as did P. collina, P. canescens and P. heidenreichii, but formed mixed clusters with different varieties of P. argentea s.str. Therefore, P. impolita is not worthy of the rank of species and evidently not even that of subspecies, and should be treated as a variety - P. argentea var. incanescens (OPIZ) FOCKE.

First, the window parameter controlling the size of the neighborhood is automatically determined from the original distribution of points. Second stable, hierarchical clustering is achieved by increasing the window parameter value in a deterministic manner: Third, the guarantee of its convergence is rigorously proven. A critical comparison of the extended mean shift method to the k-means method and of her hierarchical clustering methods is made rising artificial 2D point distributions of overlapping Gaussians and half-circles l-vith random noise. Moreover the extended mean shift method is successfully applied to the clustering of a wide variety of handwriting deformation in a 256-dimensional feature space.

Minimum distance classifiers are presented because they have been employed ill previous research [1]. The centers of the radial basis functions are calculated by the means clustering algorithm. The dilations or the radial basis functions are calculated using a statistical method. Finally, we present some simulation results for the radial basis function network method.

This paper proposes to overcome this problem by incorporating full covariance matrices into the RBF structure and to use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the network parameters. The resulting networks, referred to as elliptical basis function (EBF) networks, are applied to text-independent speaker verification. To examine the robustness of the networks in a noisy environment, both clean speech and telephone speech have been used. Experimental results show that smaller size EBF networks with basis function parameters determined by the EM algorithm outperform the large RBF networks trained in the conventional approach. The best error rates achieved by the EBF networks is 3.70%, while that achieved by the RBF networks is 10.37%.

This paper illustrates an implementation of a GSM receiver in which channel equalization and demodulation are realized by means of the K-means algorithm. The advantage is found in the significant reduction of the computational complexity with respect to the classical MLSE equalizer. The performance of the proposed receiver, evaluated through a channel simulator for mobile radio communications, are compared with results obtained by means of a classical 16 states Viterbi processor. It is shown that despite the strong simplification in the receiver, performances are still acceptable considering the ETSI parameters.

By this modification, the lengths of chromosomes and the intensity distribution of chromosome fluorescence can be estimated from chromosome profile data measured by the flowcytometer. The estimated lengths of chromosomes have been almost equal to known values of the lengths of chromosomes. The clustering results by the above method have been compared with the clustering results of the same data by K-mean method and an agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

Furthermore, ML block demodulation can be computationally prohibitive, This paper presents a sub-optimal block demodulation method based on a computationally simple and efficient clustering algorithm known as the K-means algorithm. The performance of noncoherent block demodulation based on this algorithm is determined for various phase and amplitude-phase modulation techniques.. This demodulation scheme does not require knowledge of the received signal strength, fading levels, or channel phase offset. Numerical results shout significant improvement over classical differential demodulation techniques.

Each function center of an RBF network is encoded as a binary string, and the concatenation of the strings forms a chromosome. In each generation cycle, the GA determines the center locations. Then the K-nearest neighbor heuristic and singular value decomposition are applied to And the function widths and output weights of each network, respectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three problem sets. The results show that networks with centers found by the proposed algorithm achieve a lower mean squared error and a higher classification accuracy than networks with centers found by the K-means algorithm. The paper explains the findings by demonstrating that the best center locations may not necessary be located inside the input clusters.

Since existing alphanumeric indexing methods are not particularly suitable in image databases, researchers have proposed new methods for indexing by clustering methods. In this paper, we analyze the performance of two unsupervised neural network clustering algorithms Competitive Learning (CL) and Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (RPCL) together with k-means and VP-tree for image database indexing. We present some performance experiments to measure their accuracy and efficiency. Based on the experimental results, we concluded that RPCL and CL are good information retrieval in image database.

These data are converted high resolution six day images of the polar regions through the use of the scatterometer image reconstruction with filter (SIRF) algorithm. SIRF produces images of A and B where A is sigma degrees at 40 degrees incidence and B is the incidence angle dependence of sigma degrees. A simple four-dimensional classification technique is proposed which uses the dual polarization parameters A(upsilon), A(h), B-upsilon, and B-h. A k-means clustering classification can be used to separate pixels of the images with differing scattering mechanisms. This method also adapts to the seasonal characteristics of cluster migration by converging to the locally optimal cluster centroids. While validation data was not available at the time of this writing, the method is shown to have high correlation with the NSIDC SSM/I derived multiyear ice maps.

The entropy is considered to define a prior. In clustering problem we have to reduce the complexity of the grey level description. Therefore we minimise the entropy associated with the clustering histogram. This enables us to overcome the problem of defining a priori the number of clusters and an initialisation of their centers. Under the assumption of a normal distribution of data the proposed clustering method reduces to a deterministic algorithm (very fast) which appears to be an. extension of the standard k-means clustering algorithm. Our model depends on a parameter weighting the prior term and the goodness of fit term. This hyper-parameter allows us to define the coarseness of the clustering and is data independent. Heuristic argument is proposed to estimate this parameter. The new clustering approach was successfully tested on a database of 65 magnetic resonance images and remote sensing images.

The pixels of an image are represented by points in a n-dimensional space (spectral space). There is no universally accepted definition for texture, here texture means relation among pixels, given by the statistic of the image. In this work, an algorithm has been developed for segmenting colour images (or multispectral), after performing a clustering over the set of points in spectral space. The algorithm captures texture information in order to segment the image. Finally, results obtained with synthetic and real aerial images are shown.

Thereby, it is not possible for experts to analyse the ceaseless image streams. In practice, there is a growing interest in understanding concepts discovered in classified images. Our approach to image classification is based on the conceptual clustering algorithm, Cobweb and its extensions. In general, these algorithms produce tree-structured clusters. However, once the hierarchies are built, the remote sensing experts need to compare. and to synthetize the obtained hierarchies in terms of conceptual similarities. Two algorithms are described which produce a synthesis of hierarchies. The first algorithm can be used to synthetize results generated by heterogenous hierarchical classifiers, such as K-means, Unimem, Labyrinth. The second algorithm is an extended version of Cobweb. The experiments carried on urban zones have shown the universality and the efficiency of our approaches.

The adverse circulatory changes following the surgical elevation of a skin nap limits the supply of oxygen to the flap tissue. Regions of tissue which experience prolonged and severe deprivation of oxygen will not survive. A dorsal rat skin flap model was used to demonstrate the potential of visible/near infrared multispectral imaging to detect tissues under hypoxic stress. Images were required before and immediately after surgery. Image pre-processing methods were used to enhance tissue contrast and eliminate image artifacts. Principal component analysis of these images further enhanced contrast along the length of the flap while varimax rotation simplified data interpretation. Significant hemodynamic changes were detected (i) between pre and post-operative images, and (ii) within the post-elevation flap image itself. K-means and fuzzy C-means image segmentation methods were applied to the post-operative multispectral images and proved to be reliable means of predicting regions of tissue that would. go on to become visibly necrotic after a 72 h monitoring period. The results suggest that statistical analysis of visible/near infrared multispectral images can be used to extract clinically relevant information pertaining to tissue hemodynamics following reconstructive surgery.

The k-means-type algorithm is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. An efficient parallel k-means-type algorithm for clustering data sets on a distributed share-nothing parallel system is proposed. It has a simple communication scheme which performs only one round of information exchange in every iteration. We have implemented parallel k-means-type algorithm on art IBM SP2 parallel machine. The performance studies show that the algorithm has nice parallelism in. experiments.

One of the models of a MOD server is general network of computers. Some of the nodes in the network are storage nodes which contain data repositories, and the others are interface nodes which obtain data from storage nodes and deliver them to the users (clients) in a timely fashion. Determining the locations of the storage nodes to minimize the data traffic between them and the interface nodes is a global optimization problem. This paper presents an offline heuristic for choosing the locations of storage nodes and clustering interface nodes with storage nodes so as to minimize the traffic from the storage nodes. The proposed algorithm has been validated by simulations.

A new method for segmentation of medical ultrasonic image based on fractal dimension Lacunarity is presented in this paper. As fractal features have drawbacks of less number and great redundancy, we developed a method to extend the features combining with micromasks. Experimental results show that our method can enhance he description ability of fractal features and segment the images efficiently.

Principal points are a special case of self-consistent points. Any given set of k distinct points in RP induce a partition of RP into Voronoi regions or domains of attraction according to minimal distance. A set of k points are called self-consistent for a distribution if each point equals the conditional mean of the distribution over its respective Voronoi region. For symmetric multivariate distributions, sets of self-consistent points typically form symmetric patterns. This paper investigates the optimality of different symmetric patterns of self-consistent points for symmetric multivariate distributions and in particular for the bivariate normal distribution. These results are applied to the problem of estimating principal points.

The first method, Tuckerized growth curve analysis (TGCA), is an extension of factor analysis, while the second method is an extension of K means analysis (KMA), a clustering technique. Both techniques make few assumptions of data and are useful for examining growth or change in longitudinal data. The two statistical methods are described and illustrated with group counseling data. The relative strengths and weaknesses of each technique are discussed.

CT images used in this work are obtained from patients having the spontaneous intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The images are segmented into three tissue classes (skull, brain, and ICH) and the background. The method consists of two steps. In the the first step, the image is divided into a number of regions using the K-means clustering algorithm. Regions used are dark, medium dark and bright region. In the second step, the regions are labeled using the modified Hopfield neural network. The stable state of the network represents possible solution to the labeling problem. Simulated annealing is used as algorithm for network simulation.

First image sequence analysis is performed in order to estimate the shape and motion parameters of the person talking in front of the camera. For this purpose, we propose the K-Means with connectivity constraint algorithm as a general segmentation algorithm combining information of various types such as colour and motion. The algorithm is applied "hierarchically" in the image sequence and it is first used to separate the background from the foreground object and then to further segment the foreground object into the head and shoulders regions. Based on the above information, personal 3D shape parameters are estimated. The rigid 3D motion is estimated next for each sub-object. Finally a VRML file is created containing all the above estimated information.

In this paper, an heuristic pattern correction scheme based upon an hierarchical data partitioning principle is proposed for digit word recognition. This scheme is based upon General Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs) with initial centroid vectors obtained by graph theoretic data-pruning methods. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can perfectly correct the mis-classified patterns and hence improves the generalisation performance without affecting the old information. Moreover? it is also established that the initial setting of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) based upon graph theoretic data-pruning methods yields better performance than those obtained by k-means and Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ) methods.

However, most comparative studies have either been restricted to specific problem areas or have been conducted with other limitations that do not provide a more general evaluation of the relative abilities of these methods under a wide variety of conditions. This report provides a systematic empirical evaluation of the clustering abilities of k-means, moving methods and two commonly used self-organising neural network architectures, Monte Carlo simulation examining the effects of cluster shape, dimensionality, noise, dispersion and number of clusters in the data is used to evaluate the above methods. Results indicate that, on average, k-means, moving methods and 'winner take all' self-organising network; perform equally well in terms of clustering ability. However, as the moving method consistently converges faster than k-means, under circumstances where convergence speed is an important factor it may well represent a more appropriate benchmark for future comparisons between pattern partitioning methods.

The result of the early work by Phillips and Rosenfeld is dependent on the selection of initial partition, and the calculation of the principal axis of the data points needs many computations. To eliminate these shortcomings, we first propose an algorithm using an explicit initial partition according to the local property of distance deviation. This algorithm can obtain consistent and better results. Second, instead of computing the principal axis, a faster algorithm using a simpler line fitting method is presented. To determine the number of lines which approximate the given points automatically, another method using a useful criterion is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are feasible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Paal, J; Kullman, B; Huijser, HA				Paal, J; Kullman, B; Huijser, HA			Multivariate analysis of the Scutellinia umbrorum complex (Pezizales, Ascomycetes) from five ecotopes in the Netherlands	PERSOONIA			English	Article								The multivariate structure of the Scutellinia umbrorum complex (Pezizales, Ascomycetes), based on the morphometrical parameters of 81 specimens from five ecotopes in the Netherlands, was analysed. According to conventional expert estimation, five putative taxa resp. species were established: S. patagonica (Rehm) Gamundi, S. aff. subhirtella Svrcek S. umbrorum (Fr.) Lambotte, S. parvispora J. Moravec and S. subhirtella s. Kullman. These taxa form a taxonomic continuum hardly separable by traditional taxonomy. Five clusters obtained by UPGMA (with the generalized J-distance for mixed data as a measure of resemblance) are more distinct and in good accordance with ecological factors; some of them however, are statistically not well separated. The revision of the clusters' structure by k-means approach yields highly discontinuous clusters. The morphometric characters of specimens differ when going from open habitats to the forest. Differences are also revealed in phenology: the growing season starts in the forest later than in open habitats. The data are divided into two subsets according to spore ornamentation and spore width, the withingroup variation of either subset is caused mainly by the length of marginal hairs. On the basis of several statistical methods a supposition was introduced that the S. umbrorum complex probably consists of two polymorphic species, S. umbrorum (Fr.) Lambotte and S. subhirtella Svrcek s.l., with the mean value of marginal hairs longer than 450 mu m and shorter than 450 mu m, respectively. The UPGMA clusters can be interpreted as ecodemes of respective species.

An accurate extraction of left ventricle chambers is a crucial step towards cardiac dynamics analysis based on image sequences, a very much desired non-invasive technique for heart disease diagnosis and monitoring. The integrated approach aims at solving two major problems in cardiac image segmentation: imaging related ambiguity and anatomy related ambiguity. The K-means clustering with Gibb's random field constraints is able to resolve the imaging related ambiguity to obtain robust segmentation even when the intensity of the left ventricle exhibits spatially varying distribution. The active contour models incorporating a priori shape knowledge is able to resolve the anatomy related ambiguity to estimate the valve that separates the left ventricle from left atrium and aorta but is indistinguishable in the given images due to motion and partial volume effects. The fusion of the clustering and active contour models enables an integrated reconstruction of left ventricle chambers from the CT image sequences. Preliminary results show that the proposed scheme can produce extracted left ventricle chambers that compare favorably with the manually delineated chambers by a skilled operator. However, this proposed scheme is fast and reproducible.

It is based on a two level clustering scheme for robust decision tree state clustering. This approach extends the conventional segmental K-means approach to phonetic decision tree state tying based acoustic modeling. It achieves high recognition performances while reducing the model training time from days to hours comparing to the approaches based on Baum-Welch training. Experimental results on standard Resource Management and Wall Street Journal tasks are presented which demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of this approach.

This paper extends the concepts in [1] for template matching to a neural structure with capabilities for generalization. DAG-Learning is derived from concepts in Finite State Transducers, Hidden Markov Models, and Dynamic Time Warping to form an algorithmic framework within which many adaptive signal techniques such as Vector Quantization, K-Means, Approximation Networks, etc., may be extended to temporal recognition. The paper provides a concept of path-based learning to allow comparison among Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Finite State Transducers (FSTs) and DAG-Learning. The paper also outlines the DAG-Learning process and provides results from the DAG-Learning algorithm over test set of isolated cursive handwriting characters.

The approach is applied to a satellite UMTS channel composed of time invariant linear filters, a non-linear memoryless amplifier and a time varying multipath propagation channel. The neural network equalizer has a Radial Basis Function structure. The usual k-mean clustering algorithm is replaced by a Kohonen learning rule. This results in an RBF-SOM equalizer which outperforms the LMS equalizer, and which has better recovering abilities (after passing through a high fading area) than the former RBF equalizer.

Further, it is important to be able to use standard clinical acquisition sequences to maximize the possible impact of these measures. We introduce a method of segmentation for use on conventional spin-echo MR acquisitions with two echoes. Linear combinations of proton density and T(2)-weighted images enhance tissue types. These are then segmented using k-means clustering, an unsupervised classification algorithm. The segmentation occurs at two separate levels. The output of each level is combined to give a user-selected tissue type, i.e., grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), partial volume white/grey, and partial volume CSF/grey. The segmentation is reliable and has been tested on controls as well as patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

Measurements of the efficiency and utility of the three algorithms are presented using both the raw waveforms and the weightings of the first two principal components. Additionally, all three algorithms were tested with data obtained from electrophysiological experiments.

In what concerns sleep staging, the system consists of a three-step analysis. The first step is the recognition of elementary patterns in EEG (delta, alpha, spindle and K complex waves), EOG and ER IG, and spectral analysis for background activity. The second step is the determination of sleep stages based on these parameters. Automatic sleep scoring was performed using a multilayer feedforward network, The last step, is the supervision of the automatic decision using ambiguity rejection and coherence analysis. Finally, this work presents an automated system for micro arousals detection based on k means method. The system was validated with a data set including 20 hour of signal. Overall agreement between the computer and human judges indicates considerable reliability of the system.

This database can be a collection of individual signatures or a collection of average signatures distributed over the region of viewing aspect of interest. An efficient database is one which captures the intrinsic variability of the HRR signatures without either excessive redundancy (over-characterization) typical of single-signature databases or without the loss of information (under-characterization) common when averaging, arbitrary groups of signatures. The identification of "natural" clustering of similar HRR signatures provides a means for creating efficient databases of either individual signatures or of signature templates. Using a k-means and the Kohonen self-organizing feature net, we identify the natural clustering of the HRR radar range profiles into groups of similar signatures based on the match quality metric (Euclidean distance) used within a Vector Quantizer (VQ) classification algorithm. This greatly reduces the redundancy in such databases while retaining classification performance. Such clusters can be useful in template-based algorithms where groups of signatures are averaged to produce a template. Instead of basing the group of signatures to be averaged on arbitrary regions of viewing aspect, the averages are taken over the signatures contained in the natural clusters which have been identified. The benefits of applying natural cluster identification to individual-signature HRR data preparation are decreased algorithm memory and computational requirements with a consequent decrease in the time required to perform identification calculations. When applied to template databases the benefits are improved identification performance. This paper describes the techniques used for identifying HRR signature clusters and describes the statistical properties of such clusters.

The findings indicate high prevalence of anxiety during both the acute phase and after three months. However, during the long-term follow-up their anxiety decreased. The proportion of women with severe depression was relatively stable during the whole course. A K-mean cluster analysis identified four subgroups with different patterns of anxiety and depression. The findings indicate that pre-MI use of health services, quality of marital relationship, perceived social support and coping styles during the acute illness phase are significant predictors of emotional reactions in the sample.

J	Yuter, SE; Houze, RA				Yuter, SE; Houze, RA			The natural variability of precipitating clouds over the western Pacific warm pool	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						airborne observations; rainfall; TOGA COARE; tropical meteorology	MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; SQUALL-LINE; TOGA COARE; MICROPHYSICAL EVOLUTION; FLORIDA CUMULONIMBUS; TROPICAL CONVECTION; WATER-BUDGET; CLUSTERS; RAINFALL; RADAR	The natural variability of precipitating cloud systems over the western Pacific 'warm pool' is investigated by analysing aircraft C-band radar data collected on 24 aircraft missions during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment of the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere programme (TOGA COARE) in relation to the infrared (IR) temperature patterns measured contemporaneously by geosynchronous satellite. The data are analysed at fine (24 km x 24 km) and coarse (240 km diameter) horizontal resolutions, which correspond to typical resolutions of mesoscale and general-circulation models, respectively. The analysis is statistical and imposes no a priori conceptual model or subjectively decided-upon structure categories. The mean IR temperature of cloud tops, and the sizes of rain areas mapped by radar (and objectively subdivided into convective and stratiform subareas), are tallied and related to each other to obtain statistics representative of the four-month period of the TOGA COARE. At fine resolution the precipitation region underlying very cold cloud tops (<208 K) always contained stratiform precipitation and had less than a 50% probability of containing some amount of convective precipitation. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation, the area covered by all types of precipitation, and the area covered by stratiform precipitation all increased with decreasing mean IR temperature. In contrast, the area occupied by convective precipitation was independent of mean IR temperature. Over a period of sustained convective cell activity, the cells never instantaneously occupied more than a small fraction of the coarse area, and never more than 30% of a fine-grid element. However, as cells weakened they evolved into stratiform precipitation, and the stratiform region grew as each cell finished its active convective phase and was added to the stratiform area. The sustainability of convective cells over time thus determined the overall size of a precipitation area. Rain-area size did not correlate linearly with mean IR temperature nor any other statistical measure of the IR temperature pattern at coarse resolution. However, two-dimensional joint-probability distributions of mean IR temperature (a measure of cloud structure) and radar echo parameters (which measure precipitation structure) on the coarse scale yield insight into the natural variability of precipitation processes over the warm pool: most notably, large precipitation areas (>50% of a coarse area) tended to have low mean cloud-top temperatures (<235 K), and high mean cloud-top temperatures (>235 K) were associated with small precipitation areas (<50% of a coarse area). However, the converse of these two results was not true. Low mean cloud-top temperatures (<235 K) were associated with a wide range of precipitation areas from near 0 to 90% of a coarse area, and small precipitation areas (<20% of a coarse area) had mean IR temperatures ranging from 210-295 K. Once precipitation regions reached a large enough size (near 20% of a coarse area), the cloud systems were efficient at spreading ice outside of the boundaries of the precipitation regions. Larger rain areas (>20% of a coarse area) were predominantly stratiform (>75% by area and >50% by rainfall amount). Precipitating cold clouds (containing ice) with stratiform area fractions <50% were not observed. During active phases of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO), the probability that there were no satellite-observable clouds within a coarse-resolution area of the aircraft sample was practically zero (maximum mean IR temperature never >286 K), while during suppressed phases the near or total absence of clouds was common. Large rain areas with very cold cloud tops were common under active conditions but not under suppressed conditions. The large rain areas with very cold cloud tops (>20% of the coarse area and <235 K mean IR temperature) occurred primarily during the active phase and were 75-100% stratiform by area and >70% by rain fraction. In the suppressed phases, stratiform rain fractions varied widely since most of the rainfall was associated with small precipitation areas. Although the joint-probability distributions differ substantially between active and suppressed phases of the ISO, the overall precipitation-area size is not strongly related to wind speed, wind direction, or thermodynamic variables, as seen in the storm inflow soundings obtained by the TOGA COARE aircraft.

A case study in Arizona is presented to illustrate the methodology The input variables of the FRBM consist of the monthly CPs and lagged Southern Oscillation Index (SOT) data; the output of the model is an estimate of local extreme precipitation. The daily Cps have been previously defined over the western United States by an automated clustering method, namely, principal component analysis coupled with K-means clustering. The SOI data has been divided into three fuzzy groups, representing the El Nino, normal, and La Nina years. The local extreme precipitation consists of monthly total precipitation from different Arizona precipitation stations. After defining and analyzing the basic properties of the extremes, a fuzzy rule-based model is constructed, and the results are interpreted and then compared with that of a multivariate linear regression model (MLRM). Using two goodness fit criteria, first the root mean squared error (RMSE) and then the correlation between the model results and the observed values, the FRBM is found to perform better than the MLR for capturing the properties of extreme precipitation events in Arizona.

The k-means clustering algorithm is combined with the MAP filter in order to cluster pixels with similar statistics (Changle Li's variance ratio). Assigned to each cluster there is a window size which is used to estimate the filter parameters. Several densities such as gaussian, gamma, chi-square, exponential, and Rayleigh were used as "a priori" model.

The proposed framework has been implemented within the Sigma ynergos system, a powerful imaging laboratory that includes, among other features, tools for performance assessment of computer vision techniques, image databases, real-time processing by using distributed systems and interface with the Internet. The motivations for the development of such a framework: (i) the importance of biological shape analysis; (ii) its potential as an effective tool for the systematic assessment of image processing and analysis techniques; and (iii) the possibility of conducting extensive characterizations of biological shapes. The paper describes an experiment to assess multiscale shape features for complexity characterization, which have been adopted for the classification of two types of ganglion neural cells (cat), namely alpha and beta. This experiment involves: (1) a training stage where the k-means clustering algorithm learns the prototypes of each class from the database; (2) the neurons in the database are classified; (3) the classification results are compared to the original classes; and (4) the number of misclassifications is determined. The genetic algorithm is used as a means of effectively investigating the N-dimensional spaces defined by the parameter configurations.

In this paper, we propose a theoretical justification for the loss in performance of slowly moving targets in regions of benign clutter. In particular, a K-means segmentation technique is developed using a fixed number of classes and a variety of local scene features. This class map is used by a 3-D matched filter to estimate a covariance matrix for each region. The filter would then whiten each region using the appropriate class map. The algorithm is applied in this paper to actual sensor data which contains heterogeneous scenes taken from the Airborne Infrared Measurement Systems (AIRMS) sensor. Performance is assessed through the measure of SNRs and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on a suite of injected targets.

J	Kulkarni, A; Kripalani, RH				Kulkarni, A; Kripalani, RH			Rainfall patterns over India: Classification with fuzzy c-means method	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURES	Seasonal (June through September) percentage departure from normal rainfall patterns over India for the period 1871-1994 have been classified using Fuzzy c-means method (FCM) to identify the dominant modes of spatiotemporal variability in the Indian monsoon rainfall. Unlike the hard clustering methods, for example the Map-to-Map (MM) correlation method and the k-means (KM) clustering method, this method does not force a pattern to get classified into only one cluster but assigns varying membership to every cluster. Thus marginal patterns get classified into all clusters with different memberships. Patterns for the 124-year period are represented by the four dominant clusters. The spatial patterns associated with the extreme (deficient/excess) Indian monsoon rainfall (IMR) get high membership in one of the clusters only, while the patterns associated with the normal LMR get almost equal membership to all clusters. Even the spatial patterns during the El Nino/La Nina episodes show high preference to a particular cluster. Time variation of each cluster shows that there are epochs where a particular cluster dominates. Possible dynamic causes leading to the clusters are examined. Merits and demerits of the FCM method are also discussed.

The splats were obtained by plasma spraying alumina fused and crushed particles (- 45 + 22 mu m). The model has shown that for more than 160-200 mu m layered splats the solidification time is over 7-10 mu s. When spraying thin passes (e(p) < 15 mu m) each splat cools down to substrate preheating temperature before next splat impacts. On the contrary for thick passes (e(p) = 60 or 180 mu m), after depositing a certain thickness (between 160 and 200 mu m) depending on spraying conditions, the temperature of the splats never drops below 800-900 K (mean splat temperature). In this case nucleation occurs after flattening is completed. Such conditions allow a columnar growth through the layered splats of each pass and successive passes. The study of the corresponding stresses (quenching sigma(q) and expansion mismatch) generated when spraying alumina on XC38 sheet was measured by following continuously the bending of a beam. The comparison of the measurements with the results of a 1D model developed by Tsui and Clyne has allowed to calculate the coating Young's modulus E-d and the residual stresses difference at the interface. For thin coatings sigma(q) and E-d increase with preheating temperature. For thick coatings the values of E-d and sigma(q) are lower than the highest ones of thin coatings. This is probably due to stress relaxation by cracks propagation, the quenching and expansion mismatch stresses increasing with the increasing mean splat temperature.

By using the qualitative data interpretation method that is base upon k-means clustering method, qualitative information of the process is extracted. Quantitative information of the process is extracted by NLPCA, that is based on functional-link-associative neural network which has more enhanced learning and generalization capabilities than autoassociative neural network. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated using its application to the water supply unit of a utility boiler plant.

Clustering techniques are very common and useful in image processing and pattern recognition, especially. for unsupervised initial segmentation of images. Images always contain some imprecise, uncertain or ambiguous regions and structures. Fuzzy sets constitute a good framework to represent and take into account these imprecisions(16). Their use leads to image processing methods where binary decisions are not taken at intermediate levels, where only partial information is available. As mentioned by Bloch (3) the usage of fuzzy sets in image processing relies on two different approaches - symbolic, where decision rules are derived from fuzzy logic, and numerical, where fuzzy sets directly represent the spatial structure of the image. Our work combines these two approaches.

This is a common problem that is encountered in home videos. We propose a hierarchical key-frame summarization algorithm where a coarse-to-fine key-frame summary is generated. A hierarchical key-frame summary facilitates multi-level browsing where the user can quickly discover the content of the video by accessing its coarsest but most compact summary and then view a desired segment of the video with increasingly more detail. At the finest level, the summary is generated on the basis of color features of video frames, using an extension of a recently proposed key-frame extraction algorithm. The finest level key-frames are recursively clustered using a novel pairwise K-means clustering approach with temporal consecutiveness constraint. We also address summarization of MPEG-2 compressed video without fully decoding the bitstream. We also propose efficient mechanisms that facilitate decoding the video when the hierarchical summary is utilized in browsing and playback of video segments starting at selected key-frames.

Twelve FD features are computed based on twelve filtered versions of the original image using directional Gabor filters. Features are computed in a window and mapped to the central pixel of this window. An iterative K-means-based algorithm which includes feature smoothing and takes into consideration the boundaries between textures is used to segment an image into a desired number of clusters. This approach is partially supervised since the number of clusters has to be predefined. The fractal features are compared to Gabor energy features and the iterative K-means algorithm is compared to the original K-means clustering approach. The performance of segmentation for noisy images is also studied.

The contradiction might be caused by the use of inadequate criteria. To find out the discriminant items for efficient evaluation, 50 operated and 43 conservative treated radius fractures are analyzed. The radiological findings (radioulnar index, frontal and sagittal angles) were classified with k-means clustering into four groups defining the quality of the anatomical results. These groups enabled to search a correlation between the restoration of the anatomy and some functional item that might influence the outcome. No other potential disturbing factor as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), neurological problems or primary intraarticular fracture was taken into account. Our findings show that an anatomical restoration gives significantly better results (p=0.004). However, no evident clinical data, except mobility, seemed to correlate with the subjective results. Scoring systems, introducing indiscriminant items, might impair efficient clinical research. In addition, primary use of classification systems to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment might no! be the appropriate mean.

On the basis of five clinical factors: age of onset of dependence, history of familial alcoholism: severity of alcohol-related problems and the prevalence of psychiatric and somatic diseases, K-means cluster analysis delineated three types of alcoholics. Type 1 was characterized by late onset of dependence, low prevalence of familial alcoholism and mild course. Type 2 was characterized by early onset of dependence, high familial alcoholism in fathers, frequent antisocial personality, severe intensity of alcohol-related problems. Type 3 was characterized by early onset of dependence, familial history of psychiatric diseases, severe intensity of alcohol-related problems and high prevalence of psychiatric disturbances and somatic diseases. Type 3 may be characterized as alcoholism associated with high predisposition and comorbidity. This may make a distinct type of male alcoholics. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

J	Popper, SE				Popper, SE			Validity of using non-pilot subjects to represent pilots in a sustained acceleration environment	AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							PERSONALITY; AVIATION	Background: A preliminary study determined the similarities between the personality of military pilots (transport and fighter) and centrifuge subjects using the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS). Past, similar personality studies have shown differences between military fighter vs. transport pilots, and general population vs. male and female general aviators. To use subjects in lieu of pilots in the centrifuge, they must represent the pilot characteristics of interest, for both ethical and scientific reasons. With the increase in measuring performance metrics (e.g., reaction time, tracking tasks, missile evasion) during centrifuge testing, any factor effecting performance must be explored. It is unknown whether personality effects performance. Methods: Cluster analysis of 36 pilot and subject personality tests consisted of the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) program by Leonard Kaufman and Peter Rousseeuw (10) and Ward's method/K-MEANS clustering (CSS:STATISTICA). Results:: The clusters generated by the 36 pilots and subjects did not match the Retzlaff and Gibertini (21) clusters. Two clusters were preferred over three, and while the values of the personality variables Dominance, Exhibition, and Aggression (DOM, EXH, ACC) were similar, the pilot membership did not coincide. Subjects had basically the same cluster characteristics as pilots and did not alter the pilot cluster composition characteristics when clustered together. Females did not appear to differ from the males in the cluster analysis. Clustering did not differentiate between fighter and transport pilots using the chosen variables. Conclusion: These preliminary results support the hypothesis that there are no major differences in personality between fighter pilots, transport pilots, or centrifuge subjects using the EPPS.

J	Tominaga, Y; Fujiwara, I				Tominaga, Y; Fujiwara, I			Data structure comparison using fractal analysis	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						fractal analysis; data management; clustering	DIVERSITY	Fractal analysis is useful to describe complex structures. We directed our attention to the complexity of the structure of a dataset including many thousands of samples, and introduced fractal analysis to the comparison of dataset structures. The fractal dimensions of representative subsets of the datasets that were selected using nonhierachical clustering technique (combination of leader algorithm and MacQueen's k-means method) and randomly selected subsets were estimated using a box counting method. We compared fractal dimensions of all subsets with the fractal dimension of the original dataset. The representative subsets selected by the clustering method showed more similar fractal dimensions to those of the original dataset when compared to randomly selected subsets.

The Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Teacher Rating Scales for Children (TRS-C) norming data were collected for 1,227 six-to eleven-year-old children at 116 sites representing various regions of the United Stares. The TRS-C has 148 items that are rated by the teacher on a 4-point scale of frequency, ranging from Never to Almost always. The Ward method of cluster analysis was used to identify the initial centroids or cluster seeds. An iterative clustering method, a K-means procedure, was used to refine the Ward cluster solution. A seven-cluster solution was selected based on both rational and empirical considerations. The resulting clusters were named well-adapted, average, learning disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, physical complaints and worry, severe psychopathology, and mildly disruptive. The seven-cluster solution resembles those of Achenbach (1991), Curry and Thompson (1985), and other researchers. The resulting typology points the way toward future cluster studies of child psychopathology by delineating additional research and theoretical questions.

The relationship between microalbuminuria and several cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage was evaluated in a large cohort of untreated essential hypertensive patients. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin to creatinine ratio in three non consecutive first morning urine samples. Cardiac damage was evaluated by ECG and retinal vascular changes by direct ophtalmoscopy. Ln a subgroup of 23 patients with Mi and in a control group of 22 normoalbuminurics, selected from the entire cohort of patients and carefully matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and duration of disease, we also measured left ventricular mass index by M-B mode echocardiography, common carotid wall thickness by high resolution US-scan, and renal vascular resistances by US-doppler of interlobar arteries. K-means cluster analysis performed on the entire cohort of patients showed that microalbuminuria is associated with the presence of an unfavorable risk profile and target organ damage. Furthermore, microalbuminuric hypertensive patients have a larger left ventricular mass index, increased intima media thickness of carotid arteries and higher intrarenal vascular resistances as compared to a well matched group of normoalbuminuric patients. We conclude that in essential hypertension increased urinary albumin excretion can be useful to identify patients for whom more aggressive preventive strategies and/or additional treatment measures are advisable.

Selim and Ismail's (1984) objective function for k-means clustering is generalized in the convergence proof of the self-organizing map. It is shown that when the neighborhood relation is doubly decreasing, order in the map is preserved. An unordered map becomes ordered when a degenerate state of ordering is entered, where the number of distinct winners is one or two. One strategy to enter this state is to run the algorithm with a broad neighborhood relation.

Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in three nonconsecutive, first morning urine samples. The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 6.7%. Albuminuric patients were more likely to be men and to be characterized by higher blood pressure, body mass index, and uric acid levels and lower HDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol-to-LDL cholesterol ratio. Piecewise linear regression analysis demonstrated that uric acid and diastolic blood pressure significantly influence albuminuria and together account for a large part of its variations. K-means cluster analysis performed on the entire cohort of patients confirmed that microalbuminuria is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk profile. Furthermore, microalbuminuria was associated with the presence of target organ damage (eg, electrocardiographic [EGG] abnormalities and retinal vascular changes). Age and the presence of microalbuminuria act as independent risk factors for the development of ECG abnormalities and retinal vascular changes. Cluster analysis allowed us to identify three subgroups of patients who differed in the presence or absence of microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and ECG abnormalities. We conclude that the prevalence of microalbuminuria in essential hypertension is lower than previously reported. Increased urinary albumin excretion is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk profile and is a concomitant indicator of early target organ damage.

In particular, we propose two key modifications to a recent motion segmentation algorithm developed by Wang and Adelson. 1) The adaptive k-means clustering step is replaced by a merging step, whereby the affine parameters of a block which has the smallest representation error, rather than the respective cluster center, is used to represent each layer; and 2) we implement it in multiple stages, where pixels belonging to a single motion model are labeled at each stage. Performance improvement due to the proposed modifications is demonstrated on real video frames.

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by k-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application.

J	Locke, RE; Nerbonne, JM				Locke, RE; Nerbonne, JM			Three kinetically distinct Ca2+-independent depolarization-activated K+ currents in callosal-projecting rat visual cortical neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							FLUORESCENT LATEX MICROSPHERES; INACTIVATING POTASSIUM CURRENT; THALAMIC RELAY NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; OUTWARD CURRENT; GUINEA-PIG; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; SENSORY NEURONS; CELLS; CORTEX	Whole cell, Ca2+-independent, depolarization-activated K+ currents were characterized in identified callosal-projecting (CP) neurons isolated from postnatal day 7-16 rat primary visual cortex. CP neurons were identified in vitro after in vivo retrograde labeling with fluorescently tagged latex microbeads. During brief (160-ms) depolarizing voltage steps to potentials between -50 and +60 mV, outward K+ currents in these cells activate rapidly and inactivate to varying degrees. Three distinct K+ currents were separated based on differential sensitivity to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP); these are referred to here as I-A, I-D, and I-K, because their properties are similar (but not identical) K+ currents termed I-A, I-D, and I-K in other cells. The current sensitive to high (greater than or equal to 100 mu M) concentrations of 4-AP (I-A) activates and inactivates rapidly; the current blocked completely by low (less than or equal to 50 mu M) 4-AP (I-D) activates rapidly and inactivates slowly. A slowly activating, slowly inactivating current (I-K) remains in the presence of 5 mM 4-AP. I-A, I-D, and I-K also were separated and characterized in experiments that did not rely on the use of 4-AP. All CP cells express all three K+ current types, although the relative densities of I-A, I-D, and I-K vary among cells. The experiments here also have revealed that I-A, I-D, and I-K display similar voltage dependences of activation and steady state inactivation, whereas the kinetic properties of the currents an distinct. At +30 mV, for example, mean +/- SD activation tau s are 0.83 +/- 0.24 ms for I-A, 1.74 +/- 0.49 ms for I-D, and 14.7 +/- 4.0 ms for I-K. Mean +/- SD inactivation tau s for I-A and I-D are 26 +/- 7 ms and 569 +/- 143 ms, respectively. Inactivation of I-K is biexponential with mean +/- SD inactivation time constants of 475 +/- 232 ms and 3,128 +/- 1,328 ms; similar to 20% of the 4-AP-insensitive current is noninactivating. For all three components, activation is voltage dependent, increasing with increasing depolarization, whereas inactivation is voltage independent. Both I-A and I-K recover rapidly from steady state inactivation with mean +/- SD recovery time constants of 38 +/- 7 ms and 79 +/- 26 ms, respectively; I-D recovers an order of magnitude more slowly (588 +/- 274 ms). The properties of I-A, I-D, and I-K in CP neurons are compared with these of similar currents described previously in other mammalian central neurons and, in the accompanying paper, the roles of these conductances in regulating the firing properties of CP neurons are explored.

Two cases studies are presented, both considering only plant data. For two classes of process data, a neural network and a K-Means classifier both produced excellent diagnoses. Extending the study to include three additional classes of plant operation, a neural network again gave accurate classifications, while a K-Means classifier failed to correctly categorise the data. Principal components analysis is used to visualise data clusters. The robustness of the neural networks was found to be generally good. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Chaudhuri, D; Chaudhuri, BB				Chaudhuri, D; Chaudhuri, BB			A novel multiseed nonhierarchical data clustering technique	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						classification minimal spanning tree; multiseed clustering; pattern recognition		Clustering techniques such as K-means and Forgy as well as their improved version ISODATA group data around one seed point for each cluster. It is well known that these methods do not work well if the shape of the cluster is elongated or nonconvex. We argue that for a elongated or nonconvex shaped cluster, more than one seed is needed, In this paper a multiseed clustering algorithm is proposed. A density based representative point selection algorithm is used to choose the initial seed points. To assign several seed points to one cluster, a minimal spanning tree guided novel technique is proposed. Also, a border point detection algorithm is proposed for the detection of shape of the cluster. This border in turn signifies whether the cluster is elongated or not. Experimental results show the efficiency of this clustering technique.		Chaudhuri, D (reprint author), INDIAN STAT INST,COMP VIS & PATTERN RECOGNIT UNIT,CALCUTTA 700035,W BENGAL,INDIA.

J	Tarpey, T				Tarpey, T			Estimating principal points of univariate distributions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article								The term 'principal points' originated in a problem of determining 'typical' heads for the design of protection masks, as described by Flury. Two principal points in the mask example correspond to a small and a large size. Principal points are cluster means for theoretical distributions, and sample cluster means from a k-means algorithm are non-parametric estimators of principal points. This paper demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimators and semi-parametric estimators based on symmetry constraints typically perform much better than the k-means estimators. Asymptotic results on the efficiency of these estimators of two principal points for Jour symmetric univariate distributions are given. Simulation results are provided to examine the performance of the estimators for finite sample sizes. Finally, the different estimators of two principal points are compared using the head dimension data for the design of protection masks.

The segmented regions are fuzzy subsets, with soft partitions characterizing the region boundaries. The validity of the assumptions and thresholding schemes are investigated in the presence of distinct region proportions. The hard k means and fuzzy c means algorithms have been found useful when object and background regions are well balanced. Fuzzy thresholding is also formulated as extraction of normal densities to provide optimal partitions. Regional imbalances in gray distributions are taken care of in region normalized histograms.

The algorithm effectively groups a given set of data into an optimum number of clusters. The proposed method is applicable for clustering tasks where clusters are crisp and spherical. This algorithm determines the number of clusters and the cluster centers in such a way that locally optimal solutions are avoided. The result of the algorithm does not depend critically on the choice of the initial cluster centers. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Nodes are sequentially removed using an increment of error variance criterion. The procedure is terminated by using a prediction risk criterion so as to obtain a model structure with good generalisation properties. The algorithm can be used to postprocess radial basis centres selected using a k-means routine and, in this mode, it provides a hybrid supervised centre selection approach.

Patients who presented with a previous condition or who had undergone surgery to the wrist were excluded. History, clinical findings, standard radiographs and arthrography were correlated with the uninjured side and with arthroscopic findings. The radiolunate (RL) angle of the injured wrist differed significantly form that of the ''normal'' wrist (p = 0.008). Possible correlations within the whole group were studied by multivariate analysis, particularly k-means clustering, a procedure which enables the detection of natural groups. We found that ligamentous tears at the triquetrum in the midcarpal joint significantly (p = 0.004) affected the equilibrium of the proximal row defined by clustering with the RL and scapholunate (SL) angles. The use of multivariate analysis techniques in combination with cross tabulation for the survey of intracarpal Ligamentous abnormalities seen at arthroscopy might help us to define better the function of the ligaments of the wrist.

J	Moiseenko, VV; Walker, AJ; Prestwich, WV				Moiseenko, VV; Walker, AJ; Prestwich, WV			Energy deposition pattern from tritium and different energy photons - A comparative study	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						tritium; photons; Monte Carlo; radiation, beta	QUALITY FACTOR; X-RAYS; RADIATION; RISK	Energy deposition patterns of beta particles from tritium decay have been analyzed in comparison with photon radiation in the energy range from 12 to 1250 keV. Energy deposition was modeled by Monte Carlo means using electron tracks in water vapor with a complete follow up of delta electrons. Ionizations have been used as representative of track structure. Frequencies of clusters on a nanometer scale and their spatial distribution in spherical targets representing cell nuclei have been derived. Cluster analysis has been carried out by implementing a k-means method. Frequencies of ionization clusters from tritium are similar to 60-100 keV photons. Spatial distribution of clusters from tritium closely match similar to 70 keV photons up to 2 mu m separation.

J	Sutanto, EL; Mason, JD; Warwick, K				Sutanto, EL; Mason, JD; Warwick, K			Mean-tracking clustering algorithm for radial basis function centre selection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article							NETWORKS; NUMBER	Radial basis functions can be combined into a network structure that has several advantages over conventional neural network solutions. However, to operate effectively the number and positions of the basis function centres must be carefully selected. Although no rigorous algorithm exists for this purpose, several heuristic methods have been suggested. In this paper a new method is proposed in which radial basis function centres are selected by the mean-tracking clustering algorithm. The mean-tracking algorithm is compared with k means clustering and it is shown that it achieves significantly better results in terms of radial basis function performance. As well as being computationally simpler, the mean-tracking algorithm in general selects better centre positions, thus providing the radial basis functions with better modelling accuracy.

J	Chaturvedi, A; Carroll, JD; Green, PE; Rotondo, JA				Chaturvedi, A; Carroll, JD; Green, PE; Rotondo, JA			A feature-based approach to market segmentation via overlapping K-centroids clustering	JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BENEFIT SEGMENTATION; ADCLUS MODEL; MAPCLUS; INDCLUS	Nonhierarchical partitioning techniques are used widely in many marketing applications, particularly in the clustering of consumers, as opposed to brands. These techniques can be extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers, which might result in misinterpretations of the segments, and subsequently to inferring incorrect relationships of segments to independently defined, actionable variables. The authors propose a general approach to market segmentation based on the concept of over-lapping clusters (Shepard and Arabie 1979), wherein each pattern of overlap can be interpreted as a distinct partition. Both K-means and K-medians clustering procedures are special cases of the proposed approach. The suggested procedure can handle relatively large data sets (e.g., 2000 entities), is easily programmable, and hence can be gainfully employed in marketing research.

This work is supposed to derive a nearly complete list of corresponding properties concerning the cdf's and some related functions for Beta as well as for central and non-central Chi-square and F distributions, where hitherto only partial results were available. To this end we introduce a generalized reproductive property, thereby extending the relationships between total positivity of order 2, log-concavity and reproductivity developed in Das Gupta and Sarkar (1984). The key to our results are log-concavity properties of the non-central Chi-square distribution with zero degrees of freedom introduced by Siegel (1979). Finally one of the results for the central F distribution is used to solve a monotonicity problem for a stepwise multiple F-test procedure for all pairwise comparisons of k means.

J	Zhang, XB; Wang, XLL; CorteReal, J				Zhang, XB; Wang, XLL; CorteReal, J			On the relationships between daily circulation patterns and precipitation in Portugal	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL PRESSURE; WEATHER PATTERNS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIMES; TEMPERATURES; VARIABILITY; ANOMALIES	Daily circulation (sea level pressure) maps over east Atlantic-Europe were classified into six circulation patterns (CPs) by using k-means clustering coupled with principal component analysis. The relationships between winter monthly rainfall in Portugal and the occurrence frequencies of the CPs were also examined. The CP classification scheme is effective not only in discriminating regional wet/dry weather conditions, but also in differentiating between various conditions associated with different precipitation intensities. For southern Portugal, CP6 and CP3 are the wettest patterns: under their presence the rainfall occurrence probability and the rainy day rainfall intensity are twice as high as those associated with the dry CPs; with only about 26.6% occurrence probability the two wet CPs together contribute about 66.8% of the total rainfall. For northern Portugal, CP6 and CP4 turned out to be the wettest patterns. They produce over 60% of the total rainfall with only 31% chance of occurrence. In terms of long-term variation the precipitation is also intimately related to the occurrence frequencies of the CPs. The occurrence frequencies of CPs were found to be good predictors for the regional precipitation. In addition, it is evident that the decrease of March rainfall throughout the country in the last 3 decades has been a consequence of a reduction in the occurrence frequency of the wettest circulation pattern, CP6, which coincides with the upward trend of the North Atlantic Oscillation index and could be related to the northeastward shifting and strengthening of the Azores High.

Continuous classification yields a separate map of class membership values for every class the dominance of any class at each location can be expressed by a confusion index, CI. If spatial correlation is strong, zones of high CI are concentrated in narrow geographical transition zones between locally dominant classes: these zones can be refined to delineate automatically class-specific boundaries. If spatial correlation in membership values is weak then broad zones of large values of CI occur all over the map. Simulation modelling and two case studies demonstrate that contiguity in geographical space is more important for successful mapping than attribute class compactness. The studies show that soil information systems must take the spatial aspects of soil variation into account; further improvements in identifying and mapping significant soil groupings should be possible using numerical models of soil processes together with the methods presented here.

This mismatch between aggregation levels is particularly detrimental in the context of precision agriculture. It is argued that, in order to bridge the gap, soil distribution modelling should be based on a new classification paradigm: that of fuzzy set theory. In geographic space, this enables representation of gradual as well as abrupt transitions, i.e., soil distribution models that can predict variables at pedon level. In a case study we used fuzzy k-means with extragrades to derive a continuous classification from data on thicknesses of 25 layers measured in 552 soil profiles. For interpolation of the class memberships we developed a new method, Compositional Kriging, which takes into account that the memberships have the structure of compositional data: they must be positive and add up to a constant (1) for each individual. These conditions were added to the regular Kriging equations. For cartographic representation of the continuous soil distribution models we developed a new technique, the Pixel Mixture technique, by which we generated a large number of small coloured pixels in each raster cell of the map. The colours of the pixels symbolize the classes, and the proportions of iso-coloured pixels in a cell symbolize the grades of the class memberships as predicted for that cell. The combination of continuous classification and Compositional Kriging convincingly bridged the gap between aggregation levels, and with the aid of the Pixel Mixture technique the resulting soil distribution model could also be visualized at the appropriate level of aggregation. The continuous soil map showed bath the general landscape structure, as well as the varying degree of variability within the study area. Based on this multi-purpose continuous soil model, functional models of soil processes and land-use effects can be developed.

Lack of spatial contiguity and overlap in data space render conventional numerical methods for soil and landscape classification unreliable. Fuzzy k-means with extragrades have been used to create a spatially coherent classification of fields for a test area in Roujan (Herault, Languedoc). Several different classifications were tested for geographical coherency using the Geary contiguity coefficient. The stability of the classes was also tested using a less precise data set for characterizing the same fields. To test the usefulness of this approach, the best classification was used to allocate fields from a larger area adjacent to the test site to the established classes. The increase in extragrade sites is used as a measure of robustness, representativity and transferability of the classification. Our,results show that a fuzzy classification gives systematically better mappable and less error-sensitive clusters than a classical crisp classification. Furthermore, it provides more information, particularly concerning the representativity of the elementary catchment.

This study focuses on a strip of land which was sampled at three different depths. Fuzzy classification by fuzzy k-means was used to analyze the spatial variability for each separate layer. The concentrations of heavy metals showed abrupt changes in geographical space and the coefficients of variation were high, but in most of the area more gradual transitions in concentrations of heavy metals were found. To avoid undesirable fragmentation in the classification, i.e. a lot of small pieces of land, spatial variability is used by including additional predicted values of Cu, Pb and Zn representing spatial correlation in the horizontal and Vertical plane. Membership values are interpolated for each class by ordinary kriging. For all situations the different maps are integrated into a final classification map with associated impurity map.

J	Gath, I; Iskoz, AS; VanCutsem, B				Gath, I; Iskoz, AS; VanCutsem, B			Data induced metric and fuzzy clustering of non-convex patterns of arbitrary shape	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						data induced metric; non-convex patterns; arbitrary closed shapes; fuzzy clustering		In the present study a method is developed for partitional clustering of non-convex clusters, the geometry of which can not be analytically described. A new approach, based on the principle of Data Induced Metric (DIM), is introduced, and distance is defined as medium-dependent, in analogy to propagation of light rays in optics. Distance is computed using graph theoretic techniques, measuring the shortest paths in a weighted graph. The DIM principle is implemented to construct two new algorithms, the Modified Fuzzy k-Means (MFKM) algorithm, and the Stepping algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on several synthetic data sets, as well as on real data sets, and are shown to be valuable for partitioning of non-convex clusters of arbitrary shape.

Using K-means cluster analysis, 3,644 codas were categorized based on the number of clicks and their patterning. There were 30 resulting types of coda. The numbers of codas of the different types recorded were used to construct repertoires for each recording session, day, group of whales, place, area, and ocean. Strong group-specific dialects, which seem to persist over periods of years, were apparent, overlaid on weaker geographical variation. Significant differences in repertoire were found between the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean. Sperm whales now join killer whales (Orcinus orca) as the only cetacean species in which dialects (differences in vocal repertoire among neighboring, potentially interacting groups) have been found.

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor like tuned modulated basis filters. We have chosen scale-changeable exponential bases of compact support to derive such filters. It is seen that the tuned modulated basis filters closely approximate the Gabor elementary function. Perfect reconstruction of the input image from its filtered images is shown. Computation and storage requirements are considerably reduced. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of ''energy'' in a window around each pixel. The simple K-means algorithm is used to produce segmentation. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Biserrula pelecinus; hard-seededness; Mediterranean pasture legumes; morphological characterization	ANNUAL MEDICS MEDICAGO; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; SEED; GERMINATION; DYNAMICS; PASTURE; SYRIA	A collection of 29 populations of Biserrula pelecinus L. (biserrula) from Italy (Sardinia), Spain, France (Corsica), Morocco and Greece was evaluated in nursery rows at Perth, Western Australia. Fifteen morphological traits were recorded and chromosome numbers of representative populations were counted. The quantitative characters were analysed using principal component analysis and k-means clustering. The chromosome number of all accessions was 2n = 2x = 16. In other respects there was substantial variation in biserrula collected from the Mediterranean basin, the Moroccan populations in particular being distinct, some with strongly curved pods and others with long linear pods. All Greek populations had white flowers and large seeds. Populations from Italy, France and Spain were similar, with linear pods, blue flowers and smaller seeds. Most populations From Morocco were early flowering, had larger leaves, longer pods and produced more seeds per plant than other populations. All populations were extremely hard-seeded (>98% hard-seeded after a one-summer exposure on the soil surface). It was concluded that there is sufficient variation in Mediterranean populations of biserrula to initiate a selection programme for southern Australia, and other areas with Mediterranean-type climates, especially for areas where serradella (Ornithopus compressus L.) is adapted. Seed production is far easier than for serradella, and this advantage alone offers potential for its use in duplex soils where the deep rooting habit of serradella gives it an ecological advantage over conventional pasture legumes.

To obtain these distribution functions an inverse integral transformation is performed numerically by the program CONTIN with the integral adsorption equation. It employs the constrained regularization technique with a smoothing regularizer favoring parsimony of the solution and an automatic adjustment of the regularization strength by the statistical F test. A Langmuir equation as local isotherm is additionally built in the code for the first time so that CONTIN is now a very convenient and handy tool for the calculation of model independent kinetic and affinity spectra. Bimodal kinetic spectra are observed where the main process (80%) is the binding of Cd2+ at the outer surface. The mean rate coefficient k(mean) is 11 s(-1) at 25 degrees C and the HWHH of the distribution function of about 0.1 log k units proves the considerable degree of heterogeneity. An inner sphere complex is formed that is controlled by the ion exchange reaction itself, not by diffusion, as proven by temperature dependent measurements. The more heterogeneous slow process is caused by aggregation of the platelets and intercalation of Cd2+ into the interlayer space. A broad monomodal affinity spectrum is found with a mean value of log K-ex,K-mean = 0.5 and an asymmetry to the low affinity side. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

We include a detailed study of optimal regions, showing that only nonpathological regions can arise from impartial trimming procedures. The asymptotic results provided in the paper focus on strong consistency of the suggested methods under widely general conditions. A section is devoted to exploring the performance of the procedure to detect anomalous data in simulated data sets.

J	Gunnarsson, J; Wahlund, R				Gunnarsson, J; Wahlund, R			Household financial strategies in Sweden: An exploratory study	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						saving behaviour; household portfolios; life-cycle; attitudes	SAVINGS	The paper presents and discusses some results from an exploratory study of Swedish households' portfolio behaviour, The results show that groups of households exhibit different patterns of financial assets and debts, These patterns have been called financial strategies. The study was based on a survey with 1,000 randomly sampled Swedish households. The response rate was 50.3%. K-means cluster analysis of 35 standardised dichotomous variables measuring different forms of savings and debts was used to examine the existence of different types of financial strategies. The strategies were labelled the residual saving strategy (45.5% of the analysed households), the contractual saving strategy (22.0%), the security saving strategy (14.0%), the risk hedging strategy (9.3%), the prudent investing strategy (3.2%) and 'divergent' strategies (6.0%). Among the factors differing between the different types of financial strategies were time preferences, degree of financial planning and control, interest in financial matters, activity and innovativeness, attitudes towards financial risk taking, propensity to save, life-cycle categories, financial wealth and home ownership.

Symptoms are often multiple and patients report different symptoms, Neuropsychological deficits are also not uniform in patients with PCS, This variability of presentation may signify different patterns of symptoms and deficits, We studied the patterns of association between symptoms and neuropsychological deficits through cluster analysis, Ward's method of hierarchical clustering was followed by K-means partitioning method. Five clusters grouped the neuropsychological deficits into core cognitive domains, The core cognitive domains were either at the elementary level of cognitive functioning or at a system level of cognitive functioning, Different symptoms were associated with different deficits in the elementary and system level cognitive domains, Disruption of neural networks arising out of head injury was hypothesized to be the basis for the association between the symptoms and the cognitive deficits.

In this paper, the part family formation problem is considered. The problem is cast into a hard clustering model, and the K-means algorithm is proposed for solving it. Preliminary computational experience on the algorithm is very encouraging and it shows that real-life problems of large sizes can efficiently be handled by this approach.

To date, however, no systematic comparison of the geographic variation of NIDDM among black populations has been undertaken. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - In the course of an international collaborative study on cardiovascular disease, we used a standardized protocol to determine the rates of NIDDM and associated risk factors in populations of the African diaspora. Representative samples were drawn from sites in Nigeria, St. Lucia, Barbados, Jamaica, the United States, and the United Kingdom. A total of 4,823 individuals aged 25-74 years were recruited, all sites combined. RESULTS - In sharp contrast to a prevalence of 2% in Nigeria, age-adjusted prevalences of self-reported NIDDM were 9% in the Caribbean and 11% in the U.S. and the U.K. Mean BMI ranged from 22 kg/m(2) among men in West Africa to 31 kg/m(2) in women in the U.S. Disease prevalence across sites was essentially collinear with obesity, pointing to site differences in the balance between energy intake and expenditure as the primary determinant of differential NIDDM risk among these populations.

J	Heiser, WJ; Groenen, PJF				Heiser, WJ; Groenen, PJF			Cluster differences scaling with a within-clusters loss component and a fuzzy successive approximation strategy to avoid local minima	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Psychometric-Society	JUN 18-20, 1993	BERKELEY, CA	Psychometr Soc		multidimensional scaling; iterative majorization; K-means clustering; fuzzy clustering; local minima; constrained optimization; analysis of dispersion; co-citation analysis		Cluster differences scaling is a method for partitioning a set of objects into classes and simultaneously finding a low-dimensional spatial representation of K cluster points, to model a given square table of dissimilarities among n stimuli or objects. The least squares loss function of cluster differences scaling, originally defined only on the residuals of pairs of objects that are allocated to different clusters, is extended with a loss component for pairs that are allocated to the same cluster. It is shown that this extension makes the method equivalent to multidimensional scaling with cluster constraints on the coordinates. A decomposition of the sum of squared dissimilarities into contributions from several sources of variation is described, including the appropriate degrees of freedom for each source. After developing a convergent algorithm for fitting the cluster differences model, it is argued that the individual objects and the cluster locations can be jointly displayed in a configuration obtained as a by-product of the optimization. Finally, the paper introduces a fuzzy version of the loss function, which can be used in a successive approximation strategy for avoiding local minima. A simulation study demonstrates that this strategy significantly outperforms two other well-known initialization strategies, and that it has a success rate of 92 out of 100 in attaining the global minimum.

Four different methods are studied, these are the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). Special focus is placed on the usefulness of these cluster analysis methods, that is, if the results generated by these methods are relevant and are of help to the physical analysis of the data. A combined SOM adaptive dynamic K-means procedure suitable for automated cluster analysis is presented. This new method is capable of achieving useful partition of multivariate satellite data which has not previously been studied.

The application background is vision-based driving assistance in the inner city In an initial step, object parts are determined by a divisive clustering algorithm, which is applied to all pixels in the first image of the sequence. The feature space is defined by the color and position of a pixel. For each new image the clusters of the previous image are adapted iteratively by a parallel k-means clustering algorithm. Instead of tracking single points, edges, or areas over a sequence of images, only the centroids of the clusters are tracked. The proposed method remarkably simplifies the correspondence problem and also ensures a robust tracking behavior.

A number of model building techniques are described and the comparative performance of a system using models built using each of these techniques is presented. Mean estimated models, models where the means of the HMMs are estimated using segmental K means but where the variances are taken from speaker independent models, out performed other techniques such as Baum Welch reestimation for training times of 120s, 60s and 15s. Mean estimated models were also built with varying numbers of components in the state mixture distributions and a performance gain was again observed. The incorporation of transitional features into the system had degraded performance when the Baum-Welch algorithm was used for model estimation. However the inclusion of delta and delta-delta cepstra into the system using mean estimated models now gave a significant improvement in performance. Taken together these changes halved the equal error rate of the system from 15.7% to 7.8%.

The HMM part of this system uses discrete probability density functions (pdf). The neural network (NN) is used to replace a classical vector quantizer (VQ) like a k-means or LBG algorithm, which are typically used in discrete HMM systems. The NN is trained on an algorithm, that tries to achieve maximum mutual information (MMI) between the generated output labels and the underlying phonetic description. The system has been trained and tested with the five thousand word speaker independent WSJ task. The error rates of the MMI-Connectionist approach are 21% lower than the error rates of a k-means system. The system achieves error rates which have been achieved before only by the best continuous/semi-continuous HMM speech recognizers, with the advantage of a faster recognition algorithm.

Unfortunately, the number of clusters in general is unknown to the user. Therefore, the clustering becomes a tedious trial-and-error work and the clustering result is Often not very promising especially when the number of clusters is large. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm for the clustering problem. This algorithm can automatically cluster the data according to their similarities and automatically find the proper number of clusters. In traditional classification methods, usually a set of parameters is used to represent a class. But in many case, although belonging to the same class, the data may be divided into several clusters and the data in each cluster may have different characteristics. Hence, we also apply the genetic algorithm to the classification problem and obtain good results especially when the situation stated above happened. Another genetic algorithm is Proposed for the feature selection problem. This algorithm can not only search for a good set of features but also find the weight of each feature such that the application of these features associated with their weights to the classification problem will achieve a good classification rate. Experimental results ate given to illustrate the effectiveness of these genetic algorithms.		Tseng, LY (reprint author), NATL CHUNGHSING UNIV,DEPT APPL MATH,TAICHUNG 402,TAIWAN.

The proposed Centroid Neural Network (CNN) algorithm estimates optimal centroids of the related cluster groups to each training data. The CNN is based on the classical K-means clustering algorithm. This peeper also explains algorithmic relationships between the CNN and some of conventional unsupervised competitive learning algorithms such as Kohonen's Self-Organization Map (SOM) and Kosko's Differential Competitive Learning (SOM). The CNN algorithm requires neither a predetermined learning coefficient schedule nor a total number of iterations. The simulation results on image compression problem show that the CNN converges much faster than SOM or DCL with compatible compression error.

This algorithm involves 3D adaptive K-Means clustering of the gray-scale and texture features images. The segmentation problem is formulated as a Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation problem. The MAP estimation is achieved using Besag's Iterated Conditional Modes algorithm for the minimization of an energy function. This function has three components. The first one constrains the region to be close to the data, the second imposes spatial continuity and the third takes into consideration the texture of the various regions. This segmentation technique is demonstrated on in vivo breast data. The method revealed very efficient. The results are compared with the manual segmentation of lesions by an expert.

This approach extends the conventional segmental K-means approach to phonetic decision tree tying based acoustic modeling, It achieves high recognition performances while reducing the model training time from days to hours comparing to approaches based on incremental Baum-Welch training, Experimental results for this fast segmental clustering approach are presented for the Resource Management and the Wall Street Journal tasks.

Deriving SDCHMMs from CDHMMs requires a definition of multiple streams and a Gaussian clustering scheme, Previously we have tried 4 and 13 streams, which are common but ad hoc choices. Here we present a simple and coherent definition for streams of any dimension: the streams comprise the most correlated features. The new definition is shown to give better performance in two recognition tasks. The clustering scheme in [1] is an O(n(2)) algorithm which can be slow when the number of Gaussians in the original CDHMMs is large, Now we have devised a modified k-means clustering scheme using the Bhattacharyya distance as the distance measure between Gaussian clusters. Not only is the new clustering scheme faster, when combined with the new stream definitions, we now obtain SDCHMMs which perform at least as well as the original CDHMMs(with better results in some cases).

The state-space model generates training data for the neural network, which is successfully trained to classify five plant conditions. A second model, developed from the K-Means clustering algorithm, is incapable of correctly classifying the training data when using the same inputs as the neural network. The neural network exhibits good robustness to sensor faults and biases and produces acceptable diagnoses of a feed composition change when applied on-line with the plant.

If a polyhedral distance is used, the problem can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave function on a polyhedral set which is shown to be equivalent to a bilinear program: minimizing a bilinear function on a polyhedral set. A fast finite k-Median Algorithm consisting of solving few linear programs in closed form leads to a stationary point of the bilinear program. Computational testing an a number of real-world databases was carried out. On the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, k-Median training set correctness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm, however its testing set correctness was better. Additionally, on the Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) database, distinct and clinically important survival curves were extracted by the k-Median Algorithm, whereas the k-Mean Algorithm failed to obtain such distinct survival curves for the same database.

SOM's remaining ability of doing both VQ and MDS at the same time is challenged by a new combined technique of online K-means clustering plus Sammon mapping of the cluster centroids. SOM are shown to perform significantly worse in terms of quantization error, in recovering the structure of the clusters and in preserving the topology in a comprehensive empirical study using a series of multivariate normal clustering problems.

Pure Al2O3 particles synthesized in an Al(CH3)(3) (TMA-) seeded atmospheric pressure laminar counterflow diffusion flame ''fueled'' with CH4/O-2/N-2 were used as the model material/combustion system. Experimental techniques included spatially resolved laser light scattering (LLS) and thermophoretic sampling/transmission electron microscopy. Local aggregate morphology was characterized in terms of spherule (''grain'') size, aggregate size, aggregate shape and fractal structure. Effects of flame temperature and TMA concentrations on particle inception location, sizes and morphology studied systematically were interpreted based on parallel theoretical studies. LLS signals and TEM images show particle/aggregate size and morphology evolution as a result of two competing rate processes. Mean spherule diameters prior to high-temperature coalescence are explained in terms of the strong size dependence of nanoparticle restructuring kinetics due to surface melting, even at 500 K. Mean fractal aggregate sizes reached only 15-27 spherules near a local temperature of only 1,250 K. Final particulate products were isolated spherical particles resulting from complete ''collapse'' of the aggregates in an interval of only 24 ms immediately upstream of the maximum gas temperature (2,280 K). Experimental results are compatible with the characteristic times governing each participating ''unit'' rate process. Some of these methods can be applied in controlling the larger-scale synthesis of valuable nanopowders and guide rational extensions into the domain of turbulent nonpremixed combustors generating ultrafine particles of tailored composition and morphology at high mass loadings.

This data shows great promise for remote sensing applications ranging from environmental and agricultural to national security interests. The reduction of this voluminous data to useful intermediate forms is necessary both for downlinking all those bits and for interpreting them. Smart on-board hardware is required, as well as sophisticated earth-bound processing. A segmented image (in which the multispectral data in each pixel is classified into one of a small number of categories) is one kind of intermediate form which provides some measure of data compression. Traditional image segmentation algorithms treat pixels independently and cluster the pixels according only to their spectral information. This neglects the implicit spatial information that is available in the image. We will suggest a simple approach-a variant of the standard k-means algorithm-which uses both spatial and spectral properties of the image. The segmented image has the property that pixels which are spatially contiguous are more likely to be in the same class than are random pairs of pixels. This property naturally comes at some cost in terms of the compactness of the clusters in the spectral domain, but we have found that the spatial contiguity and spectral compactness properties are nearly ''orthogonal,'' which means that we can make considerable improvements in the one with minimal loss in the other.

After the HGSHS:A, subjects completed the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) (Pekala, 1982, 1991c) in reference to the sitting quietly interval embedded in the hypnotic induction ceremony. Subjects were divided into low and high susceptible groups. K-means cluster analysis of the subjects' responses to the: PCI revealed nine different cluster groups. These groups had different patterns of phenomenological experiences that cut across individual subjects' actual HGSHS:A scores. Implications of the above for (a) working with clients who may not score that high on standard behavioral measures of hypnotizability (such as the HGSHS:A), of (b) understanding how hypnosis ''works,'' are discussed.

It has been suggested that venotonic drugs relieve the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency by decreasing capillary leakage and improving venous tone. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Daflon 500 mg in patients with abnormal venous elasticity without varicose veins. Twenty-five healthy female volunteers aged 18-35 were included in the study. They presented with symptomatic varicose veins in one leg and an abnormal elastic modulus without varicosities in the opposite leg. Treatment group: 12 patients received 2 tablets of Daflon 500 mg (1000 mg/day); control group: 13 patients received no treatment. The elastic modulus K was determined using the air plethysmograph. Simultaneous measurements of calf volume changes were made in response to different venous pressures produced by a thigh pneumatic cuff. In the control group K (mean +/- sd) was 10.8 x 10(3) +/- 4.1 x 10(3) N/m(2) at the beginning and 10.2 x 10(3) +/- 3.1 x 10(3) N/m(2) at the end of the study (P > 0.1). In the treatment group the initial K was 10.2 x 10(3) +/- 3.9 x 10(3) N/m(2) and 14.2 x 10(3) +/- 5.1 x 10(3) N/m(2) at the end (P < 0.02). The results of the Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that 4 weeks' therapy with Daflon 500 mg is effective in improving venous tone in patients with symptoms but without varicose veins.

In the current study, the self-organizing feature map algorithm, the genetics-based machine learning (GBML) paradigm, and the K-means nearest neighbour clustering algorithm are applied on the same set of data. The aim of this exercise is to show how these three paradigms can be used in practice, given that their diagnostic performance is problem- and parameter-dependent. A total of 720 macro EMG recordings were carried out from four groups, from seven normal, nine motor neuron disease, 14 Becker's muscular dystrophy, and six spinal muscular atrophy subjects, respectively. Twenty-three of the subjects were used for training and 13 for evaluating the various models. For each subject, the mean and the standard deviation of the parameters (i) amplitude, (ii) area, (iii) average power and (iv) duration were extracted. The feature vector was structured in two different ways for input to the models: an eight-input feature vector that consisted of both the mean and the standard deviation of the four parameters measured, and a four-input feature vector that included only the mean of the parameters. Also, due to the heterogenous nature of the spinal muscular atrophy group, three class models that excluded this group were investigated. In general, self-organizing feature map and GBML models resulted in comparable diagnostic performance of the order of 80-90% correct classifications (CCs) score for the evaluation set, whereas the K-means nearest neighbour algorithm models gave lower percentage CCs. Furthermore, for all three learning paradigms: better diagnostic performance was obtained for the three class models compared with the four class models; similar diagnostic performance was obtained for both the eight- and four-input feature vectors. Finally, it is claimed that the proposed methodology followed in this work can be applied for the development of diagnostic systems in the analysis of biosignals.

J	Seaman, MA				Seaman, MA			Tables for pairwise multiple comparisons using Shaffer's modified sequentially-rejective procedure	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						multiple-comparison procedures; pairwise comparisons; sequential testing		A sequentially rejective (SR) testing procedure introduced by Helm (1979) and modified (MSR) by Shaffer (1986) is considered for testing all pairwise mean comparisons. For such comparisons, both the SR and MSR methods require that the observed test statistics be ordered and compared, each in turn, to appropriate percentiles on Student's t distribution. For the MSR method these percentiles are based on the maximum number of true null hypotheses remaining at each stage of the sequential procedure, given prior significance at previous stages. A function is developed for determining this number from the number of means being tested and the stage of the test. For a test of all pairwise comparisons, the logical implications which follow the rejection of a null hypothesis renders the MSR procedure uniformly more powerful than the SR procedure. Tables of percentiles for comparing K means, 3 less than or equal to K less than or equal to 6, using the MSR method are presented. These tables use Sidak's (1967) multiplicative inequality and simplify the use of the MSR procedure. Several modifications to the MSR are suggested as a means of further increasing the power for testing the pairwise comparisons. General use of the MSR and the corresponding function for testing other parameters besides the mean is discussed.

Finding an optimal set of patterns is NP-hard; previous compression schemes have resorted to heuristics. We extend the cross-entropy approach, used previously for measuring pattern similarity, to this problem. Using this approach we reduce the problem to the fixed-cost k-median problem, for which we present a new algorithm with a good provable performance guarantee. We test our new algorithm in place of the previous heuristics (First Fit, with and without generalized Lloyd's (k-means) postprocessing steps). The new algorithm generates a better codebook, resulting in an overall improvement in compression performance of almost 17%.

Between INT and IRA pigs there was no significant difference in the retention of Ca, P and K (mean values over the 3 periods). The recommended allowances of these minerals for pigs are valid for IRA pigs too. The ES-IRA group showed a significantly reduced Mg retention with negative values in the 3rd period. The Na retention did not significantly differ between the groups but in IRA pigs there was a reduction in the last period with negative values too. IRA animals showed equal close, nearly constant relations for the Ca to P and the K to Na retention as in INT pigs.

Non-linear distortion is difficult to eliminate. This paper discusses a method based on dynamic programming which copes with feature normalisation subjected to small non-linear distortions. Combining with k-means clustering results in a statistical classification algorithm suitable for pattern recognition problems. In order to assess the classifier, it has been integrated into a hand-written character recognition system. Dynamic features have been extracted from a database of 1248 isolated Roman character. The recognition rates are, on average, 91.67% (first choice) and 94.55% (first two choices). The classifier might also be tailored to any pattern recognition application.

The study area is located in Norway, 66 degrees N, 14 degrees E. Fully polarimetric C-and L-band SAR data from EMISAR, an airborne instrument operated by the Danish Centre for Remote Sensing (DCR), combined with ERS SAR, airborne photos and field data were analyzed in order to determine the capabilities for snow parameter estimation in mountainous areas. The backscatter statistics of EMISAR C-band data from two areas partly covered by wet snow was studied. There was a difference in mean values between the two areas of up to 4.4 dB for snow and up to 1.3 dB for bare ground. For the purpose of classification, this indicates that local class statistics has to be applied. A classification test on a small area of K-means clustering showed that the best results was obtained for vv polarization with an error rate of 7.2%. All error rates were between 7.2 and 12.2%.

The proposed method utilizes information from the histogram of pixel intensities of the intracranial image. Based on this information, an unsupervised K-means clustering procedure separates various tissue regions. Information about the approximate location of anatomical regions within the intracranial space is used to detect ventricles and the caudate nuclei. First a description and justification for the procedure is presented. Then the performance of the procedure is evaluated by analysis of variance. In conclusion, the results of applying this procedure to 31 healthy subjects are presented and future improvements are discussed. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We also analyze theoretically the cell loss probability and the mean cell delay time for the proposed priority control mechanism. The two service classes of our concern are the delay sensitive class and the loss sensitive class. The loss sensitive class cell occupancy represents the number of the loss sensitive class cells stored in the buffer. In other words, the proposed priority control mechanism has the methods to control the cell service ratio according to the number of the loss sensitive class cells stored in the buffer. Here what the cell service ratio is K means that only a loss sensitive class cell is served whenever the maximum number K of delay sensitive class cells are consecutively served. The analytical results show that the proposed priority control mechanism is able to improve the cell loss probability for loss sensitive class cells and the mean cell delay time for delay sensitive class cells by properly controlling the cell service ratio according to the loss sensitive class cell occupancies of the buffer.

It iteratively satisfies each of the two necessary conditions for an optimal quantizer; the nearest neighbor condition for the partition and centroid condition for the codevectors. In this letter, we propose a new algorithm for both vector quantizer design and clustering analysis as an alternative to the conventional K--means algorithm, The algorithm is almost the same as the K-means algorithm except for a modification at codebook updating step, It does not satisfy the centroid condition iteratively, but asymptotically satisfies it as the number of iteration increases, Experimental results show that the algorithm converges to a better locally optimal codebook with an accelerated convergence speed.

The most common VQ algorithms are the-LEG algorithm and K-means algorithm which have the advantages of being simple in concept and implementation with low computational costs. However the quantization error of VQ using these algorithm degrades the performance of speech recognizer. In this paper, we propose an alternative VQ method for Korean speech using a continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM). The CHMM classifies the signal space into clusters of which each cluster is represented by a Gaussian function in the state of HMM. The results show that VQ using a CHMM classifies Korean speech space more effectively.

In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that makes use of higher order statistics for improved data clustering when the distribution of the data is non-Gaussian. The algorithm uses an HOS-based decision measure which is derived from a series expansion of the multivariate probability density function in terms of the multivariate Gaussian and the Hermite polynomials. Experimental results are presented on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

The study area is located in Norway, 66 degrees N, 14 degrees E. Fully polarimetric C-and L-band SAR data from EMISAR, a airborne instrument operated by the Danish Centre for Remote Sensing, combined with ERS SAR, airborne photos and field data were analyzed in order to determine the capabilities for snow parameter estimation in mountainous areas. The backscatter statistics of EMISAR C-band data from two areas partly covered with wet snow was studied. There was a difference in mean values between the two areas of up to 4.4 dB for snow and up to 1.3 dB for bare ground. For the purpose of classification, this indicates that local class statistics has to be applied. A classification test on a small area of K-means clustering showed that the best results was obtained for VV polarization with an error rate of 7.2%. All error rates were between 7.2 and 12.2%. The C-band polarization responses derived from the snowcover corresponds to smooth surface scattering. The extent of the wet snowcover observed by ERS SAR correspond to EMISAR observation.

A hybrid method, consisting of statistical textural measures and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, is proposed for this problem. Imagery obtained for areas of South American rain forest are employed for this study and standard statistical techniques are used as a benchmark for comparison. A supervised method for training the RBF neural network hidden layer and parameters (e.g. centres, width, etc.) is proposed, based on a minimum-classification-error criterion. This modified RBF network has been applied to the forest data and has been found to outperform standard statistical techniques and the conventional RBF with k-means (or other similar) training method for hidden layer parameters in these classification tasks.

We studied image statistics to justify the correct use of the standard finite normal mixture model and formulated image quantification as a distribution learning problem. From information theory, we used relative entropy as the information distance measure and developed an adaptive structure probabilistic self-organizing mixture to estimate the parameter values. New learning scheme has the capability of achieving flexible classifier shapes in terms of winner-takes-in probability splits of data, allowing data to contribute simultaneously to multiple regions. The result is unbiased and holds the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve a fully automatic function and incorporate the correlation between slices, we utilized a newly developed information theoretic criterion (minimum conditional bias/variance) to determine the suitable number of mixture components such that the network can adjust its structure to the characteristics of each image in the sequence. By compared with the results of the algorithms based on expectation-maximization, K-means, and Kohonen's self-organizing map, new method yields a very efficient and accurate performance.

We present development and application of a semi-supervised method for segmenting normal and abnormal brain tissues from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of stroke patients. The method does not require manual drawing of the tissue boundaries. It is therefore faster and more reproducible than conventional methods. The steps of the new method are as follows: (1) T2- and T1-weighted MR images' are co-registered using a head and hat approach. (2) Intracranial brain volume is segmented from the skull, scalp, and background using a multi-resolution edge tracking algorithm. (3) Additive noise is suppressed (image is restored) using a non-linear edge-preserving filter which preserves partial volume information on average. (4) Image nonuniformities are corrected using a modified lowpass filtering approach. (5) The resulting images are segmented using a self organising data analysis technique which is similar in principle to the K-means clustering but includes a set of additional heuristic merging and splitting procedures to generate a meaningful segmentation. (6) Segmented regions are labeled white matter, gray matter, CSF, partial volumes of normal tissues, Bones of stroke, or partial volumes between stroke and normal tissues. (7) Previous steps are repeated for each slice of the brain and the volume of each tissue type is estimated from the results. Details and significance of each step are explained. Experimental results using a simulation, a phantom, and selected clinical cases are presented.

Attention is focused on the phase of automatic training (clustering) in order to retrieve the image class parameters, needed in the successive parametric segmentation. Since the clustering of the whole data set is in general not possible due to the computational load involved, sampling is needed that allows one to estimate the distribution of the classes in the feature space. However, on the one hand the sampling of single pixels may effect strongly the correct estimation of the class distributions due to noise, while, on the other hand, simply taking the mean value of a window around the sample may have too strong a filtering effect. The proposed algorithm exploits the spatial interaction between the pixels in the image, taking carefully into account the local image content (here also called morphology or topology) of each sample of the observed scene. A Bayesian network estimates for each candidate sample the most appropriate neighbourhood, looking for connected components and thus for pixels that are likely to partake of the same class. From the selected neighbourhood a mean value of the feature vector is computed that is to represent the sample, thus taking into account the local morphologic information. In this way the estimated class distributions in the feature space form a more robust representation of the true classes, thus bearing advantages to the parameter estimation and to the final segmentation. The image class models obtained by the proposed training step are used as input to a Markov random field (MRF) segmentation approach. Results presented show that a better separation of the natural classes is possible when using in a more careful fashion the local image content. Numerical results based on synthetic images show that the accuracy of the MRF segmentation approach improves from 72 % (training by classical K-means) to 96 % (proposed).

The algorithm does not require the number of classes or regions K as input, which is normally, difficult to determine in advance. There is also no need for an initial estimate obtained by an algorithm such as K-means. Further, each region is connected during the whole segmentation process leading to more reliable estimates of the regions' mean gray levels and to fewer wrong detected boundaries. In addition, a novel was to incorporate edge information into the segmentation process is proposed resulting in a better defection of small objects. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our technique.		Meier, T (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,DEPT ELECT & ELECT ENGN,VIDEO COMMUN RES GRP,NEDLANDS,WA 6907,AUSTRALIA.

First an initial estimate for the motion field is obtained by using an improved block matching method. Then, an intensify-based initial segmentation is performed, using watershed segmentation on a non-linearly diffused version of the image.

One goal of image segmentation would be to segment the image into regions that correspond to physically and semantically coherent objects in the scene. We propose can improved color segmentation algorithm by taking advantage of a simple ''k-mode'' algorithm and an adaptive Bayesian k-means algorithm. The ''k-mode'' algorithm uses a physics-based distance metric to generate regular par partitioning of the color space. The adaptive L-means algorithm utilizes two additional mechanisms, i.e., spatial homogeneity constraints and spatial adaptivity, to achieve more robust and coherent segmentation. The proposed algorithm integrates a physically more meaningful color space and the corresponding color difference metric into the the adaptive Bayesian k-means framework in an effort towards physics-based segmentation of photographic color images.

J	Zoppe, A				Zoppe, A			On uniqueness and symmetry of self-consistent points of univariate continuous distributions	JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						K-means cluster analysis; principal points; normal distribution; exponential distribution; uniform distribution	PRINCIPAL POINTS	Self-consistent points of a P-variate random variable X are conditional means in the classes of a partition of the support of X into domains of attraction. They are related to principal points, which are defined as those points xi(1),...,xi(K) that minimize the expected squared distance of X from the nearest of the xi(k). Lf only one set of self-consistent points exists, then it is the set of principal points, provided second moments exist. This paper reviews the theory of self-consistent and principal points and presents some results for univariate continuous distributions. A method to establish the uniqueness of self-consistent points is derived and applied to the uniform, the standard normal, the exponential and other distributions.

These are used to model a transformation from a high-dimensional observation space to a low-dimensional one. The parameters of the model are determined by optimising a loss function defined to be the stress function in multidimensional scaling. The metric for the low-dimensional space is taken to be the Minkowski metric with order parameter 1 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 2. A scheme based on iterative majorisation is proposed.		Webb, AR (reprint author), DEF RES AGCY,ST ANDREWS RD,MALVERN WR14 3PS,WORCS,ENGLAND.

J	Beliaeff, B; Burgeot, T				Beliaeff, B; Burgeot, T			Sampling design optimization for EROD measurements in fish	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						biomonitoring; estimation; EROD activity; statistical power; sample size; sampling design	MONITORING PROGRAMS; STATISTICAL DESIGN; FRENCH COASTS; INDUCTION; POWER; AGE	Activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in fish is certainly the best-studied biomarker of exposure applied in the field to evaluate biological effects of contamination in the marine environment. Since 1991, a feasibility study for a monitoring network using this biomarker of exposure has been conducted along French coasts. Using data obtained during several cruises, this study aims to determine the number of fish required to detect a given difference between 2 mean EROD activities, i.e. to achieve an a priori fixed statistical power (l-beta) given significance level (alpha), variance estimations and projected ratio of unequal sample sizes (k). Mean EROD activity and standard error were estimated at each of 82 sampling stations. The inter-individual variance component was dominant in estimating the variance of mean EROD activity. Influences of alpha, beta, k and variability on sample sizes are illustrated and discussed in terms of costs. In particular, sample sizes do not have to be equal, especially if such a requirement would lead to a significant cost in sampling extra material. Finally, the feasibility of longterm monitoring is discussed.

In the case of inflammatory bowel disease, quality of life greatly differs through phases of remissions and relapses. Could the quality of life questionnaire tell the difference? In this study we are disclosing possibilities of assessing patients' perspectives by analysing analogue scale statements regarding concerns and worries related to ulcerative colitis. Some two hundred Swedish patients, 3/4 in remission and 14 in relapse, filled out a booklet containing 36 statements. To characterise the disease activity, we have used multivariate discrimination. To structure and describe in details path distinguishing the remission from relapse, we have used an artificial intelligence procedure. Applications of the CART (Classification And Regression Trees) algorithm resulted in a set of classifiers which are, based on the similar subsets of significant variables, i.e. statements. Best reached classification accuracy did not exceed 80 % in any case. Other classifiers namely, K-nearest-neighbour (KNN), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) confirmed that outcome. An expectation that the disease activity should clearly speak throughout the questionnaire held for a certain number of the observation such as pain and suffering, loss of bowel control, dying early, felling alone, ability to have children, being treated as different and concerns regarding th medication. To highlight the difference of incorrect 20%, K-means clustering was performed. The results settled a basis for a hypothesis that the studied quality of life instrument captures more than the disease activity.

In the differential diagnosis of female urinary incontinence the physician has to determine a diagnostic class for the patient. This task is complex because of the unreliable patient history and the overlapping class boundaries. In order to develop an expert system to help the physician, a retrospective investigation on the incontinent women was performed to detect the potential expert system parameters. Also a diagnosis table was constructed from the expected values of parameters and the diagnostic classes. The results from K-means cluster analysis indicate that it is possible to develop the expert system on basis of the defined parameters and classes.

Stimulated by common clustering methods of this type (learning vector quantisation [LVQ, GLVQ] and K-means) a globally operating algorithm was developed to cope with known shortcomings of existing tools. This algorithm and K-means (for the common methods) were applied to the problem of clustering EEG patterns being preprocessed. It can be shown that the algorithm based on global random optimisation may find an optimal solution repeatedly, whereas K-means provides different sub-optimal solutions with respect to the quality measure defined as objective function. The results are presented. The performance of the algorithms is discussed.		Galicki, M (reprint author), UNIV JENA,INST MED STAT COMP SCI & DOCUMENTAT,JENA BOTZSTR 6,D-07743 JENA,GERMANY.

The investigation compares a neural network model with two classical statistical techniques using biochemical information obtained from a set of liver transplant patients. Each approach combines the results of a number of liver function tests to predict the presence of allograft rejection. Each system is assessed, relative to the clinical gold standard, in terms of its overall accuracy and degree of advance warning offered. Applying non-linear methods does offer an advantage over the traditional linear techniques. The underlying structure of the data set has also been determined using k-means cluster analysis. This analysis suggests important directions for future investigation including the use of temporal information. Preliminary results of incorporating this temporal information are also presented.

The capacity to produce clear cut clusters and confirmed number of clusters were studied in hierarchical methods with four measures of proximity. While single linkage and centroid methods have not yielded dear cut clusters with any of the four measures of proximity, complete linkage and average linkage (within) yielded clear cut clusters. Ward method failed to produce classifications with confirmed number of clusters. Hierarchical methods with distance measures were more accurate than with similarity measures.

While grayscale image segmentation has become quite a mature field, much less work has been done with regard to color image segmentation.(1) Until recently, this was predominantly due to the lack of available computing power and color display hardware that is required to manipulate true color images (24-bit). Today, it is not uncommon to find a standard desktop computer system with a true-color 24-bit display, at least 8 million bytes of memory, and 2 gigabytes of hard disk storage. Segmentation of color images is not as simple as segmenting each of the three RGB color components separately. The difficulty of using the RGB color space is that it doesn't closely model the psychological understanding of color. A better color model, which closely follows that of human visual perception is the HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) model. This color model separates the color components in terms of chromatic and achromatic information. Strickland et al. was able to show the importance of color in the extraction of edge features from an image.(2) His method enhances the edges that are detectable in the luminance image with information from the saturation image. Segmentation of both the saturation and intensity components is easily accomplished with any gray scale segmentation algorithm, since these spaces are linear. The modulus 2 pi nature of the hue color component makes its segmentation difficult. For example, a hue of 0 and 2 pi yields the same color tint. Instead of applying separate image segmentation to each of the hue, saturation, and intensity components, a better method is to segment the chromatic component separately from the intensity component because of the importance that the chromatic information plays in the segmentation of color images. This paper presents a method of using the gray scale K-means algorithm to segment 24-bit color images. Additionally, this paper will show the importance the hue component plays in the segmentation of images.

We also analyze theoretically the QoS, that is the cell loss probability and the mean cell delay time for the proposed priority control mechanism. The two service classes of our concern are the delay sensitive class and the loss sensitive class. The relative cell occupancy ratio represents the ratio of the number of the loss sensitive class cells to the number of the delay sensitive class cells stored in the buffer. In other words, the proposed priority control mechanism has the methods to change dynamically the cell service ratio according to the relative cell occupancy ratio of the loss sensitive class and the delay sensitive class. Here what the cell service ratio is K means that a loss sensitive class cell is served whenever the maximum number K of delay sensitive class cells are consecutively served. The analytical results show that the proposed control mechanism is capable of improving the cell loss probability with regard to loss sensitive class cells and the mean cell delay time with regard to delay sensitive class cells by selecting properly the cell service ratio according to the relative cell occupancy ratio in the buffer and the input traffic conditions.

The Bio-Medical Data Processing (BMDP) K-means clustering program with K = 2 showed that 11 of the 30 plants had a high protein nitrogen extractability as well as a high nitrogen content of the extracted protein. Among these, leaf protein from Allmania nodiflora had the highest content of crude protein (62.7%) and beta-carotene (782.4 mu g/g). Leaf protein pre pared from Hygrophila spinosa, Ottelia alismoides and Polygonum barbatum had low in-vitro digestibility. The levels of alkaloids and polyphenols were lower in the extracted protein compared to that present in the original leaf sample.

The study area is located in Norway, 66 degrees N, 14 degrees E. Fully polarimetric C- and L-band SAR data from EMISAR an airborne instrument operated by the Danish Centre for Remote Sensing (DCR), combined with ERS SAR airborne photos and field data were analysed in order to determine the capabilities for snow parameter estimation in mountainous areas. The backscatter statistics of EMISAR C-band data from two areas partly covered by wet snow was studied. There was a difference in mean values between the two areas of up to 4.4 dB for snow and up to 1.3 dB for bare ground. For the purpose of classification, this indicates that local class statistics has to be applied. A classification test on a small area of K-means clustering showed that the best results were obtained for vv polarisation with an error rate of 7.2%. All error rates were between 7.2 and 12.2%. The L- and C-band polarisation responses derived from an wet snowcover correspond to surface scattering with a diffuse scattering component. The extent of the wet snowcover observed by ERS SAR corresponds to EMISAR observation.

It is a bottom-up type split and merge operation performed steps: First, the operation is carried out using the K-means algorithm in the local windows of an input image to capture the local textural primitives. This is performed in the (R,G,B)-color space. This results in two color classes per local window. Second, the merge operation is employed using the same K-means algorithm module to group the pattern classes resulting from the split operation. This forms the global boundaries of the texture fields present in the input scene. The proposed algorithm is also suitable for a special purpose VLSI chip implementation.

We present the development and application of a semi-supervised method for segmenting normal and abnormal brain tissues from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of lesion patients. This method does not require manual drawing of the tissue boundaries. It is therefore expected to be faster and more reproducible than conventional methods. The steps of the new method are as follows. 1) T2 and T1 weighted MR images are co-registered using a head and hat approach. 2) The intracranial brain volume is segmented from the skull, scalp, and background using thresholding and morphological operations. 3) The additive noise is suppressed (the image is restored) using a non-linear edge-preserving filter which preserves partial volume information on average. 4) Image nonuniformities are corrected using a modified lowpass filtering approach. 5) The resulting images are segmented using a self organizing data analysis technique which is similar in principle to the K-means clustering but includes a set of additional heuristic merging and splitting procedures to generate a meaningful segmentation. 6) Segmented regions are labeled white matter, gray matter, CSF, partial volumes of normal tissues, zones of the lesion, or the partial volumes between lesion and normal tissues. 7) Previous steps are repeated for each slice through the brain and the volume of each tissue type is estimated from the results. Details and significance of each step are explained. Experimental results using clinical MRI data are presented.

The occurrence and development of fragipan horizons in the region has been attributed to the presence of a specific stratigraphic unit. This study was conducted to investigate the stratigraphic relationship between loess units throughout the LMRV to determine if the existence of fragipans is limited to one loess deposit. The study utilized five field sites in the loess uplands between northwestern Tennessee and southeastern Louisiana. At all sites, each member of the Memphis catena (Memphis [fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludalf], Loring [fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Fragiudalf], and Grenada [fine-silty, mixed, thermic Glossic Fragiudalf]) was sampled and preliminary stratigraphic breaks identified by changes in texture and color. These breaks were further refined in the laboratory by characterizing each horizon for clay-free particle-size distribution and mass magnetic susceptibility. Additionally, total Fe, K, Mg, Ca, Ti, and Zr were determined for the coarse silts (20-50 mu m) from all Memphis horizons. The data were further evaluated by k-means cluster analysis to refine stratigraphic breaks in the loess and underlying coastal plain or alluvial deposits. Generally, stratigraphic breaks were distinguishable by changes in clay-free sand, clay-free medium and coarse silt, and mass magnetic susceptibility. Secondary clay maxima below 250 cm represented paleoargillic horizons that confirmed stratigraphic changes and buried surfaces. For the thick loess deposits (>3.5 m total loess thickness), fragipans developed entirely in Peoria Loess, but in thinner loess deposits (<3.5 m total loess thickness) fragipans crossed stratigraphic boundaries between Peoria Loess and underlying units. Thus, the development of fragipan horizons in these loess soils is independent of stratigraphic units.

Compared to the SS-tree, the tree uses a tighter bounding sphere for each node which is an approximation to the smallest enclosing sphere and it also makes a better use of the clustering property of the available data by using a variant of the k-means clustering algorithm as the split heuristic for its nodes. A local reorganization rule is also introduced during the tree building to reduce the overlapping between the nodes' bounding spheres.

Methods: Using a k-means clustering procedure, alcohol-dependent subjects from a placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine were grouped into low-risk/severity (type A: n = 60) and high-risk/severity (type B: n = 35) groups. Multivariate analysis of covariance (with pretreatment measures as covariates) evaluated the effects of Alcoholic Subtype, Medication Group, Treatment Completion, and their interactions on measures of drinking, both during the 12-week treatment period and a 6-month follow-up period. Results: Although there were no main effects of Alcoholic Subtype or Medication Group, subjects who completed the treatment trial showed significantly better drinking-related outcomes. There was also an interaction of Alcoholic Subtype by Medication Group during treatment. Among type B subjects, fluoxetine treatment resulted in poorer drinking-related outcomes than placebo treatment. Among type A subjects, there was no effect of Medication Group. This interactive effect did not persist during the 6-month follow-up period. Conclusions: Alcoholic subtypes identified by cluster analysis seem to be differentially responsive to the effects of fluoxetine treatment on drinking-related outcomes. Serotonergic abnormalities previously identified among a subgroup of alcoholics who are also characterized by impulsivity and severity of alcohol dependence may help to explain the differential medication effect. Based on these findings, it is recommended that, in the absence of a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder, fluoxetine not be used to maintain abstinence or reduce drinking in high-risk/severity alcoholics.

Classified datasets are used often to gather spatial statistics efficiently from large areas and to simplify the analysis of complex images. The algorithm uses a modified version of k-means standard method to classify the images and statistical distance between classes in order to reduce and optimize the final partition to be obtained. The method is checked for several meteorological situations, both in summer and in winter. The program was written in C and was tested both in UNIX work stations and in personal computers. In all situations the computer time required to make the classification can be considered acceptable. The methodology presented can be applied directly to the analysis of meteorological images, providing a tool for interpreting complex scenes. Additionally, minor changes introduced in the algorithm allow classification of any image provided that two (or more) channels of the same scene are available.

J	Fox, CG				Fox, CG			Objective classification of oceanic ridge-crest terrains using two-dimensional spectral models of bathymetry: Application to the Juan de Fuca Ridge	MARINE GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCHES			English	Article						geomorphology; Juan de Fuca Ridge; roughness; spectral analysis; clustering	NORTHEAST PACIFIC; SEAFLOOR TOPOGRAPHY; FLOOR TOPOGRAPHY; MORPHOLOGY; ROUGHNESS	An important application of detailed bathymetric mapping is the interpretation of geological processes based on the nature of the fine-scale morphology of the seafloor. This interpretation is usually accomplished through qualitative analysis of contour maps. In this paper, an objective classification technique, based on a two-dimensional spectral model of bathymetry developed by Fox and Hayes (1985) is applied to detailed Sea Beam data from the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Parameters of the model can be directly related to seafloor properties corresponding to 1) isotropic (non-directionally dependent) roughness; 2) anisotropic (directionally dependent) roughness; 3) orientation of the anisotropic component; and 4) spectral roll-off (similar to fractal dimension), by fitting the model surface to two-dimensional amplitude spectra of bathymetry determined on a regular grid over the study area. A test area was selected which encompasses the southern volcanic rift zone of Axial Volcano and the northern terminus of the Vance Segment. Parameters of the model clearly define the contrast between the constructional volcanic terrain (rough, isotropic, with high fractal dimension) and the tectonic extensional terrain (smoother, anisotropic, with low fractal dimension). An agglomerative, hierarchical cluster analysis is applied to the data, independent of spatial information, to delineate groups of spectra with similar characteristics. Distinct, mappable regions, corresponding to volcanic and tectonic provinces, are objectively determined. Also, coherent sub-regions of consistent spectral properties occur within the larger volcanic/tectonic divisions. The classification is extended to the Juan de Fuca Ridge system from 44 degrees 30' N to 47 degrees 20'N through combining these results with an a priori technique (K-means clustering). Broad-scale physiographic regions of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are delineated by the technique, which may aid geologists in the interpretation of crustal accretion processes at seafloor spreading centers.

This enables them to describe elliptical clusters with different orientation. The distinction between these methods lies in the way they deal with clusters of different volume, cardinality, and density. Some industrial examples show that different applications may lead to different goals and preferences, which affect the choice of the clustering method.

J	Whitehead, BA				Whitehead, BA			Genetic evolution of radial basis function coverage using orthogonal niches	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Letter								A well-performing set of radial basis functions (RBF's) can emerge from genetic competition among individual RBP's. Genetic selection of the individual RBF's is based on credit sharing which localizes competition within orthogonal niches. These orthogonal niches are derived using singular value decomposition and are used to apportion credit for the overall performance of the RBF network among individual nonorthogonal RBF's. Niche-based credit apportionment facilitates competition to fill each niche and hence to cover the training data. The resulting genetic algorithm yields RBF networks with better prediction performance on the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series than RBF networks produced by the orthogonal least squares method and by k-means clustering.

J	Kaufmann, P; Weber, RO				Kaufmann, P; Weber, RO			Classification of mesoscale wind fields in the MISTRAL field experiment	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY			English	Article							SYNOPTIC METEOROLOGICAL CONTROLS; PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; UNITED-STATES; VALLEY; AIR; CLIMATOLOGY; PATTERNS; TRAJECTORIES	A two-stage classification scheme with outlier detection is proposed to find groups of wind fields. A hierarchical cluster analysis according to the complete linkage method is combined with a k-means procedure with detection and exclusion of outliers. The classification method is applied to a 1-yr dataset of 1-h mean wind observations from the MISTRAL field experiment. A small number of typical regional dow patterns is identified. An analysis of temperature observations shows that some of the 12 regional flow patterns have thermally forced wind systems. The main spatial forcing patterns are revealed by a principal component analysis of temperature observations; A comparison of the regional dow patterns and the synoptic-scare weather types of the Alpine region shows that only weak connections between the local flow and the synoptic-scale weather type exist.

The initial image segmentation classifies only those image pixels whose surrounding closely matches a class centroid, The subsequent procedure iteratively classifies the remaining image pixels by combining their spatial distance from the regions already segmented and the similarities between their corresponding magnitude vectors and the cluster centroids, Experimental results of the proposed algorithm for segmenting real cell images are provided.

J	Lin, JC; Lin, WJ				Lin, JC; Lin, WJ			Real-time and automatic two-class clustering by analytical formulas	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						two-class clustering; high-dimensional space; feature-preserving; analytical fast clustering; general form k-means; hierarchical agglomerative clustering	IMAGE	Several feature-preserving two-class clustering methods are investigated in this paper. By preserving certain features of the input data, some formulas useful in calculating the two class representatives and population percentages are derived. The derived formulas are expressed in general forms suitable for any dimensionality higher than two. The complexities of the investigated methods are all of order N if the data size is N and hence are much faster than any other clustering method which uses N x N dissimilarity matrix. Additionally, all investigated methods use no initial guesses. Experimental results are included to make a comparison among the four investigated methods so that only two methods are recommended. Further comparisons with the k-means method and hierarchical clustering methods also are included. The proposed feature-preserving approach was found to be fast, automatic and suitable for any held requiring fast high-dimensional two-class clustering.

J	MaydeuOlivares, A				MaydeuOlivares, A			Classification of prison inmates based on hierarchical cluster analysis	PSICOTHEMA			English	Article								Six clustering methods (Ward's method, average linkage clustering, complete linkage clustering, single linkage clustering, nearest neighbor, and k-means) were applied to the matrix of Euclidean distances among inmates in the B-dimensional space defined by the following variables: 1) age, 2) length of the internment already fulfilled, 3) paranoid ideations and behavior, 4) hardness, 5) psychotic ideations and behavior, and 6) means-ends interpersonal problem solving skills. The classification determined by each of the clustering procedures was matched with the actual classification of the inmates into those who were and those who were not granted outside permits, by computing unconditional and conditional classification rates. Ward's method, complete linkage and the k-means procedure were able to match satisfactorily the qualitative classification of the inmates. However, these methods were more efficient in determining which inmates would be denied an outside permit than in determining those that would be granted an outside permit. This also occurs in the qualitative classification: it is easy to determine which inmates will not make good use of an outside permit; it is much more difficult to determine which inmates will make good use of it.

J	Lebedev, MA; Nelson, RJ				Lebedev, MA; Nelson, RJ			High-frequency vibratory sensitive neurons in monkey primary somatosensory cortex: Entrained and nonentrained responses to vibration during the performance of vibratory-cued hand movements	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						somatosensory cortex; high-frequency vibrotactile stimulation; stimulus-entrained activity; pacinian afferent; monkey	SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; PREMOVEMENT ACTIVITY; CONSCIOUS MONKEY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL AREA; ARM MOVEMENTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; REPRESENTATION; RESPONSIVENESS; MODULATION	The activity of high-frequency vibratory sensitive (HFVS) neurons was recorded in monkey primary somatosensory cortex (SI) while animals performed wrist flexions and extensions in response to 57-Hz or 127-Hz palmar vibration. HFVS neurons were distinguished by their exquisite responsiveness to the higher frequency vibration (127 Hz). These neurons probably received input from Pacinian afferents. Systematic selection of HFVS neurons was made using K-means cluster analysis of neuronal firing rates during stimulating at 127 Hz and 57 Hz. HFVS neurons constituted similar to 4% of all recorded cells and more frequently were found in areas 3b, 1, and 2 (similar to 5% of total in each area) than in area 3a (similar to 1%). Using circular-statistics analyses for nonuniformity of discharges over the vibratory cycle, HFVS neurons were split into two groups of vibration-entrained neurons (E1 and E2 neurons) and one group of nonentrained neurons (NE neurons). E1 neurons were entrained to vibration at both 127 Hz and 57 Hz, whereas E2 neurons were entrained only at one of these vibratory frequencies. Vibration-entrained neurons often exhibited multimodal distributions of interspike intervals (ISIs), with the modes at multiples of the period of vibration. In addition, for these neurons, ISI clusters in joint interval plots commonly had diagonal orientations that were indicative of negative serial correlations of the ISIs, a feature of extrinsically driven rhythmic activity. HFVS neurons located in areas 3a, 3b, and 1 responded to vibration onset at shorter latencies (16.5+/-1.6, 19.8+/-5.9, and 21.4+/-6.4 ms, respectively, during 127-Hz stimulation) than those located in area 2 (35.6+/-13.8 ms). These observations are consistent with a scheme in which HFVS area 2 neurons receive their inputs from more anterior areas of SI. Moreover, entrained neurons exhibited shorter response latencies than nonentrained neurons. During 127-Hz stimulation, response latencies were 17.3+/-3.0, 17.5+/-2.6, and 25.7+/-6.4 ms for E1, E2, and NE neurons, respectively, located in areas 3a, 3b, and 1. Thus, entrained and nonentrained HFVS neurons may belong to different hierarchical stages of information processing.

The AMLCD method takes into account both spectral and spatial characteristics of the data. In the first level of processing, the principal background end members are obtained using the K-means clustering method, Each pixel is examined next for classification using a minimum-distance classifier with the principal end members obtained in the previous level. In the second level, the neighborhood Of each unclassified pixel is analyzed for inclusion of candidate end members in an unmixing procedure, If the list of candidate background classes is empty, the conditions for their inclusion are relaxed, The fractions of neighborhood and target signatures for the unclassified pixels are determined by means of a linear least-squares method in the third level. If the results of unmixing are not satisfactory, the list of candidate clusters is renewed. Target detection within each pixel is performed next, The last processing level determines the size and location of detected targets with a clustering analysis methodology. Target size and location are estimated on the basis of the sum and weighted vector mean, respectively, of the mixing fractions of the neighboring pixels, The AMLCD method was successfully applied to both synthetic and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral imagery datasets.

J	Crook, J; Moldofsky, H				Crook, J; Moldofsky, H			The clinical course of musculoskeletal pain in empirically derived groupings of injured workers	PAIN			English	Article						musculoskeletal pain; work disability; clinical course; cohort study; injured workers	BACK-PAIN; INDUSTRY; DISABILITY; DISORDERS; COST	The purpose of this paper is to examine the clinical course of musculoskeletal, soft tissue, work-related injury. An analysis of empirically derived sub-groupings of workers based on prognostically important pain and disability variables assessed on enrollment into the study is described. Multidimensional time-dependent profiles are used to characterize stages in the development of pain, impairment, disability and handicap. The clinical course over the 18 months of study of the three subgroups is examined. The conceptual model, used to examine the workers' changing responses over time, is based on the World Health Organization Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (1980). Methodologically, the study employed a prospective longitudinal design. A randomly selected cohort of workers who had not returned to work by 3 months post-injury were identified from the files of the Workers' Compensation Board of Ontario. The workers were interviewed and examined on enrollment into the study at 3 months and subsequently at 9 months, 15 months and 21 months after injury. The outcomes were return to work or continued work disability. The results are based on those 104 workers who attended all four assessment periods. K means clustering was used to identify homogenous subgroups of workers. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to characterize the stages of development of pain, impairment, disability and handicap. Duncan's multiple range test was used to compare pairs of means at each assessment period. Cluster groupings, based on three prognostically important clinical variables, number of pain sites, pain behavior and functional disability, obtained at the initial assessment were valid predictors of the number of days to return to work and total number of days on work disability. Prognostic stratification can enhance confidence in predictive decisions of clinical practice and improve clinical trials of therapy.

Patients-Methods. Study design: cross-sectional, prospective, multicenter. Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip, knee, fingers, or spine. Data collected: clinical and radiologic features at 41 joint sites. Methods: multivariate statistical analysis including a) k-mean clustering analysis followed by ascending hierarchical classification b) and a tree-structured discriminant method to confirm and to characterize the subgroups obtained using the clustering method. Results. The 1021 patients were first classified into five categories with an error rate (obtained by cross-validation) of 7.6%. The tree obtained by segmentation took into account manifestations of osteoarthritis at the hands, knees and spine. Irrespective of the reason for seeking medical advice, patients with bilateral involvement of the fingers or with involvement of the spine and both femorotibial joints were classified as having generalized osteoarthritis; in contrast, focal osteoarthritis was defined as the absence of involvement of the fingers and of either the spine or the knees. Conclusion. The statistical analysis provided a classification system that would be easy to use in everyday clinical practice. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the potential clinical relevance of this system.

A related problem that arises in business is market segmentation for which clustering techniques are used. In this paper, we explore the ability of a specific neural network, namely the Frequency-Sensitive Competitive Learning Algorithm (FSCL), to cluster data for developing strategic marketing decisions. To this end, we investigate the comparative performance of FSCL vis-a-vis the K-means clustering technique. A cluster analysis conducted on brand choice data for the coffee category revealed that the two methodologies resulted in widely differing cluster solutions. In an effort to address the dispute over the appropriate methodology, a comparative performance investigation was undertaken using simulated data with known cluster solutions in a fairly large experimental design to mimic varying data quality to reflect data collection and measurement error. Based on the results of these studies, it is observed that a combination of the two methodologies, wherein the results of the FSCL network are input as seeds to the K-means, seems to provide more managerially insightful segmentation schemes.

Estimating a range of exposures in a given population requires an understanding of the variability of ventilation rates in the population. Distributions of ventilation rates (Ve) were described based on the results of a large study where Ve were measured while subjects performed a variety of physical tasks. Three distinct ventilation levels were identified using cluster analyses of the mean Ve and then various activities were assigned to the three levels using a k-means procedure. Separate distributions were identified for the three Ve levels for adult males, adult females, and children. The variability of Ve was consistent with a lognormal distribution for all groups. An aggregate daily inhalation rate can be estimated based on the distributions of Ve.

Characteristic hysteretic behavior and reversible transverse susceptibility (RTS) were investigated. The salient features are as follows: The hysteresis loops become sheared with increasing anisotropy distribution, sigma(K), while their slopes steepen with the mean field strength alpha. For a homogeneous systems RTS peaks increase sharply with alpha, both at the anisotropy field H-K and coercive field H-c. For random systems, both peaks become shallower and blunted with increasing sigma(K). Mean field strength alpha causes the peak positions of RTS at H-K to shift to lower values, while the shift at H-c depends subtly upon the interplay among alpha, sigma(K) and texture of the system. For random systems the shift is toward higher H-c values with increasing alpha. For systems with constant alpha, however, it shifts toward lower values with increasing sigma(K).

Mean estimates of the three parameters stabilized at slightly different ages. However, based on estimates of I-ate of maturing and closeness of fit, growth parameters may be derived after 55 months as reported (4.5 years) for Angus cattle. Also strong negative correlations between A and K suggested that early maturing animals were less likely to attain heavy mature weights.

Direct digitizing of the waveforms provides a means for the extraction of additional features, for example, pulse skewness and kurtosis, and Fourier properties. In this work, we have first demonstrated that the Fourier properties of the pulse can be employed usefully for discrimination between different types of cells that otherwise cannot be classified by using only time-domain features of the pulse. We then implemented and evaluated automatic procedures for cell classification based on neural networks. We established that neural networks could provide an efficient means of classification of cell types without the need for user interaction. The neural networks were also employed in an innovative manner for analysis of the digital flow cytometric data without feature extraction. The performance of the neural networks was compared with that of a more conventional means of classification, the K-means clustering algorithm. Neural networks can be realized in hardware, and this, in addition to their highly parallel architecture, makes them an important potential part of real-time analysis systems. These results are discussed in terms of the design of a real-time digital data acquisition system for flow cytometry. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The performance of the methods is evaluated according to the degree of meeting the following demands made on the groups formed: The groups should (i) be consistent when preset parameters are changed (ii) be well separated both from each other and from the entire data set, (iii) be stable in space and time, and (iv) reproduce the predefined types. All the methods proved to be capable of yielding meaningful classifications. None of them can be thought of as the best in all aspects. Which method to use will depend mainly on the aim of the classification. Nevertheless, the principal component analysis is most successful in reproducing the predefined types and is therefore considered as the most promising method among those examined.

J	Krieger, AM; Green, PE				Krieger, AM; Green, PE			Modifying cluster-based segments to enhance agreement with an exogenous response variable	JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH			English	Article							BENEFIT SEGMENTATION; LINEAR-REGRESSION; METHODOLOGY; MODEL	K-means clustering programs are frequently used to group buyers into market segments. Segment members exhibit similar background profiles, based on such characteristics as psychographics, benefits seeking, conjoint-based partworths, and so on. In addition, researchers also may use data on one or more exogenous variables for the same respondents. The authors describe and apply an algorithm for systematically modifying the original K-means segmentation to enhance prediction of an exogenous variable (either continuous or categorical). The modification is designed to respect a user-specified constraint on the permissible percentage decrease in the initial partition's ratio of among-groups sums of squares to total-groups sums of squares. The authors compare this approach with models drawn from the highly popular clusterwise regression literature.		Krieger, AM (reprint author), UNIV PENN,WHARTON SCH,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104, USA.

J	Comrie, AC				Comrie, AC			An all-season synoptic climatology of air pollution in the US-Mexico border region	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER			English	Article						synoptic climatology; US-Mexico border; weather; ozone; air pollution	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; OZONE REGIMES; NORTH-AMERICA; CIRCULATION; SOUTHWEST; FORESTS; MODEL; AREAS; CLASSIFICATION; PENNSYLVANIA	The potential exists for widespread air quality problems in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Climate and weather are major factors governing the behavior of air pollution, and thus there is a need for greater understanding of border-region air pollution climatology. This paper presents a synoptic climatology of the 850 mb atmospheric circulation for the U.S.-Mexico border region, and an accompanying analysis of relationships between synoptic conditions and ground-level ozone. The synoptic methodology employs high-pass filtering to enable comparisons of all seasons, and it uses modified multiple k means clustering to identify six characteristic circulation patterns. The climatology succinctly summarizes important spatial and temporal complexities of border region circulation, including various pressure configurations, the seasonality of those patterns, and associated weather conditions across the region. These results are linked with ozone data for four border-region cities, and the subsequent findings highlight systematic seasonal and region-wide variations in ozone pollution corresponding to patterns of controlling climatic factors. Three high-ozone scenarios are identified, each of which selectively affects a different area or time of year.		Comrie, AC (reprint author), UNIV ARIZONA,TUCSON,AZ 85721, USA.

We generalize this concept to self-consistent random vectors: a random vector Y is self-consistent for X if E[X/Y] = Y almost surely. This allows us to construct a unified theoretical basis for principal components, principal curves and surfaces, principal points, principal variables, principal modes of variation and other statistical methods. We provide some general results on self-consistent random variables, give examples, show relationships between the various methods, discuss a related notion of self-consistent estimators and suggest directions for future research.

Statistical studies based on factor analysis and k-means clustering yielded templates for further classification. Using proper motion data published in the literature we suggest that the vast majority of our objects belong to the cluster Tr37 of IC 1396. Plotting the program stars, along with theoretical evolutionary tracks, onto the {logL;logT(eff)} plane we concluded that they are pre-main sequence objects of 0.5M(.) < M < 3M(.) masses and 10(5) < t < 10(7) years age.

J	Asay, KH; Mayland, HF; Clark, DH				Asay, KH; Mayland, HF; Clark, DH			Response to selection for reduced grass tetany potential in crested wheatgrass	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							GENETIC-VARIABILITY; HIGH-MAGNESIUM	Grass tetany (hypomagnesemia) has caused substantial economic losses in ruminant animals grazing crested wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.) and other cool-season (C3) grasses. This malady Is most prevalent in early lactating animals grazing forage that is deficient in Mg, Ca, and carbohydrates and with high levels of K. The K/(Ca + Mg) ratio expressed as moles of charge is often used to estimate the grass tetany potential of forage samples. Previous studies have shown that heritable variation exists in crested wheatgrass populations for traits associated with grass tetany, and research was conducted to determine the genetic response to selection for these traits. Selections were made during 1985 from two crested wheatgrass breeding populations in Utah ('1-28' and 'Hycrest') based on a reduced grass tetany potential (RTP) index, which incorporates the K/(Ca + Mg) ratio along with concentrations of Ca, Mg, and K. Mean values for the K/(Ca + Mg) were reduced by 5% in I-28 and 11% in Hycrest after one cycle of selection. Narrow-sense heritability values based on actual genetic advance and parent-progeny regression ranged from 0.62 to 0.82 in analyses of data combined across two sampling dates and two years (1988 and 1989). Genetic response to selection on the basis of RTP index was closely associated with the K/(Ca + Mg) ratio and concentrations of Ca and Mg but not with levels of K. Correlations between the K/(Ca + Mg) ratio and crude protein content and digestibility suggested that selection for RTP would Likely be accompanied by improved forage quality in the Hycrest breeding population.

It is not known whether the current molecular classification of blood coagulation disorders into severe (0-1%), moderate (1-5%) and mild (5-40% factor activity remaining) corresponds to the actual clinical situation or is in the patients best interest. Methods. A questionnaire-based study of 244 patients. Principal factor analysis was used to create a set of variables for classification, which was performed using K-means algorithm. The main variables were use of prophylactic treatment during the last five years and during the last 12 months, home treatment, bleeding, surgery, antibody inhibitors, use of cold medication, pain, use of analgesics, functional disability and physical activity level. Results. The first five variables of the main outcome measures loaded to a factor reflecting bleeding (bleeding factor) and the last four to a pain factor; both factors produced a 3-cluster solution with severe, moderate and mild bleeding or pain. Overlap between the molecular, bleeding and pain classifications was not extensive. Only 16% of 81 patients with severe coagulation factor deficiency had severe musculoskeletal pain and disability. Furthermore, only 28.6% of the patients with severe von Willebrand's disease actually had a severe bleeding disorder. Conclusions. Molecular classification does not correlate very well with the severity of disease as reflected in bleeding and pain. This is due to better prognosis for patients on modern medical management. Appropriate patient classification is a basis for defining and managing patients' clinical problems.

J	Murthy, CA; Chowdhury, N				Murthy, CA; Chowdhury, N			In search of optimal clusters using genetic algorithms	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						pattern recognition; clustering; K-means; genetic algorithms		Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are generally portrayed as search procedures which can optimize functions based on a limited sample of function values. In this paper, GAs have been used in an attempt to optimize a specified objective function related to a clustering problem. Several experiments on synthetic and real life data sets show the utility of the proposed method. K-Means is one of the most popular methods adopted to solve the clustering problem. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed method may improve the final output of K-Means where an improvement is possible.

Thixotropy and flow behavior were evaluated. Vaginal fluid samples were collected in 8 cows at the beginning of a natural estrus and then every 8 h for 24 h. Vaginal samples were also collected from 208 cows at the time of insemination within 12 to 24 h interval after the onset of a natural estrus. Time-dependent variations were registered during the estrus. The limit shear stress for flow production (T-0), the shear stress of equilibrium (T-e) and the consistency index (K) decreased at 8 and 16 h and markedly increased 24 h after the beginning of estrus. At the time of insemination, structural variation was registered and the fluids were considered to be thixotropic in samples of 181 cows (87%); in the remaining samples (27 cows), structural variation was not registered and the fluids were considered to be nonthixotropic. For flow behavior values, 178 samples (85.6%) presented non-Newtonian behavior, while 30 behaved as Newtonian fluids. The mean values of the T-0 and the T-e were 6.1+/-0.69 and 1.9+/-0.69 pascals, respectively. Consistency index (K) mean was 364.9+/-41.4 milipascals per second(n). Our data show an increase of fluidity at the middle of the estrus period in the cow and a wide variation of rheological measurements of vaginal fluid at the time of insemination.

Seed content, species composition and spatial variability	VEGETATIO			English	Article						geostatics; soil seed bank; spatial variability; species composition; weeds	ARABLE FIELDS	The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition and the spatial variability of the arable soil seed bank in one large, coherent landscape segment, where the cultivation practice of neighboring farms and the gradients in soil properties determine the distribution of the weed seeds in soil. To this end, a 50 x 50 m grid of 338 reference points was fixed throughout a 143 ha area in southern Bavaria. The seed bank contained a median density of 4950 seeds per m(2) able to germinate. These values showed remarkable variation throughout the investigated area. Thus, 27% of the sampling area contained less than 2500 seeds per m(2), another 23% were below 5000 seeds per m(2) and 19% ranged among 5000 and 10 000 germinating seeds per m(2). Among the remaining sites, 22% showed seed densities between 10 000 and 20 000 and 9% more than 20 000 seeds per m(2). To visualize the spatial distribution of the weed seed bank over the whole study area, the interpolation method kriging was used. For this purpose the spatial continuity must be described by means of a semivariogram analysis. The goodness of the interpolation results depends on the fit of the semivariogram model which shows the spatial dependency. Two important characteristic parameters of this model are the nugget and the range. The nagger expresses the sampling error and the local variability up to the 50 m sampling distance, which cannot be detected by the semivariogram. Therefore the interpolation cannot describe the seed bank variation on a scale below this threshold. In our investigations the nugget comprises about one third of the total variance. The estimation error increases towards the border of the investigated area. In general, this is due to missing sampling points at the field edges. The range observed in the present investigations was 340 m. Beyond this no more spatial variability exists and the measurements are independent of each other. The species occurring in more than five of the investigated samples were ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and classified by k-means cluster analysis of the ordination axes. Five weed communities were recognized from this analysis which distinctly differed in their relation to the soil type and to the preceding management.

Images acquired during visual stimulation using a checkerboard flashing at 8Hz were investigated. Activated pixels were identified by correlating their time-course in the gradient echo images to a model of the stimulation 'on'-'off' sequence. The temporal delay of each activated pixel was estimated by fitting its time-course to a reference sinusoidal function. The mean signal intensity and phase difference of the activated pixels was computed by subtracting the average of the 'on' images from the average of the 'off' images. After mapping each pixel onto a three-dimensional feature space (intensity, phase shift and temporal delay), a clustering method based on a K-means algorithm was employed to classify pixels into two or three classes representing the relatively large blood vessels and the microvasculature. Good demarcation between large veins and activated gray matter was achieved with this method.

First, we present an adaptation of the simulated annealing technique to the clustering problem, and compare its results with those provided by classical c-mean clustering algorithms, which lead only to local optimality. It is shown that simulated annealing technique yields improved results over the standard c-means method. Then, we compare the classified images obtained from two different clustering algorithms: simulated annealing, and K-means guided by initialization from optical data, applied to MAC-Europe'91 images. The study reveals a poor robustness of SAR image classification versus the estimated cluster characteristics, and shows that most of culture types were best identified by the global optimization.

The initial image segmentation is determined by classifying the image local variation information obtained with dilation and erosion operations. A median filter is then used to smooth the initially segmented image. A modified median filter is applied subsequently to correct possible classification errors inside the cells. The modified median filter can clear small regions of misclassified pixels while avoiding significant changes to the cell profiles. An erosion operation is finally used to restore the cell regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is successful. Comparison of the proposed algorithm and the K-means clustering method is provided.

Solutions obtained from this technique are dependent on the initialisation of cluster centres. In this article, two initialisation methods are developed. These methods are particularly suited to problems involving very large data sets. The methods have been applied to different data sets and good results are obtained.

J	Wang, ZL; Guerriero, A; DeSario, M				Wang, ZL; Guerriero, A; DeSario, M			Comparison of several approaches for the segmentation of texture images	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						texture segmentation; Fuzzy K-Means; Fuzzy ART2; Fuzzy Kohonen SOFM		In this paper, several approaches including K-Means, Fuzzy K-Means (FKM),Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART2) and Fuzzy Kohonen Self-Organizing Feature Mapping (SOFM) are adapted to segment the texture image. In our tests, five features, energy, entropy, correlation, homogeneity, and inertia, are used in texture analysis, The K-Means algorithm has the following disavantages: (i) slow real-time ability, (ii) unstability. The FKM algorithm has improved the performance of the unstability by means of the introduction of fuzzy distribution functions. The Fuzzy ART2 has advantages, such as unsupervised training, low computation, and great degree of fault tolerance (stability/plasticity). Fuzzy operator and mapping functions are added into the network to improve the generality, The Fuzzy SOFM integrates the FKM algorithm into fuzzy membership value as learning rate and updating strategies of the Kohonen network. This yields automatic adjustment of both the learning rate distribution and update neighborhood, and has an optimization problem related to FKM. Therefore, the Fuzzy SOFM is independent of the sequence of feed of input patterns whereas final weight vectors by the Kohonen method depend on the sequence. The Fuzzy SOFM is ''self-organizing'' since the ''size'' of the update neighborhood and learning rate are automatically adjusted during learning, Clustering errors are reduced by Fuzzy SOFM as well as better convergence. The numerical results show that Fuzzy ART2 and Fuzzy SOFM are better than the K-Means algorithms. The images segmented by the algorithms are given to prove their performances.

J	Nkemdirim, LC				Nkemdirim, LC			Canada's chinook belt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						chinooks; temperature signal; frequency; economic/human impacts; southern Alberta; Canada	WINTER	The chinook is the best example of the family of mountain winds that blows in regions where long mountain chains lie more or less at right angles to the prevailing wind. Apart from the unseasonable warmth it brings to Canada's interior in winter, it represents an efficient system through which latent heat drawn from the Pacific coast is converted into sensible heat and transported zonally across the continent. It also compromises both the physical and human environments. The severity of impacts depends on either the amount of anomalous warming experienced or on the number of chinook events occurring over a winter, and often on both. In Canada, the chinook belt lies almost exclusively in southern Alberta. In this paper, the belt is described and mapped with respect to the strength of the wind's temperature signal and numerical frequency. The temperature signal (the signal) is the difference between the highest temperature attained during a chinook event and the daily maximum. The frequency is the number of days in the winter with, at least, 1 h of chinook wind. Mean point values of the signal range from 13 to 25 K. Mean seasonal frequency varies from 43 days to 52 days per winter. The core of the belt for temperature and frequency do not coincide. The highest frequencies occur in the Crowsnest Pass area whereas the strongest signals are found further east of the mountains in an axis that includes Vauxhall and Brooks. Both signal strengths and frequency show strong decadal variations. The 1980s were chinook rich; the 1970s were chinook poor.

The objects are represented by points in n-dimensional Euclidean space, and the objective is to classify these m points into c clusters such that the distance between points within a cluster and its center is minimized. The problem is a difficult optimization problem due to the fact that: it posseses many local minima. Several algorithms have been developed to solve this problem which include the k-means algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, the tabu search algorithm, and the genetic algorithm. Zn this paper, we study the four algorithms and compare their computational performance for the clustering problem. We test these algorithms on several clustering problems from the literature as well as several random problems and we report on our computational experience.

J	Butters, MA; Lopez, OL; Becker, JT				Butters, MA; Lopez, OL; Becker, JT			Focal temporal lobe dysfunction in probable Alzheimer's disease predicts a slow rate of cognitive decline	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CEREBRAL METABOLIC ASYMMETRIES; MEMORY DEFICIT; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA	The memory disorder in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be described as having two components: one primarily a defect in secondary memory and the other a defect in executive processes. We compared and contrasted the pattern of neuropsychological impairment in AD patients as a function of their memory and executive deficits. A K-Means cluster analysis identified four groups of patients. All four groups had impaired episodic and semantic memory and three had progressively more severe impairments in executive functions. The fourth group had normal executive functions; this group (N = 32), described as having a ''temporal lobe'' pattern of impairment, had a significantly slower rate of progression of their dementia, with visual-constructional skills virtually spared. These data demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of AD patients with a consistent pattern of impairment who progress more slowly than other patients over the course of 2 years and who maintain some specific cognitive abilities. This suggests that the mechanism of their disease may be different.

J	Pei, SC; Cheng, CM				Pei, SC; Cheng, CM			A fast two-class classifier for 2D data using complex-moment-preserving principle	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; patterns; complex moments; moment-preserving principle; two-class classifier		A new moment-preserving classifier for two-class clustering is suggested. Based on preserving the complex moments of two-dimensional (2D) input data, an analytic, non-iterative and unsupervised classifier is proposed. This new classifier is suitable for applications requiring fast automatic two-class clustering of 2D data or fast automatic hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, the computation time is of order of data size and hence much faster than the well known iterative k-means algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed classifier can acquire acceptable clustering results.		Pei, SC (reprint author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT ELECT ENGN,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.

J	Galambosi, A; Duckstein, L; Bogardi, I				Galambosi, A; Duckstein, L; Bogardi, I			Evaluation and analysis of daily atmospheric circulation patterns of the 500 HPA pressure field over the southwestern USA	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article							SYNOPTIC CLASSIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; WEATHER-MAPS; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION	Daily atmospheric circulation patterns (CP's) are defined and analyzed on the basis of the 500 hPa pressure field for the purpose of describing and then later generating local hydroclimatological variables such as precipitation under possible climate change over the southwestern USA. To obtain the CP's we first use a so-called objective or automated clustering method, namely, principal com ponent analysis (PCA) coupled with K-means clustering algorithm. To obtain a set of CP types that are more distinguishable and so more useful for our purpose we follow two possible ways: (1) reduce subjectively the number of CP's from PCA coupled with K-means clustering analysis by aggregating the types on the basis of the precipitation producing characteristics, (2) perform K-means clustering analysis with fewer types. Thus we have three different cluster systems: original types from the result of PCA coupled with K-means clustering (8 or 9 types depending on the season), types from the K-means clustering analysis with fewer types (5 or 6 types in each season) and the subjectively aggregated types (3 types in any seasons). We compare them from the point of view of information content for precipitation modeling. An analysis is made for these types for comparison: statistical properties of these patterns are evaluated and analyzed using first observed data, and then General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs for 1 X CO2 and 2 X CO2 scenarios to estimate climate change effects, On the basis of the historical circulation pattern catalogue and observed precipitation data in Arizona, simple calculations are provided to find the ''precipitation-producing'' types of each system in each season. Three indices are evaluated using the same observed precipitation data from ten Arizona stations in order to measure objectively the information content of each type in the three cluster systems. It turns out that the larger number of types in a given season gives higher information content as we expected.

J	Duff, AI				Duff, AI			Ceramic micro-seriation: Types or attributes?	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY			English	Article								Micro-seriation using attributes of decorated ceramics has been shown to accurately refine intrasite and intersite relative dating. Using data from Pueblo de los Muertos, a nucleated town in west-central New Mexico, this presentation demonstrates that micro-seriation of type frequencies produces equally accurate results. Typological analysis also provides substantial time savings when compared to attribute recording. Additionally, using types with established temporal ranges permits linkage of relative seriation with absolute dates. A combination of correspondence analysis and k-means cluster analysis was found to provide sound and easily interpretable results. The results of a typological seriation of Pueblo de los Muertos deposits are examined. and the utility of typological seriation for other contexts is considered.

This system extracts multidimensional features from TCD waveforms and performs a cluster analysis of those features. The system can automatically recognize the pattern of spectral waveform and classify it as a normal, abnormal, or borderline subclass of TCD spectral waveform. An optimum decision function was generated based on the Bayes Gaussian classifier. The accuracy of the Bayes Gaussian model the spectral waveforms reaches 100% by estimating posterior probability and using the resubstituting method of estimating misclassification in the training TCD data.

This method allows the on-line visualization of clustering processes. This procedure was applied to the features used in the time domain ventricular late potential (VLP) analysis: duration of the filtered QRS, rootmean square of the last 40 ms and duration of the terminal part of the QRS below 40 mu V. The algorithm produces 2D-maps of the cluster centers, where the centers were grouped around a straight line and the distances between all cluster centers were preserved. We therefore conclude that this 3-dimensional data set can be embedded into a 1-dimensional abstract feature space. This feature space is spanned more or less by the duration of the QRS-complex.

The method takes into account both spectral and spatial characteristics of the data on different levels of processing. The principal background classes are obtained first using; K-means clustering. Each pixel is examined next for classification using a minimum distance classifier with principal class signatures obtained in the previous level. In the next level, the neighborhood of each unclassified pixel is analyzed for inclusion of candidate classes for use as endmembers in a spectral unmixing model. If the List of candidate background classes is empty, the conditions for their inclusion are relaxed. The fractions of backgrounds and lines of communication signatures for the unclassified pixels are determined by means of linear least-squares method. If the results of unmixing are not satisfactory, the candidate clusters list is renewed, and unmixing is repeated. The lines of communication detection within each pixel is performed next. The line segments detection parameters are initialized, directional confidence is calculated, and line segment tracking is initialized. The Line segments are incremented until the composite confidence becomes too low. At the end, segment connection, and lines of communications identification is performed. The proposed method was successfully applied to both synthetic and AVIRIS hyperspectral data sets.

Our algorithm utilises the wavelet transform to obtain a multiresolution representation of the image. The low frequency residuals of each stage of the wavelet transform are being segmented using an enhanced Gibbs Random Fields model that incorporates edge information provided by the high frequency residuals. The results of the application of our algorithm are visually more attractive than the segmentation results obtained by applying both the K-means algorithm and the Adaptive Clustering Segmentation algorithm by Pappas.

Modified k-means algorithm (MKM) used for clustering nearly 10000 vocal tract shapes into 1000 cluster centers to form a codebook of articulatory shapes is computationally intensive for our application. An investigative study on the use of NN based algorithm over MKM algorithm at the peripheral level, for our application on Computer Aided Pronunciation-education, suggests the former for less intensive computation, with the possibility of improving the performance of the system by implementing the algorithm using a dedicated neural computer. in this paper, preliminary results of this study are reported.

The objects are represented by points in an n-dimensional Euclidean space, and the objective is classify these m points into c clusters such that the distance between points within a cluster and its center is minimized. We propose and implement a genetic algorithm-based cost minimization approach to this problem. We compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the k-means and stimulated annealing algorithms. As a mater of factor, our algorithm obtained results that are better than the well-known k-means and stimulated annealing algorithms.

While ultrasonic sensor is fast at acquisition of the environment model, it's poor at angle resolution and error-prone as false reflection occurs. On the other hand, while image sensor is slow at image processing, and suffers from the lighting condition in an indoor environment, it's good in resolution. In this paper, we try to merge these two types of sensor information to produce an occupancy grid representation of the environment which is good for extraction of floor connectivity. In particular, we propose the principle of the shortest nearby range values to address the false reflection issue. Then we use the k-mean clustering to classify the floor color. A safety index representation is used as a basis for fusion of the echo and image map. Experiments are done which show the usefulness of the fusion map.

J	Gu, P				Gu, P			An objective based clustering approach to design of manufacturing cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION			English	Article						objective-based clustering; machine cells; part families; optimization	ALGORITHM	Cluster-seeking algorithms such as K-means and Isodata have been used in many fields for clustering patterns. Problems often arise from interpretation and evaluation of clustering results because of lack of evaluation criteria. This paper presents a new concept called objective-based clustering to improve the cluster-seeking algorithms by defining relationships between parameters of the algorithms and evaluation criterion of solutions. Two phases, an initial phase and a final phase, have been developed, which are used before and after the clustering-seeking processes. The initial phase aims st the optimal selection of initial cluster centres based on the objective; the find phase, from an application point of view, corrects any misclustering caused by absolute similarity as only criterion for clustering. Both phases are domain dependent. To further improve the performance of the Isodata algorithm, an optimization model has been developed to link to the Isodata algorithm. The objective and constraint functions are expressed as functions of the parameter variables required by the Isodata algorithm. The optimization program selects a group of parameters for the modified Isodata (with the initial and final phases) routine, which in turn returns an objective function value in each iteration. In such a way an optimal solution can be found. This approach has been used to form manufacturing cells, and the results show that improvement on the solutions has been achieved. A case study is provided to illustrate the approach.		Gu, P (reprint author), UNIV SASKATCHEWAN,DEPT MECH ENGN,57 CAMPUS DR,SASKATOON,SK S7H 5A9,CANADA.

This paper introduces and compares three approaches to the estimation of SNR using the symbol soft techniques discussed also provide constellation symbol coordinates. The first approach, based on the 'k-means' technique [2] for partitioning a multi-dimensional population into a number of sets, forms estimates of the constellation statistics by grouping the complex soft decisions into clusters. The second and third techniques use properties of histograms formed from the projection of soft decisions onto the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) axes to estimate the signal power and noise variance.

Generally the data set is available before running the algorithm and the clustering problem can be approached by an inertia criterion optimization. In this paper we consider the probabilistic approach to this problem. We propose a new algorithm based on the Expectation Maximization principle (EM; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977). The new method can be viewed as a Kohonen type of EM and gives a better insight into the SOFM according to constrained clustering. We perform numerical experiments and compare our results with the standard Kohonen approach.		Ambroise, C (reprint author), UNIV TECHNOL COMPIEGNE,URA CNRS 817,BP 649,F-60206 COMPIEGNE,FRANCE.

The model utilises the concept of the dichromatic reflection model and the one-bounce model of mutual reflection. A psi-theta space is introduced to enable the spectral cluster of a region to be identified either as a matte hill, a highlight lobe or an interreflection lobe. An analysis of the boundary of clusters enables the use of the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the regions without the need to specify the expected number of clusters and the initial cluster centres.

Geometric clustering has nicer structures than the graph version due to constraints induced by geometry. Tills paper first summarizes recent results by the authors on the k-clustering problem for a set S of n points p(i) = (x(i)) (i = 1,..., n) in the d-dimensional space with variance-based errors as clustering criteria. A main problem is to find a k-clustering of S into S-j (j = 1,...,k) minimizing (j=1)Sigma(k) (pi epsilon Sj)Sigma parallel to x(i) - x(S-j) parallel to(2) where parallel to . parallel to is the L(2) norm and x(S-j) is the centroid of points in S-j, i.e., 1/\S-i\ Sigma(pi epsilon Sj) x(i). Next, relations of those results with the existing local improvement technique, called k-means, are described, together with results of computational experiments. Furthermore, connections of this geometric clustering problem with the so-called geographical optimization problem proposed by Iri, Murota and Ohya [3] are mentioned.

In order to extract significant areas, the first step of sonar image analysis consist of segmenting the image into three classes: shadow, echo, reverberation. Segmentation quality and precision are of first importance for performances of subsequent tasks. The original segmentation process was carried out by two thresholds that delimit boundaries between classes. To make the chain more robust, thresholdings are replaced by an unsupervised fuzzy clustering strategy. In spite of its efficiency, this method depends on the image histogram. To take into account possible changes in the image grey level distribution, we propose to adapt clustering by mean of learning rules. Last step is a post processing, called Nagao Altering, that improves the regions boundaries thanks to a context based segmentation.

A replication study using a sample of patients from a different country was completed. Patients: Seventy patients (average age = 47.05 years, SD = 16.11) with chronic low back pain of noncancer origin participated in the study. Sixty-two of these patients were attending The Auckland New Zealand Regional Pain Service, while a further eight were attending a private practice pain service in Auckland. Outcome Measures: Subjects were assessed on the IPAM, which measures pain intensity, disability, coping strategies, attitudes towards and beliefs about pain, depression and illness behaviour, the Medical Examination and Diagnostic Information Coding System, and the Multidimensional Pain Inventory. Results: Cluster analyses using the K-means algorithm were performed on the IPAM data. The three-cluster solution was preferred according to both the Variance Ratio Criterion and cluster interpretability. Two of the three clusters correlated highly with clusters retrieved in the original study (r = 0.78, r = 0.71), while the third cluster showed partial resemblance (correlation of r = 0.31). Clusters were named ''In Control,'' ''Depressed and Disabled.'' and ''High Deniers and Somatizisers.'' No differences were found on the physical pathology scores between clusters. Decision rules for cluster assignation resulted in 68% of the sample being correctly assigned. Conclusions: Support for this cluster model from two countries suggests its value in providing a multidimensional picture of patients with chronic low back pain. The possibility of using such cluster groups for determining treatment type is discussed.

J	Mazaheri, SA; Koppi, AJ; McBratney, AB				Mazaheri, SA; Koppi, AJ; McBratney, AB			A fuzzy allocation scheme for the Australian great soil groups classification system	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							SETS	Conventional methods of soil classification are based largely on hierarchies and treat soil attribute value ranges as exactly specifiable quantities. Misclassification may result from ignoring the continuous complex nature of soil variation, and the inability to sample and measure every aspect of soil. The Australian Great Soil Groups (GSG) system of classification is essentially a fuzzy classification, and for the most part central concepts have not been defined explicitly. Centroids were generated, together with fuzzy group membership, using data from the 147 soil profile descriptions in The Handbook of Australian Soils. Some of the GSG, such as Siliceous Sands and Red and Brown Hardpan Soils, were divided into their component parts for better and easier quantification and allocation. The centroids of GSG were examined, and the method of fuzzy k-means was then used to allocate unknown profiles to the GSG. The results show that the system is intuitively reasonable.

The technique compares favorably with a combinational selection technique based on the Euclidean distance separability measure in terms of computational requirement. Experiments on the handwritten numeral recognition problem using the multilayer perceptron classifier show that the technique can reliably evaluate features and successfully select those ones important for performing the classification using a system of reduced complexity with little degradation of the performance. The technique can also be used to discard the noise-corrupted features in order to increase the reliability of a classification system.

Using Daubechies' four-tap filter, an original image is decomposed into three detail images and one approximate image. The decomposition can be recursively applied to the approximate image to generate a lower resolution of the pyramid. The segmentation starts at the lowest resolution using the K-means clustering scheme and textural features obtained from various sub-bands. The result of segmentation is propagated through the pyramid to a higher resolution with continuously improving the segmentation. The lower resolution levels help to build the contour of the segmented texture, while higher levels refine the process, and correct possible errors.

J	Rousseeuw, PJ; Trauwaert, E; Kaufman, L				Rousseeuw, PJ; Trauwaert, E; Kaufman, L			Fuzzy clustering with high contrast	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						algorithm; classification; cluster analysis; k-means		In a fuzzy clustering an object typically receives strictly positive memberships to all clusters, even when the object clearly belongs to one particular cluster. Consequently, each cluster's estimated center and scatter matrix are influenced by many objects that have small positive memberships to it. This effect may keep the fuzzy method from finding the true clusters. We analyze the cause and propose a remedy, which is a modification of the objective function and the corresponding algorithm. The resulting clustering has a high contrast in the sense that outlying and bridging objects remain fuzzy, whereas the other objects become crisp. The enhanced version of fuzzy k-means is illustrated with an example, as well as the enhanced version of the fuzzy minimum volume method.

We studied temporal and spatial synchrony of population fluctuations in the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) in Finland. 2. The data consist of route censuses (20 000-30 000 km annually) performed in 11 provinces during 1964-83, The population data for the three species in each province were standardized to zero mean and unit variance. 3. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that population dynamics of the three species in every area are in rather good temporal synchrony. Moreover, with the aid of k-means clustering, the 11 provinces could be merged into four regions, indicating large-scale synchrony in dynamics of the three tetraonid species. 4. Because it is obvious that this synchrony cannot be due only to the similar life histories of these species, we explored whether it could be influenced by a common synchronizing factor affecting all the species simultaneously. In order to do this we used a Leslie matrix-based simulation approach. In this model there is a stochastic hit of breeding failure at a given average interval. This failure was shown to synchronize the population dynamics of the species with primarily different life tables.

J	RALAMBONDRAINY, H				RALAMBONDRAINY, H			A CONCEPTUAL VERSION OF THE K-MEANS ALGORITHM	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						LEARNING; CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING; RULE DISCOVERY FROM DATA	CLASSIFICATION; DISTANCE	Clustering techniques are important for knowledge acquisition. Traditionally, numerical clustering methods have been viewed in opposition to conceptual clustering methods developed in Artificial Intelligence. Numerical techniques emphasize the determination of homogeneous clusters but provide low-level descriptions of dusters. A conceptual approach is more concerned with high-level, i.e., more understandable descriptions of classes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid numeric-symbolic method that integrates an extended version of the K-means algorithm for cluster determination and a complementary conceptual characterization algorithm for cluster description.

Biogeographical zones defined by the method are based on permanent features of the environment, while at the same time reflecting species distributions and vegetation cover. 2 Data on the occurrence of native species in six taxonomic groups (breeding birds, diurnal insects, terrestrial molluscs, vascular plants, mosses and liverworts) in 10-km squares in Scotland were extracted from national databases. The environment of each square was specified by 12 climatic variables and four topographic variables. 3 A measure of the environmental difference between 10-km squares was derived by relating their environmental attributes to the species that occur in them, using detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA), a method of ordination. DCCA defines a metric in environmental space such that unit difference corresponds to a given degree of species difference. 4 For each of the six taxonomic groups, DCCA was used to generate a four-axis ordination of the 10-km squares, which were then clustered into 10 groups by a minimum-variance clustering algorithm. Ten clusters were also derived using the full set of 24 axes resulting from all six ordinations. Characteristic species for each of the clusters were identified using a numerical preference index. 5 Most clusters could be mapped as discrete zones. There was substantial similarity between the clusters for differing taxonomic groups. The 10 clusters created by combining all six groups provided a succinct general summary of the natural zonation of Scotland. The characteristic species of these clusters were used to contrast the high conservation value of some areas with the lesser value of others. 6 Our biogeographical zones compared well with certain previous classifications, but have the additional strength of being based on a combination of environmental data and species data at a national scale. There is considerable scope for developing the methodology and for extending its application for conservation purposes.

The discrepancy measure is an outcome of a non-linear alignment procedure which optimally aligns the elements of patterns in order to minimize the dissimilarity between the patterns. The K-means clustering algorithm is modified to use the discrepancy measure to compute the similarity between patterns and the cluster centers. A series of clustering experiments were conducted on identical data using the modified and standard K-means algorithm. The results obtained show that clustering performance of the modified algorithm is significantly superior to that of the standard algorithm.

The main purpose of the proposed method is to identify the associating type of an input character together with the extraction of its embedded composing components. In this paper, the K-mean clustering algorithm is employed to cluster the thinned strokes. Besides, mis-clustered stroke modification techniques are developed to rearrange the mis-clustered strokes generated by the K-mean algorithm. Five kinds of fonts for 2500 frequently used Chinese characters are tested in our experiments. The average classification rate is 92.57% which is very promising for coarse classification.

(1992). The subjects are participants in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of alcoholism (COGA), and each was evaluated using a face-to-face structured interview. Following the procedure of Babor et al. (1992), data were used to create 17 domains, and a k-means clustering method was invoked to generate a two-cluster solution. Thirty-one per cent of the males and 25% of the females fell into the Type B group, with overall R(2) of 0.22 and 0.24 for males and females, respectively. The scores in each of the 17 domains and the analyses of the clinical characteristics for Type A and B subjects were, in general, consistent with the earlier onset and more severe course for Type B men and women. The ability of the domains to identify subgroups of alcoholics remained robust even after the exclusion of alcohol dependent subjects with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and those with an onset of alcohol dependence before age 25 years. The present analyses suggest that five of the 17 domains might be especially useful in identifying Type A and B groups		SCHUCKIT, MA (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,DEPT PSYCHIAT 116A,SAN DIEGO,CA 92161, USA.

The objects are represented by points in an n-dimensional Euclidean space, and the objective is to classify these m points into c clusters such that the distance between points within a cluster and its center (which is to be found) is minimized. The problem is a nonconvex program that has many local minima. It has been studied by many researchers and the most well-known algorithm for solving it is the k-means algorithm. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for solving this problem based on a tabu search technique. Preliminary computational experience on the developed algorithm are encouraging and compare favorably with both the k-means and the simulated annealing algorithms.

This generalization makes some k-means like clustering algorithms its special cases, It is shown that mean shift is a mode-seeking process on a surface constructed with a ''shadow'' kernel. For Gaussian kernels, mean shift is a gradient mapping. Convergence is studied for mean shift iterations, Cluster analysis is treated as a deterministic problem of finding a fixed point of mean shift that characterizes the data. Applications in clustering and Hough transform are demonstrated. Mean shift is also considered as an evolutionary strategy that performs multistart global optimization.

The results clearly show that neither the blue nor the infrared mean colors are representative of the equivalent static value, i.e., the color of the variable if it were a static star, over the whole instability strip. Moreover, it is shown that the discrepancy between synthetic mean colors and static color is a function of the amplitude of the light curve. On this basis, the amplitude corrections to observed mean colors to obtain the color of the underlying static star are derived.

J	MCCOWAN, B				MCCOWAN, B			A NEW QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR CATEGORIZING WHISTLES USING SIMULATED SIGNALS AND WHISTLES FROM CAPTIVE BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS (DELPHINIDAE, TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS)	ETHOLOGY			English	Article							SIGNATURE WHISTLES; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; CALLS; STABILITY; INDIVIDUALITY; VOCALIZATIONS; MIMICRY; WHALE	A widespread problem in the study of animal vocalizations is evaluating the acoustic similarity of signals both between individuals of a social group and between social groups. This problem becomes especially salient when classifying the narrow-band frequency-modulated signals, such as whistles, found in many avian and mammalian species. Whistles are usually characterized by their relative change in frequency over rime, known as whistle 'contour.' Measuring such a characteristic is difficult as it is not a single measurement, such as the mean frequency or duration of a signal, but several associated measurements of frequency across time. This paper reports on a new quantitative technique for determining whistle types based on whistle contour similarity and an application of this technique to the whistles of bottlenose dolphins to demonstrate its utility. This 'contour similarity' technique (CS technique) uses cluster analysis to group the correlation coefficients of frequency measurements from a data set of signals. To demonstrate the efficacy of this CS technique, three data sets were analysed, two using computer-generated signals and a third using adult bottlenose dolphin whistles, to (1) examine the efficacy of correlation coefficients for grouping signals by their similarity in whistle contour and (2) determine the viability of this technique for categorizing bottlenose dolphin whistles. Measured actual frequencies and correlation matrices from the four simulated signal types and a correlation matrix from the whistles of five captive adult bottlenose dolphins were each subjected to K-means cluster analysis and the resulting signal types were evaluated. Results indicated that the technique grouped actual frequencies according:fo the amount of shared actual frequencies and grouped correlation coefficients successfully according to signal contour. This result endured even if contours differed in overall duration or actual frequency or were expanded or compressed with respect to frequency or time. The results suggest that this approach is a viable method for assigning whistle contours to categories in bottlenose dolphins or any other species with narrow-band, frequency-modulated signals.

It is characterized uniquely by a fixed spatial distribution of active neuronal generators with time varying intensity, Brain electrical activity is modeled as being composed of a time sequence of nonoverlapping microstates with variable duration, A precise mathematical formulation of the model for evoked potential recordings is presented, where the microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials due to the underlying generators, An algorithm is developed for estimating the microstates, based on a modified version of the classical k-means clustering method, in which cluster orientations are estimated, Consequently, each instantaneous multichannel evoked potential measurement is classified as belonging to some microstate, thus producing a natural segmentation of brain activity, Use is made of statistical image segmentation techniques for obtaining smooth continuous segments, Time varying intensities are estimated by projecting the measurements onto their corresponding microstates, A goodness of fit statistic for the model is presented, Finally, a method is introduced for estimating the number of microstates, based on nonparametric data-driven statistical resampling techniques.

However, it has also been successfully applied to CT-PET, MR-CT, and MR-SPECT registrations. Materials and Methods: The head contour is detected on the MR image using a gradient threshold method. The head region in the MR image is then segmented into a set of connected components using the K-means clustering algorithm. When the two image sets are registered, the segmentation of the MR image indirectly generates a segmentation of the PET image. The best registration is taken to be the one that optimizes the segmentation induced on the PET image. In this article, the K-means minimum variance criterion is used as a cost function, and the optimization is performed using the method of coordinate descent. Results: The algorithm was tested on 80 H-2 O-15 PET and MR image pairs from 10 subjects. Qualitatively correct results were obtained in all cases. With use of external markers visible in both image modalities, the average registration error was estimated to be <3 mm. Conclusion: The algorithm presented in this article requires no user interaction and can be applied to a wide range of registration problems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the algorithm indicate a high degree of accuracy.

J	GREEN, PE; KRIEGER, AM				GREEN, PE; KRIEGER, AM			ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CLUSTER-BASED MARKET-SEGMENTATION	JOURNAL OF THE MARKET RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article							CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; ISSUES	The common practice of factor analysing data matrices, followed by a clustering or rotated, standardised factor scores has recently been questioned by several researchers in marketing. This paper presents comparative analyses of nine large-scale data sets in which two different types of transformations are employed prior to k-means clustering. The study results suggest that there is some empirical evidence for the recent claims. Clusterings based on rotated factor scores generally show poorer associations with exogenous (background) variables than those based on either the original data or a less severe preliminary transformation. Implications of these findings for post hoc market segmentation are discussed.

Herbage and seed production were compared with the Australian cultivar, Circle Valley, over 2 years at Bonassai, north Sardinia. Regeneration in the 2 years after sowing and seed size were also estimated. All variables were related to collection site parameters using multivariate analysis. Herbage production varied between 2 and 8 t dry matter/ha, and up to 1.5 t/ha of seed was produced, K-means clustering of agronomic and morphological variables indicated that there were two groups present; one similar to variety polymorpha and one to variety vulgaris. There were two other single entry clusters, one of which contained cv. Circle Valley. Principal component analysis of the environmental variables indicated that cluster 1 (vulgaris) was more likely to come from mountainous areas where winter temperatures are low, and cluster 2 (polymorpha) from coastal areas where temperatures are mild. Regeneration of cluster 1 was better than that of cluster 2, which in turn was better than Circle Valley, indicating that populations in cluster 1 are better adapted to the management system imposed at Bonassai. The results indicate that M. polymorpha has considerable potential to improve the grasslands of Sardinia. However, it is unlikely that imported cultivars will be successful, and it seems important that the selection of local populations should continue. Commercial seed production in Sardinia is likely to be a problem, and grazing management under the conditions of communal ownership may have to be reviewed. It is important that future research and development involves farmers and other industry groups.

J	CICERONE, KD; KALMAR, K				CICERONE, KD; KALMAR, K			PERSISTENT POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME - THE STRUCTURE OF SUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS AFTER MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY	JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION			English	Article							MINOR HEAD-INJURY; CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME; WHIPLASH INJURY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION; CEREBRAL SYMPTOMS; CONCUSSION; DEFICITS	Objective: To examine the structure of persistent postconcussive symptoms in a sample of patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Design: Multivariate discriminant analysis in a series of 50 consecutive clinical referrals evaluated for postconcussive symptoms, neuropsychological functioning, and personality and emotional functioning at least 3 months after injury; follow-up information regarding level of disability was obtained for 37 patients at least 1 year after injury. Setting: Neuropsychology clinic affiliated with a comprehensive brain trauma rehabilitation center. Patients: 50 consecutively referred patients with a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury referred by physicians, rehabilitation nurses, or attorneys because of persistent deficits or subjective complaints consistent with a postconcussion syndrome. Main Outcome Measure: Postconcussive symptoms endorsed on the Post Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Symptom Checklist. Results: Pour factors consisting of multiple symptoms were identified: cognitive factor, affective factor, somatic factor, and sensory factor. Using these four factors, K-means cluster analysis of subjects was applied to classify patients. Patient clusters consisted of those with minimal symptoms, those with primarily cognitive-affective symptoms, those with prominent somatic symptoms, and those with severe global symptoms (P = .000). Patient symptom clusters were largely unrelated to neurological or neuropsychological functioning. The presence of chronic disability and resumption of productive functioning differed significantly among groups (P = .003). Conclusions: Subjective complaints provide clinically meaningful information and are strongly related to the nature and extent of disability after mild traumatic brain injury. Characterization of a single postconcussive syndrome may be misleading, and it may be more meaningful to define a number of postconcussive syndromes with differing symptom profiles and recovery.

J	HAWKINS, DM				HAWKINS, DM			CONVERGENCE OF THE FEASIBLE SOLUTION ALGORITHM FOR LEAST MEDIAN OF SQUARES REGRESSION	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article								Least median of squares regression presents a daunting computational problem for moderate to large data sets-the optimum is the Chebyshev regression fit to the correct subset of the cases, and finding it exactly requires an investigation of all subsets of the cases of a certain size. The feasible solution algorithm provides a computationally attractive approach that capitalizes on the known form of the LMS solution to pass from one starting subset to another satisfying the necessary condition for the optimum-such subsets are termed 'feasible sets'. The global optimum can be reached with arbitrarily high probability by following enough random starting sets to their feasible solutions. The practical performance of the feasible solution algorithm however depends on the proportion of random starting subsets that are attracted to the global optimum; or (a less demanding requirement) to a feasible solution that is qualitatively the same as the global optimum. Little is currently known about these proportions, or about the structure of the set of feasible solutions. This paper explains the earlier empiric observations that the feasible solution algorithm performs very well, and also provides two refined necessary conditions for improving it further. The approach of k-means clustering of the residuals given by different feasible solution provides new insights into the issue of different but qualitatively equivalent feasible solutions.

In this study, the parametric pattern recognition (PPR) algorithm that facilitates automatic MUAP feature extraction and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are combined for providing an integrated system for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. Two paradigms of learning far training ANN models were investigated, supervised, and unsupervised. For supervised learning, the back propagation algorithm and for unsupervised learning, the Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps algorithm were used. Diagnostic yield for models trained with both procedures was similar and on the order of 80%. However, back propagation models required considerably more computational effort compared to the Kohonen's self-organizing feature map model, Poorer diagnostic performance was obtained when the K-means nearest neighbor clustering algorithm was applied on the same set of data.

BanfIeld and Raftery, Biometriks 49, 803-821 (1993), have considered a parameterization of the variance matrix Sigma(k) of a cluster P-k in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition, Sigma(k) = lambda(k)D(k)A(k)D'(k), where lambda(k) defines the volume of P-k, D-k is an orthogonal matrix which defines its orientation and A(k) is a diagonal matrix with determinant 1 which defines its shape. This parametrization allows us to propose many general clustering criteria from the simplest one (spherical clusters with equal volumes which leads to the classical k-means criterion) to the most complex one (unknown and different volumes, orientations and shapes for all clusters). Methods of optimization to derive the maximum likelihood estimates as well as the practical usefulness of these models are discussed. We especially analyse the influence of the volumes of clusters. We report Monte Carlo simulations and an application on stellar data which dramatically illustrated the relevance of allowing clusters to have different volumes.

J	YU, B; YUAN, BZ				YU, B; YUAN, BZ			A GLOBAL OPTIMUM CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Note						CLASSIFICATION; CLUSTERING PROBLEM; COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMUM; HEURISTIC SEARCH		The problem of clustering N patterns into m classes may be regarded as a combinatorial optimization, classification, or vector quantization. The goal of a clustering procedure is in most cases to minimize a cost metric. However, existing methods (such as the well-known K-means algorithm and its variants) are unable to avoid that clustering results are trapped into a local optimum. This paper develops a clustering algorithm based on a heuristic search strategy of artificial intelligence, which can determine the globally optimal classification. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to promote the performance both in computation and in storage. An example on a real-world data set is illustrated. Also, the clustering problem with an unknown class number is dealt with in this contribution.		YU, B (reprint author), NO JIAOTONG UNIV,INST INFORMAT SCI,BEIJING 100044,PEOPLES R CHINA.

J	GONG, XF; RICHMAN, MB				GONG, XF; RICHMAN, MB			ON THE APPLICATION OF CLUSTER-ANALYSIS TO GROWING-SEASON PRECIPITATION DATA IN NORTH-AMERICA EAST OF THE ROCKIES	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Review							SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; MIXTURE MODEL TESTS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; UNITED-STATES; CLIMATIC CLASSIFICATION; STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES; DYNAMIC CLIMATOLOGY; SIMILAR METEOROLOGY; DEFINE PERIODS; POLAR BASIN	Cluster analysis ICA) has been applied to geophysical research for over two decades although its popularity has increased dramatically over the past few years. To date, systematic methodological reviews have not appeared in geophysical literature. In this paper, after a review of a large number of applications on cluster analysis, an intercomparison of various cluster techniques was carried out on a well-studied dataset (7-day precipitation data from 1949 to 1987 in central and eastern North America). The cluster methods tested were single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage between groups, average linkage within a new group, Ward's method, k means, the nucleated agglomerative method, and the rotated principal component analysis. Three different dissimilarity measures (Euclidean distance, inverse correlation, and theta angle) and three initial partition methods were also tested on the hierarchical and nonhierarchical methods, respectively. Twenty-two of the 23 cluster algorithms yielded natural grouping solutions. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to examine the reliability of the duster solutions. This was done by bootstrap resampling from the full dataset with four different sample sizes, then testing significance by the t test and the minimum significant difference test. Results showed that nonhierarchical methods outperformed hierarchical methods. The rotated principal component methods were found to be the most accurate methods, the nucleated agglomerative method was found to be superior to all other hard cluster methods, and Ward's method performed best among the hierarchical methods. Single linkage always yielded ''chaining'' solutions and, therefore, had poor matches to the input data. Of the three distance measures tested, Euclidean distance appeared to generate slightly more accurate solutions compared with the inverse correlation. The theta angle was quite variable in its accuracy. Tests of the initial partition method revealed a sensitivity of k-means CA to the selection of the seed points. The spatial patterns of cluster analysis applied to the full dataset were found to differ for various CA methods, thereby creating some questions on how to interpret the resulting spatial regionalizations. Several methods were shown to incorrectly place geographically separated portions of the domain into a single cluster, The authors termed this type of result ''aggregation error.'' It was found to be most problematic at small sample sizes and more severe for specific distance measures. The choice of clustering technique and dissimilarity measure/initial partition may indeed significantly affect the results of cluster analysis. Cluster analysis accuracy was also found to be linearly to logarithmically related to the sample size. This relationship was statistically significant. Several methods such as Ward's, k means, and the nucleated agglomerative were found to reach a higher level of accuracy at a lower sample size compared with other CA methods tested. The level of accuracy reached by the rotated principal component clustering compared with the other methods tested suggests that application of a hard and nonoverlapping clustering methodology to fuzzy and overlapping geophysical data results in a substantial degradation in the regionalizations presented.

J	LUO, JB; CHEN, CW; PARKER, KJ				LUO, JB; CHEN, CW; PARKER, KJ			ON THE APPLICATION OF GIBBS RANDOM-FIELD IN IMAGE-PROCESSING - FROM SEGMENTATION TO ENHANCEMENT	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article								The Gibbs random field (GRF) has proved to be a simple and practical way of parameterizing the Markov random field which has been widely used to model an image or image-related process in many image processing applications, In particular, the GRF can be employed to construct an efficient Bayesian estimation that often yields optimal results, We describe how the GRF can be efficiently incorporated into optimization processes in several representative applications, ranging from image segmentation to image enhancement One example is the segmentation of computerized tomography (CT) volumetric image sequence in which the GRF has been incorporated into K-means clustering to enforce the neighborhood constraints. Another example is the artifact removal in discrete cosine transform-based low bit rate image compression where GRF has been used to design an enhancement algorithm that reduces the ''blocking effect'' and the ''ringing effect'' while still preserving the image details, The third example is the integration of GRF in a wavelet-based subband video coding scheme in which the high-frequency subbands are segmented and quantized with spatial constraints specified by a GRF, and the subsequent enhancement of the decompressed images is accomplished by smoothing with another type of GRF. With these diverse examples, we are able to demonstrate that various features of images can all be properly characterized by a GRF. The specific form of the GRF can be selected according to the characteristics of an individual application. We believe that the GRF is a powerful tool to exploit the spatial dependency in various images, and is applicable to many image processing tasks.

J	CHI, Z; YAN, H				CHI, Z; YAN, H			IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING FUZZY RULES DERIVED FROM K-MEANS CLUSTERS	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							LOGIC CONTROLLER; CONTROL-SYSTEMS	Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in computerized systems for analyzing geographic map images. We present a segmentation technique, based on fuzzy rules derived from the K-means clusters, that is aimed at achieving human-like performance, In this technique, the K-means clustering algorithm is first used to obtain mixed-class clusters of training examples, whose centers and variances are then used to determine membership functions, Based on the derived membership functions, fuzzy rules are learned from the K-means cluster centers. In the map image segmentation, we make use of three features, difference intensity, standard deviation, and a measure of the local contrast, to classify each pixel to the foreground which consists of character and line patterns, and to the background. A centroid defuzzification algorithm is adopted in the classification step. Experimental results on a database of 22 gray-scale map images show that the technique achieves good and reliable results, and is compared favorably with an adaptive thresholding method By using K-means clustering, we can build a segmentation system of fewer rules that achieves a segmentation quality similar to that of using the uniformly distributed triangular membership functions with the fuzzy rules learned from all the training examples.

J	TARPEY, T				TARPEY, T			PRINCIPAL POINTS AND SELF-CONSISTENT POINTS OF SYMMETRICAL MULTIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						ELLIPTIC DISTRIBUTIONS; K-MEANS CLUSTERING; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; STRONGLY UNIMODAL DISTRIBUTIONS	CURVES	The k principal points xi(1), ..., xi(k) of a random vector X are the points that approximate the distribution of X by minimizing the expected squared distance of X to the nearest of the xi(j). A given set of k points y(1), ..., y(k) partition R(p) into domains of attraction D-1, ..., D-k respectively, where D,consists of all points x is an element of R(p) such that \\x - y(j)\\ < \\x - y(j)\\, l not equal j. If E[x parallel to X is an element of D-j] = y(j) for each j, then y(1), ..., y(k) are k self-consistent points of X (\\.\\ is the Euclidian norm). Principal points are a special case of self-consistent points. Principal points and sell-consistent points are cluster means of a distribution and represent a generalization of the population mean from one to several points. Principal points and self-consistent points are studied for a class of strongly symmetric multivariate distributions. A distribution is strongly symmetric if the distribution of the principal components (Z(1), ..., Z(p))' is invariant up to sign changes, i.e., (Z(1), ..., Z(p))' has the same distribution as (+/-Z(1), ..., +/-Z(p))'. Elliptical distributions belong to the class of strongly symmetric distributions. Several results are given for principal points and self-consistent points of strongly symmetric multivariate distributions. One result relates self-consistent points to principal component subspaces. Another result provides a sufficient condition for any set of self-consistent points lying on a line to be symmetric to the mean of the distribution.

Computer simulation and digital processing techniques were also used to arrive at a finer interpretation of the experimental micrographs. Throughout the whole range of reduction temperatures, images in both profile and planar views show the existence of a well-defined structural relationship between metal and support. The profile imaging technique has allowed us to study the rhodium/ceria interface, It consists of Rh(111) in epitaxial relationship with (111) ceria surface planes. For the whole metal particle two different crystallographic orientations with respect to the support, both compatible with a Rh(111)/CeO2(111) interface, were observed. Metal decoration phenomena have also been found. They could only be observed on catalysts reduced at either 973 or 1173 K, the covering effects being much heavier in the latter case, The metal particle size distributions corresponding to the reduced catalysts show that metal sintering is slight up to 973 K, with mean sizes ranging from 3.5 to 3.7 nm, and much stronger when the catalysts are reduced at 1173 K, mean size: 6.7 nm. Reoxidation studies at 373, 523, 773 and 1173 K, have revealed that upon O-2 treatment at 773 K the metal particles thoroughly transform into Rh2O3, the precise structural nature of which could not be unequivocally established. These studies have also shown that for oxygen treatments up to 773 K, metal redispersion is rather modest, being necessary to heat to 1173 K to induce the spread of the oxidized rhodium phase onto the support and the subsequent redispersion. For the catalyst reduced at 1173 K, the reoxidation at 773 K or below does not lead to the recovery of the metal decoration effects. The ensemble of results presented here are discussed in relation to the nature of the metal/support interaction phenomena occurring in Rh/CeO2 catalysts. The influence of both the reduction and reoxidation treatments on the metal deactivation/regeneration of these catalysts is also discussed.

J	SAEKI, S				SAEKI, S			EMPIRICAL-EQUATION OF STATE FOR SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS	JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS			English	Article						SUPERCRITICAL FLUID; EQUATION OF STATE; CRITICAL INDEX	SEMIEMPIRICAL EQUATION; SIMPLE LIQUIDS; POLYMERS; PRESSURE; TEMPERATURE; VELOCITY; VOLUME; KBAR	An empirical equation of state for supercritical fluids has been derived based on the power laws and the thermodynamic equation of state P = (partial derivative S/partial derivative V)(T)T - (partial derivative U/partial derivative V)(T). The equation of state derived in this work is given by P=P*(T)-a(k)(T)Xe--X-b(k)(T)[X+c(k)(T)](4)X where P*(T), a(k)(T), b(k)(T), and c(k)(T) are functions of temperature and suffix k means a state of fluid such as k = l for the liquid-like region V < V-c and k = g for the gas-like region V > V-c in the supercritical region T > T-c. The quantity X is defined by X = (V - V-c)/V where V-c is the critical volume and T-c is the critical temperature. The equation of state for five fluids, neon, hydrogen, deuterium, carbon monoxide, and helium is given by a modified form P=P*(T)-{a(k)(T)+b(k)(T)[X+c(k)(T)](4)}Xe--X. Comparisons between the PV isotherms for methane calculated by the Benedict-Webb-Rubin (B-W-R), the Beattie-Bridgeman (B-B) equations of state and the equation of state in this work have been done and it is found that the present equation of state gives a good agreement with the data in the same order of accuracy as the B-W-R and B-B equations of state.

Any set of k points y1, ..., y(k) partitions R(p) into ''domains of attraction'' D-1, ..., D-k according to minimal distance; following Hastie and Stuetzle we call y(1), ..., y(k) self-consistent if E[X\X is an element of D-j] = y(j) for j = 1, ..., k. Principal points are a special case of self-consistent points. In this paper we study principal points and self-consistent points of p-variate elliptical distributions. The main results are the following: (1) If k self-consistent points of X span a subspace of dimension q < p, then this subspace is also spanned by q principal components, that is, self-consistent points of elliptical distributions exist only in principal component subspaces. (2) The subspace spanned by It principal points of X is identical with the subspace spanned by the principal components associated with the largest roots. This proves a conjecture of Flury. We also discuss implications of our results for the computation and estimation of principal points.

Recently, a new method has been developed to measure in real-time the disappearance rate of ICG from plasma. This method eliminates the multiple sampling and delay of the conventional ICG test. ICG clearance is displayed as two indices: K (ICG disappearance rate) and R(15) (ICG retention rate 15 min after injection of ICG 0.5 mg kg(-1)). This measurement was performed in patients before and after 1 MAC of sevoflurane (n = 6), 2 MAC of sevoflurane (n = 6), 1 MAC of isoflurane (n = 6), 2 MAC of isoflurane (n = 6), 1 MAC of halothane (n = 6) or 2 MAC of halothane (n = 6) without surgical stress. Although mean arterial pressure decreased significantly at 1 and 2 MAC of sevoflurane, 2 MAC of halothane, and 1 and 2 MAC of isoflurane, ICG clearance was maintained at awake levels, except at 2 MAC of halothane (K = mean-33 (SEM 3)%, R(15) = +90 (3)% from awake values). We conclude that sevoflurane and isoflurane have a more favourable effect on liver circulation than halothane.

J	CHAUDHURI, D; CHAUDHURI, BB				CHAUDHURI, D; CHAUDHURI, BB			A MULTISEED NON-HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE FOR DATA-ANALYSIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article								Clustering methods such as K-means and its variations, such as Forgy, as well as their improved version ISODATA, do not work well if the shape of the cluster is elongated. It is pointed out that a single seed point cannot correctly reflect the nature of the data of an elongated cluster. A multiseed clustering algorithm is proposed, where one cluster may contain more than one seed point. A density-based algorithm is used to choose the initial seed points. To assign several seed points to one cluster, a minimal spanning tree guided novel merging technique is proposed. The merging technique is quite general and may be applied to other clustering approaches as well. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this clustering procedure.

This approach is different from traditional image analysis scenario in which the image segmentation and shape analysis were considered separately. The advantage of integrating the image segmentation with the shape analysis lies in the fact that the shape characteristics of the object can be used as effective constraints in the process of segmentation while original image data can be made useful along with the segmentation results in the process of shape analysis. In the case of left ventricle motion estimation, such an integration can be applied to obtain the estimation results that are consistent with both given image data and a priori shape knowledge. The initial segmentation of the images is obtained through adaptive K-mean classification and the region-of-interest is then identified based on the initial segmentation. The shape analysis is accomplished through fitting the boundary points of the region-of-interest to the surface modeling primitives. These two processes are integrated through the feedforward and feedback channels so that the surface fitting is constrained by the confidence measures of the boundary points and segmentation refinement is guided by the result of surface modeling. Global motion parameters are obtained by comparing the parameters of the fitted surface model at consecutive time instances. The segmentation and shape analysis results obtained show that the integrated approach is capable of providing promising improvement over traditional approaches.

This paper presents an enhancement of the traditional k-means algorithm. It approximates an optimal clustering solution with an efficient adaptive learning rate, which renders it usable even in situations where the statistics of the problem task varies slowly with time. This modification is based on the optimality criterion for the k-means partition stating that: all the regions in an optimal k-means partition have the same variations if the number of regions in the partition is large and the underlying distribution for generating input patterns Is smooth. The goal of equalizing these variations is introduced in the competitive function that assigns each new pattern vector to the ''appropriate'' region. To evaluate the optimal k-means algorithm, we first compare it to other k-means variants on several simple tutorial examples, then we evaluate it on a practical application: vector quantization of image data.

For this purpose we employ a technique based on the fractal dimension (FD) and the multi-fractal concept. Six FD features are based on the original image, the above average/high gray level image, the below average/low gray level image, the horizontally smoothed image, the vertically smoothed image, and the multi-fractal dimension of order two. A modified box-counting approach is proposed to estimate the FD, in combination with feature smoothing in order to reduce spurious regions. To segment a scene into the desired number of classes, an unsupervised K-means like clustering approach is used.

In this paper we propose a new and general segmentation algorithm involving 3D adaptive K-Means clustering in a multiresolution wavelet basis. The voxel image of the brain is segmented into five classes namely, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, white matter, bone and background (remaining pixels). The segmentation problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem wherein, the prior is assumed to be a Markov Random Field (MRF). The MAP estimation is achieved using an iterated conditional modes technique (ICM) in wavelet basis. Performance of the segmentation algorithm is demonstrated via application to phantom images as well as MR brain scans.

J	WU, HS; QIAN, JJ; BARBA, J				WU, HS; QIAN, JJ; BARBA, J			A CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM FOR SEGMENTATION OF MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES	JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								An algorithm for the segmentation of multispectral images is described. Unlike the K-means clustering method, where the number of clusters is specified by the user, this algorithm determines the number of clusters automatically on the basis of the multidimensional histogram. Furthermore, it is much faster than the K-nearest-neighbor clustering method because it does not involve a time-consuming iterative procedure. The algorithm classifies each multidimensional pixel into either group G(1), containing pixels judged suitable to represent the clusters, or into group G(0), containing the remaining pixels. Only the pixel elements in group G(1) are used as training vectors to determine the number of clusters and their centroids. Each vector in group G(0) is subsequently classified into one of the clusters on the basis of a modified minimum-square-error measurement. Application of the algorithm to Landsat images is presented.		WU, HS (reprint author), CUNY CITY COLL,DEPT ELECT ENGN,140 ST & CONVENT AVE,NEW YORK,NY 10031, USA.

In this paper we illustrate how this weighted k-means cluster procedure works and demonstrate the consistency result by giving some examples. Moreover we discuss the effect of the choice of epsilon on the estimate k(n) and use the bootstrap procedure in order to approximate the distribution of k(n).

J	SAUND, E				SAUND, E			A MULTIPLE CAUSE MIXTURE MODEL FOR UNSUPERVISED LEARNING	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								This paper presents a formulation for unsupervised learning of clusters reflecting multiple causal structure in binary data. Unlike the ''hard'' k-means clustering algorithm and the ''soft'' mixture model, each of which assumes that a single hidden event generates each data point, a multiple cause model accounts for observed data by combining assertions from many hidden causes, each of which can pertain to varying degree to any subset of the observable dimensions. We employ an objective function and iterative gradient descent learning algorithm resembling the conventional mixture model. A crucial issue is the mixing function for combining beliefs from different cluster centers in order to generate data predictions whose errors are minimized both during recognition and learning. The mixing function constitutes a prior assumption about underlying structural regularities of the data domain; we demonstrate a weakness inherent to the popular weighted sum followed by sigmoid squashing, and offer alternative forms of the nonlinearity for two types of data domain. Results are presented demonstrating the algorithm's ability successfully to discover coherent multiple causal representations in several experimental data sets.

In order to find optimal thresholds a probabilistic method called Multi-state Stochastic Connectionist Approach (MSCA) is employed. Mean Field Annealing (MFA), a deterministic counterpart of MSCA, is also studied in this context. A parallel model to parallelize the above methods is presented. Results of MFA and MSCA are compared with that of the K-means algorithm.		BABU, GP (reprint author), INDIAN INST SCI,DEPT COMP SCI & AUTOMAT,BANGALORE 560012,KARNATAKA,INDIA.

After training, the neural network is mapped back to a nearest neighbor classifier with optimized prototypes. The main characteristic of the present method is that both the trained neural network and the mapped nearest classifier have the same recognition performance. Experimental results show that this method outperforms the method recently proposed by Yan (1994).

J	BONNET, N				BONNET, N			PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF 2 METHODS FOR THE AUTOMATIC HANDLING OF MULTIVARIATE MAPS IN MICROANALYSIS	ULTRAMICROSCOPY			English	Article							STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS; SCATTER DIAGRAMS; IMAGE; MICROSCOPY; SPECTROSCOPY	Multivariable analytical maps are very useful for evaluating the joint distribution of several elements in a specimen. However, few tools have been developed for the handling of such multivariate data sets and for their quantitation. Scatter diagrams are limited to two or three maps, and their exploitation is often made interactively. Two ways are preliminary explored in this paper, in order to go from interactive correlation partitioning (ICP) in a two-dimensional space towards automatic correlation partitioning (ACP) in a N-dimensional space (N greater than or equal to 2). Of these two ways, the first is a clustering method (the K-means) working in the abstract parameter space while the second is a region growing method working in the image space. These two methods are described and tested on two simulations and a real X-ray map series. Some indications are also given for further studies which have to be conducted before such methods can be used routinely.

Depolarization of glial cells causes their intracellular pH (pH(i)) to increase. To more completely characterize this depolarization-induced alkalinization (DIA) in mammalian astrocytes, we studied DIA in cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes. Astrocytes were loaded with the fluorescent pH indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), and pH(i) was monitored with the use of an imaging system. Cells were studied similar to 24 h after removing them from serum-containing culture medium. In HCO3--buffered solution containing 3 mM K+, mean baseline pH(i) was 7.14 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SD). 2. Astrocyte pH(i) rapidly and reversibly alkalinized when bath [K+] was increased from 3 to 12 mM. In HCO3--buffered solution, mean DIA amplitude was 0.16 +/- 0.01 pH units, and mean rate of pH(i) change was 0.076 +/- 0.03 pH units/min. In contrast, DIA elicited in nominally HCO3--free, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered solution was much smaller (0.03 +/- 0.01 pH units, 0.04 +/- 0.01 pH units/min; P < 0.0001), indicating that DIA was, in large part, a HCO3--dependent process. Subsequent experiments were carried out in HCO3--buffered solution. 3. The relationship between DIA and variable changes in bath [K+] was examined. Increasing bath [K+] from 3 to 6 mM produced a DIA of 0.07 +/- 0.04 pH units, and lowering [K+] to 0.5 mM resulted in an acid shift of 0.08 +/- 0.05 pH units. The effects of these changes in [K+] on membrane potential were measured in separate experiments by whole cell patch-clamp recording. On the basis of these data, it was possible to construct a relationship between V-m and pH(i) shifting membrane potential similar to 10 mV resulted in a pH(i) shift of similar to 0.07. 4. Application of 0.5 mM Ba2+ depolarized V-m and elicited DIA in astrocytes. This indicated that depolarization, in the absence of an increase in [K+], could cause DIA. Application of Ba2+ also blocked K+-induced DIA, presumably because blockade of K+ channels prevented any depolarization by K+. 5. Cells with more alkaline baseline pH(i)s exhibited larger and more rapidly developing DIAs. The mechanism of this effect is not known. 6. The timing of serum removal affected astrocyte DIA. Cells studied similar to 24 h after serum removal always exhibited robust DIA (mean = 0.16 +/- 0.01 pH units). In cells removed from serum just before experimentation, only 40% showed DIA, and the response amplitude was small (mean pH(i) = 0.05 +/- 0.02; P < 0.0001). The mechanism of this serum-related suppression of DIA was not determined. 7. Removal of extracellular Na+ significantly decreased DIA, suggesting that DIA is, at least in part, a Na+-dependent process. Removal of extracellular Cl- did not reduce DIA and seemed to increase its initial rate, possibly by removing an opposing acid loader such as the Cl-/HCO3- antiporter. 8. The stilbene 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and the anion channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC), both blockers of anion transport, markedly reduced DIA in the presence or absence of Na+. 9. DIA in rat hippocampal astrocytes was Na+ dependent, HCO3- dependent, and DIDS sensitive; it did not depend on Cl-. These features strongly suggest that DIA was primarily mediated by the electrogenic Na+/HCO3- co-transporter, a transport mechanism known to be present in these cells (O'Connor et al. 1994). 10. DIA was elicited by small increases in [K+](o) (i.e., 3-6 mM), as might be seen with neural activity in vivo.

The results reported here compare neural networks using Kohonen learning with a traditional clustering method (K-means) in an experimental design using simulated data with known cluster solutions. Two types of neural networks were examined, both of which used unsupervised learning to perform the clustering. One used Kohonen learning with a conscience and the other used Kohonen learning without a conscience mechanism. The performance of these nets was examined with respect to changes in the number of attributes, the number of clusters, and the amount of error in the data. Generally, the K-means procedure had fewer points misclassified while the classification accuracy of neural networks worsened as the number of clusters in the data increased from two to five.

Specifically, the daily 500-hPa surface outputs of the Canadian Climate Center (CCC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) (Germany) GCMs are linked stochastically, using a split sampling approach, to local temperature and precipitation in Nebraska. Three series of data are analyzed: historical data, 1 x CO2 GCM results and 2 x CO2 GCM results. Between these three data sets, no significant difference can be detected in either CP typology (constructed by principal component analysis and k means method) or stochastic properties of daily time series (Markov matrix). On the other hand, the average geopotential height of the 500-hPa pressure field exhibits significant change, labeled the Delta CO2 effect, between the 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 cases. Accordingly, climate change is assumed to be represented by the historical average geopotential height augmented by the Delta CO2 increment. It is found that both the CCC and MPI GCMs lead to predicting a winter temperature increase of 3 degrees-6 degrees C, a smaller but significant increase in spring and fall temperatures, and no increase in summer. The probability of precipitation occurrence is found to remain almost unchanged, as well as the dry period duration. The estimates of local response to climate change depend upon the location and the GCM used for downscaling the CP. The MPI GCM, which includes an ocean-atmosphere coupling, appears to yield smaller downscaled changes than the purely atmosphere-based CCC GCM.

First, a new frequency measure is devised to indicate the degree of coherency among system generators. Incorporating with the frequency measure, a neural network implementation of the K-means algorithm is then proposed to identify clusters of coherent generators. The rotor speeds at three selected instants in time are used as the feature patterns for the learning algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive analyses are performed on two different power systems of varying sizes with rather encouraging results.

The primary motivation behind the present work has been to serve as a preprocessing step in automatic segmentation of brain tissue and CSF. A second objective was to use the algorithm in a fully automatic PET-MR registration algorithm. Materials and Methods: The method is primarily designed for, and requires, dual echo (T1- and T2-weighted) MR images with transaxial orientations. The algorithm consists of three main stages. First, the head contour is detected using a series of low-level image-processing techniques. In the second stage, the pixels inside the head contour are clustered into a number of classes using the K-means algorithm. Finally, the extradural connected components are eliminated based on a number of heuristics. Results: Test results are presented for 10 MR image sets consisting of 197 slices. As a quantitative measure of accuracy, manual segmentations were performed by radiologists on a number of slices and compared with the results obtained automatically. Conclusion: Visual inspection and quantitative validation of the results indicate that the algorithm accurately detects the intradural spaces in MR images. This is an important step in fully automatic segmentation and registration of MR images.

J	MIYAHARA, M				MIYAHARA, M			SUBTYPES OF STUDENTS WITH LEARNING-DISABILITIES BASED UPON GROSS MOTOR FUNCTIONS	ADAPTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUARTERLY			English	Article								The purpose of this study was to identify possible subtypes of students with learning disabilities based upon gross motor functions. Subjects in a private school for learning difficulties were divided into a group of students with learning disabilities and a comparison group. Gross motor subtests from the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (Bruininks, 1978) were administered to both learning-disabled and comparison groups. The four subtypes yielded by the K-means iterative partitioning method demonstrated distinct profiles. Cluster membership was shown to be fairly stable by internal validation techniques. The external validity of the four subtypes was verified by a teacher's ratings of students' physical behaviors. It was recommended that the outcome of type-specific remediation and the longitudinal stability of gross motor subtypes be evaluated.

J	EDER, BK; DAVIS, JM; BLOOMFIELD, P				EDER, BK; DAVIS, JM; BLOOMFIELD, P			AN AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION SCHEME DESIGNED TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE DEPENDENCE OF OZONE ON METEOROLOGY	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY			English	Article							EASTERN-UNITED-STATES; SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGICAL ANALYSIS; SURFACE OZONE; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; RURAL-AREAS; AIR-QUALITY; SCALE; LOCATIONS; MOUNTAIN	This paper utilizes a two-stage (average linkage then convergent k means) clustering approach as part of an automated meteorological classification scheme designed to better elucidate the dependence of ozone on meteorology. When applied to 10 years (1981-90) of meteorological data for Birmingham, Alabama, the classification scheme identified seven statistically distinct meteorological regimes, the majority of which exhibited significantly different daily 1-h maximum ozone concentration distributions. Results from this two-stage clustering approach were then used to develop seven ''refined'' stepwise regression models designed to 1) identify the optimum set of independent meteorological parameters influencing the O-3 concentrations within each meteorological cluster, and 2) weigh each independent parameter according to its unique influence within that cluster. Large differences were noted in the number, order, and selection of independent variables found to significantly contribute (alpha = 0.10) to the variability of O-3. When this unique dependence was taken into consideration through the development and subsequent amalgamation of the seven individual regression models, a better parameterization of O-3's dependence on meteorology was achieved. This ''composite'' model exhibited a significantly larger R(2) (0.59) and a smaller rmse (12.80 ppb) when compared to results achieved from an ''overall'' model(R(2) = 0.53, rmse = 13.85) in which the meteorological data were not clustered.

The objective was to determine the feasibility of clustering procedures to classify the studied accessions according to their agronomic adaptation. Hierarchical (complete linkage) cluster and nonhierarchical (k-means) cluster analysis were found to be suitable statistical tools for assigning accessions to discrete groups. The 118 P. maximum accessions were classified into four distinct clusters of 21, 40, 41, and 16 accessions with, respectively, excellent, good, regular, and poor degree of agronomic adaptation.

An empirical stopping criterion and a perturbation method which is more feasible than those proposed in the literature are suggested. The algorithm is tested on simulated data, and then used for the classification of samples of Chinese medicine calculus bovis or bezoar and samples of Chinese tea. The algorithm which guaranteed in obtaining a global optimum with shorter time compared favorably with traditional cluster analysis based on simulated annealing and the K-means algorithm.

Reaction kinetics of this type govern the evolution of many polymerizations and have been extensively measured using photophysical techniques. Three related theoretical approaches are described and illustrated with examples: (1) simple scaling arguments, (2) renormalization group methods and (3) the self-consistent method of Wilemski and Fixman. All three approaches predict that two distinct universality classes of reaction kinetics exist, with different scaling laws for rate constants k: mean field (MF) and diffusion-controlled (DC). Increasing chain length or time drives kinetics to one behavior or the other, depending only on the regime of polymer concentration phi. Dilute solutions (good solvents) obey MF kinetics because a pair of reactive groups in close proximity is unlikely to react; the mean number of collisions is very small. This is universally true, independently of the group chemistry. In melts, by contrast, reaction is very likely because many collisions occur and thus kinetics are intrinsically DC. In semi-dilute solutions, as phi increases from dilute towards the melt a transition occurs, from MF to DC kinetics. At the transition point k is peaked. A range of experimental studies are discussed and their findings compared with theory.

J	SAPIRSTEIN, HD; ROLLER, R; BUSHUK, W				SAPIRSTEIN, HD; ROLLER, R; BUSHUK, W			INSTRUMENTAL MEASUREMENT OF BREAD CRUMB GRAIN BY DIGITAL IMAGE-ANALYSIS	CEREAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TEST BAKING PROCEDURES; TEXTURE	An instrumental system has been developed for direct quantitative assessment of bread crumb grain using digital image analysis technology implemented on a personal computer. Software was developed for comprehensive measurement of crumb grain features including cell area, cell density (cells/cm2), cell-wall thickness, cell-total area ratio, crumb brightness, and uniformity of cell size. The system is completely objective in all respects, including the critical step of crumb cell detection, where an adaptation of the K-means algorithm was used for image segmentation by thresholding. Typical spatial resolution of the system using a conventional macroviewing lens was approximately (80 mum)2 crumb per pixel. Image processing time to compute the crumb cell structure for a single bread slice (307,200 pixels per image) was about 10 sec. The precision and accuracy of the system were tested by analysis of results of experimental breadmaking using control and oxidant-formula loaves. Compared with control loaves, bread crumb containing oxidants was determined to be 6% brighter and to have, on average, 21% more cells/cm2, 17% smaller cells in cross-sectional area, 13% thinner cell walls, and 16% more uniform grain. These values were consistent with the finer crumb grain of bread containing oxidants, as observed visually. The proportion of crumb comprising gas cells for control and oxidant-formula bread was precisely identical (46%). The equivalence provides objective evidence that the predominant difference in the crumb structure of bread prepared with and without oxidants relates almost exclusively to the degree of subdivision or coalescence of gas cells.

J	Nathan, KS; Silverman, HF				Nathan, Krishna S.; Silverman, Harvey F.			Time-Varying Feature Selection and Classification of Unvoiced Stop Consonants	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article								A feature set that captures the dynamics of formant transitions prior to closure in a VCV environment is used to characterize and classify the unvoiced stop consonants. The feature set is derived from a time-varying, data-selective model for the speech signal. Its performance is compared with that of comparable formant data from a standard delta-LPC-based madel. The different feature sets are evaluated on a database composed of eight talkers. A 40% reduction in classification error rate is obtained by means of the time-varying model. The performance of three different classifiers is discussed. A novel adaptive algorithm, termed learning vector classifier (LVC) is compared with standard K-means and LVQ2 classifiers. LVC is a supervised learning classifier that improves performance by increasing the resolution of the decision boundaries. Error rates obtained for the three-way (p, t, and k) classification task using LVC and the time-varying analysis are comparable to that of techniques that make use of additional discriminating information contained in the burst. Further improvements are expected when an expanded time-varying feature set is utilized, coupled with information from the burst.

The matching process consists of two steps: registration, which restores image differences induced by varying detector positions, and comparison, which follows image analysis and makes it possible to overlap different images and to detect and classify differences of the image contents.1-3 We present a new technique for registering uni- and multispectral image data, which is independent of the underlying grey-level distributions. This characteristic property is achieved by first transforming the representation of the image into a set of connected regions with homogeneous grey levels by means of a k-means classification algorithm. The idea is to compare the geometric extensions of overlapping regions instead of single pixel values of images for a given geometric transformation.

A new stopping criterion and perturbation method which are more feasible than those proposed in the literature, are proposed. The algorithm is first tested on simulated data, and then used for the classification of Chinese tea samples. The results show that the algorithm which guaranteed obtaining a global optimum compared favourably with the traditional hierarchical technique and K-means algorithm.

To study the effect of flour extraction rate (0.54, 11.11 and 1.68% ash content), dough yield (DY) (160, 200 and 240 of sour dough/ 100 g flour), and fermentation temperature (25, 30 and 35-degrees-C) a response surface regression, factor analysis and K-means clustering analysis were used. Results from factor analysis point out that the extraction rate of flour governs TIA and acetic acid content; this factor accounts for the 53% of variability of the data. Dough yield is highly correlated with lactic acid content, explaining 27% of the total variance. Finally, temperature explains the remaining 16% of variation, but it is not related to any analytical variable. From K-means clustering analysis, flour extraction rate of 1.68% ash content leads to the highest TTA and acetic acid values, whereas DY of 240 g sour dough/100 g flour gives the greatest lactic acid content, and DY of 160 leads to the lowest levels of TTA and organic acids.

J	KOETJE, TA				KOETJE, TA			INTRASITE SPATIAL STRUCTURE IN THE EUROPEAN UPPER PALEOLITHIC - EVIDENCE AND PATTERNING FROM THE SW OF FRANCE	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article							ARCHAEOLOGY	Over the past 20 years a number of Western European Upper Paleolithic sites have been examined for internal spatial patterning by using a variety of quantitative techniques. The most commonly applied technique has been K-means clustering in one form or another. Because this technique has been applied consistently to a relatively large number of sites from a wide variety of temporal phases in the European Upper Paleolithic, it is useful to search for common patterns and consistencies in the organization of space during this time period. These analyses suggest that Upper Paleolithic sites commonly exhibit three basic modes of internal organization. Hearth focused sites are often large, complex sites with many features and distinctive global and local artifact patterning. Areal focused sites are often scatters of artifacts, and/or occur with severe natural constraints. Structure focused sites frequently show no clear indications of hearths, and are free of 'natural' constraints. They are frequently highly patterned around what may best be called ''architectural structures'', however. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

Recent developments have employed a deterministic annealing approach to solving this problem. In this letter a new approximation clustering algorithm, incorporating a gradient descent technique with deterministic annealing, is described. Results are presented for this new method, and its performance is compared with the K-means algorithm and a previously used deterministic annealing clustering algorithm. The new method is shown to produce more effective and robust clustering.

The method is analytical, deterministic, unsupervised, automatic, and noniterative. The computation time is of order n if the data size is n, and hence much faster than any other method which requires the computation of an n-by-n dissimilarity matrix. Furthermore, the proposed method does not have the trouble of guessing initial values. This new approach is thus more suitable for fast automatic hierarchical clustering or any other fields requiring fast automatic two-class clustering of 2-D data. The method can be extended to cluster data in higher dimensional space. A 3-D example is included.		LIN, JC (reprint author), NATL CHIAO TUNG UNIV,DEPT COMP & INFORMAT SCI,HSINCHU 30050,TAIWAN.

J	Gauvain, JL; Lee, CH				Gauvain, Jean-Luc; Lee, Chin-Hui			Maximum a Posteriori Estimation for Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Observations of Markov Chains	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article								In this paper, a framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of hidden Markov models (HMM) is presented. Three key issues of MAP estimation, namely, the choice of prior distribution family, the specification of the parameters of prior densities, and the evaluation of the MAP estimates, are addressed. Using HMM's with Gaussian mixture state observation densities as an example, it is assumed that the prior densities for the HMM parameters can be adequately represented as a product of Dirichlet and normal-Wishart densities. The classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, namely, the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded, and MAP estimation formulas are developed. Prior density estimation issues are discussed for two classes of applications-parameter smoothing and model adaptation-and some experimental results are given illustrating the practical interest of this approach. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning is shown to serve as a unified approach for a wide range of speech recognition applications.

Eleven experimental incubations were performed from May 1989 to April 1991 using pulsed oxygen electrodes that collected data continuously under natural daylight conditions. For comparison with in situ measurements of photosynthesis, P vs I parameters were calculated from laboratory measurements on blade segments incubated in a small volume chamber. For field plants, average saturation irradiance (I(k)) was 319 mumol m-2 s-1, photosynthetic capacity (P(max)) was 374 mumol O2 g-1 dry wt (dw) h-1, and relative quantum efficiency (alpha) generally ranged from 0.5 to 1.6 mumol O2 g-1 dw h-1 (mumol photons m-2 s-1)-1. Whole plant respiration was 70 mumol g-1 dw (leaf) h-1, and compensation irradiance (I(cp)) was ca 85 mumol m-2 s-1. Chlorophyll a concentrations averaged 12.8 mg g-1 dw, and the mean chl a: chl b ratio over the 2 yr period was 2.2. For blade segments incubated in the laboratory under similar temperatures to field plants and at corresponding chlorophyll concentrations, P(max) was not significantly different but alpha was significantly higher, ranging from 3.4 to 5.3 mumol O2 g-1 dw h-1 (mumol photons m-2 s-1)-1. The higher alpha values resulted in significantly lower estimates for I(k) (mean of 101 mumol m-2 s-1). The higher alpha in laboratory plants was largely related to the perpendicular orientation of leaf tissue to a directed light field, which is not reflective of natural conditions for H. wrightii. The significant difference in I(k) values calculated from incubations performed in the laboratory and field has profound effects on model calculations of H(sat), the duration of irradiance-saturated photosynthesis, and thus predictions of the minimum light requirements required to sustain growth in H. wrightii. Consequently, the application of laboratory-derived I(k) values for H. wrightii would result in overestimates of its maximum depth limits and rates of areal primary production.

J	LORR, M; STRACK, S				LORR, M; STRACK, S			PERSONALITY PROFILES OF POLICE CANDIDATES	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							OFFICERS; CLUSTERS	Recently, Eber (1991) reported on several large-scale studies of law enforcement candidates. The main measures were the two parts of the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (Krug, Cattell, & IPAT, 1980). Part I consists of the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire Scales, while Part II is devoted to 12 measures of psychopathology. The most striking finding was a clear personality profile characterized by a strong pattern of self-discipline or Control, Tough Poise, and low Anxiety. Our study hypothesis was that several police personality profiles would be found. This conjecture was tested on the 16PF scores of two samples of 275 police candidates by means of the Ward (1963) hierarchical clustering procedure and the Milligan/Sokal (1980) nonhierarchical K-means cluster procedures. Three distinct score profiles were isolated in both samples.

EEG data are collected from approximately one second periods prior to movement of the right or left index finger. A cue stimulus indicating which hand to use is employed. Feature vectors are formed by concatenating spatial information from different EEG electrodes and temporal information from different time incidents during the planning of hand movement. Power values of the most reactive frequencies within the extended alpha-band (5-16 Hz) are used as features. The features are derived from an autoregressive model fitted to the EEG signals. The performance of the classifiers and their ability to learn and generalise is tested with 200 arbitrarily selected event-related EEG data from a normal subject. Classification accuracies as high as 85-90% are achieved with the methods described here. A comparison of the classifiers is made.

J	WU, XL; GUAN, L				WU, XL; GUAN, L			ACCELERATION OF THE LBG ALGORITHM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NEIGHBOR	A concentric spherical search technique is proposed to speed up the clustering process in VQ design. A linear data structure is incorporated into the LBG algorithm to keep and update the information about the proximity among the codewords. This proximity information can significantly reduce the number of candidate codewords to be the closest to a given training vector. An improved k-means type VQ design algorithm is proposed based on the new search technique and the supporting data structure. The new algorithm is simple to implement, valid for general error metric, and demonstrated by our experiments to be considerably faster than previous algorithms.

In the first stage, the QMF bank is used as the wavelet transform to decompose the texture image into subbands. The gray scale transform invariant features derived from the statistics based on first-order distribution of gray levels are then extracted from each subband image. In the second stage, the sequence of subbands is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and one HMM is designed for each class of textures. The HMM is used to exploit the dependence among these subbands, and is able to capture the trend or changes caused by rotation. During recognition, the unknown texture is matched against all the models. The best matched model identifies the texture class. Up to 93.33% classification accuracy is reported.

J	WHITEHEAD, BA; CHOATE, TD				WHITEHEAD, BA; CHOATE, TD			EVOLVING SPACE-FILLING CURVES TO DISTRIBUTE RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS OVER AN INPUT SPACE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS	An evolutionary neural network training algorithm is proposed for radial basis function (RBF) networks. The locations of basis function centers are not directly encoded in a genetic string, but are governed by space-filling curves whose parameters evolve genetically. This encoding causes each group of co-determined basis functions to evolve to fit a region of the input space. A network produced from this encoding is evaluated by training its output connections only. Networks produced by this evolutionary algorithm appear to have better generalization performance on the Mackey-Glass time series than corresponding networks whose centers are determined by k-means clustering.

J	Rigoll, G				Rigoll, Gerhard			Maximum Mutual Information Neural Networks for Hybrid Connectionist-HMM Speech Recognition Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article								This paper proposes a novel approach for a hybrid connectionist-hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition system based on the use of a neural network as vector quantizer. The neural network is trained with a new learning algorithm offering the following innovations: 1) It is an unsupervised learning algorithm for perceptron-like neural networks that are usually trained in supervised mode. 2) Information theory principles are used as learning criteria, making the network especially suitable for combination with a HMM-based speech recognition system. 3) The neural network is not trained using the standard error-backpropagation algorithm but using instead a newly developed self-organizing learning approach. The use of the hybrid system with the neural vector quantizer results in a 25% error reduction compared with the same HMM system using a standard k-means vector quantizer. The training algorithm can be further refined by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Finally, it is demonstrated how the new learning approach can be applied to multiple-feature hybrid speech recognition systems, using a joint information theory-based optimization procedure for the multiple neural codebooks, resulting in a 30% error reduction.

A new formulation of the clustering problem is investigated. In order to obtain optimal partition, search is undertaken to locate optimal initial seeds, such that the K-means algorithm converges to optimal partition. Search space involved in this process is continuous, so decretization is done and simulated annealing is employed for locating optimal initial seeds. Experimental results substantiate the proposed method. Results obtained with the selected data sets are presented.

The purple membrane, from the bacterium Halobacterium halobium, was used and reconstituted with dilauroyl-(Lau2GroPCho), dimyristoyl- (Myr2GroPCho), dipalmitoyl- (Pam2GroPCho) and distearoyl- (Ste2GroPCho) glycerophosphocholine. The phase behaviour of the lipids was investigated at different temperatures and different protein/lipid molar ratios, by analyzing the fluorescence excitation spectra of the 1-acyl-2-[8-(2-anthroyl)-octanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine probe, and by measuring the fluorescence depolarization of the 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene probe. Data obtained with 1-acyl-2-[8-(2-anthroyl)-octanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine shows that bacteriorhodopsin produced positive or negative shifts in the phase transition temperature of the host lipids depending on the strength and sign of the mismatch between the lipid and protein hydrophobic thicknesses and also on the protein concentration and aggregation state in the lipid bilayer, In the region of high protein concentration (bacteriorhodopsin/phosphatidylcholine molar ratios almost-equal-to 1:50) and despite the presence of the endogenous lipids, bacteriorhodopsin (hydrophobic length d(p) almost-equal-to 3.0-3.1 nm) brought about a large upward shift in the phase-transition temperature of Lau2GroPCho (DELTAT almost-equal-to 40 K, mean hydrophobic thickness dBAR almost-equal-to 2.4 nm), and to a lesser extent of Myr2GroPCho (AT almost-equal-to 23 K, dBAR almost-equal-to 2.8 nm), accounting for a strong rigidifying effect of the protein on these short-chain lipids. Bacteriorhodopsin had no influence on the phase properties of Pam2GroPCho (DELTA almost-equal-to 0 K, dBAR almost-equal-to 3.2 nm), a lipid whose mean hydrophobic thickness is similar to that of the protein. In contrast, the transition temperature of Ste2GroPCho was decreased (DELTAT almost-equal-to - 13 K, dBAR almost-equal-to 3.7 nm), indicating a fluidifying effect of the protein on this long-chain lipid. Similar effects on the lipid acyl-chain order were observed in the region of high-protein dilution (bacteriorhodopsin/phosphatidylcholine molar ratios < 1:500). In this region and for Lau2GroPCho, both the spectroscopic data and circular-dichroism spectra indicated that the protein was in the monomeric form. Phase diagrams, in temperature versus bacteriorhodopsin concentration, were constructed for Lau2GroPCho and Ste2GroPCho. On account of microscopic theoretical models and of the relative values of d(p) and dBAR, these diagrams indicate a preference of the protein for those lipid molecules which are in the gel-ordered state in Lau2GroPCho but in the liquid disordered state in Ste2GroPCho. The phase diagram of Lau2GroPCho was also analyzed using another theoretical approach based upon elastic models within the Landau-de Gennes theory. This allowed for the estimation of the coherence length zeta which characterizes the distance over which the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer is perturbed by the protein. A value of 1.2 nm was found, agreeing relatively well with theoretical predictions.

Five of the six subtypes were virtually identical to subtypes identified in previous research (viz., normal, somatic concern, mild anxiety, externalized psychopathology, and internalized psychopathology). A sixth subtype (conduct disorder) was also found. Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) Reading and Spelling scores discriminated between normal, somatic concern, and conduct disorder subtypes on the one hand vs. the more disturbed externalized and internalized psychopathology subtypes on the other, the latter groups scored higher on these measures. The internalized psychopathology subtype also showed large discrepancies between reading vs. arithmetic and spelling vs. arithmetic. The results support the view that psychosocial functioning is related to assets and deficits in cognitive/academic functioning in children, and that particular patterns of such assets and deficits are related to particular forms of psychopathology.

J	MARTIN, SM				MARTIN, SM			POPULATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A-SCALARIS DORBIGNY, 1835 (MOLLUSCA, GASTROPODA, AMPULLARIIDAE) IN THE QUARRIES OF LOS-TALAS (BERISSO, BUENOS-AIRES PROVINCE, ARGENTINA)	STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT			Spanish	Article								This work is focused in the analysis of biological parameters of the freshwater snail Ampullaria scalaris d'Orbigny, 1835 from the quarries of Los Talas (District of Berisso, Buenos Aires province, 34-degrees 53' South Latitude and 57-degrees 54' West Longitude). The collects were made during the period from march of 1986 to january of 1988. These were made calculus of lineal regression, coefficient of correlation; K factor of condition and an analysis of the modal value of weights according to the sex. By means of histograms were established the variations produced in this population at the level of length frequencies according to the sex and milimetric classes, monthly. The conclusions arrived in this work, in agreement with the order of the treated subjects are the following ones. The relative growth between the total length of the shell and the total weight, has a high correlation for the two sexes. The factor K mean or condition, increases his value in all the individuals of greatest lengths, in males as in females. In the percentages of males and its proportion in relationship to the length, the proportion 1:1 was observed monthly in great part of the population. The frequency variation of the weight/sex function is of unimodal character and the mode is situated in the lesser weight class, which coincides with the lesser length individuals of this population. The length structure of this population and its anual evolution analysis, evidentiates that there exists one mayor group representated (30-35 mm). The juvenile class (5-15 mm) has an sustantial increase during the months of march to april, which indicates to us that these specimens are products of the massive ovipositions of november, december and january. The evolution of the length structure of A. scalaris demonstrates the life cycle is anual.

The frequency of MN was much higher in multinucleate cells (mean 100 - 204 MN per 1000 cells) than in binucleate cells (mean 8.2 - 21.0 MN per 1000 cells), tetranucleate cells containing more MN than trinucleate cells. The presence of whole chromosomes in the MN was studied in two separate experiments by immunofluorescence using antikinetochore (CREST) serum and by a centromeric alphoid DNA oligomer probe (in situ hybridization, ISH). In the tri- and tetra-nucleate cells produced by Cyt-B, MN were clearly more often kinetochore-positive (K+) (mean 82 - 86%) and centromere-positive (C +) (mean 73-83%) than in mononucleate cells of cultures containing no Cyt-B (mean 63% for CREST and 50% for ISH), indicating that most of the excess MN in the multinucleate cells were due to whole chromosomes. The binucleate lymphocytes had about as high prevalence of K+ MN (mean 79 - 84%) as the tri- and tetra-nucleate cells, despite their low MN count. Also in the ISH analysis, the majority of MN in binucleate cells were positively stained (mean 58-62%). If it is assumed that the extra labelled MN are due to Cyt-B, the present findings suggest that Cyt-B could be responsible for approximately 45 - 57% (CREST data) or approximately 17 - 23% (ISH data) of MN in binucleate cells. The presence of whole chromosomes in the majority of human lymphocyte MN is problematic when the assay is used for biomonitoring of exposure to clastogens, where the usually small effects expected may be masked by the high background. The identification of kinetochores or centromeres in MN might help in dealing with this problem.

The data was analyzed in two phases - cluster structure seeking and classification phases - by three different clustering methods (inverse factor analysis, hierarchical agglomerative, and k-means cluster analysis). Seven types of marriage were identified: Devitalized couples (40%), Financially focused couples (11%), Conflicted couples (14%), Traditional couples (10%), Balanced couples (80%), Harmonious couples (8%), and Vitalized couples (9%). The multidimensional profiles are described in relation to global measure of marital satisfaction, demographic characteristics, and clinical and research implications.

We use a genetic al to find a near-optimal partitioning of the given data set by selecting proper initial seed values in the K-means algorithm. Results obtained are very encouraging and in most of the cases, on data sets having well separated clusters, the proposed scheme reached a global minimum.

A stochastic hydroclimatological model is used to define daily precipitation under the climate of eastern Nebraska. Principal component analysis and k means method result in nine CP types in west central United States on the basis of 40 years of data- Both the probability and the amount of daily precipitation are strongly related to CP types. The approach can be used to predict the regional or local hydrological effect of climate change.

J	OBAIDAT, MS				OBAIDAT, MS			ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS USING PATTERN-RECOGNITION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Letter								This correspondence is concerned with presenting a methodology for characterizing ultrasonic transducers using pattern recognition techniques. An apparatus was developed to collect focus, frequency spectrum, impulse response, and diameter parameters. Six different pattern recognition techniques were applied to classify 83 different transducers. These include: K-means, minimum distance, perceptron, potential function, cosine measure, and Bayes' classifier. Moreover, two dimensionality reduction techniques, the K-L transform and the Fisher Multiple discriminant, were applied to reduce the feature space. It was found that the K-means was the most successful classification algorithm. Very close behind in performance was the combination of K-L transform with minimum distance classifier. The latter reduced the feature space by 44 percent with only 6 percent misclassification error more than K-means. The potential function scheme did not converge to a solution in a time equal to 60 times that was required for the other algorithms. Results of the classification, dimensionality reduction, comparison and validation are presented to highlight the advantages and limitations of the investigated techniques.

The algorithm is written in Pascal and implemented on an MS-DOS personal computer. It uses k-means, initialized with a large number of seed points, followed by a modified nearest neighbor technique to reduce the large number of subclusters. Thus we combine the advantage of the k-means (speed) with that of the nearest neighbor technique (accuracy). In order to achieve a rapid analysis, no complex data transformations such as principal components analysis were used. Results of the cluster analysis on both real and artificial flow cytometric data are presented and discussed. The results show that it is possible to get very good cluster analysis partitions, which compare favorably with manually gated analysis in both time and in reliability, using a personal computer.

Six measurements of the mandibular dental arches were performed, and five independent ratios were determined. By following the k-means clustering method on the basis of these ratios and the use of polynomial functions of the sixth degree, five mandibular dental arch forms were defined, and an arch guide was developed. The proposed forms are relatively narrow in comparison with previous studies. No significant differences in their distributions were seen between male and female subjects. However, the dental arches of the women have smaller dimensions.

A vector quantization strategy is discussed that jointly optimizes distortion errors and the codebook complexity, thereby determining the size of the codebook. A maximum entropy estimation of the cost function yields an optimal number of reference vectors, their positions and their assignment probabilities. The dependence of the codebook density on the data density for different complexity functions is investigated in the limit of asymptotic quantization levels. How different complexity measures influence the efficiency of vector quantizers is studied for the task of image compression, i.e., we quantize the wavelet coefficients of gray-level images and measure the reconstruction error. Our approach establishes a unifying framework for different quantization methods like K-means clustering and its fuzzy version, entropy constrained vector quantization or topological feature maps and competitive neural networks.

In this paper, a neural network algorithm based on a ''soft-max'' adaptation rule is presented that exhibits good performance in reaching the optimum, or at least coming close. The soft-max rule employed is an extension of the standard K-means clustering procedure and takes into account a ''neighborhood ranking'' of the reference (weight) vectors. It is shown that the dynamics of the reference (weight) vectors during the input-driven adaptation procedure 1) is determined by the gradient of an energy function whose shape can be modulated through a neighborhood determining parameter, and 2) resembles the dynamics of Brownian particles moving in a potential determined by the data point density. The network is employed to represent the attractor of the Mackey-Glass equation and to predict the Mackey-Glass time series, with additional local linear mappings for generating output values. The results obtained for the time-series prediction compare very favorably with the results achieved by back-propagation and radial basis function networks.

It is a hard problem and affects the performance of k-means strongly. When used for clustering analysis, the conventional competitive learning (CL) algorithms also have a similar crucial problem: the selection of an appropriate number of neural units, although the problem remains largely unrevealed (or ignored) in the CL literature. As shown in this paper, frequency sensitive competitive learning (FSCL), one version of the recently improved CL algorithms, also significantly deteriorates its performance when the number of units is inappropriately selected. This paper proposes a new algorithm called rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL). The basic idea is that for each input not only the winner unit is modified to adapt to the input, but also its rival (the 2nd winner) is delearned by a smaller learning rate. RPCL can be regarded as an unsupervised extension of Kohonen's supervised LVQ2. RPCL has the ability of automatically allocating an appropriate number of units for an input data set. The experimental results show that RPCL outperforms FSCL when used for unsupervised classification, for training a radial basis function (RBF) network, and for curve detection in digital images.

J	Zhao, YX				Zhao, Yunxin			A Speaker-Independent Continuous Speech Recognition System Using Continuous Mixture Gaussian Density HMM of Phoneme-Sized Units	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article								This paper describes a large vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition system which is based on hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of phoneme-sized acoustic units using continuous mixture Gaussian densities. A bottom-up merging algorithm is developed for estimating the parameters of the mixture Gaussian densities, where the resultant number of mixture components is proportional to both the sample size and dispersion of training data. A compression procedure is developed to construct a word transcription dictionary from the acoustic-phonetic labels of sentence utterances. A modified word-pair grammar using context-sensitive grammatical parts is incorporated to constrain task difficulty. The Viterbi beam search is used for decoding. The segmental K-means algorithm is implemented as a baseline for evaluating the bottom-up merging technique. The system has been evaluated on the TIMIT database (1990) for a vocabulary size of 853. For test set perplexities of 24, 104, and 853, the decoding word accuracies are 90.9%, 86.0%, and 62.9%, respectively. For the perplexity of 104, the decoding accuracy achieved by using the merging algorithm is 4.1% higher than that using the segmental K-means (22.8% error reduction), and the decoding accuracy using the compressed dictionary is 3.0% higher than that using a standard dictionary (18.1% error reduction).

In this paper we argue that there is a method, Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), that is compatible with both these research directions. The contributions of the AHP are highlighted in the light of recent developments in GIS, with particular attention to the concept of fuzzy set theory. An example of a GIS application is provided to show how the AHP can deal operationally with fuzziness, factor diversity and complexity in problems of land evaluation involving the location of a public facility.

We discuss a clustering strategy that explicitly reflects the tradeoff between simplicity and precision of a data representation. The resulting clustering algorithm jointly optimizes distortion errors and complexity costs. A maximum entropy estimation of the clustering cost function yields an optimal number of clusters, their positions, and their cluster probabilities. Our approach establishes a unifying framework for different clustering methods like K-means clustering, fuzzy clustering, entropy constrained vector quantization, or topological feature maps and competitive neural networks.

The method combines well-known clustering techniques (Leader and K-Means methods) with Stochastic Relaxation to minimize a combined cluster entropy function. Further, a technique is developed which is capable of determining the cluster weights which optimize classification performance and reflect the Boolean structures of the associated convex clusters.

J	WON, CS				WON, CS			AN OPTIMIZATION FOR CLASSIFICATION MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD CRITERION	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						CLUSTERING; CLASSIFICATION MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD CRITERION; K-MEANS; MOVING METHOD		A clustering criterion introduced by Symons (1981), which is called Classification Maximum Likelihood (CML) criterion in this paper, is designed to consider the cluster size and the covariance structure of samples. The CML criterion is optimized by the 'Moving method' suggested by Duda and Hart (1973, p. 226). When the Moving method is applied to the CML criterion with an arbitrary initial cluster, it often yields degenerate clusters. To avoid such degenerate cases, we propose two stages of clustering. In the first stage, we roughly partition samples with respect to 'the covariance structure component' in the CML criterion. The resulting partition is then further clustered with the full CML criterion.

The room temperature spectra of both specimens were composed of two doublets. For the specimen with x = 0.018, the hyperfine magnetic fields are observed at low temperatures below 40 K, meaning that the superconductivity and the magnetic order coexist in the temperature region. A comparison of the spectra in the paramagnetic and magnetically ordered phases indicates that the major part of Fe ions (about 60% in population) occupies Cu(2) sites and the remains occupy Cu(I) sites.

Photochlorination of equimolecular ethylene-chlorine mixtures obtained by this method and studied by means of kinetic UV-and IR-spectroscopy reveals activationless chain growth with mean length 300 units in the temperature range 17-45 K. Mean chain lengths greater than 100 are observed up to the conversion degree of 0.6-0.7. Comparison of the experimental data with computer simulations shows that the tunneling reaction is due to the formation of a closely packed reaction complex with high amplitudes of zero-point vibrations which lower the reaction barrier. The commensurability of reactant and product crystal lattices results in linear propagation of chains without accumulation of deformation strain. The chain termination mechanism associated with the spatial correlations of chains is discussed.

A single transition temperature between the values for bulk CoO and NiO is evident for two samples with 36 angstrom periods as previously reported, but the separate Ni and Co order parameters in a 72 angstrom period superlattice approximate bulk behavior. In the latter sample the magnetic order remains coherent across ostensibly paramagnetic CoO interlayers above 400 K. Mean field analysis accounts for the layer thickness dependence of the ordering temperature.

Correlations were determined among microbial starters, consumer acceptance and anyltical variables, and variables necessary for quality assessment were reduced. In stepwise discriminant analysis six variables were significant (p < 0.95) and used in discriminant functions. Dendograms showed similarities among cases. Strong correlations were found between sensory scores ad some fermentative, biochemical and physical measures. The same variables were significant in formation of clusters by K-means clustering analysis. In factor analysis, the first three factors, accounting for 70% of variability, related to the same variables. Relationships between overall acceptance and other parameters explained differences in sensory evaluation.

Variables from previous empirical typologies and multiple domains were used in a series of cluster analyses in order to examine replicability across independent samples, across clustering algorithms and across sets of psychometric indicators. The arbitrary nature of cluster solutions and the external validity of cluster-based schemes, with respect to an outcome criterion constructed synthetically from earlier research, was examined. Only three of eight cluster techniques (Ward's, K means, and complete linkage) yielded meaningful results. For these techniques, replicability was poor across samples, algorithms and sets of psychometric indicators. Results indicated that identified clusters were arbitrary. Although external validity analysis yielded positive results, the possibility that external validity was a function of underlying dimensions was discussed, as were other implications of the findings.

The system is based on spotting the vowels of the test utterance, extracting parameter vectors and classifying them into a speaker-dependent reference database. This database consists of L prototypes for every speaker, representing the vowels of the language, which are estimated from L vowel clusters. These are formed by applying a modified k-means algorithm on the patterns extracted from the vowels of training utterances. The patterns of the training utterances are stored in a training database to be used for updating the reference data of the system. The system was tested over a period of four months with a population of 15 male and female speakers with non-correlated training and test data. Its accuracy proved to be satisfactory (91.39% for verification, 90.19% for closed-set identification, 95.28% for open-set identification), considering that the training utterances per speaker do not exceed 50 sec and the test utterances have a duration of 1.3 sec on the average. The accuracy is substantially increased when increasing the length of the test utterance (e.g. 93.75% verification accuracy for test utterances having an average duration of 4 sec). Additional advantages of the system are the small memory requirements and the fast response.		FAKOTAKIS, N (reprint author), UNIV PATRAS, WIRE COMMUN LAB, GR-26110 PATRAS, GREECE.

Application of Ward's agglomerative hierarchical procedure to the score profiles disclosed six clusters that were replicated in a K-means partitioning process. The six clusters were then compared by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with respect to their mean five higher order scores on the Interpersonal Style Inventory (Lorr, 1986). The highly significant F tests provided confirmation of the characteristics of the cluster profiles isolated.
