Amazon, Rackspace, Google, Microsoft, to name a few, all fight to gain a foothold as cloud services providers. CB-Cloudle, a search engine aiming to discover the available options of cloud services and to suggest the most appropriate alternatives, is presented here to meet with the end users' needs. In this work, this software platform CB-Cloudle specialised in searching for cloud services, and an automated cloud services crawler is also implemented. A k-means clustering algorithm with centroids was utilised to improve the search effectiveness and efficiency. This k-means clustering algorithm was introduced to discover the groups of similar cloud service entries, using a new similarity matrix to calculate the distance between cloud service entries.

This paper presents a method to improve the accuracy of JPEG universal steganalysis using image pre-classification. In the training phase, the training images are categorized into k clusters using K-means clustering according to the clustering features which are deduced from the horizontal and vertical intra-block co-occurrence matrices of the absolute value of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. After that, steganalytic features are extracted from each cluster and the training process is specialized for each cluster separately. Given a test image, the clustering features are extracted and the distances from the test image to each cluster center obtained in the training phase are calculated, and then the test image is pre-classified as the cluster with the minimum distance. After that, the steganalytic features of the test image are extracted and sent to the corresponding classifier, and then the final result (cover or stego) is outputted. Experimental results on typical JPEG steganographic algorithms show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the detection performance of existing steganalytic features. The steganalytic performance of the proposed method is better than previous proposed methods.

It is the task of finding subsets of data that are sharing the same type of attributes. Text Clustering becomes one of the most critical and important solutions in data mining to discover knowledge from fast grow up web data and log files. There are many challenges, algorithms needs to be tailored specific for each domain and scale well with growing data sets. Another interesting aspect is the design of the system. A complex set components need to interact well together. This article proposes an elegant way of clustering university educations based on their text attributes. The solution is integrated directly into a Spring Web Application. A comprehensive architecture is proposed, providing the frameworks needed. Clustering techniques such as Canopy Generation [4] and k-Means are demonstrated.

MapReduce is a parallel programming model for processing big-data, and has been implemented in Hadoop. In order to break the big-data limits, the parallel K-Medoids algorithm HK-Medoids based on Hadoop was proposed. Every submitted job has many iterative MapReduce procedures: In the map phase, each sample was assigned to one cluster whose center is the most similar with the sample; in the combine phase, an intermediate center for each cluster was calculated; and in the reduce phase, the new center was calculated. The iterator stops when the new center is similar to the old one. The experimental results showed that HK-Medoids algorithm has a good clustering result and linear speedup for big-data.

This paper is focused on the research of role division from the perspective of information dissemination. We propose to measure users' secondary ability of information dissemination by weighting their neighborhoods' capability of information dissemination based on existing user characterization methods. The initial cluster centers in k-means are optimized by considering the characteristics of information sharing and dissemination on social networks. Eventually, users are classified into three categories: ordinary users, bridge users and core users. Experimental results on Sina micro-blog dataset show that the proposed algorithm can better differentiate users according to information dissemination.

A Hierarchical Matrix Factorization Approach for Location-based Web Service QoS Prediction	2014 IEEE 8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SERVICE ORIENTED SYSTEM ENGINEERING (SOSE)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)	APR 07-11, 2014	Oxford, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Web service; QoS prediction; Location; aware; Clustering		With the rapid growth of population of service-oriented architecture (SOA), services are playing an important role in software development process. One major issue we should consider about Web services is to dig out the one with the best QoS value among all functionally-equivalent candidates. However, since there are a great number of missing QoS values in real world invocation records, we can hardly do a detailed comparison among those selectable Web services. To address this problem, we propose a location-based hierarchical matrix factorization method to make efficient and accurate QoS prediction. In our method, we consider both global context and local information. We first apply matrix factorization (MF) on global user-service records and obtain a global prediction matrix. After that, we use MF to predict QoS values on some user-service groups, which are clustered by K-means algorithm. Then we combine global and local predicted QoS values to provide our final prediction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our hierarchical approach which outperforms other popular methods.

We show that simply adding a small amount of soft constraints, in the form of must-link and cannot-link, improves the overall accuracy of the state-of-the-art method, ACA without adding any extra computational complexity. The results on the non-posed database VAM corpus for three different emotion primitives (valence, dominance, and activation) show improvements compared to the original approach.

Mining the knowledge like pattern finding or clustering of similar kind of words is one of the important issues nowadays. This paper focuses on mining the important information from the text data. This paper uses the stories data set from project Guttenberg's William Shakespeare stories dataset for experimental study. R is used as Text Mining and statistical analysis tool in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Linux Operating System. Frequent pattern mining is used to find the frequent terms, appeared in the documents and word Association among two or more words is measured at a given threshold value. Our algorithm uses cosine similarity in order to measure the distance between the words before clustering. The algorithm may be used to find the similarity between stories, news, emails. In this paper k-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm is used to form the cluster.

Basically Proposed IDS executes on the KDD'99 Data set; this data set is used in international level for evaluating/calculating the performance of various intrusion detection systems (IDS). First step is association phase in which frequent item set are produced by apriori algorithm. The second step is clustering phase in which clusters are created by k-Means. Proposed technique uses the standard KDD99 (knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) intrusion detection contest data set. Proposed system can detect the attacks/intrusions and classifies them into different categories: U2R (User to Root), probe, R2L (Remote to Local), and Denial of Service (DoS). The prime task of the proposed IDS is to improve effectiveness with efficiency. An experiment is carried out to evaluate/calculate the performance of the proposed approach using KDD 99'dataset. Here the result shows that the proposed IDS technique performs better in term of efficiency(Execution Speed) & effectiveness.

A major source of calibration error is the system nonlinearity due mainly to optical aberration. Although there are various physical models that have been employed to correct the nonlinear image distortion due to the aberration, it is uncertain practically that which model best fits a given optical system. In this paper, an intelligent learning technique to correct errors from the nonlinear optics is proposed. Data errors are first divided into small groups using k-means clustering algorithm, and an error correction function is approximated by training a small neural network that is allocated to each divided group. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed method showed higher accuracy in our tests.

When the amount of data to be clustered is "huge," and/or when data becomes available in increments, one has to devise incremental K-means procedures. Current research on incremental clustering does not address several of the specific problems of incremental K-means including the seeding problem, sensitivity of the algorithm to the order of the data, and the number of clusters. In this paper we present static and dynamic single-pass incremental K-means procedures that overcome these limitations.

Many clustering algorithms for sensor networks have empty cluster problems due to random deployment, which causes resource and cost inefficiencies. Our algorithm calculates the mean-shift of sensor nodes and the reverse mean-shift of cluster heads to iteratively move cluster heads closer to the sensor nodes' density and away from cluster heads' density. This helps cluster heads better accommodate the distribution of sensors. Our proposed K-Centers Meanshift Reverse Mean-shift algorithm decreases the number of empty clusters dramatically, and it also balances the sizes of clusters more evenly.

The depth sensor is capable of returning images, where each pixel represents the distance to its corresponding point not the RGB data. This is considered as the real novelty of the RGBD camera in computer vision compared to the common video-based and stereo-based products. Depth sensors captures depth data without using markers, 2D to 3D-transition or determining feature points. The captured depth map then cluster the 3D depth points into different clusters to determine the different limbs of the human-body. The 3D points clustering is achieved by different clustering techniques. Our Experiments show good performance and results in using clustering to determine different human-body limbs.

Since nighttime lights based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line-scan System has been used as an effective tool to estimate economic growth, a potential correlation between nighttime stable lights (NTSL) and innovation performance has been strongly indicated. To this end, this study examined the relationship between NTSL and innovation performance of 3105 counties in the United States of America through grey relation analysis. In order to test the validity of NTSL mapping of the innovation performance, all the sample data of NTSL and innovation performance were separately grouped into five categories using k-means clustering method, and the deviation between two classifications was calculated. Overall, NTSL shows a noticeable connection to innovation performance with a grey relation grade of 0.76, indicating that NTSL could properly simulate innovation performance with slight deviation, which is mainly caused by differences of industrial structure and natural environment. It is demonstrated that NTSL data could be used as a proxy for regional innovation performance.

The algorithm based on the concept of the short distance of the consecutive points and the small angle between the consecutive vectors formed by three adjacent points. In this paper, we present a modification of the newly developed SDSA algorithm (MSDS). The MSDS algorithm is suitable for almost all test data sets used by Chung and Liu for point symmetry based K-means (PSK) algorithm and SDSA algorithm. Also, its much more effective than SDSA algorithm, since the computational effort per iteration required by MSDS algorithm is a lot less than that required by SDSA algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MSDS algorithm is rather encouraging.

Firstly, the ink cells images are gained in the images capturing device and histogram equalization. The edge of cells is extracted by using of Canny operator. We use different thresholds and experimental sigma values that compare to experimental results. Canny edge extraction operator is best when the value of sigma is 16. According to the image used in this research to determine the standard ink cells carving the value of gaps d(0) equals 125, the value of dark tone s(0) equals 394, so its standard value of gaps and dark tone are d(0) +/- 10 and s(0) +/- 10. The value of gravure outlets gaps and dark tone are measured, while d and s is in the scope of standard range, which the output 1 of the ink cells determined to pass and the output 0 deemed to fail. Binarization images are obtained through adaptive threshold segmentation, which regards the value of gaps and dark tone as the characteristic value when they start to detecting. Finally, we extract size and surface defects of ink cells for grading. Segmentation pictures are extracted by K-means clustering. The areas of ink cells are deemed to size characteristics. Then we classify the ink cells into two classes by using of neural network. The experimental results consider neural network model that produce consequences.

Optical flow is first used to extract key frames of the video. And feature points are found out in key frames by Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Then the visual words corresponded with the feature points are generated by k-means clustering method. Finally PLSA model is used to judge whether each of these visual words just mentioned is similar with the visual words in the training library, and corresponding videos with similar words is filtered out.

Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and neural networks (NN) have been used for spectral mapping. Though GMM-based mapping captures the variability among speech sounds through multiple mixtures, it can only provide a linear map between the source and the target. On the other hand, NN-based mapping is capable of providing a nonlinear map but a single mapping scheme may not handle variability across different speech sounds. Incorporating the advantages from these approaches, we propose a spectral mapping method using multiple neural networks. Speech data is clustered using k-means algorithm, and a separate neural network is employed to capture the mapping within each cluster. Objective evaluation has shown that proposed method is better than both GMM-base and NN-base mapping schemes.	[Vijayan, Karthika; Murty, K.

Minimizing power consumption and sampling-rate should be the key aspects when designing wireless ECG systems. In order to achieve portability coupled with ultra-low power consumption and sampling-rate, clustering and classification algorithms play an important role in developing wireless ECG systems. Currently used algorithms do have their share of drawbacks: 1) clustering and classification cannot be done in real time; 2) implementing existing algorithms would lead to higher computational costs. These drawbacks motivated us in developing novel optimized clustering algorithm which could easily scan large ECG datasets for characteristic bio-markers. In this paper, we present an advanced K-means clustering algorithm based on K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) approach with a connection to Compressed Sensing (CS) theory, followed by sorting the data using a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) classifier. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms by achieving a classification accuracy of 99.3%. This ability allows reducing 15% of Average Classification Error (ACE). The proposed algorithm also reduces the clustering energy consumption by increasing the classification performance.

For such applications, approximate circuits enable hardware implementations that exhibit improved efficiency for a given quality. Previous efforts have largely focused on the design of approximate combinational logic blocks such as adders and multipliers. In practice, however, designers are concerned with the quality of outputs generated by a sequential circuit after several cycles of computation, rather than an embedded combinational block. We propose ASLAN (Automatic methodology for Sequential Logic ApproximatioN), the first effort towards the synthesis of approximate sequential circuits. Given a sequential circuit and an output quality constraint, ASLAN creates an approximate version of the circuit that consumes lower energy, while meeting the specified quality bound. The key challenges in approximating sequential circuits are (i) to model how errors due to approximations are generated, re-circulate through the combinational logic over multiple cycles of operation, and eventually impact quality of the final output, and (ii) to select the most beneficial approximations, i.e., those that result in higher energy savings for smaller impact on quality. ASLAN addresses the first challenge by constructing a virtual Sequential Quality Constraint Circuit (SQCC) and utilizing formal verification techniques to ensure that the selected approximations meet the quality constraint. To address the second challenge, ASLAN identifies combinational blocks in the sequential circuit that are amenable to approximation, generates local quality-energy trade-off curves for them, and uses a gradient-descent approach to iteratively approximate the entire sequential circuit. We used ASLAN to automatically synthesize approximate versions of ten sequential benchmarks, resulting in energy reductions of 1.20X-2.44X for tight quality constraints, and 1.32X-4.42X for moderate quality constraints. We present case studies of using the approximate circuits generated by ASLAN in two popular applications - MPEG Encoding and K-Means Clustering obtaining 1.32X energy savings with 0.5% PSNR degradation, and 1.26X energy savings with 0.8% increase in mean cluster radius, respectively.

An Hybrid ClusteringAlgorithm for Optimal Clusters in Wireless Sensor Networks	2014 IEEE STUDENTS' CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (SCEECS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)	MAR 01-02, 2014	Bhopal, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE MP Subsect	Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol	Wireless Sensor Network; k-means clustering; Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering; Hybrid clustering; Cluster head	ALGORITHM	Clustering is a technique that alleviates network congestion and increase the energy efficiency of the Wireless sensor network. Hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering are well established clustering algorithms. The convergence of hierarchical clustering is only based on the inconsistency criterion while the k-means clustering requires the number of clusters (k) which are user defined. It is only by trial and error better values for inconsistency and k can be obtained. This may not be optimal and clustering without optimal number of clusters leads to energy inefficient network. Hence, a new hybrid self decisive clustering technique based on Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and k-means algorithm is proposed here. The main objective of this algorithm is to arrive at an optimal number of clusters for a given set of nodes distributed over the geographical area. Added to this, the algorithm identifies the Cluster Head also. The proposed algorithm is implemented in Matlab and compared with the existing techniques. Results demonstrate the supremacy of the proposal with that of Hierarchical and k-means clustering.

Efficient Segmentation Methods for Tumor Detection in MRI Images	2014 IEEE STUDENTS' CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (SCEECS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)	MAR 01-02, 2014	Bhopal, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE MP Subsect	Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol	MRI; brain tumor; segmentation; k-means clustering; genetic algorithm; c-means clustering		Brain tumor extraction and its analysis are challenging tasks in medical image processing because brain image and its structure is complicated that can be analyzed only by expert radiologists. Segmentation plays an important role in the processing of medical images. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has become a particularly useful medical diagnostic tool for diagnosis of brain and other medical images. This paper presents a comparative study of three segmentation methods implemented for tumor detection. The methods include k-means clustering with watershed segmentation algorithm, optimized k-means clustering with genetic algorithm and optimized c-means clustering with genetic algorithm. Traditional k-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial cluster centers. Genetic c-means and k-means clustering techniques are used to detect tumor in MRI of brain images. At the end of process the tumor is extracted from the MR image and its exact position and the shape are determined. The experimental results indicate that genetic c-means not only eliminate the over-segmentation problem, but also provide fast and efficient clustering results.

K-means has gain popularity because of its simplicity and speed of classifying massive data rapidly and efficiently. However, the output of K-Means algorithm highly depends upon the selection of initial cluster centers because the initial cluster centers are chosen randomly. The other limitation of the algorithm is to input the required number of clusters. This requires some sort of intuitive knowledge about appropriate value of K which is sometimes difficult to predict as it requires domain knowledge. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm based on the K-Means, but it does not require the number of clusters K as input. The time complexity and quality of the clusters produced by the proposed algorithm is compared with that of original K-Means using two different data sets.

As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network. Thus, our Ad-Hoc network will be free from any malicious activity and normal flow of packets will be possible.

In the last 60 years a lot of research has gone into parametric representation of these speech features. Several techniques are currently being used for Automatic Speaker Recognition. Yet Automatic Speaker Recognition still remains a confront mainly due to variations in speaker's vocal tract with time and health, varying environmental conditions, disparities in the behavior and quality of speech recorders etc. MFCC is a extensively used technique in Automatic speaker recognition. In this paper the performance of MFCC technique was evaluated in a quiet environment. A speaker database containing 30 male and 30 female speakers was created. Two separate experiments were conducted for the performance evaluation of MFCC technique when applied to K means clustering. In the first case the speech features were directly matched. In the second case a VQ codebook was created by clustering the training features of these 60 speakers. A distortion easure based on the minimum Euclidean distance was used for speaker recognition. The failure rate of speaker recognition in first ase was found to be was found to be 10% while in the second case as found to be 14%.

Large e-commerce sites contain millions of products visited by millions of users. Textual similarity search has many uses in e-commerce sites, for instance in building recommendation engines. However, the size of the corpus makes it prohibitive to use naive approaches for real-time search. In order to reduce response times, the search is executed within a small subset of most related documents. To achieve this goal, documents are clustered using k-means. However, vectors used for k-means clustering are very high dimensional. Random indexing is applied to reduce dimensionality. We boosted these steps with GPUs to reduce preprocessing overheads. Once clusters are built, text queries are executed within the closest clusters. Our experiments on a large document collection for a recommendation scenario reveal that only 1.7 % loss in recommendation precision is possible by realizing only 28 % of search operations in the inverted index.

In this paper, a k-means method and an expectation maximization algorithm are implemented respectively to achieve segmentation of GM on MR images at the transverse and coronal plane. The experiments were performed on both multi-modal and mono-modal MR images and the similarity index values for the accuracy of automatic segmentation with manual segmentation were consistently high for patients with epilepsy (transverse plane: 0.806; coronal plane: 0.837). The results demonstrated that the automatic segmentation methods implemented in this paper are accurate and efficient to realize extraction of GM of patients with epilepsy in both transverse and coronal plane.

Market segmentation is an important tool to define marketing strategies which is driving to the business goals. This study proposed a data mining technique for tourist segmentation including (1) two step clustering and (2) classification of international travelers in Thailand. Two step clustering method, in the first step Self-Organizing Map (SOM) used for determining the appropriate group's number of tourists. The performance of K-Means was the best among three candidate clustering algorithms: K-Means, FCM and SOM. They were evaluated by using Silhouette, Root Mean Square Standard Deviation (RMSSTD) and R Square (RS). Then, K-Means used for partitioning tourist data in the second step. The statistical analysis in each segment was performed. The experimental results indicated that two step clustering method provided 9 natural segments. The second stage, the tourist classification by Multi layer Perceptron (MLP) indicated the highest precision as 97.43%. Tourism industry can use the result of this study for guiding to the marketing plans or promotion campaigns.

The overall strategy is aimed to deal against parameters tuning and new requirements drift problem in the sequential learning process that commonly happened in human action recognition. Our proposed method has an automatic and systematic approach for determining input weight and bias value when the hidden nodes need to be increased to handle a larger training data size and to adjust the output weight when the new target class label is presented during sequential learning. We demonstrated the capability using 2013 Challenge on Multi modal Gesture Recognition open dataset (Chalearn 2013) with uni modal features (skeleton data) only. Our experiments using skeletons of upper body joints features with normalized euclidean distance and projection angle position coordinates to shoulder center and hip center, clustering analysis with k-means for pose based generation and Bag of Pose (BoP) for temporal sequential information. We developed the training sequence scenario to introduce the partial action classes in the initial training and the rest of training data with all classes in the next sequences to simulate the condition when the OS-ELM received new target class requirement drift. Our proposed method gives better accuracy plus adaptive capability compared with SUMO method which is the best uni modal method for chalearn data and still maintain a reasonably small computation time.

During image acquisition and transmission, factors such as moving objects, sensor quality, and channel interferences may result in additive noise. The presence of noise affects image quality. Image denoising process attempts to reconstruct a noiseless image and improve its quality. Denoising an image with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is a challenging process. Parameters such as noise mean and variance provide noise characteristics of AWGN. This paper compares three different algorithm for noise estimations; ant colony optimization, fuzzy logic, and region merging. It is shown that region merging algorithm provides better results with less resources and minimum computation time.

To take advantage of COA in clustering, here, an individual cuckoo represents a candidate solution consisting of clusters' centroids. Fitness function calculates sum of intra cluster distances. Three proposed approaches named Random COA Clustering, Chaotic COA Clustering and K-means COA Clustering differ in initial step of original COA algorithm. In COA Clustering, initial population is produced randomly. In Chaotic COA Clustering, to cover whole search space and enrich algorithm, chaotic Arnold's Cat map is used to produce initial population instead of randomness. In K-means COA Clustering, to start from closer to global optimum, well-known K-means algorithm is conducted to produce initial cuckoos. In order to local search in COA, each cuckoo lays its own eggs within a specific radius. The aim of producing better neighbors and escape local optimum in proposed Enhanced COA Clustering (ECOAC), this boundary doesn't exist and each cuckoo puts its eggs via Levy flight.

However, today there are several archives of digital documents which are scanned at low resolution, to consume less storage. These documents which usually have a resolution of 100 to 150 dpi, require to be converted to searchable documents. In this paper presents a new method for clustering of low quality printed Persian sub-words. This is necessary to reduce the number of classes of sub-words in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Two popular clustering methods, hierarchical and k-means implemented and compared. Local binary patterns (LBP) and zoning algorithms used for feature extraction. Both features are fast and represent the global shape information very well. Moreover, we used different distance measures to find the similarity of feature vectors. We applied our algorithms on a dataset of 10,700 images of distinct Persian sub-words with 96 dpi resolution. Experimental results show that the hierarchical clustering with the correlation distance measure has the best performance over other clustering methods and distance measures.

Because of limitation of available training samples, feature extraction is an important preprocessing step before classification for avoiding Hughes phenomenon. The huge volume of continues bands in hyperspectral data has high correlation and thus produces redundancy. We propose partitioning of spectral signature of pixels to some disjoint parts using a proper approach so that each part containes bands which are correlated or similar together and are different from bands involved in other parts. Then we obtain the position and shape of each part using calculation mean and variance of that part. We represent some approaches for partitioning of feature space such as uniform based partitioning, correlation based partitioning and k-means clustering based partitioning. We compared these different approaches with the most commonly used unsupervised feature extraction method, principal component analysis (PCA). The experiments were performed using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral image data and the results show the goodness of proposed method using k-means partitioning approach.

Clustering is an important data mining task that refers to the process of categorizing data objects into cohesive groups called clusters. There are many clustering approaches proposed in the literature with different quality/complexity tradeoffs. It is well known that no clustering method can sufficiently handle all types of cluster structures and properties (e.g. shape, size, overlapping, and density). The idea of combining different clustering results (cluster ensemble or clustering aggregation) emerged as an approach to overcome the weakness of single algorithms and further improve their performances. In this paper, a novel consensus function based on the theory of gravity is presented which is called "Gravitational Ensemble Clustering (GEC)". The proposed method combines "weak" clustering algorithms such as the K-means algorithm using gravitational clustering concepts. The proposed method is capable of the identification of true underlying clusters with arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Computational experiments were conducted to test the performance of the GEC approach using artificial and benchmark datasets. Undertaken experimental results illustrate the versatility and robustness of the proposed method, as compared to individual clusterings produced by well known clustering algorithms, and compared to other ensemble combination methods.

In most existing studies, conventional use of SAM does not take into account contextual information of a pixel. The proposed method incorporates spatio-contextual information both at feature and decision level for improved change detection accuracy. First, a similarity image is created using context-sensitive spectral angle mapper, and then it is segmented into two segments changed and unchanged using k-means algorithm to create a change map. The quantitative as well as qualitative comparison of the experiment results shows that the proposed method gives better results than the other existing method.

Making it increase the distance of the pairs of data in the high density areas, which are located in different spaces. And it can reduce the similarity degree among the pairs of data in the same density region, so as to find the spatial distribution characteristics complex data. According to this point, we designed two similarity measure methods, and both of them didn't introduce Gaussian kernel function parameter sigma. The main difference between the two methods is that the first method introduces a shortest path, while the second method doesn't. The second method proved to have better comprehensive performance of similarity measure, experimental verification showed that it improved stability of the entire algorithm. In addition to matching spectral clustering algorithm, the final stage of the algorithm is to use the k-means (or other traditional clustering algorithms) for the selected feature vector to cluster, however the k-means algorithm is sensitive to the initial cluster centers. Therefore, we also designed a simple and effective method to optimize the initial cluster centers leads to improve the k-means algorithm, and applied the improved method to the proposed spectral clustering algorithm. Experimental results on UCI1 datasets show that the improved k-means clustering algorithm can further make cluster more stable.

This algorithm includes the same operators of the original version of DE but works over groups previously created by the k-means algorithm, which helps to obtain more diversity in the population and skip local optimum values. Results over a large set of test functions were compared with results of the original version of Differential Evolution (DE/rand/1/bin strategy) and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The results shows that the average performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the other algorithms in terms of the minimum fitness function value reached and the average number of fitness function evaluations required to reach the optimal value. These results are supported by Friedman and Wilcoxon signed test, with a 95% significance.

Among various methods multitask neural network has been demonstrated to be a promising and effective model for traffic flow forecasting, while there are still two issues unconsidered: 1) learning unrelated tasks together tends to reduce the model's performance; 2) how to define or learn the distance metric for distinguishing related tasks and unrelated tasks. In this paper, a metric learning based K-means method is proposed to group related tasks together which effectively reduces the semantic gap between domain knowledge and handcrafted feature engineering. Then for each group of tasks, a deep neural network is built for traffic flow forecasting. Experimental results show the metric-based grouping method clusters tasks more reasonably with a better metric than classic Euclidean-based Kmeans. The final results of traffic flow forecasting on real dataset show the metric-based multi-task neural network outperforms the Euclidean-based multi-task neural network.

In this paper, we study these problems with an additional constraint that requires the sought k facilities to be on a given line. We present efficient algorithms for various distance metrics such as L-1, L-2, L-infinity. Assume all n weighted points are given sorted by their projections on the given line. For k-median, our algorithms for L1 and L-infinity metrics run in O(min{nk, n root k log n log n, n2(O(n root k log n log n)) log n}) time and O(min{nk log n, n root k log n log(2) n, n2(O(n root k log n log n)) log(2) n}) time, respectively. For k-means, which is defined only on the L-2 metric, we give an O(min{nk, nn root k log n, n2(O(root log k log log n))}) time algorithm. For kcenter, our algorithms run in O(n log n) time for all three metrics, and in O(n) time for the unweighted version under L-1 and L infinity metrics.

Currently, we deal with the VAD problem at the frame level through short time window function. However, when tackling with the VAD problem manually, we can easily pick out the speech segments containing several words. Inspired by this, we firstly use IIR filter to get the envelope of the waveform and divide the envelope into separate sound segments. And then we extract shape features from the obtained segments and use K-means to cluster the data featured by the amplitude of the wave crest to discard the silent part. Finally, we utilize other shape features to discard the noise part. The performance of our proposed VAD method has apparently surpassed the energy-based VAD and VQVAD with a relative 20% decrease in error rate, While the computation time of the proposed VAD method is only 30% less than that of VQVAD. We also get an encouraging result utilizing our VAD method for speaker recognition with about 3% average decrease in EER.

Various clustering techniques have been reported, but the effectiveness of most techniques relies on the initial value of k clusters. Such an approach may not be suitable as we may not have prior knowledge on the collection of documents. To date, there are various swarm based clustering techniques proposed to address such problem, including this paper that explores the adaptation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) in document clustering. We extend the work on Gravitation Firefly Algorithm (GFA) by introducing a relocate mechanism that relocates assigned documents, if necessary. The newly proposed clustering algorithm, known as GFA_(R), is then tested on a benchmark dataset obtained from the 20Newsgroups. Experimental results on external and relative quality metrics for the GFA_(R) is compared against the one obtained using the standard GFA and Bisect K-means. It is learned that by extending GFA to becoming GFA_(R), a better quality clustering is obtained.

Recently we proposed a new partitioning method for clustering categorical data: using the transfer algorithm to optimize an objective function called within-cluster dispersion. Preliminary experimental results showed that this method outperforms a standard method called k-modes, in terms of the average quality of clustering results. In this paper, we make more advanced efforts to compare the performance of objective functions for categorical data. First we analytically compare the quality of three objective functions: k-medoids, k-modes and within-cluster dispersion. Secondly we measure how well these objectives find true structures in real data sets, by finding their global optima, which we argue is a better measurement than average clustering results. The conclusion is that within-cluster dispersion is generally a better objective for discovering cluster structures. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of various distance measures on within-cluster dispersion, and give some useful observations.

The commonly used vector space representation of text data involves high dimensional sparse matrices. We present algorithms which are improvements over the existing algorithms namely, Online Linear Constrained Vector Quantization Error (O-LCVQE) and Constrained Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (C-RPCL). We use the concept of spherical k-means in place of Euclidean distance based traditional k-means. Several experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms work better for high dimensional text data in terms of normalized mutual information. We further show that k-means with rival penalized competitive learning is a much better alternative than simple k-means when applied on text data. The performances of k-means and spherical k-means come closer, when the distance function is weighted by the neuron winning frequency.

The large board makes Go very complex and hard to evaluate. In this paper, we propose a method that reduce the complexity of Go by learning and extracting patterns from game records. This method is more efficient and stronger than the baseline method we have chosen. Our method has two major components: a) a pattern learning method based on K-means, it will learn and extract patterns from game records, b) a perceptron which learns the win rates of Go situations. We build an agent to evaluate the performance of our method, and get at least 20% of performance improvement or 25% of computing power saving in most circumstances.

In this paper we present a new method which applies differential evolution, one of the main bio-inspired optimization algorithms, on a time series k-means clustering task to set the weights of the distance metrics used in a combination that is used to cluster the time series. The weights are obtained by applying an optimization process that gives optimal clustering quality. We show through extensive experiments how this optimized combination outperforms all the other stand-alone distance metrics, all by keeping the same low complexity of the distance metrics used in the combination.

Depending on the need of disaster recovery, the storage space used for backup would easily sprawl to a TB or PB level with the growth of images. Unfortunately, different images have a large amount of same data segments. Those duplicated data segments will lead to serious waste of storage resource. Although there is a lot of work focus on deduplication storage and could achieve a good result in removing duplicate copies, they are not very suitable for virtual machine image deduplication in a cloud environment. Because huge resource usage of deduplication operations could lead to serious performance interference to the hosting virtual machines. This paper propose a local deduplication method which can speed up the operation progress of virtual machine image deduplication and reduce the operation time. The method is based on an improved k-means clustering algorithm, which could classify the metadata of backup image to reduce the search space of index lookup and improve the index lookup performance. Experiments show that our approach is robust and effective. It can significantly reduce the performance interference to hosting virtual machine with an acceptable increase in disk space usage.

Integrating RES to an electric power network offers many techno-economical benefits and in the same time necessitate advances in the operation, control and planning of electric networks. This paper focuses on the influence of the interconnecting of wind power plants on the electric network in terms of optimal power system operation. In this paper is proposed a k-means clustering based approach to identify the typical load profiles for wind farms in order to achieve the optimal power system operation on minimizing the power losses.

By using RDE for each data sample the number of calculations is significantly reduced in offline mode and, further, the method is suitable for online use. The clusters allow a different diameter per feature/dimension creating hyper-ellipsoid clusters which are axis-orthogonal. This results in a greater differentiation between clusters where the clusters are highly asymmetrical. We illustrate this with 3 standard data sets, 1 artificial dataset and a large real dataset to demonstrate comparable results to Subtractive, Hierarchical, K-Means, ELM and DBScan clustering techniques. Unlike subtractive clustering we do not iteratively calculate P however. Unlike hierarchical we do not need O(N2) distances to be calculated and a cut-off threshold to be defined. Unlike k-means we do not need to predefine the number of clusters. Using the RDE equations to calculate the densities the algorithm is efficient, and requires no iteration to approach the optimal result. We compare the proposed algorithm to k-means, subtractive, hierarchical, ELM and DBScan clustering with respect to several criteria. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

AN EFFICIENT INITIALIZATION METHOD FOR K-MEANS CLUSTERING OF HYPERSPECTRAL DATA	1ST ISPRS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	1st ISPRS International Conference on Geospatial Information Research	NOV 15-17, 2014	Tehran, IRAN	ISPRS		K-means; Clustering Initialization methods; Unmixing; MVES; Hyperspectral data		K-means is definitely the most frequently used partitional clustering algorithm in the remote sensing community. Unfortunately due to its gradient decent nature, this algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of cluster centers. This problem deteriorates for the high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery. To tackle this problem, in this paper, the spectral signatures of the endmembers in the image scene are extracted and used as the initial positions of the cluster centers. For this purpose, in the first step, A Neyman-Pearson detection theory based eigen-thresholding method (i.e., the HFC method) has been employed to estimate the number of endmembers in the image. Afterwards, the spectral signatures of the endmembers are obtained using the Minimum Volume Enclosing Simplex (MVES) algorithm. Eventually, these spectral signatures are used to initialize the k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed method is implemented on a hyperspectral dataset acquired by ROSIS sensor with 103 spectral bands over the Pavia University campus, Italy. For comparative evaluation, two other commonly used initialization methods (i.e., Bradley & Fayyad (BF) and Random methods) are implemented and compared. The confusion matrix, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are employed to assess the methods' performance. The evaluations demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the other initialization methods and can be applied for unsupervised classification of hyperspectral imagery for landcover mapping.

The developed region based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (R-BCVT) algorithm is a kind of polygon-based clustering approach in which the algorithm attempts to (1) split the image domain into j numbers of centroidal Voronoi polygons (2) assign each polygon a label randomly, then (3) classify the image into k cluster iteratively to satisfy optimum segmentation, and finally a k-mean clustering method refine the detected boundaries of homogeneous regions. The advantages of the novel method arise from adaptively, simplicity and rapidity as well as low sensitivity of the model to speckle noise.

This will aid in-service inspection planning in the identification of possible failures in the topside piping equipment of offshore oil and gas (O&G) production and process facilities (P&PFs). The capability of data clustering and data filtration as well as the interpretation of expert knowledge in artificial intelligent (AI) techniques, such as k-means clustering, artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, has been exploited to meet the aforementioned. The k-means clustering is used in the identification of linguistic parameters from condition monitoring data. Moreover, a neural network approach is used to identify the membership function patterns using online condition monitoring data. The proposed neuro-fuzzy system will help inspection planners to recommend accurate thickness measurement locations (TMLs) for reliable inspection planning programs.	[Seneviratne, A. M. N. D.

Firstly, video data visualization design principles are proposed based on the analysis of video data characteristics. Secondly, a TV metric is proposed to measure the distance between two video frames. Then, video shots are detected by TV metric, and video key frames are extracted by K-means algorithm. Finally, according to the proposed video visualization design principles, a spiral video visualization method is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed video visualization method can express the video content and the whole structure directly and clearly.

Owing to robust performance of iris recognition, many works have investigated the performance in visible spectrum. Increasing popularity of iris recognition in the visible spectrum has further resulted in using smartphones for the same. The extraction of robust features for visible spectrum iris recognition is vital to meet the expected accuracy of recognition. In this work, we explore K - means clustering based feature extraction to obtain robust features. K-means clustering is a fast alternative training method that is not computationally expensive and can easily be extended to large scale systems. The robust features extracted serves best for the unconstrained iris recognition on smartphones in visible spectrum. The proposed feature extraction technique has been extensively evaluated on publicly available smartphone iris database from BIPLab. The best Equal Error Rate of 0.31% is achieved using the proposed technique on images captured using iPhone in indoor scenario.

In this paper, a novel horror video recognition algorithm based on fuzzy comprehensive evolution model is proposed. Three low-level video features are extracted as typical features, and they are video key-light, video colour energy and video rhythm. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to estimate the weights of extracted features in fuzzy evolution model. Horror evaluation (membership function) is on shot scale and it is constructed based on the knowledge that videos which share the same affective have similar low-level features. K-Means algorithm is implemented to help finding the most representative feature vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach has good performance in recognition precision, recall rate and F1 measure.

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters sigma and v, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.

This involves hours' of power outages in the area covered by this study, namely, the Southern Electrical Grid of Libya (SEGL). This paper discusses the results of a pattern extraction process using the k-means clustering algorithm to predict load shedding for this scenario. The data consist of all loads shed in 40 electrical power stations in southern Libya for a two-year period from 2009 through 2010. An experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the k-means clustering algorithm in grouping (clustering) the data as a means to predict future load shedding in the SEGL. Each cluster was generated five times to create five different cluster sizes (1, 2, 5, 7 and 10) with different seed values. The pattern extracted provided information on all attributes. The obtained results showed that the generated clusters are fit to be used for the future load shedding schedule problem in the SEGL.

One of the most popular and useful techniques in order to discover and extract information from data pools is clustering, and k-means is an algorithm which clusters data according its characteristics. Its main disadvantage is its computational complexity which makes the technique very difficult to apply on big data sets. Although k-means is a very well studied technique, a fully parallel version of it has not been explored yet. In this work, a parallel version of the k-means is presented for 1-d objects. The experimental results obtained are inline with the theoretical outcome and prove both the correctness and the effectiveness of the technique.

This method extracts the tumor by using K-means algorithm followed by Object labeling algorithm. Also, some preprocessing steps (median filtering and morphological operation) are used for tumor detection purpose. It is observed that the experimental results of the proposed method gives better result in comparison to other techniques.

A major issue affecting the performance of these algorithms is that they involve certain parameters that need to be estimated accurately beforehand and remain fixed during their execution. Recently, a possibilistic clustering scheme has been proposed that allows the adaptation of these parameters and imposes sparsity in the sense that it forces the data points to "belong" to only a few (or even none) clusters. The algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of clusters but, rather, only a crude overestimate of it. However, it requires the estimation of two additional parameters. In this paper, a sequential version of this scheme is proposed, which possesses all the advantages of its ancestor and in addition, it requires the (crude) estimation of just a single parameter. Simulation results are provided that show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

This paper presents a data mining approach which incorporates clustering Java classes, as well as classifying extracted clusters, in order to assess internal software quality. We use Java classes as entities and static metrics as attributes for data mining. We identify outliers and apply K- means clustering in order to establish clusters of classes. Outliers indicate potentially fault prone classes, whilst clusters are examined so that we can establish common characteristics. Subsequently, we apply C4.5 to build classification trees for identifying metrics which determine cluster membership. We evaluate the proposed approach with two well known open source software systems, Jedit and Apache Geronimo. Results have consolidated key findings from previous work and indicated that combining clustering with classification produces better results than stand alone clustering.

The proposed segmentation model based on consumer behavior establish hierarchical structure though three variables, frequency (F), average monetary (A) and volatility (V), which facilitates the identification of customers in three dimensions, potential value, current value and loyalty. Then, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is draw to evaluate the weight of each indicator instead of complicated computing indicators' value and k-means cluster is applied to divided the customers into eight disjoin clusters, which derive from the results of AHP. Finally, we examine a case study, bank VIP customer segmentation, which confirms the above observations and illustrates our methodology can play an important role in carrying out hierarchical strategy and personalization marketing.

Optimize these performances, automatically contribute in improving decision making. One of the important performances optimization techniques in XML data warehouse is fragmentation with its different variants (horizontal fragmentation and vertical fragmentation). In this paper, we develop a hybrid fragmentation algorithm combining a vertical fragmentation based on XPath expressions and a horizontal fragmentation based on selection predicates. To control the number of fragments, we use the K-Means algorithm.

In the past few years, several spectral clustering algorithms were proposed to cluster arbitrarily shaped data in various real applications including image processing and web analysis. However, most of these algorithms were based on k-means, which is a randomized algorithm and makes the algorithm easy to fall into local optimal solutions. Hierarchical method could handle the local optimum well because it organizes data into different groups at different levels. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called spectral clustering algorithm based on hierarchical clustering (SCHC), which combines the advantages of hierarchical clustering and spectral clustering algorithms to avoid the local optimum issues. The experiments on both synthetic data sets and real data sets show that SCHC outperforms other six popular clustering algorithms. The method is simple but is shown to be efficient in clustering both convex shaped data and arbitrarily shaped data.

In this paper, we present a similarity measure for clustering gene expression time series data. Our similarity measure, PWCTM, uses the pairwise changing tendency measure of every pair of conditions. We have compared our measure with several proximity measures using k-means clustering algorithm in terms of Silhouette index, z-score and p-value. Our experimental results indicate that the gene clusters obtained with PWCTM as the similarity measure are biologically significant in the respective clusters due to their low p-values and high z-values.

The scope of image segmentation is immense. Enormous amount of work has been done to develop accurate techniques in image segmentation. Several techniques like k-means clustering, watershed segmentation and quad tree segmentation have been devised for proper segmentation of images into well-defined classes. Thresholding, edge detection, clustering and region growing are some popular techniques used to segment images as per requirements. The main objective of image segmentation is to attain a highly accurate segmented image. Segmentation is a vital penultimate or final stage process in any image processing application. Unfortunately, image segmentation techniques of the yesteryears come with their drawbacks each imposing a limitation leading to inaccuracy. In our paper we have proposed a novel segmentation technique that is bio-inspired from the behavioral nature of monarch butterflies and is hence called the Monarch Butterfly Algorithm (MBA). The proposed method is extremely accurate and has an added advantage of automatic classification of the image into classes. To prove the supremacy of our algorithm over other proposed algorithms, we have done a comparison with two extremely popular segmentation techniques, watershed segmentation and K-means clustering. We have used our proposed technique on segmentation of satellite images. Segmentation of these images helps in identification and computation of land cover area, area covered by water bodies, foliage cover area etc. Detection and computation of foliage cover area can be further used for study on biomass.

Clustering and classification of collecting data are essential parts for detecting concealed information of P-QRS-T waves in the long-term ECG recording. Currently used algorithms do have their share of drawbacks: 1) clustering and classification cannot be done in real time; 2) they suffer from huge energy consumption and load of sampling. These drawbacks motivated us in developing novel optimized clustering algorithm which could easily scan large ECG datasets for establishing low power long-term ECG recording. In this paper, we present an advanced K-means clustering algorithm based on Compressed Sensing (CS) theory as a random sampling procedure. Then, two dimensionality reduction methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Correlation Coefficient (LCC) followed by sorting the data using the K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifiers are applied to the proposed algorithm. We show our algorithm based on PCA features in combination with K-NN classifier shows better performance than other methods. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms by increasing 11% classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed algorithm illustrates classification accuracy for K-NN and PNN classifiers, and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) area of 99.98%, 99.83%, and 99.75% respectively.

Comparison of Normalization Algorithms for Cross-Batch Color Segmentation of Histopathological Images	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				Automated processing of digital histopathology slides has the potential to streamline patient care and provide new tools for cancer classification and grading. Before automatic analysis is possible, quality control procedures are applied to ensure that each image can be read consistently. One important quality control step is color normalization of the slide image, which adjusts for color variances (batch-effects) caused by differences in stain preparation and image acquisition equipment. Color batch-effects affect color-based features and reduce the performance of supervised color segmentation algorithms on images acquired separately. To identify an optimal normalization technique for histopathological color segmentation applications, five color normalization algorithms were compared in this study using 204 images from four image batches. Among the normalization methods, two global color normalization methods normalized colors from all stain simultaneously and three stain color normalization methods normalized colors from individual stains extracted using color deconvolution. Stain color normalization methods performed significantly better than global color normalization methods in 11 of 12 cross-batch experiments (p<0.05). Specifically, the stain color normalization method using k-means clustering was found to be the best choice because of high stain segmentation accuracy and low computational complexity.

In this paper, a simple and efficient framework of clustering the variability in FC of a rat's brain at rest is proposed. This clustering process reveals areas that are always connected with a chosen region, called seed voxel, along with the areas exhibiting variability in the FC. This addresses an issue common to most dynamic FC analysis techniques, which is the assumption that the spatial extent of a given network remains constant over time. We increase the voxel size and reduce the spatial resolution to analyze variable FC of the whole resting brain. We hypothesize that the adjacent voxels in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), just as in task-based fMRI, exhibit similar intensities, so they can be averaged to obtain larger voxels without any significant loss of information. Sliding window correlation is used to compute variable patterns of the rat's whole brain FC with the seed voxel in the sensorimotor cortex. These patterns are grouped based on their spatial similarities using binary transformed feature vectors in k-means clustering, not only revealing the variable and non-variable portions of FC in the resting brain but also detecting the extent of the variability of these patterns.

Methodology for micro-CT data inflation using Intravascular Ultrasound images	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			VIRTUAL HISTOLOGY	In this paper, a framework for the inflation of micro-CT data using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images, is presented. The proposed methodology consists of four steps. In the first step a centerline is extracted from the micro-CT images. In the second step the micro CT images are segmented automatically using the k-means algorithm. In the third step IVUS- micro-CT images are co-registered based on fiducial markers selected manually by the experts. Finally, the images are inflated by applying a transformation method on each image. The transformation method is based on the IVUS and micro-CT contour difference. The proposed methodology for inflating micro-CT images could increase the reliability of correct plaque labeling process as well to enhance the accuracy of the produced training dataset from the micro-CT images.

The change of SEMG amplitude is one of manifestations of muscle fatigue. This study proposes a force estimation method using SEMG in fatiguing contraction. The SEMG amplitude is used to determine the signal states by k-means clustering method. According to the signal state changes, the corresponding gain is used to estimate the force. The target contraction is an isometric abduction of an index finger in static and dynamic force conditions for 5 healthy subjects. The estimation performance was evaluated by percentage of root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE for the proposed method is 2.5 +/- 1.0% under static condition and 8.8 +/- 1.2% under dynamic condition. The accuracy using a constant gain calculated at initial time was used to compare with the proposed method. The RMSE are 8.9 +/- 2.2% under static condition and 10.1 +/- 2.4% under dynamic condition. The proposed method had better performance in both conditions.

In fact, this process requires an Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) diagnosis automation. We deal with the initial phase that represents the fluorescence images segmentation. Our approach consists of three principle stages: (1) a color based segmentation which aims at extracting the fluorescent foreground based on k-means clustering, (2) the segmentation of the fluorescent clustered image, and (3) a region-based feature segmentation, intended to remove the fluorescent noisy regions and to locate fluorescent parasites. We evaluated the proposed method on 40 IIF images. Experimental results show that such a method provides reliable and robust automatic segmentation of fluorescent Promastigote parasite.

However, MSI datasets can be very large, and analyzing them to identify important biological patterns is a challenging computational problem. Many types of unsupervised analysis have been applied to MSI data, and in particular, clustering has recently gained attention for this application. In this paper, we present an exploratory study of the performance of different analysis pipelines using k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering. The results indicate the effects of different pre-processing and parameter selections on identifying biologically relevant patterns in MSI data.

Many attempts have been made to automate the process by training computer algorithms such as support vector machines and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to replicate human scoring. Such supervised classifiers are typically trained on scored data and then validated on scored out-of-sample data. Here we describe a methodology based on HMMs for scoring an overnight sleep recording without the benefit of a trained initial model. The number of states in the data is not known a priori and is optimized using a Bayes information criterion. When tested on a 22-subject database, this unsupervised classifier agreed well with human scores (mean of Cohen's kappa > 0.7). The HMM also outperformed other unsupervised classifiers (Gaussian mixture models, k-means, and linkage trees), that are capable of naive classification but do not model dynamics, by a significant margin (p < 0.05).

This vast amount of spatio-temporal data requires the development of computational methods capable of building an integrated picture of the functional networks for a better understanding of the healthy and diseased brain [1]. Although the construction of these networks from neuroimaging data is well-established [2], current approaches are limited to the characterization of the global topology of static networks where the links between different brain regions represent average connectivity over a long time period [3], [2]. Recent studies suggest that human cognition arises from the rapid formation and dissociation of synchronized neural activity on short time scales in the order of milliseconds [4]. There is a strong need for new electroencephalogram (EEG)based analytic frameworks for monitoring dynamic functional network activity. In this paper, we propose a graph theoretic approach for tracking the changing topology of functional connectivity networks across time. First, we introduce an event detection algorithm based on node level feature extraction and principal components analysis of time-dependent node correlation matrices. Then, we propose a k-means based clustering approach to characterize each time interval with the most common connectivity states. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to the study of the dynamics of functional connectivity networks during error-related negativity (ERN).

In this paper, a new kind of algorithm using PSO to optimize K-means algorithm is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, K-means algorithm based on PSO has better effect than the traditional K-means algorithm, and has good global convergence, to a certain extent, improved the traditional K-means algorithm is easy to fall into local minimum value and the initial value sensitive defect, so the improved method this paper proposed is effective.

Meanwhile, distribution division can reduce solution space of the problem of logistics system distribution scheduling. K-means which is the basic clustering algorithm has many advantages, such as dealing with large data set, getting quite compact results of clustering and the obvious separation between clusters. So, k-means algorithm is used to divide distribution areas with different clustering numbers. In this paper, two principles are considered in clustering process. One principle is that customer points are close with each other in the same region and far in different regions. The other is the lower total transport cost. At last, PROMETHEE method is used to make a contrast among projects with different clustering number.

Health care behavior involves high complexity and uncertainty, when nurses perform health care behavior-based work, they must possess highly professional nursing knowledge and skills to ensure the provision of safe patient care services. In 2005, the Taiwanese government has drawn up Taiwan TrainQuali System (TTQS) for businesses and medical units to carry out internal human training by offering a sound education and training evaluating system. Because competency plays an important role in TTQS evaluating, the purpose of this study is to establish a nursing staff competency model for a good nurse-patient relationship and integrally to promote TTQS. The data was collected by the case hospital and two-stage clustering method (Self-Organization Maps and K-means) was used to analyze core competency that nursing staff should possess. The analysis found that competency in different ranks between two groups of 'staff' and 'executive', think 'innovation and development' the most important, and then is 'emotional management' and 'earnest and responsible'. The study results establish a competency model to help the nursing staff education and self-practice, and to examine the nursing professionalism exhibited by nurses delivering health care services.

In order to have more efficient analysis and results, there is a need to calculate missing values in data. Various approaches for missing value imputation have been proposed and compared in the literature. But to the best of my knowledge work reported here on performance analysis of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Weighted K-means to compute missing values has yet not been done using financial dataset. This paper analyzes the performance of these three algorithms to find incomplete values of missing factors. Root mean square error is used as an evaluation criterion for the comparison for three mentioned algorithms. Computation is done on the data of investment patterns in different financial instruments. Results show that K-Means algorithm suite the financial data best for incomplete values imputation in comparison to other variants.

However, the existing works often utilize only one distance function to evaluate the similarity between data items along with each feature, which leads to performance degradation for some complex data sets. In this work, a novel soft subspace fuzzy clustering algorithm MKEWFC-K is proposed by extending the existing entropy weight soft subspace clustering algorithm with a multiple-kernel learning setting. By incorporating multiple-kernel learning strategy into the framework of soft subspace fuzzy clustering, MKEWFC-K can learning the distance function adaptively during the clustering process. Moreover, it is more immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features in soft subspace, which makes the choice of kernels less crucial. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MKEWFC-K algorithm.

A strong clustered dataset as input to classification algorithms can significantly improve computation time. This can be particularly useful in Big Data where computation time is equally or more important than accuracy. However, there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy among clustering algorithms. Specifically, general type-2 fuzzy c-means (GT2 FCM) is considered to be a highly accurate clustering approach, but it is computationally intensive. To improve its computation time we propose here a hybrid clustering algorithm called KGT2FCM that combines GT2 FCM with a fast k-means algorithm for input data preprocessing of classification algorithms. The proposed algorithm shows improved computation time when compared with GT2 FCM as well as KFGT2FCM on five benchmarks from UCI library.

For the demand side management and grid operation, the variation in demand is to be known. In this paper, classical k-means clustering approach is used for finding similar types of profiles of a practical system for demand variation analysis and energy loss estimation. For different zones, typical load profiles based on similar consumption are obtained. Primarily, the load factor represents feeder demand variation, and loss factor helps average energy loss estimation in distribution power system without load flow studies. In this paper, a concept is proposed for analysis of electricity consumption pattern on different days in particular zones based on cluster load factor and cluster loss factor. Normal and abnormal peak load requirements in cluster of similar types of profile of days of different zones are identified. Cluster loss factor helps in identifying the energy loss variation due to different load patterns.	[Sharma, Desh Deepak; Singh, S.

A Robust Segmentation Technique for Line, Word and Character Extraction from Kannada Text in Low Resolution Display Board Images	2014 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND IMAGE PROCESSING (ICSIP 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)	JAN 08-10, 2014	Bangalore, INDIA	Bhageerathi Bai Narayana Rao Maanay Educ Inst Technol, ISRO, Karnataka Sci & Technol Acad		Segmentation; K-Means Clustering; Projection Profile Features; Low Resolution Images; Display Boards	SYSTEM	Reliable extraction/segmentation of text lines, words and characters is one of the very important steps for development of automated systems for understanding the text in low resolution display board images. In this paper, a new approach for segmentation of text lines, words and characters from Kannada text in low resolution display board images is presented. The proposed method uses projection profile features and on pixel distribution statistics for segmentation of text lines. The method also detects text lines containing consonant modifiers and merges them with corresponding text lines, and efficiently separates overlapped text lines as well. The character extraction process computes character boundaries using vertical profile features for extracting character images from every text line. Further, the word segmentation process uses k-means clustering to group inter character gaps into character and word cluster spaces, which are used to compute thresholds for extracting words. The method also takes care of variations in character and word gaps. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a data set of 1008 low resolution images of display boards containing Kannada text captured from 2 mega pixel cameras on mobile phones at various sizes 240x320, 600x800 and 900x1200. The method achieves text line segmentation accuracy of 97.17%, word segmentation accuracy of 97.54% and character extraction accuracy of 99.09%. The proposed method is tolerant to font variability, spacing variations between characters and words, absence of free segmentation path due to consonant and vowel modifiers, noise and other degradations. The experimentation with images containing overlapped text lines has given promising results.	[Angadi, S. A.; Kodabagi, M.

Detection and classification of exudates using k-means clustering in color retinal images	2014 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND IMAGE PROCESSING (ICSIP 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)	JAN 08-10, 2014	Bangalore, INDIA	Bhageerathi Bai Narayana Rao Maanay Educ Inst Technol, ISRO, Karnataka Sci & Technol Acad		Diabetic retinopathy; exudates; morphological operations; Hough Transform; k-mean clustering		Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world among patients suffering from diabetes. It is an ocular disease and progressive by nature. It is characterized by many pathologies, namely microaneurysms, hard exudates, soft exudates, hemorrhages, etc, among them presence of exudates is the prominent sign of non-proliferative DR. Both hard and soft exudates play a vital role in grading DR into different stages. In this paper, we present an efficient method to identify and classify the exudates as hard and soft exudates. The retinal image in CIELAB color space is pre-processed to eliminate noise. Next, blood vessels network is eliminated to facilitate detection and elimination of optic disc. Optic disc is eliminated using Hough transform technique. The candidate exudates are then detected using k-means clustering technique. Finally, the exudates are classified as hard and soft exudates based on their edge energy and threshold. The proposed method has yielded encouraging results.	[Rajput, G.

Automatic Segmentation of Ovarian Follicle using K-means Clustering	2014 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND IMAGE PROCESSING (ICSIP 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)	JAN 08-10, 2014	Bangalore, INDIA	Bhageerathi Bai Narayana Rao Maanay Educ Inst Technol, ISRO, Karnataka Sci & Technol Acad		Ultrasound image; wavelet transform; k-means clustering; edge detection; ovarian follicle detection	ULTRASOUND IMAGES	Automatic detection of human ovarian follicles has been of increasing interest in recent years and is a significant area of women's health. Improper development of ovarian follicles has been an important reason for infertility in women. Currently, detection of ovarian follicle is done through diagnostic imaging technique called ultrasonography. Follicles differ in shape and colour. Further, the camouflaging characteristic of ultrasound images and the presence of speckle noise make the follicle detection a challenging task. In this paper, a novel method for automatic recognition of follicles in ultrasound images is proposed. Discrete wavelet transform based k-means clustering is proposed. Discrete wavelet transform is preferred due to its superior spectral temporal resolution that helps in despeckling the ultrasound images. K-means clustering is used to segment the image into different anatomical structures to yield better segmentation. Structural Similarity (SSIM), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

These signals are captured by a multi-channel electrode system. Any muscle movement impacts the EEG signal recording which translates to artifacts. Therefore, noise from the recording is eliminated by subtracting the noisy signal from the original EEG recording. The actual EEG signals are then subjected to band pass filtering with cut-off frequencies 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. The filtered signals are analyzed using a time-frequency technique known as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). A third order Debauchies' wavelet and five level decomposition is utilized to segregate the signal into five sub-bands, namely, delta (0.5 - 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (12 - 30 Hz) and gamma (> 30 Hz). First order statistical moments such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation and mode of the sub-bands are calculated and stored as features. These features serve as an input to the next stage of system classification. Unsupervised learning through K-means clustering is employed since the classes of the signals are unknown. This provides a strong decision making tool for a real-time drowsiness detection system. The algorithm developed in this work has been tested on twelve samples from the Physionet sleep-EDF database.

To address the need for solar radiation hourly forecasts this paper proposes the use of statistical and data mining techniques that allow different solar radiation hourly profiles for different days to be found and established. A new method is proposed for forecasting solar radiation hourly profiles using daily clearness index. The proposed method was checked using data recorded in Malaga. The obtained results show that it is possible to forecast hourly solar global radiation for a day with an energy error around 10% which means a significant improvement on previously reported errors.

It utilizes similarity to filter out redundant attributes by feature selection. Then by incorporating K-Means clustering, it is able to effectively solve the rating scale problems existing in the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm. The algorithm is verified by real data sets. Experiments use location information for clustering the restaurant data. By integration of users rating on restaurant service and external impression the experiment study combined the collaborative filtering philosophy to provide recommendation service for users. Experimental results show that compared with the item rating based recommended algorithm, the algorithm has ideal recommended quality and improved accuracy, and then it has reduced the data sparsity.

Presently, the simultaneous factor's selection is lack of theoretical basis, selecting results can't match the actual electricity demand of community reasonably. Accordingly, this paper presents a method for determining simultaneous factor of city community based on data mining. By analyzing the main factor of city community's simultaneous factor, construct index system of simultaneous factor's influencing factor. Establish the fuzzy membership function to do the unified quantization of qualitative indexes and standardization, do cluster analysis with the treated samples based on fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm, according to the clustering results predict new samples' simultaneous factor. The actual examples show that, this method's selection principle of simultaneous factor is more systematic and scientific, the results are more significant for the distribution network planning of practical city community.

Because the GDs' distributions of filtered images are almost picked, this obstacles obtaining discriminative binned distributions for each image. For this reason, we execute k-means clustering on each scale of pooled Gaussian derivative set of the instances come from all classes to yield k-cluster centroids for partitioning feature space, thus generating normalized binned marginal distributions for all training and testing samples, which are holistically adaptive to underlying distributions. On similarity matching, we identify each image with a point of product multinomial manifold with boundary, and use the direct sum of geodesic distance metric for sets of binned marginal densities. The promising experimental results on Zurich buildings database (ZuBuD) validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

In the first analysis, we show that alignment is not needed to identify paths. Indeed, without allowing for warping, we detect four clusters strongly associated to the four possible paths. In the second analysis, by exploiting the circular nature of data and allowing for shifts, we detect two clusters distinguishing between spike trains presenting higher or lower neuronal activity during the bottom-left/bottom-right movement respectively. In this latter case, the alignment procedure is able to match the four movements across paths.

Allowing for affine warping, we detect two clusters distinguishing between mainly-planar trajectories and trajectories tilted toward the body of the juggler in the lower part of the cycle. In particular we detect an anomalous presence of tilted trajectories among the trial third cycles. We also find warping functions to be clustered according to trials suggesting that each trial is performed at a different pace and thus associated to a different typical cycle-duration.

In this paper, we present a new impulse detection algorithm based on combination of Luo-statistic and k-means clustering. This paper also presents a novel approach to measure impulse noise density level in the corrupted image, knowledge of which allows us to select suitable parameters for the noise detection algorithm. In noise filtering stage, we apply nonlocal-means (NL-means) estimator to restore noisy pixels to their actual values. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing impulse noise removal techniques both in terms of noise detection and image restoration.

It is characterized by nonlocal parameter optimization obtained through K-means clustering. The proposed method, namely C-BDSD, solves the problem of context-adaptive schemes that tune the spatial injection parameters on local statistics: instabilities and blockiness artifacts are avoided and the estimation phase is improved. The C-BDSD algorithm is accurate and fast, and can be also applied to spatially enhance large-size multispectral images. Very high quality scores and excellent visual quality of the fused images demonstrate the validity of the method.

A lot of research effort has been invested in the study and understanding of images obtained from these satellites. However, there is still a huge scope of statistical understanding and comparison of data from both satellites. In this study, we demonstrate some striking similarities between medium resolution data obtained from CSK and TSX Stripmap mode images. Land-cover unsupervised clustering using k-means is discussed to further justify our findings. Clustering is carried out using a feature descriptor based on log-cumulants of Gabor coefficients, which was recently proposed by us in earlier studies.

However, as the total variation model favors a piecewise constant solution, the processing result under high noise intensity in the flat regions of the image is often poor, and some "pseudo-edges" are produced. In this paper, we develop a regional spatially adaptive total variation (RSATV) model. Firstly, the spatial information is extracted based on each pixel, and then two filtering processes are respectively added to suppress the effect of "pseudo-edges". After that, the spatial information weight is constructed and classified with k-means clustering, and the regularization strength in each region is controlled by the clustering center value. The experimental results, on both simulated and real datasets, show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the "pseudo-edges" of the total variation regularization in the flat regions, and maintain the partial smoothness of the high-resolution image. More importantly, compared with the traditional pixel-based spatial information adaptive approach, the proposed region-based spatial information adaptive total variation model can better avoid the effect of noise on the spatial information extraction, and maintains robustness with changes in the noise intensity in the super-resolution process.

In our method, the original image patch vectors embedded in the high-dimensional pixel space are first mapped into a low-dimensional intrinsic space by linear manifold techniques, and then k-means clustering is performed on the patch manifold to learn a dictionary for feature encoding. To generate the feature representation for each local patch, triangle encoding method is applied with the learned dictionary on the same patch manifold. Finally, the holistic scene representations are obtained via the bagof-visual-words (BOW) framework. We apply the proposed method on an aerial scene dataset. Experiments on the dataset show very promising results and demonstrate that our UFL pipeline can generate very effective local features for image scenes.

However, for knowledge discovery in large remote sensing databases can be use clustering techniques in multivariate time series. The clustering technique on three-dimensional time series of NDVI, albedo and surface temperature from AVHRR/NOAA satellite images was used, in this study, to map the variability of land use. This approach was suitable to accomplish the temporal analysis of land use. Additionally, this technique can be used to identify and analyze dynamics of land use and cover being useful to support researches in agriculture, even considering low spatial resolution satellite images. The possibility of extracting time series from satellite images, analyzing them through data mining techniques, such as clustering, and visualizing results in geospatial way is an important advance and support to agricultural monitoring tasks.

Clustering is a widely used approach for grouping similar kind of genes. The main objective of this paper is to identify the optimal subset of genes from the leukemia dataset in order to classify the leukemia cancer. Different clustering approaches such as K-means (KM) clustering, fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, and modified K-means (MKM) clustering have been adopted in this research. The clusters obtained from these methods are further clustered using K-means sample-wise (by omitting class values), and the results are compared with ground truth value to evaluate the performance of the different clustering methods. The highly correlated genes are selected from the cluster that produces more accurate classification results. It is observed that the FCM (gene-wise clustering) with K-means (sample-wise clustering) produces better accuracy, and the resultant genes have been identified.

Software fault prediction is subject to problems like non-availability of fault data which makes the application of supervised technique difficult. In such cases, unsupervised techniques are helpful. In this paper, a hyper-quadtree-based K-means algorithm has been applied for predicting the faults in the program module. This paper contains two parts. First, the hyper-quadtree is applied on the software fault prediction dataset for the initialization of the K-means clustering algorithm. An input parameter Delta governs the initial number of clusters and cluster centers. Second, the cluster centers and the number of cluster centers obtained from the initialization algorithm are used as the input for the K-means clustering algorithm for predicting the faults in the software modules. The overall error rate of this prediction approach is compared with the other existing algorithms.

However, their analysis is uneasy because the number of genes is extremely large with respect to the number of experiments. The problem is that all genes are not essential in gene expression data. Some of the genes may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. This research paper studies the gene expression data using rough set theory; it is an intelligent computing method. In this paper, we studied and implemented following discretization methods such as rough discretization (RD), naive Bayes, max-min, equal width intervals, K-means-based discretization, and entropy-based discretization (EBD) for gene selection using rough set quick reduct (QR) for breast cancer gene expression data. Further, the performance of the above algorithms has been evaluated using classification tools available in Weka software and BPN classifier.	[Sathishkumar, E.

The feature is derived from the Teager energy operated wavelet coefficients of speech signal. The wavelet coefficients enhanced by TE operation is used to compute entropy thus forming a feature vector. The feature vector is fed to unsupervised K-means clustering in a nonhierarchical process. Considering the effectiveness of supervised classification in a recognition problem, the feature is then used in a supervised KNN classifier. It is seen that supervised KNN classifier is more capable of distinguishing different emotions when a hierarchical approach is followed for recognition instead of a non-hierarchical one. Detail simulations are carried on EMO-DB German speech emotion database containing four class emotions, such as angry, happy, sad and neutral. Simulation results show that the proposed feature with supervised hierarchical classification approach provides the higher accuracy in comparison to the other methods of four-class emotion recognition.

We analyze the ecosystems of the two prominent paradigms for data-intensive applications, hereafter referred to as the high-performance computing and the Apache-Hadoop paradigm. We propose a basis, common terminology and functional factors upon which to analyze the two approaches of both paradigms. We discuss the concept of " Big Data Ogres" and their facets as means of understanding and characterizing the most common application workloads found across the two paradigms. We then discuss the salient features of the two paradigms, and compare and contrast the two approaches. Specifically, we examine common implementation/approaches of these paradigms, shed light upon the reasons for their current "architecture" and discuss some typical workloads that utilize them. In spite of the significant software distinctions, we believe there is architectural similarity. We discuss the potential integration of different implementations, across the different levels and components. Our comparison progresses from a fully qualitative examination of the two paradigms, to a semi-quantitative methodology. We use a simple and broadly used Ogre (K-means clustering), characterize its performance on a range of representative platforms, covering several implementations from both paradigms.

Return the most similar results to build a multi-video retrieval function. By using K-mean cluster and the gradient histogram of local binary pattern, we respectively transferred video into color and texture features. According to calculated the features distance between continuous frames to detect the shot boundaries of the video. Thus, different shot can be detected. After videos were cut into representative shots, filter and cluster the shots by video analysis function, so that each shot can be more representative. Finally, we could find out the similar results by calculating the distance between query video and video database. In the experimental results, we detected the correct shot boundary. In video retrieval, it can be divided into two ways - the image query videos and the video query videos. The query results showed the similar shot of the target clips.

We proposed a robust method for detecting road sign text from urban street scenes under different weather conditions. First, color Segmentation and morphological operations are employed to obtain candidate regions, and contours of candidate regions are mainly concern. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is followed for shape classification after shape features based on edge orientation histogram (EOH) of contours are extracted. Finally, binarization of road sign images is achieved by k-means clustering in the S channel, multi-scale rules and strokes merging are referenced to extract texts. Experiment results on a large amount of images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In 2012 the average share of the the EU households expenditure on health in the total EU households expenditure was 3,7%. However, there are considerable differences in health care expenditure among EU member countries. The aim of this paper is to analyze the household expenditure on health in the European Union countries. The research problems concern such issues as: an indication of the degree of differentiation and the rate of change in households expenditure on health in 1995-2012 in European countries; a comparison of the expenditure on health in selected countries and Clusters Analysis of European countries grouped by the similar share of health expenditure in the total expenditure of households. We used three clustering methods in the following study, such as: complete-linkage clustering, Ward's method and a K-means clustering method. The selection of the countries for cluster analysis was based on the value of the Tabular Accuracy Index. The ongoing demographic processes and gradual growth of the wealth of nations have significant impact on increased demand for medical services including increased household expenditure on health.

Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. The aim of authors of the new algorithms is to search for new methods that use existing methods positives and minimize the negatives. In this article, we discuss one of the most famous and most used method, the k-means method. The inability to search non-convex clusters is one of known weak points of the k-means method. Nevertheless, this method has many advantages such as simplicity and speed. This algorithm is also implemented in a lot of statistical software. The article presents a proposal for a solution. The second phase of the process is proposed. We create a certain number of clusters which is larger than desired in the first stage of processing by the classical algorithm k-means. Then we combine some clusters using appropriate agglomerative methods and reduce the number of clusters required in the second phase. There is the proposed procedure described and analyzed. The second aim was to find out how this new feature of the algorithm adversely affects the positive benefits of the original k-means method.

One of the most popular techniques in data clustering is K-means, which is a simple, fast and efficient method that has been applied successfully in many fields. However, K-means has its own drawbacks like highly dependence on the initial solution and can easily trapped into local optima. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of the newly created meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm called Biogeography-Based Optimisation (BBO) for data clustering with different initial solution generation mechanisms (random initial solution, sequential diversification initial solution, heuristic initial solution) that is based on the idea of migration of species between different habitats. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, six UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets were used. The performance of the BBO algorithm was compared with well-known data-clustering algorithms that available in the literature, the experimental results showed that the BBO algorithm was able to obtain comparable results.

It used the methodology of Functional Measurement. Participants were not instructed to judge the acceptability of components of drug policies (e.g., acceptability of needle exchange programs) but the acceptability of the policy itself (e.g., acceptability of a policy of complete prohibition). One hundred eighty-five participants (mean age = 35) who lived in different areas of the city were presented with a series of 12 vignettes. These vignettes were composed according to a two within-subject orthogonal factor design: (a) existence of information campaigns regarding the dangerousness of drugs, and (b) current state policy regarding soft and hard drugs (e.g., complete laissezfaire, complete prohibition, regulation policy for both soft and hard drugs). The question was "To what extent do you think that, in these circumstances, the position of the State is politically acceptable?" Through K-means analyses, an interpretable six-cluster solution was identified. These clusters were called radical constructionists (51%), progressive prohibitionists (22%), free trade libertarians (11%), undecided (10%), and cultural conservatives (6%). Public opinion in Bogota seems to be at variance with public policy regarding the management of the illicit drug issue.

To address the problem, this paper proposes a method based on x-means clustering, an extended version of k-means without fixed number of classes, for the task. Moreover, x-means method clusters the data according to a pre-defined distance measurement considering different features. Current methods on distance measuring only focus on features themselves while ignoring the impact of these features on human perception. To derive a more reasonable distance measurement, this paper also proposes a human perception based weighted distance to capture the contribution of different acoustic features on human perception. In this way, the automatic classification of internet speech data will make use of the prior knowledge of human perception as well as capture the speaking style characteristics in different datasets with varying categories. Experiments on listening test demonstrate that it is useful to introduce the human perception prior knowledge in distance measurement and our proposed method outperforms the baseline with conventional Euclidian distance with 10% improvement in classification accuracy.

Historical sensor data is first clustered by the K-means method to obtain the representative data pattern of the sensor. For each K-means cluster and using the clusters centroid as the exogenous input, the time-varying output of the sensor is subsequently modeled as an ARMAX stochastic process, and identified in real time using a recursive least squares (RLS) with forgetting factor algorithm. Based on the identified ARMAX model, a D-step ahead optimal predictor is generated for each cluster and its associated estimated error prediction variance calculated. The cluster and its associated ARMAX estimate that produces the smallest estimated D-step ahead error prediction variance is selected at each sampling time instant to generate the optimal D-step ahead predictor of the sensor output. The proposed technique is applied to empirical vehicle detector station (VDS) data to forecast both freeway mainline and on-ramp traffic flow at specific locations over a horizon of one hour. Results indicate that the proposed traffic flow predictor often offers superior flexibility and overall forecast performance compared to using either only historical data or only real-time sensor data on both normal commute days and days when unusual incidents occur.

The motion vectors are extracted by partially decoding the corresponding video sequence in the H. 264 compressed domain. The region of interest ie., crowd flow region is extracted and the motion vectors that spans the region of interest is preprocessed and a collective representation of the motion vectors for the entire video is obtained. The obtained motion vectors for the corresponding video is then clustered by using EM algorithm. Finally, the clusters which converges to a single flow are merged together based on the bhattacharya distance measure between the histogram of the of the orientation of the motion vectors at the boundaries of the clusters. We had implemented our proposed approach on the complex crowd flow dataset provided by [1] and compared our results by using Jaccard measure. Since we are performing crowd flow segmentation in the compressed domain using only motion vectors, our proposed approach performs much faster compared to other pixel domain counterparts still retaining better accuracy.

Classifying Text Documents using Unconventional Representation	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP)	International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)	JAN 15-17, 2014	Bangkok, THAILAND			Classification; Text Documents; Representation; Clustering Algorithms		Classification of text documents is one of the most common themes in the field of machine learning. Although a text document expresses a wide range of information, but it lacks the imposed structure of tradition database. Thus, unstructured data, particularly free running text data has to be transferred into a structured data. Hence, in this paper we represent the text document unconventionally by making use of symbolic data analysis concepts. We propose a new method of representing documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors. Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of Mean and Standard Deviation. Further, term frequency vectors are used in the form a interval valued features. To cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentations on standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini Newsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia datasets and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model gives better results when compared to the state of the art techniques. In addition, as the method is based on a simple matching scheme, it requires a negligible time.	[Harish, B. S.; Kumar, S. V.

Unlike the classification algorithm, clustering belongs to the unsupervised type of algorithms. Two representatives of the clustering algorithms are the K-means and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Linear regression analysis was extended to the category-type dependent variable, while logistic regression was achieved using a linear combination of independent variables. To predict the possibility of occurrence of an event, a statistical approach is used. However, the classification of all data by means of logistic regression analysis cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results. In this paper, the logistic regression analysis is applied to EM clusters and the K-means clustering method for quality assessment of red wine, and a method is proposed for ensuring the accuracy of the classification results.

Most retail decisions are made based on the demand forecasts which may or may not be accurate in the first place. In this study, a framework for forecasting weekly demands of retail items is proposed via linear regression models within item groups that incorporate both positive and negative item associations. In addition to pairwise item associations found by utilizing transactional data, our framework incorporates item similarities based on weekly sales figures to group the similar items. Grouping items can be regarded as a form of variable selection to prevent the overfitting in the prediction models. The regression results of the framework and benchmark linear regression models are reported for a real world dataset provided by an apparel retailer. The results show that the regression models provide better estimates within multi-item groups compared to the single item models. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Adaptive Learning Model for Predicting Negotiation Behaviors through Hybrid K-means Clustering, Linear Vector Quantization and 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Model	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Conquering Complexity - Challenges and Opportunities	NOV 03-05, 2014	Philadelphia, PA	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol		System of Systems; negotiation; unsupervised; behavior; radial basis; k-means; clustering; hierarchical; LVQ; network		Acknowledged System of systems (SoS) manager has no direct control over contributing systems yet they deliver capabilities required to meet the purpose of the SoS operating in an interdependent environment. Forming a joint capability by contribution requires both persuasion and negotiation between the SoS coordinator and each individual system. Negotiation here involves multiple parties, and multiple issues. The challenges here include predicting an opponent system's negotiation behavior and reaching a near optimal negotiation outcome based on the following three issues: performance demands made by the coordinator, monetary benefits in lieu of effort required, and the deadline assigned to prepare for the final SoS participation formation. The negotiation framework proposed involves an unsupervised clustering of the difference between offers from both parties on all three issues by clustering techniques. The clustering results so far indicate the presence of four prominent behaviors: selfish, semi-cooperative, opportunistic, and extremely selfish. The clustered data was used to train both a radial bass function network (RBFN) and a linear vector quantization network (LVQN) to predict future offers. Once trained, the SoS manager uses 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model for decision making. A time-dependent strategy is used to generate a new offer by SoS manager to the systems.

Cluster Analysis of North Atlantic Tropical Cyclones	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Conquering Complexity - Challenges and Opportunities	NOV 03-05, 2014	Philadelphia, PA	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol		Cluster Analysis; Silhouette Coefficients; Tropical Cyclones; North Atlantic Ocean	SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; TRACKS	Tropical cyclones (TCs) in the North Atlantic (NA) basin pose an annual risk to coastal regions, with hurricane Katrina (2005) the costliest TC in US history. This study employs K-means cluster analysis (CA) to detect the distinctive, important NA TC paths and lifecycles. Unlike previous TC cluster analyses, which examined TC tracks, the present work documents TC genesis and decay locations. Application of the silhouette coefficient provided an objective method to determine the optimal number of clusters (7 for genesis locations, 6 for preferred tracks, and 5 for decay locations). Additionally, silhouette coefficients provided the information necessary to remove storms that did not fit specific clusters, improving cluster cohesiveness. For TC genesis, K-means CA captured the separation between tropical and higher-latitude TCs. Clustering of genesis points identifies formative areas. The western NA cluster is the most active. TCs have distinct decay locations, notably in the western NA, Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean Sea. Clustering TC tracks reveals that TCs moving to higher latitudes recurve generally, whereas Caribbean and Gulf coast TCs have straight-line tracks. Temporally, early season TC clusters form in the western Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and western NA. Mid-season TC clusters shift eastward, extending from the tropical NA to Africa. Late season TC clusters recur in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and western NA. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An Algorithm for Clustering Animals by Species Based upon Daily Movement	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Conquering Complexity - Challenges and Opportunities	NOV 03-05, 2014	Philadelphia, PA	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol		clustering; sequential data clustering; algorithm; adjusted rand index; ARI		An algorithm is presented for clustering individual animals by species based solely upon the daily movements of the individual animals. This is particularly challenging due to the highly erratic nature of the animals' movement. The variance in the scale and frequency of movement between individuals within a species is often greater than the difference between species. Existing clustering algorithms including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral were tried, but they failed to accurately distinguish between species or to cluster individuals of the same species together. Also, some of these algorithms require a priori knowledge of the number of species (clusters). The algorithm presented here addresses this problem by creating separation through a distance metric based upon ranking and then clustering based upon commonality in rankings. The algorithm performed well, demonstrating the ability to both distinguish between species and to cluster together individual of the same species. Furthermore, it assumes no a priori knowledge of the number of clusters expected. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

K-means hashing (KH) is a novel hashing method which firstly quantizes the data by codewords and then uses the indices of codewords to encode the data. However, in KH, only the codewords are updated to minimize the quantization error and affinity error while the indices of codewords remain the same after they are initialized. In this paper, we propose an optimized k-means hashing (OKH) method to encode data by binary codes. In our method, we simultaneously optimize the codewords and the indices of them to minimize the quantization error and the affinity error. Our OKH method can find both the optimal codewords and the optiaml indices, and the resulting binary codes in Hamming space can better preserve the original neighborhood structure of the data. Besides, OKH can further be generalized to a product space. Extensive experiments have verified the superiority of OKH over KH and other state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Firstly, calculate reactive power demand curve by transformer parameters and load curve, partition this curve into several segments. Then cluster these segmentation results into K clusters by using modified FCM (fuzzy C-means clustering) algorithm, in which K means the number of capacitor groups. Take the difference between two adjacent cluster centers as the capacity of each group. Furthermore, study the relationship between segment number and grouping centers in order to get the steady grouping results. After the grouping plan is determined, take the nine-area figure as control strategy. Finally, simulating with an equivalent practical power grid and load profile, the results show both the availability and rationality of this method that power loss is less and power factor is higher compared with the equal grouping method when capacitor is divided into 3 groups.

SURF is a widely used method in computer vision. But it's still not efficient enough to apply in real-time applications, such as real time object tracking. To reduce the time cost, the traditional descriptor of SURF is altered. Triangle and diagonal descriptor is adopted to replace the Haar wavelet calculation. Then dual matching approach based on FLANN is employed. Thus matching errors can be cut down. Besides, the traditional SURF does not give the accurate region of the target. To restrict the area, clustering analysis is used which is promoted from K-WMeans. Experimental work demonstrates the proposed approach achieve better effect than traditional SURF in real scenarios.

The genetic algorithm is an adaptive probabilistic search algorithm, but the crossover and mutation probability usually keep a probability in traditional genetic algorithm. If the crossover probability keep a large value, the possibility of damage for genetic algorithm model is greater; In turn, if the crossover probability keep a small value, the search process will transform a slow processing or even stagnating. If the mutation probability keep a small value, a new individual can be reproduced difficultly; In turn, if the mutation probability keep a large value, the genetic algorithm will as a Pure random search algorithm.

First, based on the model of images with intensity inhomogeneities, we use the K-mean clustering algorithm for intensity clustering in a neighborhood of each point of images with intensity inhomogeneities, and define a local clustering criterion function for the image intensities in the neighborhood. Then this local clustering criterion function is then integrated with respect to the neighborhood center to give a global criterion of image segmentation. This criterion defines an energy function as a local intensity fitting term in the level set model. By minimizing this energy, our method is able to get the accurate image segmentation. The image segmentation results prove that our model in the aspect of segmenting images with intensity inhomogeneity is better than piecewise constant(RSF) model.

Dynamic functional connectivity analysis reveals transient states of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; RESTING-STATE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GRAPHICAL LASSO; NETWORK; FLUCTUATIONS; CONNECTOMICS; FMRI; DYSFUNCTION; REGRESSION	Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by functional dysconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical-subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences.

Although several methods based on single or multiple parameters from diagnostic images exist, a definitive method for pre-operatively determining glioma grade remains unknown. We aimed to develop an unsupervised method using multiple parameters from pre-operative diffusion tensor images for obtaining a clustered image that could enable visual grading of gliomas. Fourteen patients with low-grade gliomas and 19 with high-grade gliomas underwent diffusion tensor imaging and three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before tumour resection. Seven features including diffusion-weighted imaging, fractional anisotropy, first eigenvalue, second eigenvalue, third eigenvalue, mean diffusivity and raw T2 signal with no diffusion weighting, were extracted as multiple parameters from diffusion tensor imaging. We developed a two-level clustering approach for a self-organizing map followed by the K-means algorithm to enable unsupervised clustering of a large number of input vectors with the seven features for the whole brain. The vectors were grouped by the self-organizing map as protoclusters, which were classified into the smaller number of clusters by K-means to make a voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered image. Furthermore, we also determined if the diffusion tensor-based clustered image was really helpful for predicting pre-operative glioma grade in a supervised manner. The ratio of each class in the diffusion tensor-based clustered images was calculated from the regions of interest manually traced on the diffusion tensor imaging space, and the common logarithmic ratio scales were calculated. We then applied support vector machine as a classifier for distinguishing between low- and high-grade gliomas. Consequently, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves from the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images that showed the best performance for differentiating high- and low-grade gliomas were 0.848, 0.745, 0.804 and 0.912, respectively. Furthermore, the log-ratio value of each class of the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images was compared between low- and high-grade gliomas, and the log-ratio values of classes 14, 15 and 16 in the high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than those in the low-grade gliomas (p < 0.005, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). These classes comprised different patterns of the seven diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters. The results suggest that the multiple diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters from the voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered images can help differentiate between low-and high-grade gliomas.

In a smart grid, Distributed Generation (DG) has gained much attention due to numerous advantages. However, inappropriate selection of DG allocation nodes may increase the total power loss of the distribution system. Therefore, it is important to identify similar type of nodes where energy efficient DG allocation is possible. In this paper, Constriction Factor Particle Swarm Optimization (CF-PSO), which is a major variant of Swarm Intelligence (SI), has been used with traditional well studied k-means algorithm to enhance the clustering performance. Experiments are performed considering test data from UCI repository of machine learning databases which shows that the CF-PSO based hybrid clustering outperforms the traditional k-means algorithm. This improved clustering algorithm is then employed to identify the potential nodes for DG allocation using loss sensitivity indices. Extensive experiments have been carried out considering IEEE benchmark 123 node test distribution system to justify the clustering output. Results show that the clustering algorithm provides an insight to select the appropriate DG integration nodes for power loss reduction.

Anomaly detection is one such technique to detect abnormalities in many different domains including computer network intrusion, gene expression analysis, financial fraud detection and many more. In this paper, we develop a framework to discover interesting traffic flows, which seem legitimate but are targeted to disrupt normal computing environment, such as Denial of Service attack. We propose a framework for collective anomaly detection using x-means clustering, which is a variant of basic k-means algorithm. We validate our approach by comparing against existing techniques and benchmark performance. Our experimental results are based on widely accepted DARPA dataset for intrusion detection from MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Summarization is such an important data analysis technique which can be broadly classified into two categories as semantic and syntactic methods. Syntactic methods consider a dataset as a sequence of bytes whereas semantic methods convert large dataset into a much smaller one yet maintaining low information loss. Clustering algorithms are widely used for semantic summarization such as basic k-means. Existing clustering based summarization techniques assume that a summary is represented using the cluster centroids. However, the centroids might not represent the actual data points in summary. In addition, many clustering algorithms, such as the most popular k-means algorithm requires the number of clusters as an input, which is not available for unsupervised summarization of unlabeled data. To address these issues, we propose a clustering based semantic sumtnarization using a combination of x-means and k-nzedoid clustering algorithms. Our experimental analysis shows that, the proposed algorithm outperforms k-means based summarization techniques.

Clustering analysis for time series data is one of the main methods mining time series data, however, general clustering algorithms can't perform clustering for time series data directly since series data has a special structure. The time series clustering algorithm presented is a combining algorithm from algorithms of Canopy and K-means based on SVD. Using singular value decomposition for feature extraction from the time series data, and then use Canopy and K-means algorithms to clustering analysis the feature data of the time series, at last, the algorithm is implemented on Hadoop platform by Mahout leading to a new clustering method that can handle massive time series data. Finally, this new clustering analysis method is successfully applied to real stock time series data with a satisfactory result.

A new feature extraction method based on quaternion principle component analysis (QPCA) algorithm used for sorting the tetrode spikes trains is presented. A quaternion vector formed of four-dimensional numbers can replace a set of tetrode spikes data. Firstly, the four channels of spikes were achieved using dual threshold detection method. We used the modulus values of the vectors grouped by 4 channels corresponding data to constitute the new features vectors of spikes through QPCA algorithm. The features vectors contain correlations of 4 channels. Our method fully fuses the information of tetrode data. Thus it has higher clustering accuracy than traditional feature extraction methods.

This means that it provides machine learning techniques for clustering of multiple user characteristics. Multifactorial classification is conducted by the k-means clustering algorithm which takes as input seven important users' characteristics in order to initialize the process. The clustering is conducted by k-means clustering algorithm, which takes as input multiple user characteristics, in order to initialize the process. The aforementioned characteristics tend to influence the educational procedure. K-means algorithm creates clusters based on data from empirical studies. After determining in which cluster each new student belongs, the system can reason about this specific student, adapting its behavior to the user's needs. The resulting adaptation emerges from the analysis of each cluster's characteristics that derive from each cluster as a superset of already existing user models.

The K-means algorithm is one which is widely used algorithm for clustering of data sets and is easy to understand and simulate on different datasets. In our paper work we have used K-means algorithm for clustering of yeast dataset and iris datasets, in which clustering resulted in less accuracy with more number of iterations. We are simulating an improved version in K-means algorithm for clustering of these datasets, the Improved K-means algorithm use the technique of minimum spanning tree. An undirected graph is generated for all the input data points and then shortest distance is calculated which intern results in better accuracy and also with less number of iterations. Both algorithms have been simulated using java programming language; the results obtained from both algorithms are been compared and analyzed. Algorithms have been run for several times under different clustering groups and the analysis results showed that the Improved K- means algorithm has provided a better performance as compared to K-means algorithm; also Improved K-means algorithm showed that, as the number of cluster values increases the accuracy of the algorithm also increases. Also we have inferred from the results that at a particular value of K (cluster groups) the accuracy of Improved K-means algorithm is optimal.	[Abhilash, C.

In this paper, we analyse a large scale production workload trace (version 2) [1] which is recently made publicly available by Google. We discuss statistical summary of the data. Further we perform k-means clustering to identify common groups of job. Cluster analysis provides insight into the data by dividing the objects into groups (clusters) of objects, such that objects in a cluster are more similar to each other than to the objects in other clusters. This work presents a simple technique for constructing workload characteristics and also provides production insights into understanding workload performance in cluster machine.

They contain missing fields inside some records, that may occur due to human or system error involved in a data collection task. Data imputation is the process of filling in the missing value to generate complete records. Complete databases can be analyzed more accurately in comparison to incomplete databases. This paper proposes a 2-stage hybrid model for filling in the missing values using fuzzy c-means clustering and multilayer perceptron (MEP) working in sequence and compares it with k means imputation and fuzzy c means (FCM) imputation. The accuracy of the model is checked using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE value obtained shows that the proposed model is more accurate in filling multiple values in a record compared to stage 1 alone.

In this work, we have proposed some data preprocessing techniques such as filling the missing values, removing redundant samples, reduce the dimension, selecting most relevant features and finally, normalize the samples. After data preprocessing, we have simulated and tested the dataset by applying various data mining algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K nearest neighbor, K-Mean and Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering which provides better result in less computational time.

Human knowledge of functioning of the brain is still insufficient to understand the neurophysiology of suddenly occurring epileptic seizures. But the detection of the disorder and recognition of the affected brain area is essential for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of epileptic patients. Epilepsy is not only a disorder, but rather acts as a syndrome with divergent symptoms involving episodic abnormal electrical activities in the brain. EEG is the most economical and effective tool with high temporal resolution for understanding the complex dynamical behavior and studying physiological states of the brain. The research presented in this paper, aims to develop a computer aided diagnostic system utilizing EEG data to diagnose whether the person is epileptic or not. We present here various methodologies that could be implemented in hardware for monitoring an epileptic patient. Statistical features depicting morphology of EEG signals are extracted, selected and utilized to classify the signals by Artificial Neural Network, Radial Basis Function, Naive Bayes Classifier, K means classifier, Support vector machine. Efficacy of technique is evaluated on the basis of performance measures, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It has been observed that artificial neural network and support vector machine with radial basis function kernel are more successful as compared to other soft computing paradigms.

The goal of this paper is to reduce the high dimensional data to a meaningful low dimensional data representation, so that the efficiency of clustering algorithm will be elevated. Hence to improve the efficiency of clustering analysis, unsupervised quick reduct algorithm (USQR) is used for selecting the features from high dimensional data. Then the selected features are used to find the initial centroid using k-MAM initialization technique for k-means. The initial centroids are finally used to find the clusters. The results are compared to k-means and k-MAM with USQR so that outperforms well, in terms of accuracy and number of iterations compared to the k-means, for high dimensional data.

When the glucose level of the body goes to abnormal level, it will lead to Blindness, Heart disease, Kidney failure and also Cancer. Epidemiological studies have proved that several cancer types are possible in patients having diabetes. Many researchers proposed methods to diagnose diabetes and cancer. To improve the classification accuracy and to achieve better efficiency a new approach like Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is proposed. The Pima Indian diabetic dataset is used as data set for classification.

In the real world, predicting the performance of the students is a challenging task. Currently they are using cluster analysis for analyzing the students' results and using statistical algorithms to segregate their marks based on their performance. But it is not much effective, so we additionally added the k-mean clustering algorithm combined with deterministic model to analyze and monitor the student's results and their performance. By this k-mean clustering we can get more efficiency on monitoring the progress of academic performance of students in higher Institution to provide accurate results in a short period of time. In this paper, we applied the methodology to find out the various interesting pattern by taking the student test scores.	[Manoharan, J. James; Ganesh, S. Hari; Felciah, M.

In developed countries, among one in eight women develop breast cancer at some stage of their life. Early diagnosis of breast cancer plays a very important role in treatment of the disease. With the goal of identifying genes that are more correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer, we use data mining techniques to study the gene expression values of breast cancer patients with known clinical outcome. K-means clustering is used to compare the result based on test data. As a result, a set of genes are identified that are potential bio marks for breast cancer prognosis which can categorize the patients based on the certain attributes. A comparison is made on gene expression levels that are discovered with gene subsets identified from similar studies using clustering techniques.

In this work, we propose a new GA approach for solving the automatic clustering problem, ACGA -Automatic Clustering Genetic Algorithm. It is capable of finding the optimal number of clusters in a dataset, and correctly assign each data point to a cluster without any prior knowledge about the data. An encoding scheme which had not yet been tested with GA is adopted and new genetic operators are developed. The algorithm can use any cluster validity function as fitness function. Experimental validation shows that this new approach outperforms the classical clustering methods K-means and FCM. The method provides good results, and requires a small number of iterations to converge.

This would probably lead to degradation of river ecosystem. In order to alleviate the influence of reservoirs on river ecosystem, a multi-objective ecological operation model for reservoirs was established. Then, a novel approach was proposed to solve the multi-objective model, which combined a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm with the non-dominated solutions evaluation approach. MOPSO algorithm was introduced to generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, while the non-dominated solutions evaluation approach, based on k-means clustering and the information entropy method, was adopted to provide an alternative sequence for a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to the ecological operation of the reservoirs at the main stream of Xiuhe river in Poyang Lake basin in China. The results show that the proposed approach is able to offer the quantifiable benefits or costs among different objectives for the reservoir operators, and can provide a useful tool for decision makers to solve multi-objective water resources and hydrology problems.

This paper presents a method based on maximum entropy fuzzy clustering and a new interest points detecting method for human action recognition. Firstly, the interest points of the videos are detected by the new approach, and the 3D-SIFT features of the points are extracted, and then, the features of the training videos are clustered generating video words based on maximum entropy fuzzy clustering algorithm to construct the codebook. In the end, the histogram based on the codebook for every video is built, which is used to classify targets in the SVM multi-class classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the expression ability of the codebook and the efficiency of the recognition of human action.

Then coordinates of obtained featured points were used to calculate the affine transformation parameters to complete registration. The experiments indicate that the method used in this paper is simple, fast, and accurate.

The selection and use of sampling strategy is core of active learning. Most active learning methods select those uncertain or representative unlabeled samples to query their labels. And some of the active learning methods consider both in the query selection. However, the uncertainty sampling methods rely on the relative correctness or confidence of the current model and suffer from a lack of the feature space. The representative sampling methods avoid the drawbacks associated with uncertainty sampling, but tend not to improve the learning model very efficiently. The combining methods are lack of the consideration of sample redundancy. This paper proposes a multicriterion active learning technique for solving multiclass problems. First, use the Best-versus-Second-Best (BvSB) method to calculate the sample's uncertainty and then select the most valuable component to constitute the uncertain set; further, use the kernel k-means clustering algorithm and the resulting sample set is divided into h different clusters; finally, use Gaussian process to select the most informative sample in each cluster and submit to human experts for annotation. The results show that the labeling cost can be reduced without degrading the performance.

Based on the image superpixel structure, our method maps each superpixel to a vertex and the similarity between two superpixels to an edge, to form a graph structure which can be represented as an affinity matrix. Hyperedges can be generated by doing spectral clustering on this affinity graph. Similarity of superpixels can be defined by different feature, then multiple features can be used to generate the hyperedges, and finally construct a hypergraph. Our approach uses the brightness, color and edge features. Then we use normalized hypergraph cut algorithm and the K-means clustering method to obtain the final segmentation result. The method was evaluated in Berkeley Segmentation Database. Experimental results show that our method can give better segmentations for the natural images. The computational efficiency and robustness of the method was verified through a comparative analysis of some state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms.

In this paper, the problem is retrieving the document image having similar layout with query image. We propose a solution based on two algorithmic ideas. For unconstrained handwritten documents, the image is segmented into text lines using k-means clustering to build a minimum cost spanning tree (MST). Then, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is defined on the tree, the decoding sequence of which represents the layout structure. In this image retrieval system, the candidate images having the same decoding sequence with query image will be sorted by the Manhattan distance, and the nearest images are selected.

In this paper, a simple and effective human action recognition method is presented based on the key poses of human silhouette and the spatio-temporal feature. Firstly, the contour points of human silhouette have been gotten, and the key poses are learned by means of K-means clustering based on the Euclidean distance between each contour point and the centre point of the human silhouette, and then the type of each action is labeled for further match. Secondly, we obtain the trajectories of centre point of each frame, and create a spatio-temporal feature value represented by W to describe the motion direction and speed of each action. The value W contains the information of location and temporal order of each point on the trajectories. Finally, the matching stage is performed by comparing the key poses and W between training sequences and test sequences, the nearest neighbor sequences is found and its label supplied the final result. Experiments on the public available Weizmann datasets show the proposed method can improve accuracy by distinguishing amphibious poses and increase suitability for real-time applications by reducing the computational cost.

As an effective means for Earth observation, remote sensing technique has been widely applied in extracting land-cover information and in monitoring land-use and land-cover change, among which image classification becomes a key issue. Most existing studies about object-oriented classification use traditional low-level feature extraction methods or statistics of low-level features to represent objects in an image, which, to a large extent, loses the information in remote sensing images. Therefore, in order to facilitate better description of these objects in object-oriented classification, this paper introduces a state-of-the-art feature representation method called bag-of-visual-words (BOVW) to construct the middle-level representations instead of low-level features. Based on the idea of BOVW, this paper proposes a BOVW based framework for object-oriented land-cover classification. For a given remote sensing image, it first applies a pixel-level local feature extraction strategy to construct a visual vocabulary by K-means clustering with each cluster as a visual word. Then the image is segmented into objects and each object is represented as a histogram of visual word occurrences by mapping the local pixel-level features in this object to the learned visual words. Finally, the calculated histogram is considered as the final representation of an object which can be used for further classification tasks. Experimental results on a SPOT5 satellite image, acquired from the Changping County in Beijing, China, in 2002, show that the proposed method is superior to the traditional low-level feature based method in classification accuracy by about 2%.

In this algorithm, genetic k-means (GKM) with hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) is employed to improve the reconstruction of high-resolution (HR) images, and a pre-processing of classification in frequency is used to accelerate the procedure. Self-redundancy across different scales of a natural image is also utilized to build attached training set to expand example-based information. Meanwhile, a reconstruction algorithm based on hybrid supervise locally linear embedding (HSLLE) is proposed which uses training sets, high-resolution images and self-redundancy across different scales of a natural image. Experimental results show that patches are classified rapidly in training set processing session and the runtime of reconstruction is half of traditional algorithm at least in super-resolution session.

However, the computation time of these algorithms grows exponentially with the number of thresholds due to their exhaustive searching strategy. As a population-based optimization algorithm, differential algorithm (DE) uses a population of potential solutions and decision-making processes. It has shown considerable success in solving complex optimization problems within a reasonable time limit. Thus, applying this method into segmentation algorithm should be a good choice during to its fast computational ability. In this paper, we first propose a new differential algorithm with a balance strategy, which seeks a balance between the exploration of new regions and the exploitation of the already sampled regions. Then, we apply the new DE into the traditional Otsu's method to shorten the computation time. Experimental results of the new algorithm on a variety of images show that, compared with the EA-based thresholding methods, the proposed DE algorithm gets more effective and efficient results. It also shortens the computation time of the traditional Otsu method.

Specifically, sparse coding is widely used due to its intrinsic advantage. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous latent semantic sparse coding model. The central idea is to bridge heterogeneous modalities by capturing their common sparse latent semantic structure so that the learned visual dictionary is able to describe both the visual and textual properties of training data. Experiments on both image categorization and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our model shows superior performance over several recent methods such as K-means and Sparse Coding.

The traditional methods used for monitoring pollutants are generally relied on optical images. In this paper, we present a new approach based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images which we used to map the region of interest and to estimate the WQPs. To achieve this estimation quality, the texture analysis is exploited to improve the regression models. These models are established and developed to estimate six common concerned water quality parameters from texture parameters extracted from Terra SAR-X data. In this purpose, the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is used to estimate several regression models using six texture parameters such as contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, entropy and variance. For each predicted model, an accuracy value is computed from the probability value given by the regression analysis model of each parameter. In order to validate our approach, we have used tow dataset of water region for training and test process. To evaluate and validate the proposed model, we applied it on the training set. In the last stage, we used the fuzzy K-means clustering to generalize the water quality estimation on the whole of water region extracted from segmented Terra SAR-X image. Also, the obtained results showed that there are a good statistical correlation between the in situ water quality and Terra SAR-X data, and also demonstrated that the characteristics obtained by texture analysis are able to monitor and predicate the distribution of WQPs in large rivers with high accuracy.

The importance of different contributors in the process of manufacture is not the same when clustering, so the weight values of the parameters are considered. Retaining the best individuals and roulette are combined to decide which individuals are chose to crossover or mutation. Dynamic mutation operators are used here to decrease the speed of convergence. Two groups of data are used to make comparisons among the three algorithms, which suggest that the algorithm has overcome the problems of local optimum and low speed of convergence. The results show that it has a better clustering.

The other word, missing values are occurred when the customers rate to a few products or services, which bring about to less accuracy of the recommendation. Although the centroid of cluster and SVD are able to solve Sparsity problem, their drawbacks are 1) imputed mean is not derived from user preference and 2) imputed mean does not reflect to the real distribution since imputed mean comes from the average. Therefore, we propose "SVDUPMedianCF" in order to solve the defect of the traditional approach which is an imputation missing value by filling the missing values for each customer with the cluster centroid, obtained from K-means algorithm, of such customer along with singular value decomposition (SVD) in collaborative filtering. According to the experimental evaluation based on MovieLens dataset by using 5-fold cross validation, it has found that imputing missing values with the proposed model presents the lowest mean absolute error when comparison with traditional approach significantly. From the experimental result, the proposed model can improve the quality of recommendation results with significant difference (p<0.05).

Kinect with its Software Development Kit applications has enabled low-cost constructions of various benchmark data on humans. We devised multi-lingual instruction sheets on 25 expressions, collected data from 115 persons, and carefully inspected and labeled the outcome to construct the data. The benchmark data consist of 263,106 instances, each of which includes 6 animation units, 11 shape units, and an image file all provided by the application. Out of the 263,106 instances, we labeled 62,500 of them as 1 of the 25 expressions and investigated their clustering stabilities to the 17 features. We show that the most frequently used clustering algorithm: k-means achieves the average normal mutual information about 0.92 as an evidence of the stability of our facial expression data.

The motive of refinement using Evolutionary Algorithms is quite obvious because in any clustering algorithm the obtained clusters shall have some data items that are inappropriately clustered, hence, never giving us well separated and cohesive clusters. Hence the quality of clusters is improved using refinement techniques. Initial clusters are formed using K-Means clustering algorithm which suffers from local minima problem. The refinement on clusters is performed on the basis of access and time features (Modified Knockout Refinement Algorithm) which is a distance based dissimilarity, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a combination of MKRA with GA and MKRA with PSO. Results are evaluated on five synthetic datasets and three real datasets. Further, it is shown experimentally that effectiveness of combining MKRA with evolutionary techniques produces better quality clusters.

The clustering algorithm simulates the law of universal gravitation, which is that stars with heavy mass tend to show a stronger attraction to floating objects than those with less mass. Some experiments have done in this paper for this problem, and the results show that this algorithm can obtain better clustering result for this case.

As more and more enterprises and individuals applications are migrated into cloud platform, however, how to analyze the evidence of computer crime caused by malicious users is not a trivial question. In this paper, we conduct computer forensics based on particle swarm algorithm combining fuzzy k-means clustering. Specifically, the data analysis is the key link of computer forensics. Given a set of application logs, we use particle swarm algorithm to cluster users' actions into different classes. The extensive experiments present the practicality of the proposed mechanism with low computation overhead. Also low false positives and false negatives are demonstrated.

So how to detect the outlier in financial time series effectively is of great significance. This paper is based on the clustering of the outlier detection by the idea, and put forward an improved K-MEANS clustering algorithm. The main feature of the improved algorithm is to use the idea of the clustering of the outlier detection, this algorithm used the inherent disadvantage of the K-MEANS algorithm which is easy to fall into the local extrema. So we changed clusters k and made clusters K=10k. Then we let K decrease to k in a certain step size, In this process, we had repeated the cycle to identify the outlier, so that we could ensure this algorithm will not always fall into the local extrema. In this paper, on the closing price of the Shanghai Composite Index and China International Trade Stock and macroeconomic information empirical analysis, we prove that the method is feasible and effective.

It enables one to group the similar documents using keywords or terms of the clusters. Thus document clustering can be used to group and categorize document databases, as well as providing useful summary information of the categories for browsing purposes. Most of traditional approaches can directly be applied to English language without preprocessing. However, when applying clustering techniques to non-segmented languages, the challenge Is to identify keywords or terms before clustering. Subsequently, there are two main phases in the non-segmented document clustering method: preprocessing phase and clustering phase. The aim of this paper is to study and compare two clustering techniques for non-segmented languages: Self-organizing map (SOM) and K-means as they are two classical methods and well known in the area of text clustering.

This includes the utilization of optimization algorithms that mimics the behavior of insects or animals. This paper presents an experiment on document clustering utilizing the Gravitation Firefly algorithm (GFA). The advantage of GFA is that clustering can be performed without a pre-defined value of k clusters. GFA determines the center of clusters by identifying documents with high force. Upon identification of the centers, clusters are created based on cosine similarity measurement. Experimental results demonstrated that GFA utilizing a random positioning of documents outperforms existing clustering algorithm such as Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means.

A novel image quality vocabulary is firstly obtained by the contrast features computed from the training images using K-means. Probabilistic latent semantic analysis model is then used to discover quality aware topics that are latent in clear sample images and the test image. The similarity between the latent topics of the test image and the average topics of clear images is finally computed to measure blurriness. Experimental results show that the proposed blur metric is monotonic, robust to additive noises, and also consistent with the human visual system.

Then we applied K-means clustering algorithm to divide the feature space into 2 classes: going straight and turning. After that, we used supervised learning algorithm to analyze these labeled data and build a model to recognize vehicle moving state. The experimental results showed that the model built in this way has good generalization. Based on the above research achievement, we designed and implemented a vehicle moving state recognition learning system for dynamic in-car navigation systems and applied this learning system to the map-matching field. The improved map-matching algorithm was tested on a complex urban road network and the result showed that the new algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the junction match.

In this paper, we prove that when the content-generating server is comprised of a mixture of parametric sources, label-based clustering of the data to their original sequence-generating models from the mixture is optimal almost surely as it achieves the mixture entropy (which is the lower bound on the average codeword length). Motivated by this result, we present a K-means clustering technique as the proof of concept to demonstrate the benefits of memory-assisted compression performance. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach by matching the expected improvements predicted by theory on man-made mixture sources. Finally, the benefits of the cluster-based memory-assisted compression are validated on real data traffic traces demonstrating more than 50% traffic reduction on average in data gathered from wireless users.

Cognitive Radio Network can enable the sharing of channels among unlicensed and licensed users on a non-interference basis. An unlicensed user (i.e., secondary user) should monitor for the presence of a licensed user (i.e., primary user) to avoid interfering with a primary user. However to get more gain, an attacker also called selfish secondary user may copy a primary user's signal to cheat other secondary users. Therefore a primary user detection method is needed to detect the difference between a primary user's signal and secondary user's signal. In this paper, unsupervised learning methods such as K-means and SOM techniques are used to classify the signals and also measure the performance parameters such as throughput, end-to-end delay, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and collision rate of the channel.

In silhouette based gait recognition approach, the presence of incomplete and noisy silhouettes has a direct impact on recognition performance. Using blob detection, initially the incomplete silhouettes are identified. Fusion of frame difference energy image with dominant energy image of a silhouette along with a morphological filter output, preserve the kinetic and kinematic information to make incomplete silhouette into a high quality and a complete silhouette. The results prove that the resultant silhouettes are well suited for human gait recognition algorithm with improved variance. The silhouette database is taken from CASIA database.

We have constructed a system that uses clustering techniques and tool catalog data to support the determination of drilling conditions for printed wiring boards (PWBs). Variable cluster analysis and the K-means method were used together to identify tool shape parameters that have a linear relationship with the drilling conditions listed in the catalogs. The response surface method and significant tool shape parameters obtained by clustering were used to derive drilling condition decision equations, which were used to determine the indicative drilling conditions for PWBs. Comparison of the conditions recommended by toolmakers demonstrated that our proposed system can be used to determine the drilling condition for PWBs.

Many clustering algorithms such as K-means and some types of hierarchical clustering need a number of centroids representing the 'center' of the clusters. The choice of centroids for the initial clusters often plays an important role in the quality of the clusters. Since a data point with a high centrality supposedly lies close to the 'center' of some cluster, this can be used to assign centroids rather than through some other method such as picking them at random. Some work have been done to evaluate the use of centrality measures such as degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality in clustering algorithms. The aim of this article is to compare and evaluate the usefulness of a number of common centrality measures such as the above mentioned and others such as PageRank and related measures.

This paper gave a weighted K-means algorithm and introduced weighted K-means algorithm into social networks. Traditional k-means and most k-means variants are still computationally expensive for large datasets, however, the weighted K-means algorithm is to reduce the initial cluster centers blindness and randomness by eliminating noise point and narrowing the range of k values. Experiments datasets show that the weighted K-means algorithm significantly enhances the clustering quality. Therefore, the weighted K-means algorithm is effective and suitable for the social network. Algorithm's error rate is smaller and accuracy is higher than that of traditional k-means algorithm.

The purpose of this paper is to propose an improved, efficient methodology to handle such a challenge. Design/methodology/approach - According to the fact that the inner-class distance among samples within the same cluster is supposed to be smaller than the inter-class distance among clusters, the algorithm will dynamically adjust initial cluster centers that are randomly selected. Consequently, such adjusted initial cluster centers will be highly representative in the sense that they are distributed among as many samples as possible. As a result, local optima that are common in K-means clustering can then be effectively reduced. In addition, the algorithm is able to obtain all initial cluster centers simultaneously (instead of one center at a time) during the dynamic adjustment. Findings - Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of traditional K-means clustering results and, in a more efficient manner. Originality/value - The authors presented in this paper an efficient algorithm, which is able to dynamically adjust initial cluster centers that are randomly selected. The adjusted centers are highly representative, i. e. they are distributed among as many samples as possible. As a result, local optima that are common in K-means clustering can be effectively reduced so that the authors can achieve an improved clustering accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is a cost-efficient one and the enhanced clustering accuracy can be obtained in a more efficient manner compared with traditional K-means algorithm.

This paper investigates uncertainty-based optimal operation of a multi-purpose water reservoir system by using four optimization models. The models include dynamic programming (DP), stochastic DP (SDP) with inflow classification (SDP/Class), SDP with inflow scenarios (SDP/Scenario), and sampling SDP (SSDP) with historical scenarios (SSDP/Hist). The performance of the models was tested in Zayandeh-Rud Reservoir system in Iran by evaluating how their release policies perform in a simulation phase. While the SDP approaches were better than the DP approach, the SSDP/Hist model outperformed the other SDP models. We also assessed the effect of ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) that were generated by artificial neural networks on the performance of SSDP/Hist. Application of the models to the Zayandeh-Rud case study demonstrated that SSDP in combination with ESPs and the K-means technique, which was used to cluster a large number of ESPs, could be a promising approach for real-time reservoir operation.

Due to the fact that all of the image data is given to clustering algorithms, generally the clustering process takes a lot of time, and it causes delays in real-time segmentation applications. In this study, in order to minimize the delays, the dividing of images into the sub-blocks, and using the average values of sub-blocks for the clustering process are proposed. As a result, the size of clustering data is relatively decreased. In the experimental studies, besides the images of travertine plates, well-known images such as "Lena" and "Baboon" were also used. The proposed method was compared with K-means, Fuzzy C-means, K-medoids and Spectral clustering methods, and its speed increased 2-4 times. Furthermore, it was observed that the image quality did not change too much in case of small size of blocks.

An edge detection algorithm based on level set combined with clustering idea is proposed as there were no significant differences between target area and background, and each cotton fiber has one lumen. Firstly, the small region is obtained by binarization algorithm, and the outer contour is got by level set algorithm based on it. Then combined the fiber's outer contour with OSTU, and the rough edge of the fiber is appeared after the burr and broken edge are eliminated. And the seed area of the fiber is emerged by using flooding algorithm and dilation algorithm. Finally, the adherence separation algorithm found on clustering idea is applied to gain the separated fibers. The experimental results show that this algorithm can not only ensure the integrity and the continuity of the fiber's edge, but also segment each fiber rapidly and reliably.

Side-channel attacks on secret exponents are typically bound to the leakage of single executions due to cryptographic protocols or side-channel countermeasures such as blinding. We propose for the first time, to use a well-established class of algorithms, i.e. unsupervised cluster classification algorithms such as the k-means algorithm to attack cryptographic exponentiations and recover secret exponents without any prior profiling, manual tuning or leakage models. Not requiring profiling is of significant advantage to attackers, as are well-established algorithms. The proposed non-profiled single-execution attack is able to exploit any available single-execution leakage and provides a straight-forward option to combine simultaneous measurements to increase the available leakage. We present empirical results from attacking an FPGA-based elliptic curve scalar multiplication using the k-means clustering algorithm and successfully exploit location-based leakage from high-resolution electromagnetic field measurements to achieve a low remaining brute-force complexity of the secret exponent. A simulated multi-channel measurement even enables an error-free recovery of the exponent.

They provide valuable insights into genome-wide dynamic aspects of gene regulations. We focus on gene clustering analysis in this paper. We explore a nonparametric Bayesian method for constructing clusters in functional space from the characteristics of gene profiles. In particular, we model each gene profile using a B-spline basis. So each gene is characterized by the basis coefficients of the spline fitting. Then we place a Dirichlet process prior on the basis coefficients to determine clusters of the genes. We essentially construct a hierarchical Dirichlet processes mixing model that assigns genes into the same cluster if they share the same latent basis coefficients. A simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed method to the K-means clustering method, a model-based clustering method (MCLUST), and a two-stage version of them in terms of the adjusted Rand index. We show our new method has better adjusted Rand index number among all these methods.

Gene clustering is to find out groups of genes similarly expressed in large size of microarray data. Meanwhile, recent development of microarray technology generates a very large number of microarray data with low cost and handles more than 10,000 genes simultaneously in one chip. Thus, high performance computing of gene clustering has become increasingly important in microarray data analysis. In this paper, we propose a scalable parallel gene clustering method using the MapReudce programming model. The proposed method utilizes the k-means algorithm for identifying similar groups of genes. Experiment results show that the proposed method can offer good scalability with data size increases, and different numbers of nodes, and it can also provide effective clustering results against real microarray data.

Ice conditions are important for the analysis of ice-structure interaction in an ice field. To monitor sea-ice conditions, cameras are used as field observation sensors on mobile sensor platforms in Arctic. Various image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding, k-means clustering, distance transform, Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) Snake, mathematical morphology, are then applied to obtain ice concentration, ice types, and floe size distribution from sea-ice images to ensure safe operations of structures in ice covered regions. Those techniques yield acceptable results, and their effectiveness are demonstrated in case studies.

Process Model Accuracy Enhancement Using Cluster Based Approach	PHYSICS OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES	Environmental Science and Engineering	Environmental Engineering	English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on the Physics of Semiconductor Devices (IWPSD)	DEC 10-14, 2013	Noida, INDIA	Amity Univ		Compact model; resist model; K-means clustering; and lithography simulation		Full chip resist simulation is a critical step in the lithography simulation of advanced CMOS technology nodes. The semi-empirical compact models (such as compact model 1, also known as CM!) are generally used in the semiconductor industries for resist simulation since the physical models are computationally expensive. The CM1 model considers physical effects of the resist process and uses a constant threshold on a two dimensional resist surface to extract the critical dimension (CD). However, the required threshold for different samples may vary over a range and therefore a constant threshold value may not hit an optimal solution for all the samples. In this paper, we propose a clustering based approach to enhance the accuracy of CM1 model and resist simulation. In this proposed approach, various attributes of the lithographic samples such as aerial image and pattern density are used to bin the samples into different groups (clusters). The CM1 model is then used to calibrate parameters individually for each group. This approach is verified by doing the resist simulation on one of the layers of 14nm CMOS technology and the results show good improvement in model accuracy.

Dermatologists use manual methods such as direct visual assessment and ordinary flash photography to assess the acne. However, these manual methods are time consuming and may result in intra-observer and inter-observer variations, even by experienced dermatologists. The objective of this research is to develop a computational imaging method for automated acne grading. The first step in the proposed method is pre-processing which involves lighting compensation. The CIE La*b* color space is used to measure any dissimilarity between skin colors. Acne segmentation has been performed using automated modified K-means clustering algorithm and support vector machines (SVM) classifier. Color and diameter are the main features extracted to classify acne blobs into different acne classes; papule, pustule, nodule or cyst. Finally, the severity level is determined such as mild, moderate, severe and very severe.

The system comprises a commercially available radar, a GPS, and heading sensor that communicate to a central node that runs algorithms for shore estimation. In particular, to extract and deliver the radar information, a dedicated FPGA-based unit was implemented to interface with the radar internal signaling and to deliver the processed information to the main computer. In the central node, a novel mathematical model based on projection of parametric ellipsoids is programmed such that the shore estimation can be used without any geographical restriction. The estimation model uses a K-means algorithm to segment the sample data and applies a biased estimator to reduce the error of the output. The proposed system performance is validated using official geographical information showing that in fact a tradeoff between accuracy and cost is possible while maintaining acceptable shore estimation.

S	Elguebaly, T; Bouguila, N		Bouchachia, A		Elguebaly, Tarek; Bouguila, Nizar			A Novel Method for Scene Categorization Using an Improved Visual Vocabulary Approach	ADAPTIVE AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, ICAIS 2014	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Adaptive and Intelligent Systems (ICAIS)	SEP 08-10, 2014	Bournemouth, ENGLAND	IEEE Computat Soc, Int Neural Networks Soc, Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Comp			CLASSIFICATION	The performance of any scene categorization system depends on the scene representation algorithm used. Lately, the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) approach has indisputably become the method of choice for this crucial task. Nevertheless, the BoVW approach has various flaws. First, the K-means clustering algorithm for visual dictionary creation is based solely on the Euclidean distance. Second, the size of the visual vocabulary is a user-supplied parameter which is unpractical as the final categorization depends critically on the chosen number of visual words. Finally, classifying each descriptor to only one visual word is unrealistic because it does not consider the uncertainty present in the image descriptor level. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple solution for these problems. Our algorithm uses the Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian mixture (AGGM) to model the distribution of the visual words. Our choice is based on the fact that the Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian distribution (AGGD) can fit different shapes of observed non-Gaussian and asymmetric data. To automatically determine the number of visual words, the number of mixture components in our case, we employed the Minimum Message length (MML) criterion. We propose to use a soft assignment by exploiting the probability for each descriptor to belong to each visual word and thus considering the uncertainty present in the image descriptor level. In addition, the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated by applying it to scene categorization.

NEW ALGORITHM FOR CLUSTERING DISTRIBUTED DATA USING K-MEANS	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data privacy; decomposable algorithm; k-means clustering; vertically and horizontally distributed data	PARTITIONED DATA; COMPUTATIONS; CLASSIFIER; AGENTS	The internet era and high speed networks have ushered in the capabilities to have ready access to large amounts of geographically distributed data. Individuals, businesses, and governments recognize the value of this available resource to those who can transform the data into information. These databases, though valuable as individual entities, become significantly more valuable when they function as parts of a federated database and their data can be aggregated for collective mining or computations. This requires new algorithms to shift-their focus from working with single databases to efficiently working with federated databases. In this paper, we propose a new decomposable version of the popular k-means clustering algorithm that works in this desired manner with a set of networked databases. We show that it is possible to perform global computation in a reasonably secure manner for either horizontally or vertically distributed databases. The computation is completed by only exchanging a few local summaries among the databases. An empirical and analytical validation of our results is also presented.

Due to the translation-invariant property, signals appearing at arbitrary locations in time have similar representations in feature space. Classification is carried out by a condensed k-Nearest-Neighbors classifier trained on these features, i.e. the training set is reduced for faster classification. This reduction is conducted by a k-means clustering of the original training set and using the obtained cluster centers as a new training set. The coreset-technique BICO is employed to accelerate this initial clustering for big datasets. The resulting feature extraction and classification pipeline is applied successfully in the context of biological virus detection. Data from Plasmon Assisted Microscopy of Nano-size Objects (PAMONO) is classified, achieving accuracy 0.999 for the most important classification task.

There is no a perfect solution for skin detection, since this process is a compromise on speed, simplicity and precision (detection quality). There are many different techniques for skin detection modeling ranging from simple models based on one or several thresholds to advanced models based on neural network, Bayesian classifier, maximum entropy, k-means clustering, etc. This paper proposes a simple model, based on ratios of red, green and blue components of the RGB color model. It describes how to make a compromise in a skin detection modeling by using three levels of rules. Data analysis that supports conclusions is performed on the dataset from Universidad de Chile (UChile, dbskin2 - complete set) that contains 103 images and their annotations.

Our approach is able to extract information (models) from these sensors that is relevant for performing fault diagnosis of these sensors. Such a situation involving large number of correlated sensors is encountered in large core nuclear reactors, for example. Since fault diagnosis methods are computationally intensive, it is helpful to organize the sensors into groups such that strongly correlated sensors belong to the same group. However, the groups/clusters need to be reorganized depending on operating conditions. We propose an adaptive method that is scalable to a large number of sensors and can adapt to changing operating conditions. Also, within each cluster, it is often required to adaptively rebuild new models/relations for sensors inside that cluster. We use the k-means algorithm for obtaining clusters and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for finding relations between the sensors within a cluster. We demonstrate that significant speedup is achieved by parallelizing the various aspects of the above computation. A key requirement in managing a large number of sensors is the data and processing management. We demonstrate and compare a serial and parallel implementation of this method using SQLite for database management, Python for numerical computations, the Pycluster module for clustering and the Python multiprocessing module for code parallelization. The method is demonstrated for the above nuclear reactor application: with 140 sensors and 14,000 measurements for each sensor. The method turns out to scale very easily to such a large number. The implementation codes of our approach have been made available online. The utilized packages all being open source (FOSS) helps in the use of these codes in various safety critical applications which typically require complete verification/ratification. The cost saved due to the FOSS aspect of our implementation is another advantage.	[Pawar, Nahit; Belur, M.

Fault diagnosis may be interpreted as a classification problem; therefore artificial intelligence-based classifiers can be efficiently used to classify normal and faulty machine conditions. K-means clustering is one of the methods applied for this purpose. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method is proposed by applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to overcome the drawback of K-means which it may be get stuck in local optima. For this purpose, the best solution of GA is chosen to be the initial point for K-means clustering. The proposed method is used in fault diagnosis of the scaled rotor-bearing system experimentally. Then the result of hybrid GA-K-means clustering is compared with classic K-means clustering.	[Ettefagh, M. M.; Asr, M.

We are interested in merging solutions from different grouping algorithms, distilling all their good qualities into a consensus solution. In this paper, we propose a biclustering framework and perspective for reaching consensus in such grouping problems. In particular, this is the first time that the task of finding/fitting multiple parametric models to a dataset is formally posed as a consensus problem. We highlight the equivalence of these tasks and establish the connection with the computational Gestalt program, which seeks to provide a psychologically inspired detection theory for visual events. We also present a simple but powerful biclustering algorithm, specially tuned to the nature of the problem we address, though general enough to handle many different instances inscribed within our characterization. The presentation is accompanied with diverse and extensive experimental results in clustering, community detection, and multiple parametric model estimation in image processing applications.

The proposed methods are capable of capturing high-quality hand models without being affected by external influences, such as changes in lighting or complex backgrounds. The proposed system is based on the offline construction of databases comprising skin color and non-skin color samples. The means and standard deviations of these samples respectively serve as the initial cluster centers of the K-means classifier and the screening radii. In this way, we were able to accelerate the speed of convergence in the classification of clusters to enhance the accuracy of hand model images. The circular sweeping method and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm are used to detect fingertips after the edges of hand image are established. The robustness of the proposed method was experimentally verified in terms of the skin recovery rate and the accuracy of fingertip detection, which remained effective despite variations in skin color and the complexity of the background.

Based on the basic principles of IDA and the features of datasets that IDA handles, the development of IDA is briefly summarized from three aspects, i.e., algorithm principle, the scale and type of the dataset. Moreover, the challenges facing the IDA in big data environment are analyzed from four views, including big data management, data collection, data analysis, and application pattern. It is also cleared that in order to extract more values from data, the further development of IDA should combine practical applications and theoretical researches together.

Lip Contour Extraction Scheme Based on K-means Clustering in Different Color Planes	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS, ELECTRONICS & VISION (ICIEV)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)	MAY 23-24, 2014	Dhaka, BANGLADESH		Univ Dhaka	K-means clustering; RGB color space; weighted color plane; lip contour; lip detection; curve fitting	SEGMENTATION	In this paper, an efficient lip contour extraction scheme is proposed. From a given video frame, first the mouth region is extracted by using pixel threshold based binary conversion and detection of largest object in that region. Analysing the variation of pixel intensity pattern of RGB and a weighted colour plane, intensity ratio based lip region detection is performed, which provides accurate estimate of separate upper and lower lip regions. At the first stage, k-means classification is employed after obtaining feature value from green colour plane for the upper part of the lip region. In the second stage, the weighted colour plane with excellent lip distinguishing capability along with k-means classification is employed to detect the lower lip region. Because of critical shape of the upper lip, a piecewise curve fitting process is employed, where smoothing operation is performed on the outer contour by taking four consecutive pixels and fitting them in polynomials of certain order. From extensive experimentation on several real-life images from audio-visual clips, it is found that the proposed method offers high level of accuracy in image.	[Rahman, F.

A Non-hierarchical Approach of Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Enhanced Wavelet Coefficients and K-means Clustering	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS, ELECTRONICS & VISION (ICIEV)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)	MAY 23-24, 2014	Dhaka, BANGLADESH		Univ Dhaka	Wavelet; Teager Energy; Entropy; Euclidean Distance; K-means; Speaker-independent; non-hierarchical		This paper represents a non-hierarchical speech Emotion Recognition method, where the speaker-independent emotional features are extracted from the Teager energy (TE) operated wavelet coefficients of speech signal. The detail as well as approximate Wavelet coefficients enhanced by TE operation is used to determine entropy. Entropy values of TE operated detail and approximate wavelet coefficients downsize the feature dimension. The reduced feature vector thus formed is found effective for distinguishing different emotions when fed to a K-means clustering method in a non-hierarchical process. Detail simulations are carried out on EMO-DB German speech emotion database containing four class emotions, such as angry, happy, sad and neutral. Simulation results show that the proposed emotion recognition method provides better four-class emotion recognition performance through its attribute of speaker independence with lesser computation in comparison to a state-of the-art method.

One important issue in network virtualization is the problem of real-time monitoring of resource usage information. In this paper we investigate a novel method for clustering virtual resources inspired by the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. Then a clustering algorithm extending the k-means method with the isometric feature mapping (Isomap) is used to analyze the relationships of substrate nodes and links in different time slots. By replacing the classical Euclidean distance with the geodesic distance, we can preserve the intrinsic geometry of the high-dimensional data and discover the regularities and irregularities in the substrate network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can classify the real-time states of virtual resources and provide accurate VN mapping guidance and resource management.

The research work here is focused on the study of various approaches for transformation large data into smaller datasets in effective manner so that accurate classification could be performed. Data clustering is a machine learning approach which divides dataset into smaller partitions and having higher intra partition similarity within it and dissimilarity among different partitions. Many clustering algorithm exists for varying nature of dataset and own their advantages as well as limitations as per nature of individual datasets thus there is sufficient scope to explore efficient and new algorithm for clustering based classification. This paper presents a new approach for centroid selection in k-mean algorithm for health datasets which gives better clustering results in comparison to traditional k-mean algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated against tuberculosis dataset and then results are applied to classifier for performance evaluation and results show improvement over previous algorithm.

The monthly practical statistics which were obligatedly submitted to administration by each B&B and hotel were collected in this study. Three housing performance indexes, including the room sold ratio, averaged room price, and averaged productivity per employee, were calculated and analyzed. The statistical procedures, including correlation analysis, K-Means clustering, MANOVA analysis and MDS as well, were respectively conducted to explore the correlation of dependent variables within B&B and two kinds of hotel, classify each accommodation object into one cluster based on relative similarity, test the hypothesis of heterogeneous means existing in factors or clusters, and finally reduce the dimensionality in order to have better and easier visible interpretation.

It has been used in many studies for tumor classification and of identification of marker genes associated with cancer. However, this technique often suffers the 'curse of dimensionality'. A general approach to overcome this setback is to perform feature selection technique prior to classification. Biomarkers have long been used for the prognosis and diagnosis of different types of diseases. The need for new and more specific biomarkers for leukemia arises. In this study gene selection was approached first using gene filtering by determining the expressions inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of the genes and determining whether or not they are differentially expressed across the different sample types by using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA). Filtered genes were then subjected to k-means clustering algorithm to identify candidate genes that can be used to discriminate the four main types of leukemia (ALL, AML, CLL, CML) and non-leukemia (NoL) bone marrow samples. The selected genes were then used to build classification models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms. Forty samples were used to build the models and 20 samples were used to assess the models performance. A minimum of 6 genes was found to be needed to correctly classify all samples in the training dataset into the five categories and to classify the samples in the validation dataset with high accuracy.

This research employed k-means clustering to group 50 low and very low income households into three clusters (Poorest, Average and Richest) based on mean indoor temperature, surface area of the dwelling, number of rooms, family size, building age and income. The Poorest Cluster contained 9 households that had an annual income of 2133 euros, had the smallest families, occupied less surface area with fewer rooms, lived in older buildings, used less central heating and had the lowest average indoor temperature. The Richest Cluster contained 20 large families that had an average annual income of 11850 euros, occupied a larger surface area, had more rooms and lived in newer buildings with more heating autonomy. Finally, 7.6% of the households of the Richest Cluster, 8.6% of the Average Cluster and 11.6% of the Poorest Cluster were fuel poor. Findings show that the lowest income households live in dire economic conditions and underscore the need to address fuel poverty via targeted measures.

J	Baya, C			IOP	Baya, Chalabi			Implementation of a solution Cloud Computing with Map Reduce model	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SYMPOSIUM 2013 (HPCS 2013)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	High Performance Computing Symposium (HPCS)	JUN 02-06, 2013	Ottawa, CANADA					In recent years, large scale computer systems have emerged to meet the demands of high storage, supercomputing, and applications using very large data sets. The emergence of Cloud Computing offers the potentiel for analysis and processing of large data sets. Mapreduce is the most popular programming model which is used to support the development of such applications. It was initially designed by Google for building large datacenters on a large scale, to provide Web search services with rapid response and high availability. In this paper we will test the clustering algorithm K-means Clustering in a Cloud Computing. This algorithm is implemented on MapReduce. It has been chosen for its characteristics that are representative of many iterative data analysis algorithms. Then, we modify the framework CloudSim to simulate the MapReduce execution of K-means Clustering on different Cloud Computing, depending on their size and characteristics of target platforms. The experiment show that the implementation of K-means Clustering gives good results especially for large data set and the Cloud infrastructure has an influence on these results.

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that motivation to work is a phenomenon whose nature is different among subsequent employees not only in terms of its general level, but also internal structure, and checking whether among various possible structures of motivation there is repeatability which could prove the existence of specific regularities and enabling possible classification of employees. Reasoning with regard to internal structure of motivation was conducted on the basis of the designated 14 variables expressing it, which included both internal factors (feelings) and external (actions), both positive and negative in its meaning. The conducted research consisted in segmentation of the surveyed employees using the generalized method of k-means, in order to separate groups with the same subsequent intensity profiles, so designated variables. By way of research, live various groups of employees were found. Each has a unique, different profile of motivation, at the same time, in each of them a different satisfaction level of the employed was observed. The analysis leads to a conclusion that the motivation profile itself is not completely connected with the perceived satisfaction with work. While signs of motivation positive in nature are usually stronger among satisfied employees, and the weaker among dissatisfied ones, we cannot speak about a similar regularity when it comes to factors of negative nature. Furthermore, the presented research shows that within negative factors, larger intensification can be observed among ones of internal nature, while among these of external nature it is smaller.

In the proposed approach, an ensemble neural network is created by using a layered k-means clustering and fusion by majority voting. This approach is designed to improve the classification accuracy of roadside images into different objects like road, sky and signs. A set of images obtained from Transport and Main Roads Queensland is used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results obtained from experiments using proposed approach indicate that the new approach is better than the existing approaches for segmentation and classification of roadside images.

We, however, believe that the different types of user behavior are not known a priori and depend on the ontology engineering project. The detection of such user profiles based on unsupervised learning allows finding roles and responsibilities along peers in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we present a method for automatic detection of user profiles in a collaborative ontology engineering environment by means of the K-means clustering algorithm only by looking at the type of interactions a user makes. In this paper we use the GOSPL ontology engineering tool and method to demonstrate this method. The data used to demonstrate the method stems from two ontology engineering projects involving respectively 42 and 36 users.

The results show that k-NN, ANN and SVM were the most efficient method according to test processing of both DWT and AR as feature extraction for recognition of epileptic seizures in EEG.

Numerous countries are responding to the rapid development of radio frequency identification device (RFID) applications by actively pursuing and protecting RFID innovations. This study examines numerous patent indicators to predict and explain future technological developments in the RFID industry, thereby providing insights for economic planning at the national scale. Patent indicators, such as the number of patent applications and Patent Cooperation Treaties (PCTs), have been used to analyze technological development trends in the context of overall development in Europe, Asia, and the United States and identify valuable technological development directions. The distributions of RFID patents were then used along with the revealed patent advantage (RPA) index to conduct cluster analysis of the K-means, thus providing insight into relative regional technological advantages in RFID development. Finally, this paper discusses the future creative value and development direction of the Taiwanese market.

Due to the priori knowledge among participants, several team building constraints can be formed. For example, it might be required to place participants from the same organization in the same group. In this research, we consider the cooperative team building as a constrained clustering problem. Clustering algorithms equipped with instance level must-link (ML) and cannon-link (CT) constraints are known to improve the efficiency and accuracy on handling data clustering. This paper presents the result of applying the constrained clustering algorithm to accommodate the complete must-link (CML) constraints, a special case of ML constraints, in which all participants should be pre-grouped with other members. The result shows the CML clustering can be used to group teams by pre-group requirements with promising computational performance.

Although traditional Single-Pass algorithm and K-means algorithm each has shortcomings, they are widely used in clustering analysis because of their relatively simple principles and fast computing speed. This paper firstly describes the overall flow of the entire topic of detection, then we make a comparison between Single-Pass algorithm and K-means algorithm. In order to verify the comparison, finally, an experiment is designed. The result shows that Single-Pass algorithm is better than K-means algorithm in Web topic detection.

K-means algorithm is a simple and easy clustering method which can efficiently separate a huge number of continuous numerical data with high-dimensions. Moreover, the data in each cluster are similar to one another. However, it is vulnerable to outliers and noisy data, and it spends much executive time in partitioning data too. Noisy data, outliers, and the data with quite different values in one cluster may reduce the accuracy rate of data clustering since the cluster center cannot precisely describe the data in the cluster. In this paper, a bi-level K-means algorithm is hence provided to solve the problems mentioned above. The bi-level K-means algorithm can give an expressive experimental results.

The clustering is computed over the histogram rather than on the full list of intensity levels. Our implementation runs in linear time per iteration proportional to the number of bins of the histogram, not depending on the size of the image nor on the number of clusters/levels as in a traditional implementation. Therefore, it is possible to get a large speedup when the number of bins of the histogram is significantly shorter than the number of pixels. In order to achieve that running time, two restrictions were exploited in our implementation: (I) we target only grayscale images and (II) thresholding does not use spatial information.

The Bag-of-Words model is a representation method very used in action classification techniques. In this work we propose an approach based on mid-level features representation for human action description. First, an optimal vocabulary is created without a preliminary number of visual words, which is a known problem of the K-means method. We introduce a graph-based video representation using the interest points relationships, in order to take into account the spatial and temporal layout. Finally, a second visual vocabulary based on n-grams is used for classification. This combines the representational power of graphs with the efficiency of the bag-of-words representation. The representation method was tested on the KTH dataset using STIP and MoSIFT descriptors and multi-class SVM with a chi-square kernel. The experimental results show that our approach using STIP descriptor outperforms the best results of state-of-art, meanwhile using MoSIFT descriptor are comparable to them.

In order to analyze the gene expression data, fuzzy clustering algorithms are widely used. However, common clustering algorithms do not provide a comprehensive approach that look into the three categories of annotations; biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, and were not tested with different functional annotation database formats. Furthermore, the common clustering algorithms do not provide the information of dominant gene among the clusters. In this paper, we present a new computational framework for clustering gene expression data. From this experiment, we can conclude that our framework capable of determining the dominant gene and also predict the unknown genes.

In the proposed framework, co-occurrence and spatial relationship based features are developed to improve the categorization problem of the objects with high intra-class variation, deformable objects or the objects that are occluded. The descriptor in this framework is based on a co-occurrence of objects and hand poses, a relative position between objects and face, an object motion, and an object appearance. For co-occurrence based features, hand pose prototypes are generated by using K-means clustering. The co-occurrence vectors between objects and hand poses are observed from image frames and used as features. For spatial relationship based features, the histogram of relative positions between object and face and histogram of object motion vectors are applied. The evaluation is performed on six classes of objects in 180 videos. The proposed framework can improve the recognition rate by 30.1% in comparison with the object appearance baseline.

These techniques are proving much more effective to overcome the limitations of the traditional in-vitro experiments on the constantly increasing sequence data. However, most critical problems that caught the attention of the researchers may include, but not limited to these: accurate structure and function prediction of unknown proteins, protein subcellular localization prediction, finding protein-protein interactions, protein fold recognition, analysis of microarray gene expression data, etc. To solve these problems, various classification and clustering techniques using machine learning have been extensively used in the published literature. These techniques include neural network algorithms, genetic algorithms, fuzzy ARTMAP, K-Means, K-NN, SVM, Rough set classifiers, decision tree and HMM based algorithms. Major difficulties in applying the above algorithms include the limitations found in the previous feature encoding and selection methods while extracting the best features, increasing classification accuracy and decreasing the running time overheads of the learning algorithms. The application of this research would be potentially useful in the drug design and in the diagnosis of some diseases. This paper presents a concise overview of the well-known protein classification techniques.

Fabric could be discriminated to categories on the basis of material mechanical properties and matched reasonable sewing processing parameters. This paper explores the relationship between the fabric mechanical properties and fabric styles, properties influencing the sewing quality, and fabric clustering analysis methods, as well as the dimension methods of the mechanics performance indicators. Applying the factor analysis to the fabric mechanical performance indexes in dimension reduction, the common factors that are obtained would have clearer practical significance. K-means clustering was utilized to obtain fabrics clustering analysis, and mixed-F statistics was used to determine the optimal class number.

This data is very useful in making valuable medical decisions. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools to discover hidden relationships in data. The objective of this research is to mine the historical unstructured data of heart patients and to extract significant features and patterns. This work is based on a large amount of unstructured data in the form of patients medical reports collected from a renowned cardiac hospital in Pakistan. Firstly data preparation is done in which the unstructured (textual) data of heart patients is converted to structured (tabular) form and then pre-processed to make it suitable to apply different data mining techniques. After data preprocessing, unsupervised learning strategy is used in which K-Means clustering technique is applied to find out clusters in data which are further used to extract hidden patterns related to heart patients. These patterns can then be used for heart condition prediction besides helping medical practitioners in making intelligent verdicts. Finally, performance evaluation of k-Means with other clustering algorithms is done and results are compared.

Large-scale 3-D modeling by integration of resistivity models and borehole data through inversion	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LATERALLY CONSTRAINED INVERSION; NEAR-SURFACE; ELECTROMAGNETIC DATA; GEOPHYSICAL-DATA; WATER MODEL; SHALY SANDS; SUBSURFACE; CONDUCTIVITY; SIMULATION; COMPLEX	We present an automatic method for parameterization of a 3-D model of the subsurface, integrating lithological information from boreholes with resistivity models through an inverse optimization, with the objective of further detailing of geological models, or as direct input into groundwater models. The parameter of interest is the clay fraction, expressed as the relative length of clay units in a depth interval. The clay fraction is obtained from lithological logs and the clay fraction from the resistivity is obtained by establishing a simple petrophysical relationship, a translator function, between resistivity and the clay fraction. Through inversion we use the lithological data and the resistivity data to determine the optimum spatially distributed translator function. Applying the translator function we get a 3-D clay fraction model, which holds information from the resistivity data set and the borehole data set in one variable. Finally, we use k-means clustering to generate a 3-D model of the subsurface structures. We apply the procedure to the Norsminde survey in Denmark, integrating approximately 700 boreholes and more than 100 000 resistivity models from an airborne survey in the parameterization of the 3-D model covering 156 km(2). The final five-cluster 3-D model differentiates between clay materials and different high-resistivity materials from information held in the resistivity model and borehole observations, respectively.

The effect of flow and orography on the spatial distribution of the very short-term predictability of rainfall from composite radar images	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SPACE-TIME RAINFALL; WEATHER RADAR; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; OPERATIONAL APPROACH; SCALE-DEPENDENCE; STOCHASTIC-MODEL; BEADS MODEL; REAL; FIELDS; EXTRAPOLATION	The spatial distribution and scale dependence of the very short-term predictability of precipitation by Lagrangian persistence of composite radar images is studied under different flow regimes in connection with the presence of orographic features. Data from the weather radar composite of eastern Victoria, Australia, a 500 x 500 km(2) domain at 10 min temporal and 2 x 2 km(2) spatial resolutions, covering the period from February 2011 to October 2012, were used for the analyses. The scale dependence of the predictability of precipitation is considered by decomposing the radar rainfall field into an eight-level multiplicative cascade using a fast Fourier transform. The rate of temporal development of precipitation in Lagrangian coordinates is estimated at each level of the cascade under different flow regimes, which are stratified by applying a k-means clustering algorithm on the diagnosed velocity fields. The predictability of precipitation is measured by its lifetime, which is derived by integrating the Lagrangian auto-correlation function. The lifetimes were found to depend on the scale of the feature as a power law, which is known as dynamic scaling, and to vary as a function of flow regime. The lifetimes also exhibit significant spatial variability and are approximately a factor of 2 longer on the upwind compared with the downwind slopes of terrain features. The scaling exponent of the spatial power spectrum also shows interesting geographical differences. These findings provide opportunities to perform spatially inhomogeneous stochastic simulations of space-time precipitation to account for the presence of orography, which may be integrated into design storm simulations and stochastic precipitation nowcasting systems.

Audio-Visual Emotion Analysis Using Semi-Supervised Temporal Clustering with Constraint Propagation	IMAGE ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, ICIAR 2014, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR)	OCT 22-24, 2014	PORTUGAL	Assoc Image & Machine Intelligence		Semi-supervised; Facial expression; Speech emotion recognition; Clustering; Temporal segmentation; Kernel k-means		In this paper, we investigate applying semi-supervised clustering to audio-visual emotion analysis, a complex problem that is traditionally solved using supervised methods. We propose an extension to the semi-supervised aligned cluster analysis algorithm (SSACA), a temporal clustering algorithm that incorporates pairwise constraints in the form of must-link and cannot-link. We incorporate an exhaustive constraint propagation mechanism to further improve the clustering process. To validate the proposed method, we apply it to emotion analysis on a multimodal naturalistic emotion database. Results show substantial improvements compared to the original aligned clustering analysis algorithm (ACA) and to our previously proposed semi-supervised approach.

These methods require a detailed knowledge of the action composition both in the spatial and temporal domains, which is a difficult task, most notably under realtime conditions. As such, there has been a recent shift towards the exemplar paradigm as an efficient low-level and invariant modelling approach. Motivated by recent success, we believe a real-time solution to the problem of human action recognition can be achieved. In this work, we present an exemplar-based approach where only a single action sequence is used to model an action class. Notably, rotations for each pose are parameterised in Exponential Map form. Delegate exemplars are selected using k-means clustering, where the cluster criteria is selected automatically. For each cluster, a delegate is identified and denoted as the exemplar by means of a similarity function. The number of exemplars is adaptive based on the complexity of the action sequence. For recognition, Dynamic Time Warping and template matching is employed to compare the similarity between a streamed observation and the action model. Experimental results using motion capture demonstrate our approach is superior to current state-of-the-art, with the additional ability to handle large and varied action sequences.

The nerve localization presents a key step for RA practice, it is therefore valuable to develop a tool able to facilitate this practice. The nerve detection in the ultrasound images is a challenging task, since the noise and other artifacts corrupt the visual properties of such kind of tissue. In this paper we propose a new method to address this problem. The proposed technique operates in two steps. As the median nerve belongs to a hyperechoic region, the first step consists in the segmentation of this type of region using the k-means algorithm. The second step is more critical; it deals with nerve structure detection in noisy data. For that purpose, a new descriptor is developed. It combines tow methods median binary pattern (MBP) and Gabor filter to obtain the median Gabor binary pattern (MGBP). The method was tested on 173 ultrasound images of the median nerve obtained from three patients. The results showed that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than the original MBP, Gabor descriptor and other popular descriptors.

A large variety of image classification, scene recognition, and more in general computer vision problems have been addressed according to this paradigm in the recent literature. Despite the fact that some papers questioned the real effectiveness of the paradigm, most of the works in the literature follows the same approach for codebook creation, making it a standard "de facto", without any critical investigation on the suitability of the employed procedure to the problem at hand. The most widespread structure for codebook creation is made up of four steps: dense sampling image patch detection; use of SIFT as patch descriptors; use of the k-means algorithms for clustering patch descriptors in order to select a small number of representative descriptors; use of the SVM classifier, where images are described by a codebook whose vocabulary is made up of the selected representative descriptors. In this paper, we will focus on a critical review of the third step of this process, to see if the clustering step is really useful to produce effective codebooks for image classification tasks. Reported results clearly show that a codebook created according to a purely random extraction of the patch descriptors from the set of descriptors extracted from the images in a dataset, is able to improve classification performances with respect to the performances attained with codebooks created by the clustering process.

J	Zhang, LW				Zhang, Liwei			Fault Diagnosis of Oil-Immersed Transformers Using Self-Organization Antibody Network and Immune Operator	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DISSOLVED-GAS ANALYSIS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; CLUSTERS; SYSTEM; NUMBER	There are some drawbacks when diagnosis techniques based on one intelligent method are applied to identify incipient faults in power transformers. In this paper, a hybrid immune algorithm is proposed to improve the reliability of fault diagnosis. The proposed algorithm is a hybridization of self-organization antibody network (soAbNet) and immune operator. There are two phases in immune operator. One is vaccination, and the other is immune selection. In the process of vaccination, vaccines were obtained from training dataset by using consistency-preserving K-means algorithm (K-means-CP algorithm) and were taken as the initial antibodies for soAbNet. After the soAbNet was trained, immune selection was applied to optimize the memory antibodies in the trained soAbNet. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using benchmark classification dataset and real-world transformer fault dataset. For comparison purpose, three transformer diagnosis methods such as the IEC criteria, back propagation neural network (BPNN), and soAbNet are utilized. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can extract the dataset characteristics efficiently and the diagnostic accuracy is higher than that obtained with other individual methods.

The implementation followed the map-reduce programming model, with both the map and reduce functions executing autonomously to the CPU on multiple FPGAs. A hardware/software framework was developed to manage gateware execution on multiple FPGAs across the cluster. Using this k-means implementation as an example, system-level tradeoff study between computation and I/O performance in the target multi-FPGA execution environment was performed. When compared to a similar software implementation executing over the Hadoop MapReduce framework, 15.5 x to 20.6 x performance improvement has been achieved across a range of input data sets.

In this paper, we report results from a one-week network trace of an urban mobile network with over 200,000 users. We first propose several normalized metrics such as the ratio of active users (RAU) and its z-score (ZLP) either by time or by user group, which allow comparison of location preferences across different user groups. Next, we apply these metrics on an area of 50 km(2), composed of 358 lattices. The results show that the top ranked favorite lattices are located in the west and middle parts of this given area. The k-means clustering of lattices reveals their time sequence feature patterns. Furthermore, we specifically analyze users having different ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) levels. We quantify and compare the degrees of location preferences, and present them numerically and visually. These statistics would be utilized in various practical scenarios for enhancing user experience.

M-N SCATTER PLOTS TECHNIQUE FOR EVALUATING VARYING-SIZE CLUSTERS AND SETTING THE PARAMETERS OF BI-COPAM AND UNCLES METHODS	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAY 04-09, 2014	Florence, ITALY	IEEE		M-N plots; UNCLES; Bi-CoPaM; clustering validation; gene expression	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; K-MEANS; BIOSYNTHESIS; ALGORITHM; GENES	The recently proposed UNCLES method has the ability to unify clustering results from multiple datasets under different types of external specifications. It can also tunably tighten the results such that many objects are unassigned from all of the clusters to obtain few tight clusters. Despite the success of this method, setting its parameters, such as the number of clusters (K) and the tuning parameters delta and (delta(+), delta(-)), has never been automated. As its clusters vary in size, they cannot be validated by the existing validation indices. In this study we present a technique of validation based on our proposed M-N scatter plots. This technique has the ability to provide better fitness values for the clusters which include more objects while preserving their tightness. This well suits the nature of the results of UNCLES. We have applied this technique to a set of bacterial microarray datasets as well as a set of English vowels datasets. Our results demonstrate the success of the M-N plots in selecting the best few clusters out of a pool of clusters generated under varying K, delta, and (delta(+), delta(-)) values. Our results also show that the best few clusters can be originated from different partitions, which shows the power of our technique in evaluating individual clusters rather than whole partitions. Finally, despite proposing this technique within the context of the UNCLES framework, it is readily applicable to other clustering results, especially when the parameters are not confidently predefined.

In virtually all these applications, the efficiency of the signal processing algorithm depends on how fast we can evaluate the learned metric. Moreover, storing the chosen metric can create space bottlenecks in high dimensional signal processing problems. As a result, we consider data dependent metric learning with rank as well as sparsity constraints. We propose a new non-convex algorithm and empirically demonstrate its performance on various datasets; a side benefit is that it is also much faster than existing approaches. The added sparsity constraints significantly improve the speed of multiplying with the learned metrics without sacrificing their quality.

After block-based image partitioning, a space-variant prior for local blur kernels is proposed for local blur kernels estimation. Then, the image blocks are clustered using a k-means clustering based on the similarity of local blur kernels to generate blur type invariant regions. Finally, blur types of the regions are classified into out-of-focus or motion blur using a minimum distance classifier. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully detects and classifies the regions blur types which outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques. Our proposed approach is used to detect inconsistency in the partial blur types of an image as an evidence of image tampering.

Utilizing a strong representation power of this deep learning framework, with any vector quantization (VQ) method as an initializer, the proposed DLVQ technique is capable of learning a code-constrained codebook and thus improves over conventional VQ to be used in classification problems. Tested on an audio information retrieval task, the proposed DLVQ achieves a quite promising performance when it is initialized by the k-means VQ technique. A 10.5% relative gain in mean average precision (MAP) is obtained after fusing the k-means and DLVQ results together.

Traditional detection techniques model the acoustic events on frame-based spectral features. Considering the temporal-frequency structures of acoustic events may be distributed in time-scales beyond frames, we propose to represent those structures as a bag of spectral patch exemplars. In order to learn the representative exemplars, k-means clustering based vector quantization (VQ) was applied on the whitened spectral patches which makes the learned exemplars focus on high-order statistical structure. With the learned spectral exemplars, a sparse feature representation is extracted based on the similarity measurement to the learned exemplars. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built on the sparse representation for acoustic event detection. Our experimental results showed that the sparse representation based on the patch based exemplars significantly improved the performance compared with traditional frame based representations.

In this work we present a novel approach to cluster the musical segments based on their acoustic similarity by using 2D-Fourier Magnitude Coefficients (2D-FMCs). These coefficients, computed from a chroma representation, significantly simplify the problem of clustering the different segments since they are key transposition and phase shift invariant. We explore various strategies to obtain the 2D-FMC patches that represent entire segments and apply k-means to label them. Finally, we discuss possible ways of estimating k and compare our competitive results with the current state of the art.

We use an ensemble of vocabulary trees based on hierarchical k-means clustering and query these trees to find the NN candidates in sub-linear time. As generating these vocabulary trees with widely used affine-invariant Riemannian metric (AIRM) will be very time-demanding, we propose to use the second-order approximation to AIRM (SOA-AIRM). We evaluate the proposed NN search algorithm in the application scenario of near-duplicate image detection in a large database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state of the art techniques in terms of both accuracy and speed.

The motivation of the proposed algorithm is to utilize variational Bayesian framework and exploit potential channel effect of total variability modeling for diarization of conversation side. Other three well-known techniques are compared as follows: K-means clustering for eigenvoices and I-vector speaker diarization, and variational Bayes applied to eigenvoices. Performance evaluations are conducted on the summed-channel telephone data from the 2008 NIST speaker recognition evaluation. The paper discusses how the performance is influenced by different modules, e. g., VAD, initial speaker clustering and Viterbi re-segmentation. Comparison experiments show the interest of variational Bayesian probabilistic framework for speaker diarization.

The integrated zone is an area where consumers, resources and energy conversion technologies are integrated. This is obtained by developing aggregated district integration models based on GIS data and applying k-means clustering techniques. By using the proposed method, the regional DES is partitioned into limited number of integrated zones. The selected zones allow us to achieve accurate representation of the whole district while significantly reducing the number of decision variables for which more detailed optimization methods can be applied.

Integrating remote sensing with GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation approach for Karst rocky desertification assessment in Southwest of China	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol		PROVINCE; AREAS	The increasing exploitation of Karst resources is leading to severe environmental impacts, as Karst frequently occurs in the most fragile and vulnerable environments. This paper presents a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach in a spatial context to support Karst rocky desertification (KRD) assessment by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. The study area is located in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. Criteria and impact factors for KRD first were identified and weighted through pairwise comparison method. A GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion, and a clustering method based on K-mean algorithms was used to classify KRD into several descending rank zones (or levels). Both ROC and error matrix assessments indicated that the MCE approach is better than the NDVI approach. In addition, we found it is useful to integrate the topographic and human disturbance factors into KRD mapping and assessment, compared with most of the previous KRD assessment studies mainly focused on developing vegetation or land cover information in karst regions by using remote sensing alone. Furthermore, the integrated MCE approach is robust, flexible, and easy to be implemented. It also explicitly includes the quantitative and qualitative information, for instance, opinions of decision makers and experts as well as characteristics of the landscape.

However, due to its sequential nature, k-means++ requires a large number of iterations to complete the initialization and it becomes inefficient as the size of data increase. Even though scalable k-means++ can drastically reduce the iterations and can be easily applied to the MapReduce systems, but due to its sequential nature, it still requires two MapReduce jobs in each round. Moreover, it takes a large number of I/O cost and it is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose Oversampling and Refining (OnR) method which can improve efficiency of scalable k-means++ by using only one MapReduce job to obtain Omega(k) centers in each round. Except for the oversampling factor l of scalable k-means++, OnR uses another oversampling factor o to further increase the number of chosen centers. Oversampling is executed on the Mapper phase, and in Reducer phase, one Reducer is responsible for removing the oversampled centers generated from o and outputs a set of centers which is the same as the output of scalable k-means++. To reduce the expensive network cost caused by too large o, OnR estimates the global cost by the local clustering cost and uses it to remove some wrong points in Mapper phase. Extensive experiments on real data are conducted and the performance results indicate that OnR outperforms scalable k-means++ in the aspect of I/O cost and running time.

The unreasonable thread mapping will lead the promising computing power of MIC coprocessor not to be fully exploited. In order to fully exploit the computing potential of MIC coprocessor, this paper discussed effective multi threads mapping strategies through comparing the computing performance and analyzing the performance differences between various mapping methods. Meanwhile, for the further exploiting the high computing power of MIC heterogeneous system, the specific program porting and performance optimization strategies were explored by using the k-means application program. Experimental results show that the proposed mapping and parallel optimization strategies are effective, which can be guide the programmer to port and optimize applications effectively to MIC heterogeneous parallel system.

Open column, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and chemometric strategy for investigation of metabolic fingerprints of complex systems	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							MIXTURE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; BAUHINIA-PURPUREA; EXTRACTION SOLUTIONS; VARIEGATA; GLYCOSIDE; MEDIA	A new strategy for investigation of metabolic fingerprints in complex systems was developed based on a combination of open column chromatography, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and k-means clustering. A simplex centroid mixture design with four solvents, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol, was applied to a crude extract of the Bauhinia variegata L. to gradually change the mobile phase polarity of the open column. K-means clustering was used to screen the profiles of the 3033 spectra from high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection data. The seventeen k-means clusters were discriminated into three groups. The largest one containing 2617 (86.3%) spectra has a strong absorbance band around 210 nm that is commonly found in many naturally abundant compounds. The smallest group contains only 134 (4.4%) spectra and has strong absorbance bands at wavelengths well above 250 nm and are potentially interesting for further metabolic studies and fingerprinting. The other group judged to have spectral profiles intermediate between those of the other two contains 282 (9.3%) spectra. Ternary and quaternary mixtures of the statistical design provided potentially useful information for fingerprinting Bauhinia variegata L. extracts relative to what could be obtained using only pure solvents and binary mixtures that are commonly employed in open column chromatography.

For instance, the classification scores of the Bag of Features (BoF) model for image classification have been used to build a top-down categorization cost in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for semantic segmentation. Recent work shows that discriminative sparse dictionary learning (DSDL) can improve upon the unsupervised K-means dictionary learning method used in the BoF model due to the ability of DSDL to capture discriminative features from different classes. However, to the best of our knowledge, DSDL has not been used for building a top-down categorization cost for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a CRF model that incorporates a DSDL based top-down cost for semantic segmentation. We show that the new CRF energy can be minimized using existing efficient discrete optimization techniques. Moreover, we propose a new method for jointly learning the CRF parameters, object classifiers and the visual dictionary. Our experiments demonstrate that by jointly learning these parameters, the feature representation becomes more discriminative and the segmentation performance improves with respect to that of state-of-the-art methods that use unsupervised K-means dictionary learning.

In order to exploit the advantages of kernel methods, multiple kernel learning was proposed several years ago. However, the time and space complexity of multiple kernel learning increases greatly due to great amount computation of multiple kernels. So far, the research on improving training efficiency for multiple kernel learning mostly focuses on reducing the complexity of solving the objective function, other than reducing the training set. In this paper, the time performance of multiple kernel learning is improved through shrinking the training sets by introducing cooperative clustering, which is a novel method based on k-means clustering. Applying cooperative clustering to multiple kernel learning problems is proposed to reduce the number of support vectors, and then reduce the time complexity of multiple kernel learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the new method improves the efficiency of multiple kernel learning greatly with a slight impact on classification accuracy.

A watermark embedding as a 2-D wavelet in the training data at the first step to identify the identity of who makes the action. The proposed technique relies on detecting interest points using SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) from each frame of the video for action recognition. More specifically, we propose an action representation based on computing a rich set of descriptors from 2D-SIFT key points. Since most previous approaches to human action recognition typically focus on action classification or localization, these approaches usually ignore the information about human identity. A compact yet discriminative semantics visual vocabulary was built by a K-means for high-level representation. Finally a multi class linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for classification. Our algorithm can not only categorize human actions contained in the video, but also verify the person who performs the action. We test our algorithm on three datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, Weizmann and our action dataset. Our results reflect the promise of our approach.

Topic extraction in this domain is necessary to help focus on events that are popular and important. At present LDA, a probabilistic topic model based on word co-occurrence is widely used. However, when it comes to deal with microbloggings that are all short texts with a lot of noise, the result can be not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a new index called M-membership that is proved to be more suitable to indicate the importance of each term in this scenario, and present a topic extraction method based on Fuzzy C-Means algorithm, then use fuzzy set to represent clusters and topics, which can lead to a more reasonable and thematic result. Comparative experiments with K-Means and LDA illustrate our ability to cluster and extract topics in the field of Micro-blog.

Its two major disadvantages lie in the facts that the algorithm is sensitive to initial cluster centers and the outliers exert significant influence on the clustering results. In addition, K-Means algorithm traverses and computes all the data multiple times. Thus, the algorithm is not efficient when dealing with large data sets. In order to overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes to exclude the outliers using the minimum number of points in the d-dimensional hypersphere area. Then k cluster centers can be obtained by adjusting the threshold making use of density idea. Finally, K-Means algorithm will be integrated with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The time efficiency is improved considerably through taking advantage of computing power of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). We use the ratio of distance between classes to distance within classes and speedup as the evaluation criteria. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the stability and running efficiency of K-Means algorithm.

In the modified K-SVD algorithm, the maximum sparsity is considered. First, the K-SVD denoising model is first to preprocess the Low Resolution (LR) images. And then, the high-resolution (HR) and LR images are both trained by the RAMP based K-SVD algorithm. The LR and HR dictionaries are also classed by the K-mean method. In test, a human-made and real LR image, namely millimeter wave (MMW) image are respectively used to testify our method proposed.

However, they require the eigenanalysis of a sample's graph Laplacian L, something very costly for moderately sized samples and prohibitive for very large ones. We propose to build a low rank approximation to L using essentially the centroids obtained applying kernel K-means over the similarity matrix. We call this approach kernel KASP (kKASP) as it follows the KASP procedure of Yan et al. but coupling centroid selection with the local geometry defined by the similarity matrix. As we shall see, kKASP's reconstructions are competitive with KASP's ones, particularly in the low rank range.

The scheme properly decreases the ESA index matrix dimensions to achieve faster process with similar results. This paper discusses index matrix dimensional reduction schemes of econo-ESA. We did experiments with several schemes: random selection, k-means clustering, norm-based clustering, densest, and sparsest schemes. Each resulted matrix had different element values and density. Our experimental results showed that the random selection scheme, which had the nearest density to the original index matrix, gave the best results. We thus conclude that the index matrix density is an additional feature which has to be considered in econo-ESA. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, companies around the world need a better and deeper understanding of their customers. In order to enhance store layout, generate customers groups, offers and personalized recommendations, among others. To accomplish these objectives, it is very important to know which products are related to each other. Classical approaches for clustering products, such as K-means or SOFM, do not work when exist scattered and large amounts of data. Even association rules give results that are difficult to interpret. These facts motivate us to use a novel approach that generates communities of products. One of the main advantages of these communities is that are meaningful and easily interpretable by retail analysts. This approach allows the processing of billions of transaction records within a reasonable time, according to the needs of companies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We use thematic clustering to solve this problem. The existing clustering algorithms such as k-means, minimum spanning tree and etc. are considered and analyzed. It is shown which of these algorithms give the best results working with news texts. Clustering is a powerful tool for text processing, but it can't give a complete picture of news article semantics. This paper also presents a methodic of comprehensive news texts analysis based on a combination of statistical algorithms for keywords extracting and algorithms forming the semantic coherence of text blocks. Particular attention is paid to the structural features of the news texts.

Rough k-means (RKM) by Lingras et al. is one of rough clustering algorithms[3]. The method does not have a clear indicator to determine the most appropriate result because it is not based on objective function. Therefore we proposed a rough clustering algorithm based on optimization of an objective function [7]. This paper will propose a new rough clustering algorithm based on optimization of an objective function with fuzzy-set representation to obtain better lower approximation, and estimate the effectiveness through some numerical examples.

The present investigation was performed to study the genetic structure of Tamarix populations in this province and present some information about gene flow among these populations. Forty-two tree specimens were randomly collected and studied for molecular and morphological diversity. Based on morphological descriptions we recognized 3 species that were confirmed by detailed morphometric and genetic analysis. The studied tree specimens were separated in 3 distinct clusters by UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analysis and multidimensional scaling ordination methods. Clustering of molecular (ISSR) data showed some degree of genetic variation within each species. Similarly, STRUCTURE analysis and K-means clustering revealed some degree of genetic admixture among the studied accessions. NeighborNet and reticulograms revealed some degree of gene exchange among the studied populations. AMOVA and the Hickory test showed significant genetic differences of the studied populations and the Mantel test showed significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of these populations.

This paper presents a novel image-hiding scheme to embed the secret image into an innocent cover image. We use a block matching procedure to search for the best-matching block for each secret image block. Then the k-means clustering method is used to select k representative blocks for the not-well-matched secret image blocks. Moreover, the bases and indexes of the well-matched blocks together with the representative blocks are compressed by the Huffman coding.

Different from the template design pattern, our system allows an interaction between the algorithm and the Decision Maker(DM). It allows the users to take into account their preferences at each generation of IGA. In order to avoid the fatigue of the users, a novel evaluation model consisting of DM evaluation and machine evaluation is applied. The whole population is classified into clusters by the K-means clustering algorithm and only the most representative individual of each cluster is evaluated by the DM. The support system is applied to a book cover design. The results show that the proposed IGA is able to capture preferences of user in a reasonable number of iterations.

First is how to choose and quantify the proper features to build user model. Second is how to divide the users into optimal teams to play the best effectiveness of collaborative learning. Based on the collaborative learning theory, its practical research, and the conditions of network learning system, the paper selects learning interest and knowledge level as user's features, using the methods of educational psychology measurement to quantify these two features so as to establish user model. Considering the elements and some practical teaching cases of collaborative learning, the paper derives the requirements of collaborative learning's basic unit: the collaboration group, and defines three features of collaborative group as: the cohesion within group, the hierarchy within group and the uniformity among groups. Then, the paper builds the group model and put forward the objective function of collaborative learning grouping scheme. Finally, from the perspective of clustering and combinatorial optimization, the paper investigates how to divide the users into collaborative learning's groups. As a result, it comes up the method as follows. Above all, according to the users' learning interest, it uses K-means to cluster the users into different clusters. Then in each cluster, genetic algorithm is adopted for collaborative learning's group division according to the users' knowledge level. Thus, the paper achieves the automatic group division to find the approximate optimal collaboration learning groups. Lastly, through the simulation experiments, the validity of the method is proved.

Firstly, Aligned Cluster Analysis (ACA), a robust method used to segment sequence of motion, is taken to capture data into actions. Secondly, body joints are denoted by quatemion, each sub-segment of motion features is extracted by k-means clustering. Finally, the motion features match with the features database. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach can accurately segment the motional sequence. The motional features are successfully employed in the retrievable process.

Due to the disturbance of clutter, the conventional methods, such as distance partition method, K-means(++) method, etc., cannot give a perfect partition. In this paper, a novel partition method is proposed based on density analysis and spectral clustering technique. Firstly, construct the density distribution function of the measurements by using the Gaussian kernel, and then eliminate the clutter from the measurements. Secondly, the spectral clustering technique based on neighbor propagation is introduced to partition the measurements. Finally, the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density method is used to achieve the METT. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance, especially a better real-time performance, than the conventional methods.

The attributes of the objects within the same cluster should be similar to each other, while the attributes of the objects within different clusters should be different. Most of classical clustering algorithms suffer from such disadvantages as local optima, initial centroid selection and the lack of a way to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, and thus fail to cluster datasets with complex distributions. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm based on artificial immune network with elitist learning (Ocopt-aiNet-EL). Some elaborated operators are implemented for automatic data clustering and the Manifold distance is used for the dissimilarity measure of antibodies. A number of benchmark cases including artificial datasets and real-world datasets are arranged to evaluate the performance of the proposed Ocopt-aiNet-EL algorithm and the other clustering algorithms, such as K-means, EAC and Ocopt-aiNet. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Ocopt-aiNet-EL is an effective and efficient clustering method.

Hence, maximizing the lifetime of WSNs becomes a critical issue in sensor networks. Clustering is one of the most effective means to extend the lifetime of the whole network. In this paper, an energy-aware cluster heads selection method, based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and K-means, is presented to prolong the network lifetime. We apply the BPSO and make it suitable for this issue. The selection criteria of the objective cost function are based on minimizing the intra-cluster distance as well as the distance between cluster heads and base station, and optimizing the energy consumption of the whole network. In addition, the sensor nodes are divided into several clusters based on K-means algorithm at the beginning, which can reduce the complexity of the whole algorithm. The performance of our technique is compared with the well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols, LEACH-C and PSO-C respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed work can achieve better network lifetime over its comparatives.

Five feature descriptors about the color, texture, and shape defined in the MPEG-7 specification, which are relevant to textile image characteristics, are extracted from a dataset. First, we tune the feature weights using a genetic algorithm, based on a predefined training dataset. Then, for each extracted feature descriptor, we use K-means to partition it into four clusters and combine them together to obtain an MPEG-7 signature. Finally, when users input a query image, the system finds out similar images by combining the results based on MPEG-7 signatures and the ones in three nearest classes. The experimental results show that the similar images returned from an image database to a query textile image are acceptable for humans and with good quality.

In this paper, we carried out a throughout research on evolutionary computation based clustering. This paper proposed a sample index based encoding method, which significantly reduces the search space of evolutionary computation so the clustering algorithm converged quickly. Evolutionary computation has a good global search ability while the traditional clustering method k-means has a better capability at local search. In order to combine the strengths of both, this paper researched on the effect of initializing k-means by evolutionary computation algorithms. Experiments were conducted on five commonly used evolutionary computation algorithms. Experimental results show that the sample index based encoding method and evolutionary computation initialized k-means both perform well and demonstrate great potential.

Assessment and application of clustering techniques to atmospheric particle number size distribution for the purpose of source apportionment	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							VEHICLE EMISSIONS; URBAN-ENVIRONMENT; R-PACKAGE; LONG-TERM; AEROSOL; VALIDATION; SUBMICROMETER; EXPOSURE; SPLINES; HEALTH	Long-term measurements of particle number size distribution (PNSD) produce a very large number of observations and their analysis requires an efficient approach in order to produce results in the least possible time and with maximum accuracy. Clustering techniques are a family of sophisticated methods that have been recently employed to analyse PNSD data; however, very little information is available comparing the performance of different clustering techniques on PNSD data. This study aims to apply several clustering techniques (i.e. K means, PAM, CLARA and SOM) to PNSD data, in order to identify and apply the optimum technique to PNSD data measured at 25 sites across Brisbane, Australia. A new method, based on the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) with a basis of penalised B-splines, was proposed to parameterise the PNSD data and the temporal weight of each cluster was also estimated using the GAM. In addition, each cluster was associated with its possible source based on the results of this parameterisation, together with the characteristics of each cluster. The performances of four clustering techniques were compared using the Dunn index and Silhouette width validation values and the K means technique was found to have the highest performance, with five clusters being the optimum. Therefore, five clusters were found within the data using the K means technique. The diurnal occurrence of each cluster was used together with other air quality parameters, temporal trends and the physical properties of each cluster, in order to attribute each cluster to its source and origin. The five clusters were attributed to three major sources and origins, including regional background particles, photochemically induced nucleated particles and vehicle generated particles. Overall, clustering was found to be an effective technique for attributing each particle size spectrum to its source and the GAM was suitable to parameterise the PNSD data. These two techniques can help researchers immensely in analysing PNSD data for characterisation and source apportionment purposes.	[Salimi, F.; Ristovski, Z.; Mazaheri, M.; Laiman, R.; Crilley, L.

If one assumes that image patches from natural imagery can be modeled as a low rank manifold, we develop an optimality criterion for a measurement matrix based upon separating the canonical elements of the manifold prior. Any sparse image reconstruction algorithm has improved performance using the developed measurement matrix over using random projections. We implement a 2-way clustering then K-means algorithm to separate the estimated image space into low dimensional clusters for image reconstruction via a minimum mean square error estimator. Some insights into the empirical estimation of the image patch manifold are developed and several results are presented.

S	Lad, S; Parikh, D		Fleet, D; Pajdla, T; Schiele, B; Tuytelaars, T		Lad, Shrenik; Parikh, Devi			Interactively Guiding Semi-Supervised Clustering via Attribute-Based Explanations	COMPUTER VISION - ECCV 2014, PT VI	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	13th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)	SEP 06-12, 2014	Zurich, SWITZERLAND					Unsupervised image clustering is a challenging and often ill-posed problem. Existing image descriptors fail to capture the clustering criterion well, and more importantly, the criterion itself may depend on (unknown) user preferences. Semi-supervised approaches such as distance metric learning and constrained clustering thus leverage user-provided annotations indicating which pairs of images belong to the same cluster (must-link) and which ones do not (cannot-link). These approaches require many such constraints before achieving good clustering performance because each constraint only provides weak cues about the desired clustering. In this paper, we propose to use image attributes as a modality for the user to provide more informative cues. In particular, the clustering algorithm iteratively and actively queries a user with an image pair. Instead of the user simply providing a must-link/cannot-link constraint for the pair, the user also provides an attribute-based reasoning e. g. "these two images are similar because both are natural and have still water" or "these two people are dissimilar because one is way older than the other". Under the guidance of this explanation, and equipped with attribute predictors, many additional constraints are automatically generated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by incorporating the proposed attribute-based explanations in three standard semi-supervised clustering algorithms: Constrained K-Means, MPCK-Means, and Spectral Clustering, on three domains: scenes, shoes, and faces, using both binary and relative attributes.

Sentiment analysis is undertaken in revealing current customers' satisfaction level towards low-cost airlines. Design/methodology/approach - About 10,895 tweets (data collected for two and a half months) are analysed. Text mining techniques are used during data pre-processing and a mixture of statistical techniques are used to segment the customers' opinion. Findings - The results with two different sentiment algorithms show that there is more positive than negative polarity across the different algorithms. Clustering results show that both K-Means and spherical K-Means algorithms delivered similar results and the four main topics that are discussed by the consumers on Twitter are customer service, LCCs tickets promotions, flight cancellations and delays and post-booking management. Practical implications - Gaining knowledge of customer sentiments as well as improvements on the four main topics discussed in this study, i.e. customer service, LCCs tickets promotions, flight cancellations or delays and post-booking management will help LCCs to attract more customers and generate more profits. Originality/value - This paper provides useful insights on customers' sentiments and opinions towards LCCs by utilizing social media information.

J	Iwankowicz, RR; Rosochacki, W				Iwankowicz, Remigiusz Romuald; Rosochacki, Wlodzimierz			Clustering risk assessment method for shipbuilding industry	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Shipbuilding; Prediction; Clustering; Risk assessment; Steel structure production		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a risk assessment method for production processes of large-size steel ship hulls. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a quantitative-probabilistic approach with involvement of clustering technique in order to analyse the database of accidents and predict the process risk. The case-based reasoning is used in here. A set of technological hazard classes as a basis for analysing the similarities between the production processes is proposed. The method has been explained using a case study on large-size shipyard. Findings - Statistical and clustering approach ensures effective risk managing in shipbuilding process designing. Results show that by selection of adequate number of clusters in the database, the quality of predictions can be controlled. Research limitations/implications - The suggested k-means method using the Euclidean distance measure is initial approach. Testing the other distance measures and consideration of fuzzy clustering method is desirable in the future. The analysis in the case study is simplified. The use of the method according to prediction of risk related to loss of health or life among people exposed to the hazards is presented. Practical implications - The risk index allows to compare the processes in terms of security, as well as provide significant information at the technology design stage of production task. Originality/value - There are no studies on quantitative methods developed specifically for managing risks in shipbuilding processes. Proposed list of technological hazard classes allows to utilize database of past processes accidents in risk prediction. The clustering method of analysing the database is agile thanks to the number of clusters parameter. The case study basing on actual data from the real shipyard constitutes additional value of the paper.

We are using logfiles from a workflow system that record the sequential execution of business processes. Each process execution results in a timestamped event. The main issue of analysing such event sequences is that they can be very diverse. Models that can effectively handle diverse sequences without losing the sequential nature of the data are desired. We propose an approach which clusters event sequences. Each cluster consists of similar sequences and the challenge is to identify a similarity measure that can cope with the sequential nature of the data. After clustering we build individual predictive models for each group. This strategy addresses both the sequential and diverse characteristics of our data. We first employ K-means and extent it into a categorical-sequential clustering algorithm by combining it with sequential alignment. Finally, we treat each resulting cluster by building individual Markov models of different orders, expecting that the representative characteristics of each cluster are captured.

Some researchers applied the K-Means algorithm to divide traffic sub-areas on the taxi trajectories. However, the traditional K-Means algorithms faced difficulties in processing large-scale Global Position System(GPS) trajectories of taxicabs with the restrictions of memory, I/O, computing performance. This paper proposes a Parallel Traffic Sub-Areas Division(PTSD) method which consists of two stages, on the basis of the Parallel K-Means(PKM) algorithm. During the first stage, we develop a process to cluster traffic sub-areas based on the PKM algorithm. Then, the second stage, we identify boundary of traffic sub-areas on the base of cluster result.

Traditionally, to maintain the network coverage, all of the APs within the WLAN have to be powered on. Nevertheless, the new algorithm can power off a large proportion of APs while the coverage is maintained as the always-on counterpart. The proposed algorithm is composed of two parallel and concurrent procedures, which are the faster procedure based on K-means and the more accurate procedure based on Dynamic Population Size Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (DPS-MOPSO). To implement green clustering efficiently and accurately, dynamic population size and mutational operators are introduced as complements for the classical MOPSO. In addition to the function of AP selection, the new green clustering algorithm has another new function as the reference and guidance for AP deployment. This paper also presents simulations in scenarios modeled with ray-tracing method and FDTD technique, and the results show that about 67% up to 90% of energy consumption can be saved while the original network coverage is maintained during periods when few users are online or when the traffic load is low.

ADFA-LD is composed of thousands of system call traces collected from a contemporary Linux local server, with six types of up-to-date cyber attack involved. Previously, we have conducted a preliminary analysis of ADFA-LD, and shown that the frequency-based algorithms can be realised at a cheaper computational cost in contrast with the short sequence-based algorithms, while achieving an acceptable performance. In this paper, we further exploit the potential of the frequency-based algorithms, in attempts to reduce the dimension of the frequency vectors and identify the optimal distance functions. Two typical frequency-based algorithms, i.e., k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and k-means clustering (kMC), are applied to validate the effectiveness and efficiency.

A recently introduced extension, pi rough k-means, eliminates need for the weight parameter in rough k-means applying probabilities derived from Laplace's Principle of Indifference. However, the proposal in its more general form makes it possible to optionally integrate user-defined weights for parameter tuning using techniques such as evolutionary computing. In this paper, we study the properties of this general user-weighted pi k-means through extensive experiments.

Most recent works concerning unsupervised learning have been focused on clustering, showing great potential of ACO-based techniques. This work presents an ACO-based clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach restructures ACOC from a centroid-based technique to a medoid-based technique, where the properties of the search space are not necessarily known. Instead, it only relies on the information about the distances amongst data. The new algorithm, called MACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Partition Around Medoids) and with ACOC. The experiments measure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Clustering provides us with a powerful tool to organize the information and recognize the structure of the information. Most text clustering techniques are designed to deal with either long or short texts. However many real-life collections are often made up of both long and short texts, namely mixed length texts. The current text clustering techniques are unsatisfactory, for they don't distinguish the sparseness and high dimension of the mixed length texts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach - Length-Aware Dual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ADLDA), which is used for clustering the mixed length texts via obtaining auxiliary knowledge from long (short) texts for short (long) texts in the collections. The degree of mutual auxiliary is based on the ratio of long texts and short texts in a corpus. Experimental results on real datasets show our approach achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art text clustering approaches for mixed length texts.

The movement path selection method of sink nodes is proposed. Modified subtractive clustering method, k-means method, and nearest neighbor interpolation method are used to obtain the movement paths. The lifetime optimization model is established under flow constraint, energy consumption constraint, link transmission constraint, and other constraints. The model is solved from the perspective of static and mobile data gathering of sink nodes. Subgradient method is used to solve the lifetime optimization model when one sink node stays at one anchor location. Geometric method is used to evaluate the amount of gathering data when sink nodes are moving. Finally, all sensor nodes transmit data according to the optimal data transmission scheme. Sink nodes gather the data along the shortest movement paths. Simulation results show that MLMS can prolong network lifetime, balance node energy consumption, and reduce data gathering latency under appropriate parameters. Under certain conditions, it outperforms Ratio_w, TPGF, RCC, and GRND.

In the first stage, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to make an initial clustering, and the optimal number of clusters is automatically determined by a compactness criterion that is established to find clustering with maximum intercluster distance and minimum intracluster variance. In the second stage, a multiple terminal vertices weighted graph is constructed based on an energy function, and the image is segmented according to a minimum cost multiway cut. A large number of performance evaluations are carried out, and the experimental results indicate the proposed approach is effective compared to other existing image segmentation algorithms on the Berkeley image database.

There are several differences at the local level regarding how the formal care of the older people is organised (e. g. the existence of social home care services) and to what extent other services have developed (e. g. institutional care for the older people, intergenerational centres, community nursing, NGOs and interpersonal assistance). We focus on two services, institutional care and social home care, and present the typology of community care in Slovenia. Four clusters were obtained via a hierarchical method (k-means clustering). Clusters of municipalities are comprised of municipalities that have similar characteristics of care for older people, taking into account both institutional care and social home care. The results have shown that municipalities in Slovenia differ dramatically in the availability of care for the older people. Some offer only a poor quality of care (mainly smaller rural municipalities), while others offer higher quality of care and a strong combination of both institutional and social home care.

In order to obtain an accurate WPC model that can consider various factors, this paper improves a bisecting k-means clustering algorithm. The improved clustering algorithm is used for partitioning the measured data into a certain number of groups, which can be expressed in their centroids. The interpolation method based on the polynomial is carried out for modelling a WPC of WTG. The modelled WPC is applied to the reliability analysis of the generating systems with a wind farm. The results show that the accuracy of the linear interpolation is higher than that of quadratic interpolation and cubic spline interpolation when there are a relatively large number of clusters.

However, face localization from input image is a challenging task due to possible variations in location, scale, pose, occlusion, illumination, facial expressions, and clutter background. In this paper we introduce a new optimized k-means algorithm that finds the optimal centers for each cluster which corresponds to the global minimum of the k-means cluster. This method was tested to locate the faces in the input image based on image segmentation. It separates the input image into two classes: faces and nonfaces. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, MIT-CBCL, BioID, and Caltech datasets are used. The results show significant localization accuracy.

Many clustering algorithms have been used in the field of gene clustering. The multivariate Gaussian mixture distribution function was frequently used as the component of the finite mixture model for clustering, however the clustering cannot be restricted to the normal distribution in the real dataset. In order to make the cluster algorithm strong adaptability, this paper proposes a new scheme for clustering gene expression data based on the multivariate elliptical contoured mixture models (MECMMs). To solve the problem of over-reliance on the initialization, we propose an improved expectation maximization (EM) algorithm by adding and deleting initial value for the classical EM algorithm, and the number of clusters can be treated as a known parameter and inferred with the QAIC criterion. The improved EM algorithm based on the MECMMs is tested and compared with some other clustering algorithms, the performance of our clustering algorithm has been extensively compared over several simulated and real gene expression datasets. Our results indicated that improved EM clustering algorithm is superior to the classical EM algorithm and the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm, and can be widely used for gene clustering.

The P system used is a cell-like P system of two-layer nested structure: a skin membrane contains several elementary membranes. Each object in elementary membranes represents a group of cluster centers. Objects in the system evolve by using the differential evolution mechanism, and then the global optimal object in the skin membrane is updated by the best objects in all elementary membranes. The cell-like P system can automatically find the best cluster centers for a data set. The proposed DE-MC algorithm is evaluated on an artificial data set and a real-life data set and is further compared with classical k-means algorithm, GA-based clustering algorithm and DE-based clustering algorithm, respectively. The comparison results reveal that the proposed DE-MC algorithm is superior to the other three clustering algorithms in terms of clustering quality and robustness.

Skin Proteomic Comparison among Four Grape Cultivars with Different Anthocyanin Contents	X INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRAPEVINE BREEDING AND GENETICS	Acta Horticulturae		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics	AUG 01-05, 2010	Geneva, NY	Int Soc Hort Sci		grape skin; anthocyanin; two-dimensional electrophoresis	BERRY; PROTEINS; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; GENOME; WINE; TOOL	Grape skin is characterized by a very intense metabolism during ripening involving many biosynthetic activities such as those relating to secondary compounds like the anthocyanins. In order to improve our knowledge about the physiology of this tissue, we performed a comparison among the proteomes of the ripe skin of 'Riesling Italico', 'Pinot Gris', 'Pinot Noir' and 'Croatina', genotypes that accumulate anthocyanins to different extents. In order to examine quantitative changes in proteomic maps, data underwent a two-way ANOVA test using cultivars and years as factors. The 297 significant variations underwent two different clustering procedures. By means of the two-way hierarchical clustering, it was possible to observe that the gels of the four cultivars were arranged in an order that clearly reflected anthocyanin levels and emphasized the similarities between the two Pinots, from one side, and the divergence of the proteome of 'Croatina', from the other. It was then possible to group the 297 spots, according to their trends, in six clusters through the k-means procedure. One of the clusters included 85 spots showing a variation profile that could be associated with anthocyanin levels. Some were identified through LC-ESI-MS/MS and their role was discussed.	[Negri, A.

The k-Means Clustering Method, with k values ranging between 2 (two) and 4 (four), was used in order to segment the data. Decision Trees were used for the development of explanatory models of the segmentation. The results obtained showed that the majority of the answerers considered that experimentation is central on Chemistry learning. The results also showed that the significance of research in Chemistry learning is strongly dependent on the students' involvement in lab work.

The value of analysing and characterising short text is to understand and identify the features that can identify and distinguish them, thereby improving input to the classification process. In this research work, we analyse a large number of text features and establish which combinations are useful to discriminate between the different genres of short text. Having identified the most promising features, we then confirm our findings by performing the categorisation task using three approaches: the Gaussian andSVMclassifiers and the K-means clustering algorithm. Several hundred combinations of features were analysed in order to identify the best combinations and the results confirmed the observations made. The novel aspect of our work is the detection of the best combination of individual metrics which are identified as potential features to be used for the categorisation process.

J	Oles, M; Oles, P				Oles, Maria; Oles, Piotr			Coping Style and Quality of Life in Elderly Patients with Vision Disturbances	JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							BASE-LINE DATA; CATARACT-SURGERY; MACULAR DEGENERATION; HEALTH; GLAUCOMA; IMPACT; HOPELESSNESS; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; STRESS	Purpose. This study aims at evaluating coping style and quality of life in patients with glaucoma and cataract. Methods. The participants were patients (N = 237, 130F; mean age: M = 67,8; SD = 9,5) with low vision caused by cataract (N = 188) and glaucoma (N = 49) who answered the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QOLQ) by Schalock and Keith. The participants were divided by means of cluster analysis (k-means) according to coping stylesmeasured by CISS (Endler and Parker) into three groups: (1) high mobilization for coping, (2) task-oriented coping, and (3) low mobilization for coping. Results. In all the group, a general quality of life was moderately lowered; however, in task-oriented group it was relatively high. Moreover, task-oriented group had significantly lower level of anxiety (STAI), hopelessness (HS), and loneliness (UCLA LS-R) and higher level of self-esteem (SES) in comparison to the patients from high mobilization and low mobilization for coping. Conclusions. In an old age, adaptive coping with vision disturbances does not necessarily mean flexibility in combining all coping styles, but rather task-oriented coping and an ability to use social support. Extreme mobilization for coping seems not adaptive similarly like low mobilization for coping because it violates balance between environmental requirements and personal resources.

A comparative study of DIGNET, average, complete, single hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms in 2D face image recognition	SIGNAL PROCESSING, SENSOR/INFORMATION FUSION, AND TARGET RECOGNITION XXIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Signal Processing, Sensor/Information Fusion, and Target Recognition XXIII	MAY 05-08, 2014	Baltimore, MA	SPIE		DIGNET; Face tracking; face clustering; clustering validation		The study in this paper belongs to a more general research of discovering facial sub-clusters in different ethnicity face databases. These new sub-clusters along with other metadata (such as race, sex, etc.) lead to a vector for each face in the database where each vector component represents the likelihood of participation of a given face to each cluster. This vector is then used as a feature vector in a human identification and tracking system based on face and other biometrics. The first stage in this system involves a clustering method which evaluates and compares the clustering results of five different clustering algorithms (average, complete, single hierarchical algorithm, k-means and DIGNET), and selects the best strategy for each data collection. In this paper we present the comparative performance of clustering results of DIGNET and four clustering algorithms (average, complete, single hierarchical and k-means) on fabricated 2D and 3D samples, and on actual face images from various databases, using four different standard metrics. These metrics are the silhouette figure, the mean silhouette coefficient, the Hubert test G coefficient, and the classification accuracy for each clustering result. The results showed that, in general, DIGNET gives more trustworthy results than the other algorithms when the metrics values are above a specific acceptance threshold. However when the evaluation results metrics have values lower than the acceptance threshold but not too low (too low corresponds to ambiguous results or false results), then it is necessary for the clustering results to be verified by the other algorithms.

Information and content retrieval is a critical service for mobile ad-hoc networks. It relies on other resources and tools, such as internal storage, content searching and sharing, delay-tolerant delivery, etc. Previous studies have shown that social networking can assist delay-tolerant routing design in many respects. In this paper, we specifically address content retrieval in delay-tolerant mobile ad-hoc networks. We propose a social-tie based content retrieval scheme to support the delay-tolerant MANET. The social hierarchy is structured using balanced connectivity criteria and a K-mean clustering algorithm. The proposed scheme has been evaluated and validated on a real social network dataset.

The present work explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering feature semantics from image data. The features appearing in the image database are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Feature Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between features is used as an indicative of their contextual similarity. K-means clustering is used to aggregate similar features. In this paper, we show that the Feature Space model based on Random Indexing can be used effectively to constellate similar features. The proposed clustering approach has been applied to the Corel databases and motivating results have obtained.

Boundary Extraction for Imperfectly Segmented Nuclei in Breast Histopathology Images - A Convex Edge Grouping Approach	COMBINATORIAL IMAGE ANALYSIS, IWCIA 2014	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis (IWCIA)	MAY 28-30, 2014	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC		Brno Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn	Histopathology; Breast cancer; Nuclei segmentation; Boundary extraction; Edge grouping		The detection of cell nuclei plays a significant role in automated breast cancer grading and classification. Although many algorithms for nuclei detection are present in contemporary literature, there is a general arduousness in automatically segmenting nuclei which have an inhomogenous interior and weak boundaries revealed by uneven staining. Such nuclei are common in high grade breast cancer cells. This paper presents an automated boundary extraction methodology for detecting the broken or missing boundaries of imperfectly-segmented nuclei in breast histopathology images. The images are first segmented using K-means clustering method, to retrieve the prospective nuclei regions which may contain these imperfectly segmented nuclei. Following this, a boundary extraction methodology based on the grouping of approximately convex boundaries is used to uncover missing edges and connect the gaps inbetween them. The study is focused on patchy and open vesicular nuclei which are common in high grade breast cancers and which normally pose a challenge for automatic segmentation techniques. Using a sample size of a 100 images of nuclei for this evaluation, the proposed method yielded sensitivity and specificity rates of 90% and 93% with average Hausdorff distance measuring 59. In comparison, the same three factors achieved by employing color-based K-means clustering technique amounted to 49%, 92% and 323, whereas color deconvolution yielded 85%, 69% and 373 and intensity-based segmentation returned 14%, 97% and 351.

To ensure suitability for practical use, the recognition performance must be maintained even when there are changes in the illumination environment. First, a color calibration process using a k-means clustering scheme is introduced as a way of ensuring high performance in color detection. In the proposed method the thresholds for hue values are decided before the recognition process, as a color calibration scheme. The second method of enhancing accuracy involves making a majority decision. Many image frames are obtained from one hand shape before the transition to the next shape. The frames in this hand shape formation time span are used for shape recognition by majority voting based on the recognition results from each frame. It has been verified by carrying out experiments under different illumination conditions that the proposed technique can raise the recognition performance.

ANFIS modeling of Electro-Hydraulic Actuator system through physical modeling and FCM gap statistic in initial FIS determination	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						ANFIS; EHA; physical modeling; cluster number; FCM; gap statistic	INTEGRATE LEARNING-MECHANISMS; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; ALGORITHM; CLUSTERS; NUMBER; COMPENSATION; CONTROLLER; PREDICTION; LOGIC	The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) modeling technique has shown the ability to model nonlinear system at high accuracy. The initial Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is required before ANFIS parameters' training. The generation of initial FIS requires the number of inputs, number of clusters and cluster centers to be determined. Instead of determining the above parameters by heuristic approach, the number and variable of inputs of an Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (EHA) system are determined through mathematical derivation of the system. The number of clusters for each input is determined via fuzzy gap statistic, which applies Fuzzy C-means (FCM) instead of k-means of gap statistic in calculating the within cluster dispersion. FCM clustering also provides the center of each cluster identified. Information of the input variables and cluster numbers as well as cluster centers are used to obtain initial FIS. ANFIS hybrid training algorithm is used to train the initial FIS for parameters. The result shows that the model obtained using ANFIS approach can estimate the EHA's system response at high precision.	[Ling, T. G.; Rahmat, M. F.; Husain, A.

This flow velocity is difficult to estimate due to complex nature of the physical processes. It has been shown that the model predictions may vary several orders of magnitude for the same inputs. This paper introduces a systematic approach to reduce this discrepancy using data clustering, model selection, and cluster identification techniques. The case study results show that the H-spread of the error percentages between the predictions and experimental velocities are reduced from 71.6% to 34.4%.

Evaluate the implementation of a government planning policy (Liveable Neighbourhoods Guidelines) and its impacts on residents' walking behaviors. Design. Cross-sectional study of participants from the RESIDential Environments project (RESIDE). Setting. Nineteen "liveable'' and 17 "conventionally designed'' housing developments across Perth, Western Australia. Subjects. Five hundred ninety-four participants from RESIDE who resided in 36 housing developments. Measures. Developed in geographic information systems to assess the on-ground implementation of 43 policy requirements. Policy compliance was defined as the degree to which construction of the developments adhered to the standards outlined. Walking behaviors were measured using the Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire. K-means cluster analyses identified groups of homogeneous developments with respect to policy implementation. Analysis. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the likelihood of undertaking any and >= 60 minutes of transport and recreational walking associated with (1) policy compliance and (2) different clusters of developments. Results. There were few significant differences in on-ground outcomes between the two development types. Despite incomplete implementation, the odds of walking for transport increased with overall levels of policy compliance (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.08) and compliance with the community design (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.13-1.42), movement network (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.38-4.50), and lot layout elements (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50). Conclusion. Consistent with the aims of the policy, residents in walkable (i.e., liveable) neighborhoods may be more physically active.

Subha			A SPARSE BASED RAIN REMOVAL ALGORITHM FOR IMAGE SEQUENCES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION			English	Article						Sparse; dictionary learning; TOMP; rain removal	STREAKS; VIDEO	Videos taken for border security and outdoor surveillance in bad weather conditions will severely suffer from degradation of information. This paper presents a rain degraded image enhancement algorithm based on sparse coding for robot vision. Sparse coding is a technique of finding a sparse representation for a given signal with a minimum number of significant coefficients corresponding to the atoms in a dictionary. Hence the size of the dictionary is usually a trade-off between approximation speed and accuracy. This paper adapts K means clustering based dictionary pruning algorithm to find an optimized dictionary for the given data set. This optimized dictionary selection will provide an increased convergence speed and performance to the proposed method by ensuring minimum error as well as sparsity of representation. The proposed method makes use of online dictionary learning and tree search based orthogonal matching pursuit (TBOMP) for sparse coding to retrieve the rain degraded image. This paper also examines the proposed method with other well-known dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides improved performance in visual quality and also provides less computation time.	[Chinniah, Ramya; Rani, S.

Optimization algorithms have their advantages in guiding iterative computation to search for global optima while avoiding local optima. The algorithms help speed up the clustering process by converging into a global optimum early with multiple search agents in action. Inspired by nature, some contemporary optimization algorithms which include Ant, Bat, Cuckoo, Firefly, and Wolf search algorithms mimic the swarming behavior allowing them to cooperatively steer towards an optimal objective within a reasonable time. It is known that these so-called nature-inspired optimization algorithms have their own characteristics as well as pros and cons in different applications. When these algorithms are combined with K-means clustering mechanism for the sake of enhancing its clustering quality by avoiding local optima and finding global optima, the new hybrids are anticipated to produce unprecedented performance. In this paper, we report the results of our evaluation experiments on the integration of nature-inspired optimization methods into K-means algorithms. In addition to the standard evaluation metrics in evaluating clustering quality, the extended K-means algorithms that are empowered by nature-inspired optimization methods are applied on image segmentation as a case study of application scenario.

Most active learning approaches select either uncertain or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels. Although several active learning algorithms have been proposed to combine the two criteria for query selection, they are usually ad hoc in finding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative and fail to take the diversity of instances into account. We address this challenge by presenting a new active learning framework which considers uncertainty, representativeness, and diversity creation. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the uncertainty, representativeness, and diversity of an instance. Firstly, use instances' uncertainty and representativeness to constitute the most informative set. Then, use the kernel k-means clustering algorithm to filter the redundant samples and the resulting samples are queried for labels. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art active learning approaches.

J	Lu, CJ; Chang, CC				Lu, Chi-Jie; Chang, Chi-Chang			A Hybrid Sales Forecasting Scheme by Combining Independent Component Analysis with K-Means Clustering and Support Vector Regression	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ALGORITHM; MODEL; TIME; INDUSTRY; WHOLESALERS; SELECTION; SYSTEM; SVR	Sales forecasting plays an important role in operating a business since it can be used to determine the required inventory level to meet consumer demand and avoid the problem of under/overstocking. Improving the accuracy of sales forecasting has become an important issue of operating a business. This study proposes a hybrid sales forecasting scheme by combining independent component analysis (ICA) with K-means clustering and support vector regression (SVR). The proposed scheme first uses the ICA to extract hidden information from the observed sales data. The extracted features are then applied to K-means algorithm for clustering the sales data into several disjoined clusters. Finally, the SVR forecasting models are applied to each group to generate final forecasting results. Experimental results from information technology (IT) product agent sales data reveal that the proposed sales forecasting scheme outperforms the three comparison models and hence provides an efficient alternative for sales forecasting.

The average values of L, R, and F excluding monetary covered by national health insurance program are computed for each cluster. In addition, customer value matrix is used to analyze customer values of twelve clusters in terms of frequency and monetary. Customer relationship matrix considering length and recency is also applied to classify different types of customers from these twelve clusters. The results show that three clusters can be classified into loyal patients with L, R, and F values greater than the respective average L, R, and F values, while three clusters can be viewed as lost patients without any variable above the average values of L, R, and F. When different types of patients are identified, marketing strategies can be designed to meet different patients' needs.

First, we extended DBSCAN with the orientation constraint to partition the whole point set of traces to clusters representing road segments. Second, we proposed an adaptive k-means algorithm that the k value is determined by an angle threshold to reconstruct nearly straight line segments. Third, the line segments are grouped according to the 'Good Continuity' principle of Gestalt Law to form a 'Stroke' for recovering the road map. Experiment results show that our algorithm is robust to noise and sampling rate. In comparison with previous work, our method has advantages to infer the road maps from sparsely-sampled GPS traces.

Although clustering has been extensively studied, a problem remains significant: iterative techniques like k-means clustering are especially sensitive to initial starting conditions. An unreasonable selection of initial points leads to problems including local minima and massive computation. In this paper, a spatial contiguity analysis-based approach is proposed, aiming to solve this problem. It employs principal component analysis (PCA) to identify data points that are likely extracted from different clusters as initial points. This helps to avoid local minima, and accelerates the computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on several benchmark datasets.

Many research contributions about this issue have been recently published under the umbrella of the smart cities research. In this work, we sketch a possible framework to optimize the tourist bus in the city of Barcelona. Our framework will extract information from Twitter and other web services, such as Foursquare to infer not only the most visited places in Barcelona, but also the trajectories and routes that tourist follow. After that, instead of using complex geospatial or trajectory clustering methods, we propose to use simpler clustering techniques as k-means or DBScan but using a real sequence of symbols as a distance measure to incorporate in the clustering process the trajectory information.

In this paper we propose a series of strategies to improve the efficiency of k-means for massive high-dimensional data points on MapReduce. First, we use locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to map data points into buckets, based on which, the original data points is converted into the weighted representative points as well as the outlier points. Then an effective center initialization algorithm is proposed, which can achieve higher quality of the initial centers. Finally, a pruning strategy is proposed to speed up the iteration process by pruning the unnecessary distance computation between centers and data points. An extensive empirical study shows that the proposed techniques can improve both efficiency and accuracy of k-means on MapReduce greatly.

This representation belongs to the penta-valued category and it has three chromatic components (red, blue and green) and two achromatic components (black and white). The proposed penta-valued representation is obtained by constructing a fuzzy partition in the RGB color space. In the structure of the penta-valued representation, it is defined the well known negation operator and supplementary, two new unary operators: the dual and the complement. Also, using the Bhattacharyya formula, it is defined a new inter-color similarity. Next, the obtained inter-color similarity is used in the framework of k-means clustering algorithm. On this way, it results a new color image clustering method. Some examples are presented in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed multi-valued color descriptor.

These three approaches are: kernel k-means to optimize multilevel weighted graph cuts, Normalized Cuts and Graph Cuts, respectively. The bag-of-bags of words (BBoW) model, is an approach based on irregular pyramid partitions over the image. An image is first represented as a connected graph of local features on a regular grid of pixels. Irregular partitions (subgraphs) of the image are further built by using graph partitioning methods. Each subgraph in the partition is then represented by its own signature. The BBoW model with the aid of graph, extends the classical bag-of-words (BoW) model, by embedding color homogeneity and limited spatial information through irregular partitions of an image. Compared to existing methods for image retrieval, such as Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM), the BBoW model does not assume that similar parts of a scene always appear at the same location in images of the same category. The extension of the proposed model to pyramid gives rise to a method we name irregular pyramid matching (IPM). The experiments on Caltech-101 benchmark demonstrate that applying kernel k-means to graph clustering process produces better retrieval results, as compared with other graph partitioning methods such as Graph Cuts and Normalized Cuts for BBoW. Moreover, this proposed method achieves comparable results and outperforms SPM in 19 object categories on the whole Caltech-101 dataset.

The main objective of quantization process is that significant information should be preserved while reducing the color of an image. In other words, quantization process shouldn't cause significant information loss in the image. In this paper, a short review of color quantization is presented and a new color quantization method based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with the performance of the most widely used quantization methods such as K-means, Fuzzy C Means (FCM), minimum variance and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the others.

This framework initially makes use of clustering analysis and then use the result of clustering analysis as a reference-studying sample. Secondly, AdaBoost integrated several classification methods is used to classify the samples and get a stable classification rule. To prove the method feasible, this paper shows an empirical study of classifying retail outlets of a tobacco market in a city of China. In this practice, k-means is used to make clustering analysis, and AdaBoost integrated RBF neural network, CART, and SVM is used in classification. In the empirical study, this method successfully divides retail outlets into different classes based on the sales ability.

One such problem is image segmentation. This task is used for object (contour) extraction from images to create sensible representation of the image. There are many image segmentation and optimization methods. This work is focused on selected evolutionary optimization methods. Namely, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and differential evolution. Our image segmentation method is inspired in algorithm known as k-means.

We compare original k-means algorithm with evolutionary approaches and we show that our evolutionary approaches easily outperform the classical approach.

For the color characteristic of greenhouse environment, the clustering segmentation of the image is performed based on K-means algorithm to achieve the respective cluster of the path and green crop information. Then, the redundant and interference information existing in the clustered image is eliminated by a morphological corrosion so as to obtain the complete and clear path information. Compared with the conventional threshold segmentation methods, the proposed method can solve the problem of too large memory occupation and too long calculation time caused by the unclear segmentation information for the subsequent Hough transform, thus can enhance the rapidity of the greenhouse path recognition and meet the real-time requirements of automatic navigation and operation of the greenhouse robot. The experiment results show that for the greenhouse robot working in the environment with a complex background and variable light, the proposed method can significantly reduce the effect of the nonuniform illumination on the navigation, that is, has a good robustness to the nonuniform illumination. Furthermore, the processing time of a single image is reduced by 53.26%, so the rapidity of the path recognition can be significantly improved.

Our approach generates an over-segmentation based on voxel cloud connectivity, where a modified k-means algorithm selects supervoxel seeds and associates similar neighboring voxels to form segments. Given the data stream from a potentially mobile sensor, we solve for the camera transformation between consecutive frames using a joint optimization over point correspondences and image appearance. The aligned point cloud may then be integrated into a consistent model coordinate frame. Previously labeled points are used to mask incoming points from the new frame, while new and previous boundary points extend the existing segmentation. We evaluate the algorithm on newly-generated RGB-D datasets.

J	Marchetti, Y; Zhou, Q				Marchetti, Yuliya; Zhou, Qing			Solution path clustering with adaptive concave penalty	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Clustering; sparsity; concave regularization; co-ordinate descent; MM algorithm	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; VARIABLE SELECTION; COORDINATE DESCENT; K-MEANS; REGULARIZATION; REGRESSION; LASSO; OPTIMIZATION; SPARSITY; NUMBER	Fast accumulation of large amounts of complex data has created a need for more sophisticated statistical methodologies to discover interesting patterns and better extract information from these data. The large scale of the data often results in challenging high-dimensional estimation problems where only a minority of the data shows specific grouping patterns. To address these emerging challenges, we develop a new clustering methodology that introduces the idea of a regularization path into unsupervised learning. A regularization path for a clustering problem is created by varying the degree of sparsity constraint that is imposed on the differences between objects via the minimax concave penalty with adaptive tuning parameters. Instead of providing a single solution represented by a cluster assignment for each object, the method produces a short sequence of solutions that determines not only the cluster assignment but also a corresponding number of clusters for each solution. The optimization of the penalized loss function is carried out through an MM algorithm with block coordinate descent. The advantages of this clustering algorithm compared to other existing methods are as follows: it does not require the input of the number of clusters; it is capable of simultaneously separating irrelevant or noisy observations that show no grouping pattern, which can greatly improve data interpretation; it is a general methodology that can be applied to many clustering problems. We test this method on various simulated datasets and on gene expression data, where it shows better or competitive performance compared against several clustering methods.

Segmenting knowledge management (KM) practitioners and its relationship to performance variation - some empirical evidence	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance; India; Knowledge management; Cluster analysis	ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; RESEARCH ISSUES; TECHNOLOGY; CAPABILITIES; PERSPECTIVE; FIRM; IMPROVEMENT; FRAMEWORK; ENABLERS; BEHAVIOR	Purpose - This paper aims at identifying segments among knowledge management (KM) practitioners and analyzes whether performance varies across these segments. The field of KM aims at enhancing performance through knowledge practitioners. However, not all KM implementations have similar outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is conducted through secondary sources. Based on the themes identified for research, qualitative research through a focus group discussion (FGD) and personal interviews is used to explore the themes. This is used to develop a conceptual KM framework. An instrument is developed which is tested for validity and reliability. The instrument is administered to respondents and 313 responses are obtained. Convenience sampling is used to select the respondents. Further, k-means cluster is used to identify segments among KM practitioners. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is conducted to determine if the average scores of KM constructs varied between the three clusters. Further, ANOVA test is also used to analyze whether organizational and financial performance scores vary between the three clusters. Post hoc test is used to determine the extent of variation between cluster pairs. Findings - The results show that the sample comprises three segments which were subsequently labeled as active, partly and passive KM practitioners. It was found that active KM practitioners scored highest on various KM constructs, passive KM practitioners scored the least and partly KM practitioners had scores in between the two. One-way ANOVA results showed that the average scores of KM constructs varied significantly between the three clusters. The results show that a significant difference is found in organizational as well as financial performance between any two cluster pairs. Research limitations/implications - The sample comprises 313 respondents, of which around 65 per cent are from services industry and 67 per cent from private sector. A higher representation from public sector and manufacturing industry would have made the comparison more meaningful. The findings are based on data collected from India, and therefore, the results may not be generalizable to all economies. Practical implications - The three clusters identified from the sample data may help organizations who have initiated the KM process to benchmark themselves with the obtained clusters and identify the trust areas important to their KM initiative. Originality/value - The study builds upon both qualitative methodology through FGD and personal interviews and quantitative methodology through questionnaire and surveys. This comprehensive coverage of KM constructs and identification of respondent clusters is insightful. It also provides researchers useful means to enhance performance through KM within clusters.

For this purpose, we built radial basis function neural networks to represent the proportional logic which has exactly three variables in each clause. We used the Prey-predator algorithm to calculate the output weights of the neural networks, while the K-means clustering algorithm is used to determine the hidden parameters (the centers and the widths). Mean of the sum squared error function is used to measure the activity of the two algorithms. We applied the developed technique with the recurrent radial basis function neural networks to represent the quantified Boolean formulas. The new technique can be applied to solve many applications such as electronic circuits and NP-complete problems.

Typologies of students are useful to provide a better understanding of students' behavior to assist an institution in the development of programs to maximize students' experiences and achievements. This study used a typological schema to differentiate 315 freshmen at the time of entry into the American Degree Transfer Program (ADP). Data were collected over three semesters using the Cooperative Institutional Research Freshmen Survey (CIRP), developed by the University of California, on students during their first day of the orientation week. Data reduction was done by exploratory factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis was used to obtain categorical typology of students. We identified seven distinctive and meaningful students' types, namely Leaders, Status Strivers, Scholars, Undecided, Uncommitted, Artists and Social Activists. The Uncommitted and Undecided represented the largest subgroups of freshmen standing at 28% and 25% respectively. Uncommitted students scored negatively on all variables pertaining to career success, self-confidence, social concern, academic matters and artistic abilities. Undecided students reported their choice of the ADP was largely influenced by their parents, school teachers and school counselors. The findings of this study can be leveraged to academic interventions and special guidance to specific at-risk subgroups so as to produce positive outcomes at the exit point. It can also inform institutional marketing to focus on those people who play a significant role in a student's choice of a university. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Cheong, K.

J	Hacohen-Kerner, Y; Margaliot, O				Hacohen-Kerner, Yaakov; Margaliot, Orr			Authorship Attribution of Responsa Using Clustering	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						authorship attribution; Hebrew; responsa; text clustering; unsupervised machine learning methods; word lists	STYLISTIC FEATURE SETS; HISTORICAL PERIOD; ETHNIC-ORIGIN; CLASSIFIERS; DOCUMENTS	Authorship attribution of text documents is a "hot" domain in research; however, almost all of its applications use supervised machine learning (ML) methods. In this research, we explore authorship attribution as a clustering problem, that is, we attempt to complete the task of authorship attribution using unsupervised machine learning methods. The application domain is responsa, which are answers written by well-known Jewish rabbis in response to various Jewish religious questions. We have built a corpus of 6,079 responsa, composed by five authors who lived mainly in the 20th century and containing almost 10M words. The clustering tasks that have been performed were according to two or three or four or five authors. Clustering has been performed using three kinds of word lists: most frequent words (FW) including function words (stopwords), most frequent filtered words (FFW) excluding function words, and words with the highest variance values (HVW); and two unsupervised machine learning methods: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM). The best clustering tasks according to two or three or four authors achieved results above 98%, and the improvement rates were above 40% in comparison to the "majority" (baseline) results. The EM method has been found to be superior to K-means for the discussed tasks. FW has been found as the best word list, far superior to FFW. FW, in contrast to FFW, includes function words, which are usually regarded as words that have little lexical meaning. This might imply that normalized frequencies of function words can serve as good indicators for authorship attribution using unsupervised ML methods. This finding supports previous findings about the usefulness of function words for other tasks, such as authorship attribution, using supervised ML methods, and genre and sentiment classification.

First, the determinants of the OC content variability in soil O-horizons were examined, then the OC content was mapped at the national scale and this map was used to estimate the OC stocks for French forest soils. Three soil datasets were used. Two were national datasets provided by national soil survey programs for soils knowledge and inventory and soil quality survey (IGCS and RMQS). One was provided by the Level I of the European program BioSoil. Various covariates were used to identify the determinants of OC stocks in O-horizons: the soil descriptions provided by the pre-mentioned datasets, with collection of biological, chemical and physical properties of O-horizons and soils, plus a description of surrounding landscapes and climate properties. For OC content mapping in O-horizons, spatially exhaustive covariates were used, such as a digital elevation model (SRTM DEM, 90-m grid) and its derived attributes, the French soils map (1:1,000,000), climatic and land use data. Predictive models of OC stocks in the O-horizons were created using Generalized Boosted Regression Models. Estimation of uncertainties has been afterwards modeled using fuzzy k-means clustering. The final OC stocks in O soil layers were estimated to 15 TgC.	[Lacoste, M.; Martin, M. P.; Saby, N. P. A.; Paroissien, J. -B.; Lehmann, S.; de Forges, A. C.

In Bag of Visual Words framework, image is represented as vector of frequencies of Visual Words, typically of length from hundreds to thousands elements. A dictionary of Visual Words is produced from image keypoints detected by SIFT algorithm and quantized into words by k-means clustering. In the paper we use Mutual Information and Information Gain as methods for selecting these words that are the most important for efficient image classification. There are four novel methods, which expand use of classic Mutual Information and Information Gain in line with our previous feature selection methods. We consider two basic selection strategies: one-vs-all and one-vs-one, as well as multi class and multi attribute value problems. The experimental session we have conducted has shown a positive effect of our modification, when applied to image classification by Support Vector Machines. The results showed that visual word selection based on modified Mutual Information in most cases wins over methods based on Information Gain.

The clustering is performed using an improved asymmetric version of the well-known k-means algorithm. The improved asymmetric k-means algorithm is the second proposal of this paper. As a result, we obtain the two-stage fully-asymmetric data analysis technique. In this way, we maintain the structural consistency of the both utilized methods, because they are both formulated in asymmetric version, and consequently, they both properly adjust to asymmetric relationships in analyzed data. The results of our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The high quality seeds are given input to K-Means as the set of initial seeds to produce the final clusters. DenClust uses a density based approach for initial seed selection. It calculates the density of each record, where the density of a record is the number of records that have the minimum distances with the record. This approach is expected to produce high quality initial seeds for K-Means resulting in high quality clusters from a dataset. The performance of DenClust is compared with five (5) existing techniques namely CRUDAW, AGCUK, Simple K-means (SK), Basic Farthest Point Heuristic (BFPH) and New Farthest Point Heuristic (NFPH) in terms of three (3) external cluster evaluation criteria namely F-Measure, Entropy, Purity and two (2) internal cluster evaluation criteria namely Xie-Beni Index (XB) and Sum of Square Error (SSE). We use three (3) natural datasets that we obtain from the UCI machine learning repository. DenClust performs better than all five existing techniques in terms of all five evaluation criteria for all three datasets used in this study.

This paper presents a novel swarm-base clustering algorithm inspired from flock movement. Many algorithms solve the problem by optimizing a cost function but ours clusters data by applying one rule on data agent movements. We demonstrated that not only this simple rule is sufficient but completely effective in accurately dividing the data into natural clusters. It is a good model of how simply nature solves complex problems. Unlike some algorithms, this one does not need number of desired cluster in advance and discovers it by itself correctly. Eight data sets were used to compare the algorithm with five well-known algorithms. K-means and k-harmonic fail to find none-Gaussian clusters and two other swarm-base algorithms suffer severely from performance but our algorithm works successfully in both cases. The result confirms the superiority of our method.

The toxicity evaluation requires time consuming and expensive undertaking, leading to the deprivation of the methods employed for screening chemicals pointing towards the need to develop more efficient toxicity assessment systems. Computational approaches have reduced the time as well as the cost for evaluating the toxicity and kinetic behavior of any chemical. The accessibility of a large amount of data and the intense need of turning this data into useful information have attracted the attention towards data mining. Machine Learning, one of the powerful data mining techniques has evolved as the most effective and potent tool for exploring new insights on combinatorial relationships among various experimental data generated. The article accounts on some sophisticated machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-mean clustering and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) with some of the available tools used for classification, sorting and toxicological evaluation of data, clarifying, how data mining and machine learning interact cooperatively to facilitate knowledge discovery. Addressing the association of some commonly used expert systems, we briefly outline some real world applications to consider the crucial role of data set partitioning.

Many methods have been designed to remedy this defect. In this paper, we propose a new descriptor to describe the local spatio-temporal distribution information of each point. This new descriptor, combined with HOG3D, is used to describe human actions. K-means clustering algorithm is introduced to generate codebook of visual words, achieving the integration of two features under the BOW model. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for action recognition. We extensively test our method on the standard Weizmann and KTH action datasets. The results show its validity and good performance.

A new heat transfer fluid for concentrating solar systems: Particle flow in tubes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOLARPACES 2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE	Energy Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference of the SolarPACES	SEP 17-20, 2013	Las Vegas, NE	SolarPACES		dense suspension of solid particles; fluidization; central solar receiver; heat transfer fluid; heat transfer coefficient	RECEIVER; DECARBONATION	This paper demonstrates a new concept of heat transfer fluid (HTF) for CSP applications, developed in the frame of both a National and a European project (CSP2 FP7 project). It involves a dense suspension of small solid particles. This innovation is currently. The dense suspension of particles receiver (DSPR) consists in creating the upward circulation of a dense suspension of particles (solid fraction in the range 30%-40%) in vertical absorbing tubes submitted to concentrated solar energy. So the suspension acts as a heat transfer fluid with a heat capacity similar to a liquid HTF but only limited in temperature by the working temperature limit of the receiver tubes. Suspension temperatures up to 750 degrees C are expected for metallic tubes, thus opening new opportunities for high efficiency thermodynamic cycles such as supercritical steam and carbon dioxide. First experimental results were obtained during on-sun testing with CNRS solar facility of a single tube DSPR for an outlet temperature lower than 300 degrees C. In this lab-scale experimental setup, the solar absorber is a single opaque metallic tube, containing upward solid circulation, located inside a cylindrical cavity dug in a receiver made of refractory, and submitted to the concentrated solar radiation through a 0.10m x 0.50m slot. The absorber is a 42.4 mm o.d. stainless steel tube. SiC was used because of its thermal properties, availability and rather low cost. The 63.9 mu m particle mean diameter permits a good fluidization with almost no bubbles, for very low air velocities. Solar flux densities in the range 200-250 kW/m(2) were tested resulting in solid temperature increase ranging between 50 and 150 degrees C. The mean wall-to-suspension heat transfer coefficient (h) was calculated from experimental data. It is very sensitive to the solid fraction of the solid suspension, which was varied from 27% to 36%. These latter values are one order of magnitude larger than the solid fraction in circulating fluidized beds operating at much higher air velocity. Heat transfer coefficients ranging from 140 to 500 W/m(2).K have been obtained; i.e. 400 W/m(2). K mean value for standard operating conditions at low temperature. (C) 2013 G. Flamant.

The algorithm is a simple sampling procedure and can be described as follows: Pick the first center randomly from the given points. For i > 1, pick a point to be the ith center with probability proportional to the square of the Euclidean distance of this point to the closest previously (i - 1) chosen centers. The k-means++ seeding algorithm is not only simple and fast but also gives an O(log k) approximation in expectation as shown by Arthur and Vassilvitskii [7]. There are datasets [7,3] on which this seeding algorithm gives an approximation factor of Omega(log k) in expectation. However, it is not clear from these results if the algorithm achieves good approximation factor with reasonably high probability (say 1/poly(k)). Brunsch and Roglin [9] gave a dataset where the k-means++ seeding algorithm achieves an O(log k) approximation ratio with probability that is exponentially small in k. However, this and all other known lowerbound examples [7,3] are high dimensional. So, an open problem was to understand the behavior of the algorithm on low dimensional datasets. In this work, we give a simple two dimensional dataset on which the seeding algorithm achieves an O(log k) approximation ratio with probability exponentially small in k. This solves open problems posed by Mahajan et al. [13] and by Brunsch and Roglin [9].

The resulting clusters of countries are similar but not identical to quartile groupings found using the overall EFW index. Simple comparisons of socio-economic outcomes along the one-dimensional EFW index yield different results compared with the multidimensional-based country clusters. In particular, social democratic market economies appear to outperform liberal market economies using these simple comparisons.

R.; Nayak, Shailesh			Coupled correction and classification of hyperspectral imagery for mapping coral reefs of Agatti and Flat Islands, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN SYSTEM; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; IMAGING SPECTROMETER; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MANAGEMENT; SIMULATION; AUSTRALIA; HYPERION; WATERS; SPACE	Among the various remote-sensing options available today to map ecomorphological classes of corals, hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the best options by virtue of its spectral capabilities, while high spatial resolution is a necessary condition to resolve finer morphological features spatially. Given high-spatial resolution data of equal to or better than 30 m, the discrimination capability of end-members of multi-/hyperspectral satellite data is dependent on the efficacy of the correction for atmospheric effects and the intervening water column. In this study, a coupled approach to account for oceanic and atmospheric radiative contributions, called the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Radiative Transfer (COART), was applied to Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) mission Hyperion image data acquired over the coral reefs of Agatti Island in the Lakshadweep Islands, Arabian Sea and Flat Island in the Andaman Islands, Bay of Bengal, India. The paper presents an open-source approach to correct and perform unsupervised classification of Hyperion imagery using a custom-built software toolkit called HyperCorals. The study finds that Hyperion has sufficient capabilities for discrimination of a few ecomorphological classes and can be improved further by using coupled radiative transfer models. Correcting for the intervening water column helps in classifying submerged features. The k-means classification offers a simpler classification method to classify an image of a subset with 42 selected spectral channels of Hyperion in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region than the traditional Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). The classification results using the cosine distance metric over 42 selected spectral channels of Hyperion in the VNIR region offer the potential to differentiate between various ecomorphological zones. The study also presents results from sensitivity analysis experiments and discusses the relative importance of three parameters: water column depth, bottom albedo, and chlorophyll concentration on the overall correction and classification of the imagery.

The RFID tags were distributed near elevator exits on the second and third floors, and outside the doors of three laboratories in the building. An RFID reader was set in a wheelchair and connected to the Internet via a laptop. The different amplitudes recorded on each tag clearly identified the positions of the tags. Calculating the error of distances, the differences between self- and cross-correlation coefficients, and the K-means clustering of these tags enables dividing the space under surveillance into several adjoining regions. Thus, this approach effectuates enlarging the space which can be covered.

This paper proposes a novel method to detect the lane center via rapid extraction and high accuracy clustering of vehicle motion trajectories. First, we use the activity map to realize automatically the extraction of road region, the calibration of dynamic camera, and the setting of three virtual detecting lines. Secondly, the three virtual detecting lines and a local background model with traffic flow feedback are used to extract and group vehicle feature points in unit of vehicle. Then, the feature point groups are described accurately by edge weighted dynamic graph and modified by a motion-similarity Kalman filter during the sparse feature point tracking. After obtaining the vehicle trajectories, a rough k-means incremental clustering with Hausdorff distance is designed to realize the rapid online extraction of lane center with high accuracy. The use of rough set reduces effectively the accuracy decrease, which results from the trajectories that run irregularly. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can detect lane center position efficiently, the affected time of subsequent tasks can be reduced obviously, and the safety of traffic surveillance systems can be enhanced significantly.

Object-based change detection in wind storm-damaged forest using high-resolution multispectral images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							COVER CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL DATA; INVENTORY DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; TEXTURE; RIPARIAN; FEATURES; LANDSAT; LEVEL	Natural disasters are generally brutal and may affect large areas, which then need to be rapidly mapped to assess the impacts of such events on ecosystems and to prevent related risks. Ground investigations may be complex, whereas remote-sensing techniques enable a fast regional-scale assessment of damage and offer a cost-effective option for large and inaccessible areas. Here, an efficient, quasi-automatic object-based method for change mapping using high-spatial-resolution (HR) (5-10 m) satellite imagery is proposed. Our contribution comprises two main novelties with respect to similar works in forestry. First, an automatic feature selection process optimizes the image segmentation and classification steps via an original calibration-like procedure. Second, an automatic bitemporal classification enables the separation of damaged and intact areas thanks to a new descriptor based on the level of fragmentation of the obtained regions. The mean shift algorithm is used in both the segmentation and classification processes. The method was assessed in a maritime pine forest using bitemporal HR Formosat-2 multispectral images acquired pre- and post-Windstorm Klaus, which occurred in January 2009 in southwestern France. The binary overall classification accuracy reached 87.8% and outperformed a pixel-based K-means classification with no feature selection. A thematic analysis of the results highlights the correlation between the ages of trees and their sensitivity to wind.

J	Xu, LL; Li, J; Wong, A; Wang, C				Xu, Linlin; Li, Jonathan; Wong, Alexander; Wang, Cheng			A KPCA texture feature model for efficient segmentation of RADARSAT-2 SAR sea ice imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; COOCCURRENCE; STATISTICS; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM; MIXTURES; QUIKSCAT; NOISE	Sea ice information obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is crucial for ensuring safe marine navigation and supporting climate change studies in polar regions. We propose a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) local texture feature model for efficient sea ice segmentation. The proposed KPCA texture feature model is significant for several reasons. First, it takes into account the multiplicative nature of SAR speckle noise. The resulting KPCA features therefore assume independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian-like noise, which satisfies the assumptions inherent in classical statistical models such as the k-means algorithm. Second, the KPCA features are compact and statistically independent and therefore capable of reducing data redundancy. Third, the KPCA texture features are discriminative. Finally, the extraction of KPCA features requires less computation. Based on the KPCA model, a segmentation scheme is implemented in four steps. First, local patch-based texture descriptors are extracted from the image. Second, KPCA is performed on the patch-based texture descriptors to obtain compact and discriminative texture features with Gaussian-like noise characteristics. Third, the k-means algorithm is performed on extracted KPCA features to segment the image. Finally, a neighbourhood-based majority voting scheme is employed to determine the final label of each pixel. We compared the proposed method with several other popular sea ice segmentation approaches. The results demonstrated that our method is robust to speckle noise level, is accurate and fast and may thus better support the operational segmentation of sea ice in SAR imagery.

It can be used to identify groups of people who have a high mortality risk. Identifying group is important to compare the characteristics of human that have high and low risk. These characteristics can be seen from the factors that influenced it. Furthermore, there are factors which influence of birth and death child, such us economic, health facility, education, and others. The influence factors of every individual are different, but there are similarities some individuals which live close together or in the close locations. It means there was spatial effect. To identify group in this research, clustering is done by spatial cluster method, which is view to considering the influence of the location or the relationship between locations. One of spatial cluster method is Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal (SKATER). The research was conducted in Bogor Regency, West Java. The goal was to get a cluster of districts based on the factors that influence birth and death child. SKATER build four number of cluster respectively consists of 26, 7, 2, and 5 districts. SKATER has good performance for clustering which include spatial effect. If it compare by other cluster method, K-means has good performance by MANOVA test.

Two of its critical steps are to construct a visual dictionary and to quantize each local feature to its nearest visual word in the dictionary. In this paper, we present the framework of a generalized BoVW (GBoVW) Model in which feature quantization can be replaced by sparse coding based feature encoding. We also propose to use spectral clustering to construct a visual dictionary to overcome the shortcomings of K-Means based clustering algorithms. Image retrieval experiments on ZuBud database indicate that GBoVW Model improves BoVW Model and the visual dictionary generated by spectral clustering achieves better performance than that by K-Means based clustering methods.

However, the clusters produced are often found not in accord with user's perception of the document collection. In this paper we describe a novel framework and explore whether clustering performance can be improved by including user supervision at the feature level. Unlike existing semi-supervised clustering methods, which ask the user to label documents, this framework interactively asks the user to label features. The proposed method ranks all features based on the recent clusters using cluster-based feature selection and presents a list of highly ranked features to the user for labeling. The feature set for the next clustering iteration includes both features accepted by the user and other highly ranked features. The experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that the feature set obtained using the new interactive framework can produce clusters that better match the user's expectations compared with the unsupervised version of the methods. Moreover, we quantify and evaluate the effect of reweighting previously accepted features and of user effort. Different underlying clustering algorithms such as K Means and Multinomial Naive Bayes model are demonstrated to perform very well with the newly proposed framework.

The framework is a combination of our proposed Bayesian-based adaptive mean shift (BAMS), a priori spatial tissue probability maps and fuzzy c-means. BAMS is applied to cluster the tissues in the joint spatial-intensity feature space and then a fuzzy c-means algorithm is employed with initialization by a priori spatial tissue probability maps to assign the clusters into three tissue types; white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed framework is validated on multimodal synthetic as well as on real T1-weighted MR data with varying noise characteristics and spatial intensity inhomogeneity. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated relative to our previous method BAMS and other existing adaptive mean shift framework. Both of these are based on the mode pruning and voxel weighted k-means algorithm for classifying the clusters into WM, GM and CSF tissue. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework to noise and spatial intensity inhomogeneity, and that it exhibits a higher degree of segmentation accuracy in segmenting both synthetic and real MR data compared to competing methods.

Kinetic parameter estimation is formulated as a nonlinear least squares with spatial constraints problem (NLLS-SC) where the spatial constraints are computed from a physiologically driven clustering of dynamic images, and used to reduce noise contamination. An ideal clustering of dynamic images depends on the underlying physiology of functional regions, and in turn, physiological processes are quantified by kinetic parameter estimation. Physiologically driven clustering of dynamic images is performed using a clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means, Spectral Clustering etc) with Kinetic modeling in an iterative handshaking fashion. This gives a map of labels where each functionally homogenous cluster is represented by mean kinetics (cluster centroid). Parametric images are acquired by solving the NLLS-SC problem for each voxel which penalizes spatial variations from its mean kinetics. This substantially reduces noise in the estimation process for each voxel by utilizing kinetic information from physiologically similar voxels (cluster members). Resolution degradation is also substantially minimized as no spatial smoothing between heterogeneous functional regions is performed. The proposed framework is shown to improve the quantitative accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion (MP) PET imaging, and in turn, has the long-term potential to enhance capabilities of MP PET in the detection, staging and management of coronary artery disease.

CBIR extracts images that are relevant to the given query image, based on the features extracted from the contents of the image. Most of the CBIR systems available in the literature are not rotation and scale invariant. Retrieval efficiency is also poor. In this paper, shape features are extracted from the database images and the same are polar raster scanned into specified intervals in both radius and angle, using the proposed Polar Raster Edge Sampling Signature (PRESS) algorithm. Counts of edge points lying in these bins are stored in the feature library. When a query image passed on to the system, the features are extracted in the similar fashion. Subsequently, similarity measure is performed between the query image features and the database image features based on Euclidian Distance similarity measure and the database images that are relevant to the given query image are retrieved. PRESS algorithm has been successfully implemented and tested in a CBIR System developed by us. This technique preserves rotation and scale invariance. It is evaluated by querying different images. The retrieval efficiency is also evaluated by determining precision-recall values for the retrieval results.	[Mathew, Santhosh P.; Zachariah, K.

Anomaly detection algorithms currently proposed can be classified into two class, global algorithm and local algorithm. Global algorithm may lead to miss alarm since the discrimination is not accurate enough. On the contrary, local algorithm may bring about false alarm because of lack of global statistics. An improved RX algorithm integrating local and global statistics is proposed. Firstly K-means algorithm is carried out to cluster the whole image into K class which is determined with a virtual dimension estimation method. Then the improved RX is proposed by integrating the global cluster information and the local statistics. Experiment results show that the improved algorithm can obtain a better detection performance than RX algorithm.

The focus of the evaluation is to identify an approach that produces the best geometric representation from a computational fluid/solid modeling point of view. In particular, extraction of geometries from a wide variety of imaging modalities and noise intensities, to supply to an immersed boundary approach, is targeted. Design/methodology/approach - Two- and three-dimensional images, acquired from optical, X-ray CT, and ultrasound imaging modalities, are segmented with active contours, k-means, and adaptive clustering methods. Segmentation contours are converted to level sets and smoothed as necessary for use in fluid/solid simulations. Results produced by the three approaches are compared visually and with contrast ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio measures. Findings - While the active contours method possesses built-in smoothing and regularization and produces continuous contours, the clustering methods (k-means and adaptive clustering) produce discrete (pixelated) contours that require smoothing using speckle-reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD). Thus, for images with high contrast and low to moderate noise, active contours are generally preferable. However, adaptive clustering is found to be far superior to the other two methods for images possessing high levels of noise and global intensity variations, due to its more sophisticated use of local pixel/voxel intensity statistics. Originality/value - It is often difficult to know a priori which segmentation will perform best for a given image type, particularly when geometric modeling is the ultimate goal. This work offers insight to the algorithm selection process, as well as outlining a practical framework for generating useful geometric surfaces in an Eulerian setting.

Our system includes detection of bare hand from the video sequences by subtracting the background and including only the hand region. The system uses a machine learning approach. In the training stage the keypoints are extracted from the hand posture contour using the affine-scale invariance feature transform (ASIFT), and the keypoints are then clustered using the K-means clustering and mapped into the histogram vector (bag-of-features). Each vector is assigned a label which is treated as input to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for training purpose. In the testing stage, for every frame captured using the webcam, the hand is detected, then, the keypoints are extracted from the hand segment only as described in our algorithm and fed into the cluster model to generate the vector and fed into the ELM training classifier to recognize the hand gesture.

In this paper, we introduce hierarchical divisive clustering with multi view point based similarity measure. The hierarchical clustering is produced by the sequence of repeated bisections. The bisecting incremental k-means with multi view point based similarity measure is used in the clustering. We compare our approach with the existing algorithms on various document collections to verify the advantage of our proposed method.

The method is based on the integration of laser and vision system. The camera is used to recognize the landmarks whereas the laser provides the information for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). K-means clustering method is implemented to extract data from different objects. In addition, the robot avoids the obstacles by the avoidance function. The closed-loop controller reduces the error between the real position and estimated position. Finally, simulation and experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and reliable for navigation in indoor environments.

INTEGRATION OF ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM AND K-MEANS ALGORITHM FOR CUSTOMER CLUSTERING	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; EFFICIENCY; PRODUCTS	This study proposes a novel artificial immune system (AIS)-based clustering algorithm, which integrates with a K-means (AISK) algorithm for a customer clustering problem. Computational results using Iris, Glass, Wine, and Breast Cancer benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed AIS-based clustering algorithm is more accurate than some particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based clustering algorithms. In addition, the model evaluation results using a daily transaction database provided by a cyberstore also show that the proposed AISK algorithm is superior to PSO-based clustering algorithms.

The Ant-Miner is an ant colony optimisation algorithm that extracts predictive rules from datasets and intrinsically works on discrete values. This study has developed a new algorithm, "Enhanced Ant-Miner" (EAM), based on previous works. EAM deals with continuous attributes as well as categorical ones and presents its captured models in the form of predictive rules. EAM has been tested versus SVM, CN2, K-means and hierarchical clustering and the results show that EAM is the best in the context of predictive accuracy. Additionally, its agent-based nature gives it a much more charming ability to speed up the whole process when compared to other trivial miners.

J	Tatar, Y; Yildirim, G				Tatar, Yetkin; Yildirim, Gungor			A DYNAMIC LOCATION ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE BASED ON FINGERPRINT USING A REDUCED RADIO MAP IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY			Turkish	Article						Localization; Wireless Sensor Networks; Fingerprint	INDOOR LOCALIZATION	In closed areas, fingerprint location estimation algorithms using a radio map, which can be used in wireless sensor networks, consist of two phases, mapping and location estimation. There are several important criterions in the phases, for example using of a radio map which has a small capacity and which shows a comprehensive RSSI dispersion, a quick position calculation, a good accuracy rate, and so on. In the study, a novel technique which employs K-Means method to decrease size of the radio map by reducing separately RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data of the anchors has been proposed for indoor position detection in WSNs. Besides, a subfield construction process to increase the accuracy of the estimation has been carried out. In the location estimation phase, a technique which is different from K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) has been preferred. In this technique, unlike KNN the number of the decision cells varies dynamically according to RSSI data received. The system was implemented in a closed environment by using TELOSB nodes. The results of the experiments and the calculations were compared with the results of well-known deterministic methods based on KNN and the validation of the proposed system was tested.

They completed a questionnaire that included the Spanish validated versions of Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire (PMCSQ-2), Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise (BPNES), Perceived Locus of Causality (PLOC), Social Goal Scale-Physical Education (SGS-PE), and several subscales of the IMI. A hierarchical cluster analysis uncovered four independent class climate profiles that were confirmed by a K-Means cluster analysis: "high ego", "low ego-task", "high ego-medium task", and "high task". Several MANOVAs were performed using these clusters as independent variables and the different outcomes as dependent variables (p < .01). Results linked high mastery class climates to positive consequences such as higher students' autonomy, competence, relatedness, intrinsic motivation, effort, enjoyment, responsibility and relationship, as well as low levels of amotivation, boredom and pressure/tension. Students' perceptions of a performance class climate made the positive scores decrease significantly. Cluster 3 revealed that a mastery oriented class structure undermines the negative behavioral and psychological effects of a performance class climate. This finding supports the buffering hypothesis of the achievement goal theory.

A total of 351 students (203 males; 148 females) (M = 14.26 +/- 1.37 years) from 3 different secondary schools agreed to participate. 86.6% (N = 303) showed AGD, mostly mastery-approach dominance (62.9%). We examined the four AGD groups' idiographic profiles and how they relate to certain positive (autonomous motivation and positive affect) and negative variables (controlled motivation and amotivation). The results supported the hypotheses of AGD theory (MANOVA one-way, Wilks' lambda = .609, F(24, 298) = 7.96, p < .001, eta(2) = .15). Subsequently, k-means cluster analysis was performed, yielding 4 distinct achievement goal profiles. The most adaptive was named "mastery goals", while "high achievement goals" were the second most adaptive. AGD participants'distribution across the different motivational clusters was also ascertained (MANOVA one-way, Wilks' lambda = .678, F(12, 910) = 12.01, p < .001, eta(2) = .12).

The algorithm requires minimal human interaction since the initialization process to segment the entire liver in 3D relied on a single computed tomography (CT) slice. The algorithm integrates a localized contouring algorithm with a modified k-means method. The modified k-means segments each slice into five distinct regions belonging to different structures. The liver region is further segmented using localized contouring. The novelty of the algorithm is in the design of the initialization masks for region contouring to minimize human intervention. Intensity based region growing together with novel volume of interest (VOI) based corrections is used to accomplish the single slice initialization. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using 34 liver CT scans. Statistical experiments were performed to determine consistency of segmentation and to assess user dependency on the initialization process. Volume estimations are compared to the manual gold standard. Results show an average accuracy of 97.22% for volumetric calculation with an average Dice coefficient of 0.92. Statistical tests show that the algorithm is highly consistent (P = 0.55) and independent of user initialization (P = 0.20 and Fleiss' Kappa = 0.77 +/- 0.06).

However, the unsupervised clustering techniques are not able to take advantage of exiting knowledge of the functional neuroanatomy readily available from studies of cytoarchitectonic parcellation or meta-analysis of the literature. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised clustering method for parcellating amygdala into functionally homogeneous subregions based on resting state fMRI data. Particularly, the semi-supervised clustering is implemented under the framework of graph partitioning, and adopts prior information and spatial consistent constraints to obtain a spatially contiguous parcellation result. The graph partitioning problem is solved using an efficient algorithm similar to the well-known weighted kernel k-means algorithm. Our method has been validated for parcellating amygdala into 3 subregions based on resting state fMRI data of 28 subjects. The experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed method is more robust than unsupervised clustering and able to parcellate amygdala into centromedial, laterobasal, and superficial parts with improved functionally homogeneity compared with the cytoarchitectonic parcellation result. The validity of the parcellation results is also supported by distinctive functional and structural connectivity patterns of the subregions and high consistency between coactivation patterns derived from a meta-analysis and functional connectivity patterns of corresponding subregions.

More specifically, the robotic nurse should be able to autonomously recognize different situations of surgeries so that the robotic nurse can pass necessary surgical tools to the medical doctors in a timely manner. This paper proposes and explores methods that can classify suture and tying actions during suture operations from the video sequence that observes the surgery scene that includes the surgeon's hands. First, the proposed method uses skin pixel detection and foreground extraction to detect the hand area. Then, interest points are randomly chosen from the hand area so that their 3D SIFT descriptors are computed. A word vocabulary is built by applying hierarchical K-means to these descriptors, and the words' frequency histogram, which corresponds to the feature space, is computed Finally, to classify the actions, either SVM (Support Vector Machine), Nearest Neighbor rule (NN) for the feature space or a method that combines "sliding window" with NN is performed. We collect 53 suture videos and 53 tying videos to build the training set and to test the proposed method experimentally It turns out that the NN gives higher than 90% accuracies, which are better recognition than SVM. Negative actions, which are different from either suture or tying action, are recognized with quite good accuracies, while "Sliding window" did not show significant improvements for suture and tying and cannot recognize negative actions.

SD-OCT also allows the detailed imaging of retinal pathology, aiding clinicians in the diagnosis of sight degrading diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.(1) Disease diagnosis, assessment, and treatment requires a patient to undergo multiple OCT scans, possibly using different scanning devices, to accurately and precisely gauge disease activity, progression and treatment success. However, the use of OCT imaging devices from different vendors, combined with patient movement may result in poor scan spatial correlation, potentially leading to incorrect patient diagnosis or treatment analysis. Image registration can be used to precisely compare disease states by registering differing 3D scans to one another. In order to align 3D scans from different time-points and vendors using registration, landmarks are required, the most obvious being the retinal vasculature. Presented here is a fully automated cross-vendor method to acquire retina vessel locations for OCT registration from fovea centred 3D SD-OCT scans based on vessel shadows. Noise filtered OCT scans are flattened based on vendor retinal layer segmentation, to extract the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer of the retina. Voxel based layer profile analysis and k-means clustering is used to extract candidate vessel shadow regions from the RPE layer. In conjunction, the extracted RPE layers are combined to generate a projection image featuring all candidate vessel shadows. Image processing methods for vessel segmentation of the OCT constructed projection image are then applied to optimize the accuracy of OCT vessel shadow segmentation through the removal of false positive shadow regions such as those caused by exudates and cysts. Validation of segmented vessel shadows uses ground truth vessel shadow regions identified by expert graders at the Vienna Reading Center (VRC). The results presented here are intended to show the feasibility of this method for the accurate and precise extraction of suitable retinal vessel shadows from multiple vendor 3D SD-OCT scans for use in intra-vendor and cross-vendor 3D OCT registration, 2D fundus registration and actual retinal vessel segmentation. The resulting percentage of true vessel shadow segments to false positive segments identified by the proposed system compared to mean grader ground truth is 95%.

Image registration of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) has been studied a lot. Surface-based registration is extensively applied in medical imaging. We develop and evaluate a registration method combine surface-based registration with biomechanical modeling. Four sample cases of patients with PET and MRI breast scans performed within 30 days were collected from hospital. K-means clustering algorithm was used to segment images into two parts, which is fat tissue and neoplasm [2]. Instead of placing extrinsic landmarks on patients' body which may be invasive, we proposed a new boundary condition to simulate breast deformation during two screening. Then a three dimensional model with meshes was built. Material properties were assigned to this model according to previous studies. The whole registration was based on a biomechanical finite element model, which could simulate deformation of breast under pressure.

The analyzed framework includes together processing of neighboring frames using the following blocks: CIELa*b* color space conversion, wavelet transform, edge detection using HF wavelet sub-bands (HF, LH and HH), color segmentation via k-means on a*b* color plane, up-sampling, disparity map (DM) estimation, adaptive post-filtering, and finally, the anaglyph 3D scene generation. During edge detection, the Donoho threshold is computed, then each sub-band is binarized according to a threshold chosen and finally the thresholding image is formed. DM estimation is performed in the following matter: in left stereo image (or frame), a window with varying sizes is used according to the information obtained from binarized sub-band image, distinguishing different texture areas into LL sub-band image. The stereo matching is performed between two (left and right) LL sub-band images using processing with different window sizes. Upsampling procedure is employed in order to obtain the enhanced DM. Adaptive post-processing procedure is based on median filter and k-means segmentation in a*b* color plane. The SSIM and QBP criteria are applied in order to compare the performance of the proposed framework against other disparity map computation techniques. The designed technique has been implemented on DSP TMS320DM648, Matlab's Simulink module over a PC with Windows 7 and using graphic card (NVIDIA Quadro K2000) demonstrating that the proposed approach can be applied in real-time processing mode.

The quality of image features has great influence on detection results, and each kind of feature has its own unique advantage in the process of change detection. It is hard to obtain satisfying results if we only use one kind of feature. This paper extracts image gray scale feature, edge feature and geometric feature for change detection. Firstly, according to the image gray scale feature of the house, K-means classification and binarization are utilized to extract house areas roughly. After that, Hough transformation is used to detect the straight lines and obtain the difference map. To improve the accuracy, minor changes, such as spot-like and linear changes are eliminated by using the geometric shape and size of the objects. At last, we conducted accuracy assessment for the final result. Experiments show that geometric feature plays an important role in extracting target objects and improving the final result, and has obvious advantages and feasibility.

Image smoothing using the Perona-Malik equation with a new estimation method of the contrast parameter	COMPUTATIONAL VISION AND MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING IV			English	Proceedings Paper	4th Eccomas Thematic Conference on Computational Vision and Medical Image Processing (VipIMAGE)	OCT 14-16, 2013	Funchal, PORTUGAL				EDGE-DETECTION; NONLINEAR DIFFUSION; ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION; SCALE-SPACE; SEGMENTATION	The aim of this contribution is to have an efficient smoothing algorithm that preserves edges which provide valuable information for any segmentation process. It is considered the non linear anisotropic diffusion model of Perona-Malik which enhances the edges in the process of diffusion through a variable diffusion coefficient. However the diffusion coefficient is very sensitive to the so called contrast or gradient threshold parameter. This paper proposes a novel methodology for estimation of this contrast parameter based on a partition of the image using the K-means algorithm and a least-square fit to approximate the diffusion coefficient (KMLS). Examples demonstrate that preprocessing by these partial difference equation techniques taking KMLS significantly improves a subsequently edge detection regarding smoothing with traditional methods.

To many, the massive data generated or captured by IoT are considered having highly useful and valuable information. Data mining will no doubt play a critical role in making this kind of system smart enough to provide more convenient services and environments. This paper begins with a discussion of the IoT. Then, a brief review of the features of "data from IoT" and "data mining for IoT' is given. Finally, changes, potentials, open issues, and future trends of this field are addressed.

Strain data was extracted using the Morlet family. The extraction process identified damaging segments, and it was able to shorten the original signal by 74.3%, with less than 10% difference with statistical parameters. The extraction algorithm was able to retain at least 97.9% of fatigue damage. The damaging segments drawn were clustered using the k-means method to provide three groups of segments, i.e., lower, moderate, and higher groups representing statistical values.

J	Meng, R; Xie, NG; Wang, L				Meng, Rui; Xie, Nenggang; Wang, Lu			Multiobjective Game Method Based on Self-Adaptive Space Division of Design Variables and Its Application to Vehicle Suspension	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; MODELS	Based on the similarity between the game theory and the multiobjective design, the bionic mapping and the space mapping are established between the multiobjective optimization model and game model. Then, the multiobjective optimization method based on self-adaptive space division of design variables is proposed. The design variables are divided into multiple strategy subspaces and are assigned to corresponding game players by calculating impact factors, K-means clustering, and correlation analysis. Strategy subspaces of game players are dynamically adjusted in the iteration process. In their own strategy subspaces, each game player takes their payoff function (the mapping of objective function) as monoobjective optimization. It gives the best strategy upon other players. And the best strategies of all players are combined into the group strategy in this game round. Triobjective optimization is carried out for vehicle suspension in this method and it is compared with the traditional game method. The results show that this method has better calculating automaticity and can effectively promote generalization of multiobjective game method and improve the computational efficiency and precision.

This is especially challenging because bone marrow tissue has the same intensity profile as the muscle surrounding the bone. Thus simple methods such as thresholding or adaptive k-means fail to accurately segment vertebrae. While several other algorithms such as level sets may be used for segmentation any algorithm that is clinically deployable has to work in under a few seconds. To address these dual challenges we present here, a new algorithm based on the geodesic distance transform that is capable of segmenting the spinal vertebrae in under one second. To achieve this we extend the theory of the geodesic distance transforms proposed in(1) to incorporate high level anatomical knowledge through adaptive weighting of image gradients. Such knowledge may be provided by the user directly or may be automatically generated by another algorithm. We incorporate information 'learnt' using a previously published machine learning algorithm(2) to segment the L1 to L5 vertebrae. While we present a particular application here, the adaptive geodesic transform is a generic concept which can be applied to segmentation of other organs as well.

Clustering of streaming data is very challenging because streaming data cannot be scanned multiple times and also new concepts may keep evolving in data over time. Inherent uncertainty involved in real world data stream further magnifies the challenge of working with streaming data. Rough set is a soft computing technique which can be used to deal with uncertainty involved in cluster analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel rough set based clustering method for streaming data. It describes a cluster as a pair of lower approximation and an upper approximation. Lower approximation comprises of the data objects that can be assigned with certainty to the respective cluster, whereas upper approximation contains those data objects whose belongingness to the various clusters in not crisp along with the elements of lower approximation. Uncertainty in assigning a data object to a cluster is captured by allowing overlapping in upper approximation. Proposed method generates soft-cluster. Keeping in view the challenges of streaming data, the proposed method is incremental and adaptive to evolving concept. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data sets show that our proposed approach outperforms Leader clustering algorithm in terms of classification accuracy. Proposed method generates more natural clusters as compare to k-means clustering and it is robust to outliers. Performance of proposed method is also analyzed in terms of correctness and accuracy of rough clustering.

Clusters play a vital role for users to organize, summarize and navigate the data effectively. Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a relatively new subfield of artificial intelligence which studies the emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents. It is based on social behavior that can be observed in nature, such as ant colonies, flocks of birds, fish schools and bee hives. SI technique is integrated with clustering algorithms. This paper proposes new approaches for using Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) to cluster data. It is shown how CSA can be used to find the optimally clustering N object into K clusters. The CSA is tested on various data sets, and its performance is compared with those of K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Fuzzy PSO and Genetic K-Means clustering. The simulation results show that the new method carries out better results than the K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Fuzzy PSO and Genetic K-Means.

The evolutionary methods attracted attention and gained popularity among the data mining researchers for clustering due to their expedient implementation, parallel nature, ability to search global optima, and other advantages over conventional methods. However, conventional clustering methods, e. g., K-means, are computationally efficient and widely used local search methods. Therefore, many researchers paid attention to hybrid algorithms. However, most of the algorithms lag in proper balancing of exploration and exploitation of solutions in the search space. In this work, the authors propose a hybrid method DKGK. It uses DE to diversify candidate solutions in the search space. The obtained solutions are refined by K-means. Further, GA with heuristic crossover operator is applied for fast convergence of solutions and the obtained solutions are further refined by K-means. This is why proposed method is called DKGK. Performance of the proposed method is compared to that of Deferential Evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid of DE and K-means (DEKM), and a hybrid of GA and K-Means (GAKM) based on the sum of intra-cluster distances. The results obtained on three real and two synthetic datasets are very encouraging as the proposed method DKGK outperforms all the competing methods.

Because of mainly affected by natural and human factors, groundwater level has evident randomness and fuzziness. In this paper, Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network was foundation, which was combined with k-means (KM) clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create a predictive model, named PCA-KM-RBF. PCA-KM-RBF was applied to predict groundwater level in Yichang Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia. The research showed that PCA could eliminate redundancy between the factors, simplify the structure of RBF neural network, and accelerate convergence speed of neural networks. Meanwhile, the average relative error of PCA-KM-RBF was 6.79%, while the average relative error of normal RBF was 14.14%. Clearly, PCA-KM-RBF could effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of groundwater lever prediction.

We firstly extract the ship and wave regions using the corner detection method and get the separate wave regions using k-means clustering method. An approximate area containing the ship is obtained by subtracting the two regions. Then we get the saliency maps from three features i.e. color, direction and contrast under different scales, which can be combined through weighting these maps. Finally the final saliency map is obtained with a dynamic threshold segmentation. The experimental results indicate that the new method has a good detection effect in big wave regions and show a strong robustness.

More importantly, unsupervised techniques for traffic classification are useful for network administrators to cluster unknown traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for unsupervised traffic classification based on affinity propagation mechanism. The application payloads are parsed into 3-grams and similarities between payloads are computed based on information theory. An affinity propagation based algorithm is used to cluster application payloads according to the payloads similarity metrics. We implement our approach on a system and evaluate our system on three data sets and compare the performance with EM and K-means. The results show that our approach excellently outperforms the EM and K-means clustering algorithms in the clustering categorical data.

This paper proposes a new feature vector based on the wavelet packet transform and singular value decomposition for the detection of vocal fold pathology. k-means clustering based feature weighting is proposed to increase the distinguishing performance of the proposed features. In this work, two databases Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) voice disorders database and MAPACI speech pathology database are used. Four different supervised classifiers such as k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), least-square support vector machine, probabilistic neural network and general regression neural network are employed for testing the proposed features. The experimental results uncover that the proposed features give very promising classification accuracy of 100% for both MEEI database and MAPACI speech pathology database.

How to model various actions in a real-time, robust manner is a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed an improved star skeleton approach to model different actions. An angle iterative algorithm is used to uniform the feature vector. K-means cluttering method was used to label each action, and then a histogram vector is gained through the concept of bag of words (BoWs). Finally we use SVM to classify the video actions. Experimental results on the KTH dataset demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach for action recognition.

It constructs relationship rules of holistic performance enhancement road map. The data-set of relationships between enterprise and its direct customers of the case study organisations in France was used for demonstration. The experiment results show how domain managers powerfully utilise the graphical analysis results to provide the holistic performance improvement and weakness resolution relationship rules. In the long run, organisations are able to use this framework to design and adjust their units to conform the exact customer needs. This paper introduces and explains a new idea of measuring value added along the supply chain from a collaborative perspective. The extended model is adapted from our previous model and from balanced scorecard model. It provides a tool to measure tangible and intangible value between partners.

The rapid growth of technology in recent years brought a lot of contribution in this domain. However it is still challenging task. In this paper we implement Kazakh traditional dance gesture recognition. We use Microsoft Kinect camera to obtain human skeleton and depth information. Then we apply tree-structured Bayesian network and Expectation Maximization algorithm with K-means clustering to calculate conditional linear Gaussians for classifying poses. And finally we use Hidden Markov Model to detect dance gestures. Our main contribution is that we extend Kinect skeleton by adding headwear as a new skeleton joint which is calculated from depth image. This novelty allows us to significantly improve the accuracy of head gesture recognition of a dancer which in turn plays considerable role in whole body gesture recognition. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method and that its performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art system performances.	[Nussipbekov, A. K.; Amirgaliyev, E.

This improved algorithm uses the potential of data to find the center data and eliminate the noise data. It decomposes big or extended cluster into several small clusters, then merges adjacent small clusters into a big cluster using the information provided by the Safety Area. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved k-means algorithm can determine the number of clusters, distinguish irregular cluster to a certain extent, decrease the dependence on the initial cluster centers, eliminate the effects of the noise data and get a better clustering accuracy.

In this paper, a modified version of the K-means algorithm based on the shape similarity distance (SSD-K-means) is presented. The shape similarity distance is one kind of non-metric distance measure for similarity estimation based on the characteristic of differences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method we proposed, this new algorithm has been tested on three shape data datasets. Experiment results prove that the performance of the SSD-K-means is better than those of the classical K-means algorithm based on the traditional Euclidean and Manhattan distances.

In this paper, a forecast model is offered to forecast tourist distribution. First of all, based on the analysis of changing mechanism of tourist distribution, it is believed that the possibility for a scenic spot to have the same tourist distribution next time is high. To conduct this forecast, we just need to research on the similar tourist distributions of which time and tourist scale are close. Considering that it is time-consuming, an improved K-means cluster method is put forward to classify the historical data into several clusters so that little time will be needed to search for the most similar historical data. In the end, the case study of Jiuzhai Valley is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of this forecast model.

The method converts sequence alignment into vector alignment by first. Then it uses k-means alignment to divide sequences into several groups and reduce the size of sequence data. The expected accurate alignment result is achieved using parallel Smith-Waterman algorithm. The high-throughput mouse T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences were used to validate the proposed method. Under the same hardware condition, comparing to serial Smith-Waterman algorithm and CUDASW++2.0 algorithm, our method is the most efficient alignment algorithm with high alignment accuracy.

To this end, the pathologist marks regions of interest (ROT) with a felt tip pen on the microscope slide for further analysis. This paper presents algorithms for the automated detection of these ROIs, which enables further automated processing of these regions by digital pathology solutions and image analysis. For this purpose, an overview scan is obtained at low magnification. Slides from different manufacturers need to be treated, as they might contain certain regions which need to be excluded from the analysis. Therefore the slide type is identified first. Subsequently, the felt tip marks are detected automatically, and gaps appearing in the case of ROIs which have been drawn incompletely are closed. Based on the marker detection, the ROIs are obtained. The algorithms have been optimized on a training set of 82 manually annotated images. On the test set, the slide types of all but one out of 81 slides were identified correctly. A sensitivity of 98.31% and a positive predictive value of 97.48% were reached for the detection of ROIs. In combination with a slide loader or a whole slide imaging scanner as well as automated image analysis, this enables fully automated batch processing of slides.

Efficacy of Raman spectroscopic methods in non-invasive and objective diagnosis of oral cancers and confounding factors has already been demonstrated. The present Raman microspectroscopic study was undertaken for in-depth and site-specific analysis of normal and tumor tissues. 10 normal and 10 tumors unstained sections from 20 tissues were accrued. Raman data of 160 x 60 mu m and 140 x 140 mu m in normal and tumor sections, respectively, were acquired using WITec alpha 300R equipped with 532 nm laser, 50X objective and 600 gr/mm grating. Spectral data were corrected for CCD-response, background. First-derivitized and vector-normalized data were then subjected to K-mean cluster analysis to generate Raman maps and correlated with their respective histopathology. In normal sections, stratification among epithelial layers i.e. basal, intermediate, superficial was observed. Tumor, stromal and inflammatory regions were identified in case of tumor section. Extracted spectra of the pathologically annotated regions were subjected to Principal component analysis. Findings suggest that all three layers of normal epithelium can be differentiated against tumor cells. In epithelium, basal and superficial layers can be separated while intermediate layer show misclassifications. In tumors, discrimination of inflammatory regions from tumor cells and tumor-stroma regions were observed. Finding of the study indicate Raman mapping can lead to molecular level insights of normal and pathological states.	[Behl, Isha; Deshmukh, Atul; Kukreja, Lekha; Hole, Arti R.; Krishna, C.

In this research, the relationship between SC and SQ in Irish grassland soils was studied; particularly the efficiency of spectroscopy and chemometric techniques for assessing SC and its contribution to SQ. The study was conducted using 20 sites with 5 replicates per site (n = 100 soil samples). Twenty soil properties were measured using standard methods as soil quality indicators. Management intensity was classified using K- means clustering, and the results reflected a trend in soil properties indicative of poorer SQ under more intensive management. Soil porosity, CN ratio and SC were selected as a minimum data set using principal component analysis and SC was the most discriminating indicator of the impact of management intensity on SQ. Soil visible and near- infrared spectra showed a good efficiency (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.4, RPD = 2.94) for prediction of SC.

Mining these data to discover possible consumption patterns and group the users in a more fine-grained way can help the State Grid Corporation to understand users' personalized and differentiated requirements. In this work, an algorithm called TMeans is proposed to mine the electricity consumption patterns. TMeans improves the classical K-Means algorithm by presenting a set of static and dynamical rules which can dynamically adjust the clustering process according to the statistical features of the clusters, making the process more flexible and practical. Then a MapReduce-based implementation of TMeans is proposed to make itself capable of handling large volume of data efficiently. Through experiment, we first demonstrate that the consumption patterns can be effectively discovered and can be refined to very small granularity through TMeans, and then we show that the MapReduce-based implementation of TMeans can efficiently speed up the clustering process.

Firstly, the chi-square statistical analysis is applied to choose set of attributes and K-means algorithm is employed to quantize the value of each attribute. Then DBSCAN algorithm based on density is introduced to classify the customers into three groups (the first, the second and the third class). Finally biclustering based on FP-tree algorithm is used in the three groups to obtain more detailed information. Experimental results on the dataset of an airline company show that the biclustering could segment the customers more accurately and meticulously. Compared with biclustering based on Apriori, the Fp-tree is more efficient on the large dataset.

However, the application of the algorithm is usually interfered by the non-target areas within the whole image, and the interference would then affect the matching and recognition of ear features. To solve this problem, a combined image segmentation algorithm i.e. KRM was introduced in this paper, As the human ear recognition pretreatment method. Firstly, the target areas of ears were extracted by the KRM algorithm and then SIFT algorithm could be applied to the detection and matching of features. The present KRM algorithm follows three steps: (1) the image was preliminarily segmented into foreground target area and background area by using K-means clustering algorithm; (2) Region growing method was used to merge the over-segmented areas; (3) Morphology erosion filtering method was applied to obtain the final segmented regions. The experiment results showed that the KRM method could effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of ear feature matching and recognition based on SIFT algorithm.

Long wavelength Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has the ability to penetrate deep to the CSI, making the measurement of the ChT possible. The ability to accurately segment the CSI and RPE is important in extracting clinical information. However, automated CSI segmentation is challenging due to the weak boundary in the lower choroid and inconsistent texture with varied blood vessels. We propose a K-means clustering based automated algorithm, which is effective in segmenting the CSI and RPE. The performance of the method was evaluated using 531 frames from 4 normal subjects. The RPE and CSI segmentation time was about 0.3 seconds per frame, and the average time was around 0.5 seconds per frame with correction among frames, which is faster than reported algorithms. The results from the proposed method are consistent with the manual segmentation results. Further investigation includes the optimization of the algorithm to cover more OCT images captured from patients and the increase of the processing speed and robustness of the segmentation method.

To test and compare the accuracy of the three algorithms, the definition of average color difference is introduced. Then, two representative forest land background images are used to compare the performance of three algorithms. The result shows that, ISODATA clustering algorithm is superior to other two kind of clustering algorithms.

Unsupervised clustering to identify jury demographics with varying preferences	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article							INVERSE-SCREE TEST; SOUND QUALITY; K-MEANS	In the study of product sound quality, most approaches used to analyze the result of the jury study assume that preference within the jury population is universal. This assumption holds true in some cases, but there are often scenarios where preference varies significantly with demographic. Identifying the presence of and partitioning the jury members with these varying criteria for preference is seldom a trivial exercise. For this reason, a method that can be used to evaluate a jury population and identify subgroups based on the juror voting patterns would be a useful tool. To address this problem, this paper presents an approach to infer the number of subgroups and to classify the jury members into the appropriate subgroups. The method is demonstrated in this paper using both a K-means clustering and a Ward's clustering algorithm. In addition to providing a tool to improve the quality of the jury preference models, jury subgroups also have implications on brand imaging for target audiences. Identifying subgroups of consumers with differing preferences provides marketing groups with additional knowledge that can be used for targeted brand imaging.

Because of the characteristics of ancient Chinese characters such as complex structures and variant shapes, there exist many theoretical and technical problems in feature extraction, clustering and retrieval of these images. A retrieval method was established with the strategy of "clustering before matching" for the ancient Chinese character images by integrating the structural features of them. Firstly, preprocessed character image area was divided into elastic meshes and the directional elements were extracted to form the feature vectors. Then, K-means algorithm was employed to cluster the character images within global and local areas. Finally, the similar images within selected areas were searched in corresponding cluster and the obtained images were provided to users. The experimental results show that this method is helpful for the improvement of the efficiency of ancient Chinese character study.

Firstly, the proposed scheme used color similarity and k-mean clustering to extract dominant background colors in RGB color space. Then pixels in the target selected by users were replaced with dominant colors under the control of color similarity. So the camouflage image was generated after the fusion of the target and the background. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective and the camouflages have pleasant visual quality.

The assignment of these sequence reads into different species or taxonomical classes is a crucial step for metagenomic analysis, which is referred to as binning of metagenomic data. Most traditional binning methods rely on known reference genomes for accurate assignment of the sequence reads, therefore cannot classify reads from unknown species without the help of close references. To overcome this drawback, unsupervised learning based approaches have been proposed, which need not any known species' reference genome for help. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method called MCluster for binning metagenomic sequences. This method uses N-grams to extract sequence features and utilizes automatic feature weighting to improve the performance of the basic K-means clustering algorithm. We evaluate MCluster on a variety of simulated data sets and a real data set, and compare it with three latest binning methods: AbundanceBin, MetaCluster 3.0, and MetaCluster 5.0. Experimental results show that MCluster achieves obviously better overall performance (F-measure) than AbundanceBin and MetaCluster 3.0 on long metagenomic reads (>= 800 bp); while compared with MetaCluster 5.0, MCluster obtains a larger sensitivity, and a comparable yet more stable F-measure on short metagenomic reads (<300 bp). This suggests that MCluster can serve as a promising tool for effectively binning metagenomic sequences.

By optimizing the result of k-means clustering we obtained weights of all the inputted features, after setting appropriate threshold, compare it with all feature weights, eliminate those features whose weight is smaller than the threshold. After compared this method with some advanced methods, it shows that when using the SVM multi-classifier for mechanical fault diagnosis, this method produces a higher accuracy; and since eliminating part of features, it makes the time needed for diagnosis shorter.

By applying clustering analysis and discriminant analysis, a classifying and grading function model of jadeite-jades' green color is tried to be established according to L*, a* and b* variable factors. The results showed that jadeite-jades' green color were divided well into six categories by K-Means clustering analysis, and ANOVA showed L*, a* and b* values among various categories were significantly different (all p <0.01). The green color of Category 5 with moderate brightness and high chroma outperformed the others, followed by Category 3. The green color of Category 2 with higher brightness and chroma was appraised to be better than the deep green color of Category 3. Dark green of Category 4 and faint green of Category 6 were in the minimum level of the quality. A linear discriminant function model of the six categories of jadeite-jades' green color was established by Fisher discriminant analysis, which had excellent performance of discriminant with the model checking accuracy of 95.80%.It is concluded that the method of color measurement used by Color i5 spectrophotometer combined with clustering analysis and discriminant analysis offers an efficient, reasonable and feasible approach to the fast classifying and quality grading evaluation of jadeite-jades' green color.

However, most existing approaches assume that all classification parameters are certain. Unfortunately, the reality is connected to uncertainty by nature. To solve these problems, we propose in this paper new dynamic clustering approaches, based on the well known K-modes method, under uncertainty for handling both increasing and decreasing of the clusters' number where uncertain categorical attribute values are represented and managed through the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) concepts. By using the cluster cohesion and separation concepts, our main objective is to update the clusters' partition without performing the reclustering from scratch. The experiments on known benchmark data sets, show that our dynamic methods outperform the static version.

Accurate and fast segmentation of cryosection images is of great significance for research of the human brain and development of the Visible Human Project. However, most automated approaches in the literature are designed for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography data, and they may not be suitable for cryosection images. Cryosection image segmentation is often realized manually or semi-automatically in practice. The present study proposes an automated algorithm for cryosection image segmentation of brain tissue and white matter and evaluates its accuracy using the Chinese Visible Human (CVH) dataset. This method combines a mathematical morphological approach to delineate brain tissue and k-means clustering to uniquely identify white matter. Firstly, the region of brain tissue is detected coarsely using connected component labeling combined with morphological reconstruction. Then, morphological operations are used for final boundary determination to complete the segmentation of brain tissue Finally, k-means clustering is employed to extract white matter based on segmented brain tissue. The algorithm was applied to the CVH dataset to automatically extract the entire brain tissue and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. Additionally, the proposed mathematical morphological approach is compared with the region growing method and the threshold morphological method for brain segmentation, and the k-means clustering method is compared with the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian mixture model coupled with the expectation-maximization algorithm for white matter extraction. To evaluate performance, a quantitative analysis was conducted using the dice similarity index, false-positive dice, and false-negative dice for comparison with manually obtained segmentation results produced by anatomy experts. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm is capable of accurate segmentation and substantial agreement with the gold standard.

It not only maintains the self-organizing features of SOM network, but also makes up the disadvantages of the bad clustering effect caused by the inadequate selection of K-means algorithm. Firstly, data is preprocessed to form vector space model for subsequent process. Then, we analyze the features of original clustering algorithm and SOM algorithm, and plan an improved SOM clustering algorithm to overcome low stability and poor quality of original algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a higher accuracy and has a better stability, compared with the original algorithm.

Oxidation of sulfidic sediments leads to increases in acidity and mobilisation of trace metals, resulting in an increase in the concentrations of conducting ions in sediment and pore water. The distribution of these sediments on floodplains is highly heterogeneous. Accurately identifying the distribution of CASS is essential for developing targeted management strategies. One approach is the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) using ancillary information. Proximal sensing instruments such as an EM38 can provide data on the spatial distribution of soil salinity, which is associated with CASS, and can be complemented by digital elevation models (DEM). We used EM38 measurements of the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) in the horizontal and vertical modes in combination with a high resolution DEM to delineate the spatial distribution of CASS. We used a fuzzy k-means algorithm to cluster the data. The fuzziness exponent, number of classes (k) and distance metric (i.e. Euclidean, Mahalanobis and diagonal) were varied to determine a set of parameters to identify CASS. The mean-squared prediction error variance of the class mean of various soil properties (e.g. EC1:5 and pH) was used to identify which of these metrics was suitable for further analysis (i.e. Mahalanobis) and also determine the optimal number of classes (i.e. k=4). The final map is consistent with previously defined soil-landscape units generated using traditional soil profile description, classification and mapping. The DSM approach is amenable for evaluation on a larger scale and in order to refine CASS boundaries previously mapped using the traditional approach or to identify CASS areas that remain unmapped.

There are a number of breast tissue segmentation methods proposed and used in the literature. The purpose of this study was to validate and compare the accuracy of various segmentation methods and to investigate the effect of the tissue distribution on the segmentation accuracy. Computed tomography (CT) data for 24 patients, both in supine and prone positions were segmented into fibroglandular and fatty tissue. The segmentation methods explored were: physical density thresholding; interactive thresholding; fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) with three classes (FCM3) and four classes (FCM4); and k-means clustering. Validation was done in two-stages: firstly, a new approach, supine-prone validation based on the assumption that the breast composition should appear the same in the supine and prone scans was used. Secondly, outlines from three experts were used for validation. This study found that FCM3 gave the most accurate segmentation of breast tissue from CT data and that the segmentation accuracy is adversely affected by the sparseness of the fibroglandular tissue distribution.

Automated clustering of heterotrophic bacterioplankton in flow cytometry data	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteria; Flow cytometry; Automatic clustering; Aquatic sciences	NATURAL PLANKTONIC BACTERIA; NUCLEIC-ACID CONTENT; K-MEANS; PICOPLANKTON; POPULATIONS; SUBGROUPS; SAMPLES; WATERS; OCEAN; CYCLE	Flow cytometry has become a standard method to analyze bacterioplankton. Analysis of samples by flow cytometry is automatic, but it is followed by manual classification of the bacterioplankton groups in flow cytometry standard (FCS) files. This classification is a time consuming and subjective task performed by manually drawing the limits of the groups present in cytograms, a process referred to as gating. The automation of flow cytometry data processing based on pattern recognition techniques could provide an efficient tool to overcome some of these disadvantages. Here, we propose the use of model-based clustering techniques for the automatic detection of low (LNA) and high (HNA) nucleic acid bacterioplankton groups in FCS files. To validate our method, we compared the automatic classification with a flow cytometry database from a 9 yr time series collected in the central Cantabrian Sea that had been manually analyzed. The correlation between automatic and manual gating methods was >0.9 for cell counts and 0.7 to 0.95 for side scatter values, a proxy of cell size. In addition, no significant differences were found in the mean annual cycle of LNA and HNA cell abundance depicted by both methods. We also quantified the subjectivity of manual gating. The coefficient of variation for heterotrophic bacteria counts obtained by different analysts was around 10 to 20%. Our results suggest that the combination of flow cytometry and automatic gating provides a valuable tool to analyze microbial communities objectively and accurately, allowing us to safely compare bacterioplankton samples from different environments.

Automated Segmentation of Porcine Airway Wall Layers using Optical Coherence Tomography: Comparison with Manual Segmentation and Histology	ENDOSCOPIC MICROSCOPY IX; AND OPTICAL TECHNIQUES IN PULMONARY MEDICINE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Endoscopic Microscopy IX; and Optical Techniques in Pulmonary Medicine	FEB 01-03, 2014	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Optical Coherence Tomography; Automated Segmentation; Histology; Airway Wall	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; BRONCHIAL LESIONS	The objective was to develop an automated optical coherence tomography (OCT) segmentation method. We evaluated three ex-vivo porcine airway specimens; six non-sequential OCT images were selected from each airway specimen. Histology was also performed for each airway and histology images were co-registered to OCT images for comparison. Manual segmentation of the airway luminal area, mucosa area, submucosa area and the outer airway wall area were performed for histology and OCT images. Automated segmentation of OCT images employed a despecking filter for pre-processing, a hessian-based filter for lumen and outer airway wall area segmentation, and K-means clustering for mucosa and submucosa area segmentation. Bland-Altman analysis indicated that there was very little bias between automated OCT segmentation and histology measurements for the airway lumen area (bias=-6%, 95% CI=-21%-8%), mucosa area, (bias=-4%, 95% CI=-14%-5%), submucosa area (bias=7%, 95% CI=-7%-20%) and outer airway wall area segmentation results (bias=-5%, 95% CI=-14%-5%). We also compared automated and manual OCT segmentation and Bland-Altman analysis indicated that there was negligible bias between luminal area (bias=4%, 95% CI=1%-8%), mucosa area (bias=-3%, 95% CI=-6%-1%), submucosa area (bias=-2%, 95% CI=-10%-6%) and the outer airway wall (bias=-3%, 95% CI=-13%-6%). The automated segmentation method for OCT airway imaging developed here allows for accurate and precise segmentation of the airway wall components, suggesting	[Kirby, Miranda; Candido, Tara; Coxson, Harvey O.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Radiol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E3, Canada	Kirby, M (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Radiol, 3350-950 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E3, Canada.

Although MR is highly sensitive, it provides abundant organization information. Therefore, how to transform the multi-spectral images which is easier to be used for doctor's clinical diagnosis. In this thesis, the fuzzy bidirectional edge detection method is used to solve conventional SRG problem of growing order in the initial seed stages. In order to overcome the problems of the different regions, although it is the same Euclidean distance for region growing and merging process stages, we present the peak detection method to improve them. The standard deviation target generation process (SDTGP) is applied to guarantee the regions merging process does not cause over- or undersegmentation. Experimental results reveal that FISRG segments a multispectral MR image much more effectively than FAST and K-means.

The expanded formula takes into account the spectral reflectance of paper white, full tone ink and mixed area scaled by the fractional area coverages. Here, mixed area mainly refers to the edge of an inked dot where the density is very low, and lateral exchange of photons can occur. Also, in such area the paper micro components may have higher scattering power than ink, especially, in uncoated paper. Our methodology uses cyan, magenta and yellow separation ramps printed on different papers by impact and non-impact based printing technologies. The samples include both frequency and amplitude modulation halftoning methods of various print resolutions. Based on pixel values, the captured microscale halftoned image is divided into three categories: solid ink, mixed area, and unprinted paper between the dots. The segmented images are then used to measure the fractional area coverage that the model receives as parameters. We have derived the characteristic reflectance spectrum of mixed area by rearranging the expanded formula and replacing the predicted term with the measured value using half of the maximum colorant coverage. Performance has clearly improved over the Murray-Davies model with and without dot gain compensation, more importantly, preserving the linear additivity of reflectance of the classical physics-based model.

The algorithm first calculates the density-similar-neighbor-based outlier factor (DSNOF) for each point in the dataset according to the relationship of the density of the point and its neighbors, and then treats the point whose DSNOF is smaller than 1 as a core point. Second, the core points are used for clustering by the similar process of the density based spatial clustering application with noise (DBSCAN) to get some sub-clusters. Third, the proposed algorithm merges the obtained sub-clusters into some clusters. Finally, the points whose DSNOF are larger than 1 are assigned into these clusters. Experiments are performed on some real datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the experiments results verify that the effectiveness of the proposed model is higher than the DBSCAN algorithm and k-means algorithm and would not be affected by the parameter greatly.

A multi-model modeling method based on an improved supervised k-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The method introduced the cluster center initialization idea of CCIA algorithm into classical k-means clustering algorithm applied to group the data into clusters, and the least squares method is used to construct ARX sub-models. The system model is constructed by weighing all ARX sub-models. The proposed method is used to identify the ammonia concentration model for Benchmark wastewater treatment system and the actual plant process data. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be used to fit nonlinear characteristics of the system with high precision.

LEVEL SET METHOD FOR SEGMENTATION OF INFRARED BREAST THERMOGRAMS	EXCLI JOURNAL			English	Article						breast; thermography; level set; k-means fuzzy c-means	FUZZY C-MEANS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; CANCER; ALGORITHM; FRONTS	Breast thermography is a physiological test that provides information based on the temperature changes in breast. It records the temperature distribution of a body using the infrared radiation emitted by the surface of that body. Precancerous tissue and the area around a cancerous tumor have higher temperature due to angiogenesis, and higher chemical and blood vessel activity than a normal breast; hence breast thermography has potential to detect early abnormal changes in breast tissues. It can detect the first sign of forming up cancer before mammography can detect. The thermal information can be shown in a pseudo colored image where each color represents a specific range of temperature. Various methods can be applied to extract hot regions for detecting suspected regions of interests in the breast infrared images and potentially suspicious tissues. Image segmentation techniques can play an important role to segment and extract these regions in the breast infrared images. Shape, size and borders of the hottest regions of the images can help to determine features which are used to detect abnormalities. In this paper, three image segmentation methods: k-means, fuzzy c-means and level set are discussed and compared. These three methods are tested for different cases such as fibrocystic, inflammatory cancer cases. The hottest regions of thermal breast images in all cases are extracted and compared to the original images. According to the results, level set method is a more accurate approach and has potential to extract almost exact shape of tumors.

Simplifying aerosol size distributions modes simultaneously detected at four monitoring sites during SAPUSS	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PARTICLE NUMBER CONCENTRATIONS; MEDITERRANEAN CITY; PARTICULATE MATTER; URBAN-ENVIRONMENT; ATMOSPHERE; HEALTH; BARCELONA; NANOPARTICLES; EMISSIONS; DYNAMICS	The analysis of aerosol size distributions is a useful tool for understanding the sources and the processes influencing particle number concentrations (N) in urban areas. Hence, during the one-month SAPUSS campaign (Solving Aerosol Problems by Using Synergistic Strategies, EU Marie Curie Action) in autumn 2010 in Barcelona (Spain), four SMPSs (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) were simultaneously deployed at four monitoring sites: a road side (RSsite), an urban background site located in the city (UBsite), an urban background site located in the nearby hills of the city (Torre Collserola, TCsite) and a regional background site located about 50 km from the Barcelona urban areas (RBsite). The spatial distribution of sites allows study of the aerosol temporal variability as well as the spatial distribution, progressively moving away from urban aerosol sources. In order to interpret the data sets collected, a k-means cluster analysis was performed on the combined SMPS data sets. This resulted in nine clusters describing all aerosol size distributions from the four sites. In summary there were three main categories (with three clusters in each category): "Traffic" (Traffic 1, "T-clus_1" - 8 %; Traffic 2, "T-clus_2" - 13 %; and Traffic 3, "T-clus_3" - 9 %) "Background Pollution" (Urban Background 1, "UBclus_1" - 21 %; Regional Background 1, "RBclus_1" - 15 %; and Regional Background 2, "RBclus_2" - 18 %) and "Special Cases" (Nucleation, "NUclus" - 5 %; Regional Nitrate, "NITclus" - 6 %; and Mix, "MIXclus" - 5 %).

However, the expression of cathepsin K in melanocytic lesions has not been well characterized. Our aim was to investigate the expression of cathepsin K in a wide histological spectrum of melanocytic lesions and to evaluate its potential diagnostic and molecular target therapy usefulness in comparison with other commonly used markers. 143 consecutive melanocytic lesions were selected for study including 56 primary malignant melanomas, 62 metastatic melanomas, and 25 benign nevi (16 intradermal melanocytic nevi and 9 compound melanocytic nevi). 107 of the 118 (91%) primary and metastatic melanomas displayed a high percentage of cells with moderately to strongly positive reactions for cathepsin K (mean 82%; range 0-95%). MITF, HMB45, Melan-A, and S100 were expressed in 85, 76, 78 and 96% of cases, respectively, with various percentages of positive cells (mean, 63, 49, 55 and 86%; range 0-90, 0-80, 0-90 and 0-95%). Among the benign nevi, cathepsin K, MITF, HMB45, Melan-A, and S100 were expressed in 88, 80, 36, 68 and 100% of cases, respectively. Cathepsin K appears to be consistently and strongly expressed in melanocytic lesions and valuable in distinguishing malignant melanomas from the majority of human cancers.

For the problems that the fault of nodes or links will affect the transmission stability and reliability of the network, a gradient based multipath reliable transmission strategy with fault tolerance is presented for wireless sensor networks. Firstly nonuniform clustering topology is established in nonequal clustering probability based on twice K-means algorithm. Then it calculates the comprehensive measurements (CM) of cluster heads by the quality evaluation function and establishes the contour lines. Finally gradient based multiple disjoint transmission paths are established by the mechanisms of load balance and linear erasure coding. It also establishes the transmission mathematical model to analyze the performance of the network. Simulation shows that this strategy has good performance of fault tolerance. It improves the transmission reliability of the network and energy efficiency.

J	Zhang, Z; Song, GZ; Wu, JG				Zhang, Zheng; Song, Guozhi; Wu, Jigang			A Novel Two-Stage Illumination Estimation Framework for Expression Recognition	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							FACE RECOGNITION; MORPHABLE MODEL; EIGENFACES; POSE	One of the critical issues for facial expression recognition is to eliminate the negative effect caused by variant poses and illuminations. In this paper a two-stage illumination estimation framework is proposed based on three-dimensional representative face and clustering, which can estimate illumination directions under a series of poses. First, 256 training 3D face models are adaptively categorized into a certain amount of facial structure types by k-means clustering to group people with similar facial appearance into clusters. Then the representative face of each cluster is generated to represent the facial appearance type of that cluster. Our training set is obtained by rotating all representative faces to a certain pose, illuminating them with a series of different illumination conditions, and then projecting them into two-dimensional images. Finally the saltire-over-cross feature is selected to train a group of SVM classifiers and satisfactory performance is achieved when estimating a number of test sets including images generated from 64 3D face models kept for testing, CAS-PEAL face database, CMU PIE database, and a small test set created by ourselves. Compared with other related works, our method is subject independent and has less computational complexity O (C x N) without 3D facial reconstruction.

Multivariate analysis of the temporal variability of sugarcane ripening in south-eastern Brazil	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE			English	Article							COMMERCIAL CANE SUGAR; YIELD; PATTERNS; MATURITY	Sugarcane ripening is a process controlled by cultivar characteristics and the interaction of genotypes with local climate. The objective of this study was to characterise the temporal variation of sugarcane ripening by assessing the multivariate structure contained in sugarcane quality data, and by correlating the results with local climatic conditions. Eight sugarcane cultivars were evaluated from March to October in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Characteristics related to the quality of raw sugarcane juice were submitted to statistical analysis by ANOVA, hierarchical and non-hierarchical (k-means) clustering methods, and principal components, in order to classify the cultivars into groups for each month of sampling. The ANOVA showed a clear difference (P < 0.001) among harvesting months for all sugarcane quality variables, which was reinforced by the cluster analysis for the whole dataset that selected groups according to the month of harvest. By analysing the quality variables by months, patterns of similarity among sugarcane cultivars were identified, which allowed three ripening groups to be established: early, middle and late. As the harvesting season progressed, the variations within each group, as well as among groups, were explained mainly by local soil-water availability conditions. The early ripening cultivars showed polarisable sugar (Pol) values >13% in early May, whereas these values were reached by the middle cultivars in July, and the late ones in August-September. However, the differences among groups tended to decrease through the harvest season, as expressed by the Euclidean distance, which decreased from 5.62 in March to 1.82 in September, when the water deficit reached the maximum accumulated value, totalling >130 mm. The non-hierarchical analyses (k-means) and principal components methods agreed, resulting in the identification of the same three main cultivar groups. The approach proposed for cultivar classification in this study is more complete than the usual analysis of Pol variation over time, since it allowed all of the variability contained in the sugarcane quality dataset to be analysed in an integrated way, providing a better understanding of the differences observed in the ripening of different cultivars.

In order to study the characteristics of driver behavior on combination of vertical and horizontal curves (CVHCs) of mountainous freeways in free flow conditions, designated speed measurement tests of two typical segments of the upgrade direction of Xi'an-Hanzhong freeway were carried out. After data processing, vehicles in free flow were screened out and classified into two groups by K-means clustering method, and then the driver behavior with different lanes, different size vehicles, and different CVHCs was analyzed, respectively. Finally, a vehicle distribution prediction model and a speed prediction model were built which were applied to CVHCs, and a verification test was made to test the accuracy of the models. Research results show that the driver behavior is mainly different among vehicle size, longitudinal slopes, and horizontal curves, and the characteristics of speed control and lane distribution on CVHCs vary according to lanes and combination of road alignment. Also, the prediction results of the models are highly consistent with the measured test results.

However, the initial guess of cluster centers affects the clustering result seriously, which means that improper initialization cannot lead to a desirous clustering result. How to choose suitable initial centers is an important research issue for kappa-means algorithm. In this paper, we propose an adaptive initialization framework based on spatial local information (AIF-SLI), which takes advantage of local density of data distribution. As it is difficult to estimate density correctly, we develop two approximate estimations: density by t-nearest neighborhoods (t-NN) and density by epsilon-neighborhoods (epsilon-Ball), leading to two implements of the proposed framework. Our empirical study on more than 20 datasets shows promising performance of the proposed framework and denotes that it has several advantages: (1) can find the reasonable candidates of initial centers effectively; (2) it can reduce the iterations of kappa-means' methods significantly; (3) it is robust to outliers; and (4) it is easy to implement.

The iris is first segmented from the acquired image of an eye using an edge detection algorithm. The disk shaped area of the iris is transformed into a rectangular form. Described moments are extracted from the grayscale image which yields a feature vector containing scale, rotation, and translation invariant moments. Images are clustered using the k-means algorithm and centroids for each cluster are computed. An arbitrary image is assumed to belong to the cluster whose centroid is the nearest to the feature vector in terms of Euclidean distance computed. The described model exhibits an accuracy of 98.5%.

It results in the fact that the traditional clustering algorithm cannot handle the mass data of the tunnel. To solve this problem, an improved parallel clustering algorithm based on k-means has been proposed. It is a clustering algorithm using the MapReduce within cloud computing that deals with data. It not only has the advantage of being used to deal with mass data but also is more efficient. Moreover, it is able to compute the average dissimilarity degree of each cluster in order to clean the abnormal data.

J	Ji, GL; Zeng, Y; Yang, ZJ; Ye, CT; Yao, JC				Ji, Guoli; Zeng, Yong; Yang, Zijiang; Ye, Congting; Yao, Jingci			A multiple sequence alignment method with sequence vectorization	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS			English	Article						k-means; LemK_MSA; Lempel-Ziv; Multiple sequence alignment	LEMPEL-ZIV; COMPLEXITY; PROGRAMS; DISTANCE	Purpose - The time complexity of most multiple sequence alignment algorithm is O(N-2) or O(N-3) (N is the number of sequences). In addition, with the development of biotechnology, the amount of biological sequences grows significantly. The traditional methods have some difficulties in handling large-scale sequence. The proposed Lemk_MSA method aims to reduce the time complexity, especially for large-scale sequences. At the same time, it can keep similar accuracy level compared to the traditional methods. Design/methodology/approach - LemK_MSA converts multiple sequence alignment into corresponding 10D vector alignment by ten types of copy modes based on Lempel-Ziv. Then, it uses k-means algorithm and NJ algorithm to divide the sequences into several groups and calculate guide tree of each group. A complete guide tree for multiple sequence alignment could be constructed by merging guide tree of every group. Moreover, for large-scale multiple sequence, Lemk_MSA proposes a GPU-based parallel way for distance matrix calculation. Findings - Under this approach, the time efficiency to process multiple sequence alignment can be improved. The high-throughput mouse antibody sequences are used to validate the proposed method. Compared to ClustalW, MAFFT and Mbed, LemK_MSA is more than ten times efficient while ensuring the alignment accuracy at the same time. Originality/value - This paper proposes a novel method with sequence vectorization for multiple sequence alignment based on Lempel-Ziv. A GPU-based parallel method has been designed for large-scale distance matrix calculation. It provides a new way for multiple sequence alignment research.

The GWT is used to enhance the edge information in an image while suppressing noise. Following this, the k-means and Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms are used to convert a gray level image into a binary image. The proposed methods are tested using medical images obtained through Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) devices, and a phantom image.

J	Hong, HP; Ye, W				Hong, H. P.; Ye, W.			Estimating extreme wind speed based on regional frequency analysis	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Extreme wind; Clustering; k-Means clustering; Hierarchical clustering; Self-organizing map; Quantile of wind speed	GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION; UNITED-STATES; IDENTIFICATION; CLIMATE; MAP	The quantiles of wind speed at spatially distributed locations within a region that are needed for codifying wind load can be estimated based on the at-site analysis of the annual maximum wind speed using records at a number of meteorological stations. The historical wind records and available meteorological stations, however, are often short and insufficient or unavailable; a decreased sample size increases the uncertainty in the estimated quantiles. To overcome the problem with data insufficiency, the use of the regional frequency analysis applied to annual maximum wind speed is investigated in this study by using wind records from 235 Canadian meteorological stations. The analysis uses the k-means, hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering to explore potential clusters or regions; statistical tests are then applied to identify homogeneous regions for subsequent regional frequency analysis. Results indicate that the k-means is the preferred exploratory tool for the considered data, and that the discordancy measure is valuable to identify stations with wind records that may require further scrutiny. Results also indicate that the generalized extreme value distribution provides a better fit to the normalized data within a cluster than the Gumbel distribution.

J	Rhee, J; Alfian, G; Yoon, B				Rhee, Jongtae; Alfian, Ganjar; Yoon, Byungun			Application of Simulation Method and Regression Analysis to Optimize Car Operations in Carsharing Services: A Case Study in South Korea	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							USE VEHICLE SYSTEMS; USERS BEHAVIOR; MODELS; IMPACTS; PROGRAM; DEMAND	A carsharing service is a form of public transportation that enables a group of people to share vehicles based at certain stations by making reservations in advance. One of the common problems of carsharing is that companies can have difficulty optimizing the number of vehicles in operation. This paper reports on investigations of the relationship between the number of cars and the number of reservations per day with either the acceptance ratio or utilization ratio based on the commercially-operational dataset of a carsharing company in Korea. A discrete event simulation is run to analyze a round-trip service for every possible number of cars and number of reservations with the output acceptance ratio and utilization ratio. The simulation data revealed that increasing the number of reservations with respect to a certain number of cars will decrease the acceptance ratio, thus increasing the percentage of the utilization ratio. Based on the simulation data results, a rational regression model can achieve high precision when predicting the acceptance ratio or the utilization ratio compared to other prediction algorithms such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) models. K-means clustering was used to understand the pattern and provide additional policies for carsharing companies. Consequently, opening a carsharing business is very promising in terms of profit, escalating the level of customer satisfaction. In addition, a small reduction in the utilization ratio by operators will create a large increase in the acceptance ratio.

The method has been evaluated using impact (offset) and non-impact (electro-photography) based single color prints halftoned by amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) technique. The print samples have also included a range of variations in paper substrates. The colors of segmented regions have been analyzed in CIELAB color space to reveal the variations, in particular those present in mixed regions. The statistics of intensity distribution in the segmented areas have been utilized to derive expressions that can be used to calculate simple thresholds. However, the segmented results have been employed to study dot gain in comparison with traditional estimation technique using Murray-Davies formula. The performance of halftone reflectance prediction by spectral Murray-Davies model has been reported using estimated and measured parameters. Finally, a general idea has been proposed to expand the classical Murray-Davies model based on experimetal observations. Hence, the present study primarily presents the outcome of experimental efforts to characterize halftone print media interactions in respect to the color prediction models. Currently, most regression-based color prediction models rely on mathematical optimization to estimate the parameters using measured average reflectance of a large area compared to the dot size. While this general approach has been accepted as a useful tool, experimental investigations can enhance understanding of the physical processes and facilitate exploration of new modeling strategies. Furthermore, reported findings may help reduce the required number of samples that are printed and measured in the process of multichannel printer characterization and calibration.

In this paper, we present a new method of text detection using a combined dictionary consisting of wavelets and a recently introduced transform called shearlets. Wavelets provide optimally sparse expansion for point-like structures and shearlets provide optimally sparse expansions for curve-like structures. By combining these two features we have computed a high frequency sub-band to brighten the text part. Then K-means clustering is used for obtaining text pixels from the Standard Deviation (SD) of combined coefficient of wavelets and shearlets as well as the union of wavelets and shearlets features.

It was also aimed to determine the types of tests that are more efficient among these schools. For this purpose, educational data mining techniques such as clustering and decision tree are used. By deploying the non-hierarchical k-means algorithm, schools are separated into 5 different clusters which have different success level for each of Math-Science (MS), Language and Math (LM) and Language-Social Studies (LS) test scores. It is found that Science High Schools, Private Science High Schools, Anatolian High Schools and Anatolian Teacher Schools found to be in the highest achievement level in all of the test scores. Furthermore, constructed decision tree models with CHAID algorithm show that (1) Chemistry for the score type MS, (2) Math for the score type LM and (3) Turkish Language and Literature for the core type LS were the test types which are primarily effective in the division of schools into clusters.

The k-means clustering algorithm is one of the most commonly used methods. However, it highly depends on the initial solution and is easy to fall into local optimum solution. In view of the disadvantages of the k-means method, this paper proposed a hybrid monkey algorithm based on search operator of artificial bee colony algorithm for clustering analysis and experiment on synthetic and real life datasets to show that the algorithm has a good performance than that of the basic monkey algorithm for clustering analysis.

K-means is a fast and available cluster algorithm which has been used in many fields. However, for the large-scale meteorological data, the traditional K-means algorithm is not capable enough to satisfy the actual application needs efficiently. This paper proposes an improved MK-means algorithm (MK-means) based on MapReduce according to characteristics of large meteorological datasets. The experimental results show that MK-means has more computing ability and scalability.

J	Mishra, R; Kumar, P; Bhasker, B				Mishra, Rajhans; Kumar, Pradeep; Bhasker, Bharat			An alternative approach for clustering web user sessions considering sequential information	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Clustering; similarity upper approximation; web usage data; sequential data	ROUGH SETS; K-MEANS; SIMILARITY	Clustering is a prominent technique in data mining applications. It generates groups of data points that are similar to each other in a given aspect. Each group has some inherent latent similarity which is computed using the similarity measures. Clustering web users based on navigational pattern has always been an interesting as well as a challenging task. A web user, based on its navigational pattern, may belong to multiple categories. Intrinsically, web user navigation pattern exhibits sequential property. When dealing with sequence data, a similarity measure should be chosen, which captures both the order as well as content information during computation of similarity among sequences. In this paper, we have utilized the Sequence and Set Similarity Measure ((SM)-M-3) with rough set based similarity upper approximation clustering algorithm to group web users based on their navigational patterns. The quality of cluster formed using rough set based clustering algorithm with (SM)-M-3 measure has been compared with the well known clustering algorithm, Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The experimental results show the viability of our approach.

Advances of Swarm Intelligent Systems in Gene Expression Data Classification	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Swarm Intelligent Systems; Particle swarm optimization; Ant colony optimization; Gene expression data; Clustering	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; PATTERNS	The step forward in the development of microarray technology of gene expression has created new opportunities in further exploration of living systems, source of disease and drug development and cancer biology. In the analysis of gene expression profiles, the number of tissue samples with genes expression levels available is usually small compared with the number of genes. This can lead either to possible overfitting and dimensionality curse or even to a complete failure in analysis of microarray data So, the dramatic increase in genomic data volumes make it a challenging task to select genes that are really indicative of the tissue classification a key step to accurately pick out the information from such microarrays. On the other hand, in the last decades, swarm intelligent systems have gained much attention and wide applications in different fields such as solving the gene expression data classification problem. These algorithms are efficient in dealing with optimization issues, and they are also relatively simple to implement with the ability to fast converge to a reasonably good solution. They engage probabilistic rules instead of deterministic ones and require neither derivatives of cost function. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on swarm intelligence systems is utilized to classify gene expression data.

J	Gonzalez-Pardo, A; Rosa, A; Camacho, D				Gonzalez-Pardo, Antonio; Rosa, Angeles; Camacho, David			Behaviour-based identification of student communities in Virtual Worlds	COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Community finding; Behavioural patterns; Clustering; Virtual Worlds	2ND LIFE; ALGORITHM; EDUCATION; ENVIRONMENTS; COMPRESSION; INFORMATION; DISTANCE; PLATFORM	Virtual Worlds (VW) have gained popularity in the last years in domains like training or education mainly due to their highly immersive and interactive 3D characteristics. In these platforms, the user (represented by an avatar) can move and interact in an artificial world with a high degree of freedom. They can talk, chat, build and design objects, program and compile their own developed programs, or move (flying, teleporting, walking or running) to different parts of the world. Although these environments provide an interesting working place for students and educators, VW platforms (such as Open Cobalt or OpenSim amongst others) rarely provide mechanisms to facilitate the automatic (or semi-automatic) behaviour analysis of users interactions. Using a VW platform called VirtUAM, the information extracted from different experiments are used to analyse and define students communities based on their behaviour. To define the individual student behaviour, different characteristics are extracted from the system, such as the avatar position (in form of GPS coordinates) and the set of actions (interactions) performed by students within the VW. Later this information is used to automatically detect behavioural patterns. This paper shows how this information can be used to group students in different communities based on their behaviour. Experimental results show how community identification can be successfully perform using K-Means algorithm and Normalized Compression Distance. Resulting communities contains users working in near places or with similar behaviours inside the virtual world.

A texture-based algorithm is introduced in this paper for fully automatic segmentation of choroidal images obtained from an EDI system of Heidelberg 3D OCT Spectralis. Dynamic programming is utilized to determine the location of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Bruch's membrane (BM) (the blood-retina barrier which separates the RPE cells of the retina from the choroid) can be segmented by searching for the pixels with the biggest gradient value below the RPE. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to segment the choroid-sclera interface (CSI), which employs the wavelet based features to construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The model is then used in a graph cut for segmentation of the choroidal boundary. The proposed algorithm is tested on 100 EDI OCTs and is compared with manual segmentation. The results showed an unsigned error of 2.48 +/- 0.32 pixels for BM extraction and 9.79 +/- 3.29 pixels for choroid detection.

This shift is welcome as an act of patient autonomy, reflected in the term "expert patient". At the same time, there is considerable concern that patients can be easily misguided by pseudoscientific research and debate. Little is known about the sources of information used in health-related online forums, how users apply this information, and how they behave in such forums. Objective: The intent of the study was to identify (1) the sources of information used in online health-related forums, and (2) the roles and behavior of active forum visitors in introducing and disseminating this information. Methods: This observational study used the largest German multiple sclerosis (MS) online forum as a database, analyzing the user debate about the recently proposed and controversial Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) hypothesis. After extracting all posts and then filtering relevant CCSVI posts between 01 January 2008 and 17 August 2012, we first identified hyperlinks to scientific publications and other information sources used or referenced in the posts. Employing k-means clustering, we then analyzed the users' preference for sources of information and their general posting habits. Results: Of 139,912 posts from 11,997 threads, 8628 posts discussed or at least mentioned CCSVI. We detected hyperlinks pointing to CCSVI-related scientific publications in 31 posts. In contrast, 2829 different URLs were posted to the forum, most frequently referring to social media, such as YouTube or Facebook. We identified a total of 6 different roles of hyperlink posters including Social Media Fans, Organization Followers, and Balanced Source Users. Apart from the large and nonspecific residual category of the "average user", several specific behavior patterns were identified, such as the small but relevant groups of CCSVI-Focused Responders or CCSVI Activators. Conclusions: The bulk of the observed contributions were not based on scientific results, but on various social media sources. These sources seem to contain mostly opinions and personal experience. A small group of people with distinct behavioral patterns played a core role in fuelling the discussion about CCSVI.

It is a challenge because there is no unique solution that fits all problems and satisfies all applications. We target to get the most appropriate clustering solution for a given application domain. In other words, clustering algorithms in general need prior specification of the number of clusters, and this is hard even for domain experts to estimate especially in a dynamic environment where the data changes and/or become available incrementally. In this paper, we described and analyze the effectiveness of a robust clustering algorithm which integrates multi-objective genetic algorithm into a framework capable of producing alternative clustering solutions; it is called Multi-objective K-Means Genetic Algorithm (MOKGA). We investigate its application for clustering a variety of datasets, including microarray gene expression data. The reported results are promising. Though we concentrate on gene expression and mostly cancer data, the proposed approach is general enough and works equally to cluster other datasets as demonstrated by the two datasets Iris and Ruspini. After running MOKGA, a pareto-optimal front is obtained, and gives the optimal number of clusters as a solution set. The achieved clustering results are then analyzed and validated under several cluster validity techniques proposed in the literature. As a result, the optimal clusters are ranked for each validity index. We apply majority voting to decide on the most appropriate set of validity indexes applicable to every tested dataset. The proposed clustering approach is tested by conducting experiments using seven well cited benchmark data sets. The obtained results are compared with those reported in the literature to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ding, MT; Hu, KH				Ding, Mingtao; Hu, Kaiheng			Susceptibility mapping of landslides in Beichuan County using cluster and MLC methods	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Susceptibility mapping; Landslide; Clustering analysis; Beichuan County	GIS; EARTHQUAKE; INFORMATION; REGION; TURKEY	Cluster analysis and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) are exploited to map the post-earthquake landslide susceptibility in Beichuan County that was affected by the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. The methodology is applicable even if there is short of training data. Six effective factors are chosen for mapping the susceptibility, including land use, seismic intensity, average annual rainfall, relative relief, slop gradient and lithology. Four clusters are grouped from sampling grid cells by k-means clustering approach. MLC classifies all the cells in the study area into the four clusters according to their statistical characteristics. Four susceptibility classes (extreme low, low, moderate and high) are assigned to these clusters applying expert experience and hazard density. The final map gives a reasonable assessment of post-earthquake landslide susceptibility in Beichuan County. Comparing with the pre-earthquake susceptibility map made in Beichuan County geological disaster survey project, the result t using cluster and MLC classification has a better agreement with the dot density value of post-earthquake landslides in Beichuan County. The susceptibility map can be used to identify safety spots within the high danger area, which are suitable for habitations and facilities. It is also found that more landslides are densely concentrated at the boundary between high and moderate regions, and between high and extreme low regions.
