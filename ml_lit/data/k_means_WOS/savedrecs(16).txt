A Novel Piecewise Linear Clustering Technique Based on Hyper Plane Adjustment	ADVANCES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International-Computer-Society-of-Iran-Computer Conference	MAR 09-11, 2008	Kish Isl, IRAN			Clustering; Unsupervised learning; Pattern Recognition; Linearity; Parameter Adjustment; Search Strategy		In this paper, a novel clustering method is proposed which is done by some hyper planes in the feature space. Training these hyper-planes is performed by adjusting Suitable bias and finding a proper direction for their perpendicular vector so as to minimize Mean-Squared Error. For this purpose, combination of training a hyper plane and a fundamental search method named Mountain-Climbing is utilized to find a local optimum solution. ne approach achieves a satisfactory result in comparison with the well known clustering methods such as k-means, RPCL, and also two hierarchical methods, namely, Single-Link and Complete-Link. Low number of parameters and linear boundaries are only some merits of the proposed approach. In addition, it finds the number of clusters dynamically. Some two dimensional artificial datasets are used to assess and compare these clustering methods visually.			mtaheri@cse.shirazu.ac.ir; chitsaz@cse.shirazu.ac.ir; katebi@shirazu.ac.ir; zjahromi@shirazu.ac.ir	Zolghadri Jahromi, Mansoor/	Zolghadri Jahromi, Mansoor/0000-0003-3815-1528			Fawcett Tom, 2003, HPL20034; JAHROMI MZ, 2007, FUZZY IN PRESS  0829; Lachiche N., 2003, P 20 INT C MACH LEAR, P416; Russell S.

Nevisa is an HMM-based, large vocabulary speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system. Like most successful recognition systems, MFCC with some modification has been used as speech signal features. It also utilizes a VAD based on signal energy and zero-crossing rate. Maximum likelihood estimation criterion the core of which are the classical segmental k-means and Baum-Welsh algorithms is used for training the acoustic models. The system is based on phoneme modeling and utilizes synchronous beam search based on lexicon tree for decoding the acoustic utterances. Language modeling for Persian has been implemented in two statistical (n-gram) and grammatical forms. Nevisa is equipped with out-of-vocabulary capability for applications with small size vocabulary. In order to compensate the effect of accuracy reduction in noisy environments, powerful robustness methods are utilized. Model-based approaches like PMC, MLLR, and MAP, feature robustness methods like CMS, PCA, RCC, and VTLN, and speech enhancement methods like spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering were investigated. Some of these methods were modified to achieve higher robustness. For training Nevisa, Farsdat database was used. To evaluate the system accuracy, a clean test set was selected from Farsdat and four noisy tasks with different noise types were recorded in different real environments. By taking the advantages of the robustness methods, performance of Nevisa in real environments is similar to clean condition.

However in many practical situations it is often so difficult to determine the best number of clusters. On the other hand, there are other Clustering algorithms such as Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (RPCL) or ISODATA which find the number Of Clusters automatically. But these clustering methods have a problem in locating the cluster centers appropriately. In this paper, a novel hybrid structure is proposed which uses these two types of clustering algorithms its complementary to improve clustering performance. Moreover, a new weighted version of RPCL algorithm which is called here WRPCL is suggested. This structure not Only Outperforms the choice of the optimal number of clusters but also improves the performance of the overall clustering result.

In this framework, users can conduct data mining using their private information with storing them in their local storages. After the computation, they obtain only mining result without disclosing private information to others. The number of parties that join conventional privacy-preserving data mining has been assumed to be two. In our framework, we assume large numbers of parties join the protocol, therefore, not only scalability but also asynchronism and fault-tolerance is important. Considering this, we propose a k-mean algorithm combined with a decentralized cryptographic protocol and a gossip-based protocol. The computational complexity is O(log n) with respect to the number of parties n and experimental results show that our protocol is scalable even with one million parties.

The aim of such linkages is to match all records that refer to the same entity. One of the main challenges in record linkage is the accurate classification of record pairs into matches and non-matches. Many modern classification techniques are based on supervised machine learning and thus require training data, which is often not available in real world situations. A novel two-step approach to unsupervised record pair classification is presented in this paper. In the first step, training examples are selected automatically, and they are then used in the second step to train a binary classifier. An experimental evaluation shows that this approach can outperform k-means clustering and also be much faster than other classification techniques.

However, most of those techniques have annoying obstacles in precise pattern recognition. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm termed G-TREACLE, which can fulfill numerous clustering requirements in data mining applications. As a hybrid approach that adopts grid-based concept, the proposed algorithm recognizes the solid framework of clusters and, then, identifies the arbitrary edge of clusters by utilization of a new density-based expansion process, which named "tree-alike pattern". Experimental results illustrate that the new algorithm precisely recognizes the whole cluster, and efficiently reduces the problem of high computational time. It also indicates that the proposed new clustering algorithm performs better than several existing well-known approaches such as the K-means, DBSCAN, CLIQUE and GDH algorithms, while produces much smaller errors than the K-means, DBSCAN, CLIQUE and GDH approaches in most the cases examined herein.

However, the existing constrained clustering algorithms are mostly k-means like methods, which may only deal with distance-based similarity measures. In this paper, we propose a constrained hierarchical clustering method, called Correlational-Constrained Complete Link (C-CCL), for gene expression analysis with the consideration of gene-pair constraints, while using correlation coefficients as the similarity measure. C-CCL was evaluated for the performance with the correlational version of COP-k-Means (C-CKM) method on a real yeast dataset. We evaluate both clustering methods with two validation measures and the results show that C-CCL outperforms C-CKM substantially in clustering quality.

However, prior works neither clearly specify the connected constraint in the geography domain nor propose efficient algorithms. In this paper, we formulate the joint clustering problem in which a connected constraint and the number of clusters should be specified. We propose an algorithm K-means with Local Search (abbreviated as KLS) to solve the joint clustering problem with the connected constraint. Experimental results show that KLS can find correct clusters efficiently.

Front simulation results involving image compression based oil VQ, it is observed that the proposed method leads to better codebooks when compared with the conventional one (GA + standard K-means), in the sense that the former leads, to higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) results for the reconstructed images. Additionally, it is observed that the proposed method requires fewer GA generations (up to 40%) to achieve the best, PSNR. results produced by the conventional method.	[Azevedo, Carlos R.

Not only the proposed SDSA algorithm is suitable for almost all test data sets used by Chung and Liu for point symmetry-based K-means algorithm (PSK algorithm) and their newly proposed modified point symmetry-based K-means algorithm (MPSK algorithm), the proposed SDSA algorithm is also suitable for many other cases where the PSK algorithm and MPSK algorithm can not be well performed. Based on some test data sets, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SDSA algorithm is rather encouraging when compared to the previous PSK algorithm and MPSK algorithm.

First, a k-means clustering is performed based on the image intensity. A hierarchical recognition scheme is then used to recognize the structure to be segmented, and an initial seed is constructed from the recognized region. The seed is then evolved under certain deformable model mechanism. The automatic recognition is based on fuzzy logic techniques. We apply our algorithm for the segmentation of the corpus callosum and the thalamus from brain MRI images. Depending on the specific features of the segmented structures, the most suitable recognition schemes and deformable models are employed. The whole procedure is automatic and the results show that this framework is fast and robust.

The approach uses graph cuts to improve the k-means algorithm, as graph cuts introduce spatial domain information of the image that is lacking in the k-means. High resolution satellite imagery, IKO-NOS, and SPOT-5 have been evaluated by the proposed method, showing that graph cuts improve k-means results, which in turn show coherent and continually spatial cluster regions that could be useful for cartographic classification.

Tightly coupled, the distance measure is the basis for a soft k-means like framework to achieve robust clustering. Successful application of the system along with generation of shape prototypes is demonstrated in comparison to latest approaches using elastic deformation.

Thus, despite a demand for supports through well-organized information, little attentions have been paid to a study on how/which information can be utilized in a technology roadmapping. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a methodology to structure technological information in order to support the process. To this end, four methods are suggested to provide useful and substantial information: summary, information extraction, search and clustering. This research identifies the characteristics of data which can be potentially used in roadmapping and presents an approach to yielding important information from such raw data through various data mining techniques including text mining, multi-dimensional scaling and K-means clustering. Moreover, this paper explains how this approach can be applied in each step of roadmapping (preliminary, mapping and managing steps).

J	Ricquier, B; Bostoen, K				Ricquier, Birgit; Bostoen, Koen			Resolving phonological variability in Bantu lexical reconstructions: the case of 'to bake in ashes'	AFRICANA LINGUISTICA			English	Review								The current number of Bantu lexical reconstructions is highly inflated due to our partial understanding of diachronic semantic and phonological changes. The online Bantu Lexical Reconstructions 3 (Bastin & Schadeberg 2003) database holds numerous homophonous reconstructions with related meanings as well as multiple synonymic reconstructions whose phonological shape is only minimally dissimilar. This phenomenon is also known as 'osculance' in Bantu studies (Guthrie 1967-1971). In this paper we argue that phonological variability in Bantu lexical reconstructions can often be resolved through a careful reanalysis of synonymic near-homophones. We demonstrate how the osculant quadruplet degrees-bumb-/degrees-dumb iota k-/degrees-bumb iota k-/degrees-gumb iota k- meaning 'to bake in ashes' can be reduced to one common Proto-Bantu form and evaluate what implications this has with respect to the history of this particular culinary technique in Bantu speech communities.

In this paper, an intelligent distributed framework is presented to address the use of intelligent models for adaptive distributed object groups. Moreover, this paper proposes the agent-based data-mining model for implementing adaptive schemes using data mining algorithms and efficient interactions using multi-agent system. The k-means algorithm constructs group classes of object, multilayer perceptron classifies the client requests using the classes constructed from k-means and patterns generated from Apriori algorithm determine the next object needed to be replicated. For efficient interactions, the data mining is modeled in multi-agent system. Simulation result using the proposed model shows great improvements on serving clients by minimizing delay time and optimizes system performance by efficient load distribution.

In this method, a decision cluster classification model (DCC) consists of a set of disjoint decision clusters, each labeled with a dominant class that determines the class of new objects falling in the cluster. A cluster tree is first generated from a training data set by recursively calling a variable weighting k-means algorithm. Then, the DCC model is selected from the tree. Anderson-Darling test is used to determine the stopping condition of the tree growing. A series of experiments on both synthetic and real data sets have shown that the new classification method (ADCC) performed better in accuracy and scalability than the existing methods of k-NN, decision tree and SVM. It is particularly suitable for large, high dimensional data with many classes.

The Lsc algorithm firstly try to learn a smooth enough manifold structure on the data manifold and then computes the eigenvectors on the smooth manifold structure, then as former spectral clustering methods, we use the eigenvectors to help the k-means algorithm to do clustering. Experiments have been performed on toy data sets and real world data sets and have shown that our algorithm can effectively discover the cluster structure and holds much better clustering accuracy than former methods. It is also worth noting that our algorithm is also much more stable in parameter than former spectral clustering methods.

The demanding nature of the Netflix data has lead to some interesting and ingenious modifications to standard learning methods in the name of efficiency and speed. There are three basic methods that have been applied in most approaches to the Netflix problem so far: stand-alone neighborhood-based methods, latent factor models based on singular-value decomposition, and ensembles consisting of variations of these techniques. In this paper we investigate the application of forward stage-wise additive modeling to the Netflix problem, using two regression schemes as base learners: ensembles of weighted simple linear regressors and k-means clustering-the latter being interpreted as a tool for multivariate regression in this context. Experimental results show that our methods produce competitive results.

These samples were deposited onto different substrates (zinc selenide and calcium fluoride respectively) and embedded using two types of paraffin. Formalin fixation followed by paraffin embedding is the gold standard in tissue storage. It can preserve molecular structures and it is compatible with immunohistochemistry. However, paraffin absorption bands are significant in the mid-infrared region and can mask some molecular vibrations of the tissue. Direct data processing was applied on spectral images without any chemical dewaxing of the tissues. Extended Multiplicative Signal Correction was used to correct the spectral contribution from paraffin. For this purpose, the signal of paraffin was modelled using Principal Component Analysis and paraffin spectra were removed from the raw images based on an outlier detection. Then, pseudo-colour images were computed by K-means clustering in order to highlight histological structures of interest. This robust chemometrics methodology was applied on the two samples. Tumour areas were successfully demarcated from the rest of the tissue in both colon and skin independently of the embedding material and of the substrate.

Detection of pathological aortic tissues by infrared multispectral imaging and chemometrics	ANALYST			English	Article							MULTIPLICATIVE SIGNAL CORRECTION; FT-IR MICROSPECTROSCOPY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; MICRO SPECTROSCOPY; ELASTIN	Processing of multispectral images is becoming an important issue, especially in terms of data mining for disease diagnosis. We report here an original image analysis procedure developed in order to compare 42 infrared multispectral images acquired on human ascending aortic healthy and pathological tissues. Each image contained about 2500 infrared absorption spectra, each composed of 1641 variables (wavenumbers). To process this large data set, we have restricted the spectral window used to the 1800-950 cm(-1) spectral range and selected 100 spectra from the aortic media, which is the most altered part of the aortic tissue in aneurysms. Prior to this selection, a spectral quality test was performed to eliminate 'bad' spectra. Our data set was first subjected to a discriminant analysis, which allowed separation of aortic tissues in two groups corresponding respectively to normal and aneurysmal states. Then a K-means analysis, based on 20 groups, allowed reconstruction of infrared images using false-colours and discriminated between pathological and healthy tissues. These results demonstrate the usefulness of such data processing methods for the analysis and comparison of a set of spectral images.	[Bonnier, F.; Rubin, S.; Manfait, M.; Sockalingum, G.

Eighteen weaning piglets were vaccinated subcutaneously with tetanus toxoid. Leukocyte RNAs were isolated from samplings before and 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after vaccination. After competitive hybridization of a 13297 porcine 70-mer oligo microarray (Qiagen-Operon NRSP8), subsequent image analysis and normalization, the data was analysed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) to identify genes regulated due to vaccination (ANOVA, p <= 0.05; corresponding to false discovery q <= 0.12). Of 8,240 probes representing genes expressed in leukocytos, 1,289 genes showed differential expression. Results were exemplarily confirmed by real-time PCR. Holistic expression data was clustered to six prominent groups of genes with similar changes in expression patterns using a k-means algorithm. To got more insight into functional and structural components and impact of the genes represented in each cluster, the EASE score was used to identify Gene Ontology functional categories. The results showed that in vivo significant changes of expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) occurred very early after immune stimuli. These alterations concerned genes of pathways related to immune response as well as other metabolic and regulatory pathways including ATP/energy metabolism, transcription, structural molecule activity, biosynthesis, and metabolism. The analysis reveals now functional candidate genes for traits related to immune responsiveness and also provides new insight into the interaction of immune response, and metabolic and endocrine status. This will facilitate a better understanding of the relationship between immune and performance traits.

These are grouped in five categories (liquidity, solvency, efficiency, profitability, and market value), and the analysis follows their changes in time, trying to evaluate their development possibilities in time. The research method employed is cluster analysis, while the period under analysis is 2002 2006, with annual data used. The cluster analysis progressively groups the companies, according to two main criteria: objects' similarity within the groups and groups' differentiation, We use, as clustering procedures, the single linkage method and the Wards method and we also construct a number of clusters using the k-means method. The results show that Romanian companies do not display any industrial specificities that are reflected in their financial performance. Still, further research is needed in order to provide categorical arguments in favor of this conclusion.

S	Haan, BD			IEEE	Haan, Brian Douglas			A Simple Classification Approach to Build a Bathtub	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM, 2008 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	54th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 28-31, 2008	Las Vegas, NV			Reliability Data Analysis; Mixed-Weibull		The notional bathtub curve is often cited to describe how a device's failure rate may change with age. Modeling the bathtub curve or other undulating function to capture the reliability-centric phases of life can be accomplished using the mixed-Weibull distribution. Unfortunately, fitting failure data directly to the mixed-Weibull distribution typically requires an assumption of the number of subpopulations within the distribution and difficult computations that often end in the utilization of complex algorithms. The fitting approach described in this paper provides a tactic that can perforin the fit without assuming a set number of subpopulations and can be implemented in a basic spreadsheet. This paper begins with a brief examination of a common mixed-Weibull form. It is observed that the likelihood function of this form implicitly handles the data in aggregate ironically not a mixture. This can be addressed with a modest adjustment but at the cost of greatly increasing the number of parameters that must be considered to fit the distribution. Two separate derivations of the introduced approach are outlined. The first originates within an Artificial-Life framework used for constructing reliability models. Processes within this framework are taken to a conceptual limit. Addressing computational time issues that result yields the presented approach. Because the Artificial-Life Framework tactic is still largely unproven a second derivation based on the well established k-means clustering algorithm is provided as an alternate. Because k-means clustering algorithms are well known, their behavior provides predictions into the behavior of the approach being introduced. The mechanics of the approach are outlined and detailed using sample data. One simple sample set demonstrates the mechanics while a second, more contextually rich set of data illustrates a more realistic application and behavior of the approach. In each, individual reliability data are classified and subpopulations emerge to quickly estimate parameters for a mixed-Weibull distribution. Performance characteristics are noted to be very similar to the k-means algorithm. Termination requires little iteration so even very complex mixtures can be assessed quickly. As predicted by its k-means derivation the approach is mildly chaotic so multiple trials may yield better solutions. Fortunately speed and case of implementation accommodates for this shortcoming. Additionally, repeated application of the method on a set of data is shown to yield a discrete probabilistic estimate of the number of subpopulations contained within a dataset. The approach is found to be a convenient addition to the reliability analyst's toolbox.

Four sets of CT images were segmented by a binary classification method, support vector machine (SVM), after supervised thresholding and K means clustering. A leave-one-out method was applied to compare with the adaptive method. The result shows that the adaptive method can more accurately identify the class of the pixel with evidently lower false negative volume fraction than that of the leave-one-out method.

The proposed system uses Semantic Mapping to dimensionality reduction and K-means to volume reduction of document vectors of a medium text collection. The vectors obtained after dimensionality and volume reduction steps are used to train the document maps with the SOM algorithm, thus the training time is reduced without compromising the quality of the generated map. We compare experimentally the hybrid system with the correspondent SOM system in organization of documents of Reuters-21758 v1.0 collection. The performances of the systems were measured in terms of classification error in text categorization and training time. The experimental results show that the proposed system generates pretty good document maps with smallest training time.

Some techniques can keep the local structure of data, while the others try to preserve the global structure. In this paper, we propose a linear dimensionality reduction technique that characterizes the local and global properties of data by firstly applying k-means algorithm on original data, and then finding the projection by simultaneously globally maximizing the between-cluster scatter matrix and locally minimizing the within-cluster scatter matrix, which actually keeps both local and global structure of data. Low complexity and structure preserving are two main advantages of the proposed technique. The experiments on both artificial and real data sets show the effectiveness and novelty of proposed algorithm in visualization and classification tasks.

Problem ConFL is a natural extension of the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem where a facility can be any point in R-q. The proposed algorithms are based on a primal-dual technique for spaces with constant dimensions. For the ConFL Problem, we present algorithms with approximation factors 3+epsilon and 1.861+epsilon for euclidean distances and 9+epsilon for squared euclidean distances. For the k-Means Problem (that is restricted to squared euclidean distance), we present an algorithm with approximation factor 54 + epsilon. All algorithms have good practical behaviour in small dimensions. Comparisons with known algorithms show that the proposed algorithms have good practical behaviour.	[Meira, Luis A.

AVQ with variable block size has so far been implemented using a quad tree (QT) decomposition algorithm. QT decomposition carries out image partitioning based on the homogeneity of local regions of an image. However, we think that the complexity of local regions of an image is more essential than the homogeneity, because we pay close attention to complex region than homogeneous region. Therefore, complex regions are essential for image compression. Since the complexity of regions of an image is quantified by values of LFD, we implemented variable block size using LFD values and constructed a codebook ( CB) for a VQ. To confirm the performance of the proposed method, we only used a discriminant analysis and FGLA to construct a CB. Here, the FGLA is the algorithm to combine generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) and the fuzzy k means algorithm. Results of computational experiments showed that this method correctly encodes the regions that we pay close attention. This is a promising result for obtaining a well-perceived compressed image. Also, the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of VQ by FGLA in terms of both compression rate and decoded image quality. Furthermore, 1.0 bpp and more than 30 dB in PSNR by a CB with only 252 code-vectors were achieved using this method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This dermatologic cancer has increased its frequency and mortality during last years. In particular, mortality is around twenty percent in non early detected one;. For this reason, the aim of medical researchers is to improve the early diagnosis through a best melanoma characterization using pattern matching. This article presents a new way to create real melanoma patterns in order to improve the future treatment of the patients. The approach is a pattern discovery system based on the K-Means clustering method and validated by means of a Case-Based Classifier system.

The contribution of this work is the introduction of a smoothing prior over component regression coefficients through a Bayesian framework. This is done by using an appropriate Student-t distribution. The advantages of the sparsity-favouring prior is to make model more robust, less independent on order p of polynomials and improve the clustering procedure. The whole framework is converted into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where the known EM algorithm can be applied offering update equations for the model parameters in closed forms. The efficiency of the proposed sparse mixture model is experimentally shown by applying it on various real benchmarks and by comparing it with the typical regression mixture and the K-means algorithm. The results are very promising.

At shot level, the key-frame extraction problem provides sufficient indexing and browsing of large video database. In this paper we propose an approach that estimates the number ofkey-frames using elements of the spectral graph theory. Next, the frames of the video sequence are clustered into groups using an improved version of the spectral clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm efficiently summarizes the content of a video shot producing unique and representative key-frames outperforming other methods.

The proposed method is based on an embedding procedure that maps graphs to an n-dimensional real vector space. The basic idea is to view the edit distance of an input graph g to a number of prototype graphs as a vectorial description of g. Based on the embedded graphs, kernel k-means clustering is applied. In several experiments conducted on different graph data sets we demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our novel graph clustering approach and compare it with a standard. clustering procedure directly applied in the domain of graphs.

RBF network implements a normalized Gaussian radial basis function network. It uses the k-means clustering algorithm to provide the basis functions and learns a linear regression (numeric class problems) on top of that. Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The experimental results show that the accuracy of RBF network and Random Forest adds tip to 93.71% and 96.98%, respectively. Apparently these two methods are applicable and effective to classify quasars from stars. They may also be used to solve other classification problems faced in astronomy and Virtual Observatory.

J	Paquin, P				Paquin, Pierre			Carabid beetle (Coleoptera : Carabidae) diversity in the black spruce succession of eastern Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						microhabitat; indicator species; ecological time hypothesis; forestry practices; regional biodiversity	SOUTHERN-BOREAL FOREST; COARSE WOODY DEBRIS; GROUND-BEETLES; CLEAR-CUT; SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT; POSTFIRE REGENERATION; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; FIRE RESIDUALS; NORTH-AMERICA; COMMUNITIES	This study provides the first assessment of carabid beetle diversity in a natural forest context that encompasses a complete black spruce (Picea mariana) natural succession. Boreal forest conservation has been based on several assumptions about forest age that only consider species richness without accounting for species composition. It has also been guided by studies of incomplete chronologies that do not include naturally burned or old-growth stages. Twenty-one forest stands of different ages following fire - from recently burned to old-growth stages (0-340 years of age) - were sampled, revealing a strong relationship between age of forest and diversity of Carabidae. Over time, species richness followed a parabolic U-shaped pattern both with observed (Obs) and predicted richness (ACE). Chronological clustering identified four groups of species in the succession: the 'burned' group characterized 0-2-year-old forests, 'regenerating' (21-58 year), 'mature' (70-170 year) and 'old-growth' (177-340 year). The time spans corresponding to each of these assemblages lengthen with age of forest at an exponential rate. Ward's and K-means (clustering without constraint) provided support for the four assemblages but showed variation between individual successions, particularly for the 'regenerating' assemblage, identified as the most heterogeneous. The IndVal method identified characteristic species in every stage of the succession, particularly Sericoda spp. in the burned stage and Dromius piceus and Platynus mannerheinmii associated with old-growth stands. The results obtained here show that diversity of Carabidae varies in primeval conditions according to age of forest and such variation should be taken into account when conservation issues are involved.

This operation allows the further application of fully-automated techniques for quantitative evaluation of protein activity, since it avoids the necessity of a preventive manual selection of the representative pathological areas in the image, as well as of taking pictures only in the pure-cancerous portions of the tissue. In this paper we present a fully-automated method based on unsupervised clustering that performs tissue segmentations highly comparable with those provided by a skilled operator, achieving on average an accuracy of 90%. Experimental results on a heterogeneous dataset of immunohistochemical lung cancer tissue images demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised approach overcomes the accuracy of a theoretically superior supervised method such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) by 8%.

Clustering is performed as a two-stage process, in which the models used in the first stage are variants of Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). Class information-enriched variants of GTM are used to obtain a primary cluster description of the data. The number of clusters used by GTM is usually large and does not necessarily correspond to the overall class structure. Consequently, in a second stage, clusters are agglomerated using K-means with different initialization strategies, some of them defined ad hoc for the GTM models. We evaluate if the use of class information influence the brain tumour cluster-wise class separability resulting from the process. We also resort to a robust variant of GTM that detects outliers while effectively minimizing their negative impact in the clustering process.

Mass spectra, multi-channel chromatograms, or cDNA arrays are such data sources of interest for which accurate analysis is desired. Centroid-based clustering provides helpful data abstraction by representing sets of similar data vectors by characteristic prototypes, placed in high-density regions of the data space. This way, specific modes can be detected, for example, in gene expression profiles or in lists containing protein and metabolite abundances. Despite their widespread use, k-means and self-organizing maps (SOM) often only produce suboptimum results in centroid computation: the final clusters are strongly dependent on the initialization and they do not quantize data as accurately as possible, particularly, if other than the Euclidean distance is chosen for data comparison. Neural gas (NG) is a mathematically rigorous clustering method that optimizes the centroid positions by minimizing their quantization errors. Originally formulated for Euclidean distance, in this work NG is mathematically generalized to give accurate and robust results for the Pearson correlation similarity measure. The benefits of the new NG for correlation (NG-C) are demonstrated for sets of gene expression data and mass spectra.			stricker@ipk-gatersleben.de; srinivas@ipk-gatersleben.de; thomas.villmann@medizin.uni-leipzig.de; hammer@in.tu-clausthal.de	Sreenivasulu, Nese/E-8600-2011	Sreenivasulu, Nese/0000-0002-3998-038X			Cottrell M, 2006, NEURAL NETWORKS, V19, P762, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2006.05.018; Cottrell M., 1994, European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks.

However, not all implementations of clustering algorithms yield the same performance or the same clusters. Results: In this paper, we study two implementations of a general method for data clustering: k-means clustering. Our experimentation compares the running times and distance efficiency of Lloyd's K-means Clustering and the Progressive Greedy K-means Clustering. Conclusion: Based on our implementation, not just in processing time, but also in terms of mean squared-difference (MSD), Lloyd's K-means Clustering algorithm is more efficient. This analysis was performed using both a gene expression level sample and on randomly-generated datasets in three-dimensional space. However, other circumstances may dictate a different choice in some situations.

J	Wu, FX				Wu, Fang-Xiang			Genetic weighted k-means algorithm for clustering large-scale gene expression data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article	Symposium of Computations in Bioinformatics and Bioscience (SCBB07)	AUG 13-15, 2007	Iowa City, IA					Background: The traditional (unweighted) k-means is one of the most popular clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data. However, it suffers three major shortcomings. It is sensitive to initial partitions, its result is prone to the local minima, and it is only applicable to data with spherical-shape clusters. The last shortcoming means that we must assume that gene expression data at the different conditions follow the independent distribution with the same variances. Nevertheless, this assumption is not true in practice. Results: In this paper, we propose a genetic weighted K-means algorithm (denoted by GWKMA), which solves the first two problems and partially remedies the third one. GWKMA is a hybridization of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a weighted K-means algorithm (WKMA). In GWKMA, each individual is encoded by a partitioning table which uniquely determines a clustering, and three genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) and a WKM operator derived from WKMA are employed. The superiority of the GWKMA over the k-means is illustrated on a synthetic and two real-life gene expression datasets. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm has general application to clustering large-scale biological data such as gene expression data and peptide mass spectral data.

J	Pirooznia, M; Yang, JY; Yang, MQ; Deng, YP				Pirooznia, Mehdi; Yang, Jack Y.; Yang, Mary Qu; Deng, Youping			A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: Several classification and feature selection methods have been studied for the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray data. Classification methods such as SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods have been used in recent studies. The accuracy of these methods has been calculated with validation methods such as v-fold validation. However there is lack of comparison between these methods to find a better framework for classification, clustering and analysis of microarray gene expression results. Results: In this study, we compared the efficiency of the classification methods including; SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods. The v-fold cross validation was used to calculate the accuracy of the classifiers. Some of the common clustering methods including K-means, DBC, and EM clustering were applied to the datasets and the efficiency of these methods have been analysed. Further the efficiency of the feature selection methods including support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), Chi Squared, and CSF were compared. In each case these methods were applied to eight different binary (two class) microarray datasets. We evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using supervised classifiers. Conclusions: We presented a study in which we compared some of the common used classification, clustering, and feature selection methods. We applied these methods to eight publicly available datasets, and compared how these methods performed in class prediction of test datasets. We reported that the choice of feature selection methods, the number of genes in the gene list, the number of cases (samples) substantially influence classification success. Based on features chosen by these methods, error rates and accuracy of several classification algorithms were obtained. Results revealed the importance of feature selection in accurately classifying new samples and how an integrated feature selection and classification algorithm is performing and is capable of identifying significant genes.

In this paper, we propose a 3D-MRF image model based on 2D MRF by extending 2D planar to 3D space, define and describe the 3D neighbor, clique and potential function. We segment medical image using the 3D-MRF and the steps are as follows: 1. Initial images are segmented by using k-means clustering, to reduce the computational burden by using a special data structure: the k-d tree. 2. The parameters are estimated by using the maximum a posteriori (AMP) for the 3D-MRF model. 3. Computing optimal Solution is done using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the Iterated Conditional Models (ICM) algorithm. Experiments show the 3D-MRF includes more neighboring information and the results of segmentation are more stable and practical.

One of the challenges is to generate ECG signals with a wide range of waveforms, power spectra and variations in heart rate variability (HRV)-all of which are important indexes of human heart functions. In this paper we present a comprehensive model for generating such artificial ECG signals. In the first model, the operator can specify the mean and standard deviation of the heart rate, the morphology of the PQRST cycle, and the power spectrum of the RR tachogram. In the second one, we use a new modified Zeeman model for generating the time series for HRV, and a single cycle of ECG is produced by using a simple neural network. The importance of the work is the model's ability to produce artificial ECG signals that resemble experimental recordings under various physiological conditions. In one of these models, IPFM box was used to generate the R-R intervals. On the other hand, we use A dynamical model based on three coupled ordinary differential equations is introduced which is capable of generating realistic synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In this paper we focus on clustering data derived from Autoregressive moving Average (ARMA) models using k-means and k-medoids algorithms with the Euclidean distance between estimated model parameter. These models employed to assess biomedical signal processing techniques which are used to compute clinical statistics from the ECG.

J	Levesque, J; Staenz, K				Levesque, Josee; Staenz, Karl			Monitoring mine tailings revegetation using multitemporal hyperspectral image data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article								This paper investigates the use of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery in the 400-2500 nm wavelength range for the extraction of information suitable for monitoring mine tailings revegetation. The objectives were twofold: (i) demonstrate the usefulness of fractional texture for monitoring mine tailings revegetation using visible and near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral data, and (ii) investigate the benefit of adding the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi) data were acquired over the Copper Cliff mine tailings impoundment area in the VNIR bands during the summers of 1996 and 1998. In addition, Probe-1 data were collected in the VNIR-SWIR region during the summer of 1999. Surface reflectance was retrieved from the three datasets, and spectra of the 1996 and 1998 casi datasets were resampled to match the 1999 Probe-1 spectral sampling characteristics, which resulted in 30 bands covering the 450-890 nm range. The three datasets were concatenated into one file, and 30 endmember spectra were automatically selected. Constrained linear spectral unmixing was performed using the 30 endmembers, which were then grouped into the six endmember categories, namely water, lime, fresh and oxidized tailings, and low and high photosynthetic vegetation. Image fractions were then normalized and image texture was extracted from the total vegetation fraction. Total vegetation fraction (high/low photosynthetic), total tailings fraction (fresh/oxidized), and texture of the vegetation fraction were used in a K-mean unsupervised classification, which produced the best results using seven classes (78.13% overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient of 0.74). Classification results were validated using a set of 34 ground estimates of vegetation cover and tailings. The full set of 128 bands of the 1999 Probe-1 dataset was used to investigate the contribution of the SWIR bands to monitoring the reclamation of mine tailings. A new vegetation endmember was identified as plant litter, which in many cases replaces areas labelled as low photosynthetic vegetation when using the VNIR bands only. Oxidized tailings could be separated into jarosite and goethite endmembers and lime into agricultural lime (CaMgCO(3)) and calcium oxide (CaO), also known as quicklime.

Volunteer computing platforms have the potential to provide massive computing power However privacy and security concerns prevent using volunteer computing for data mining of sensitive data. The Cell processor comes with a hardware security feature. The secure volunteer data mining can be achieved by using this hardware security feature. In this paper, we present a general security scheme for the volunteer computing, and a secure parallelized K-Means clustering algorithm for the Cell processor We also evaluate the performance of the algorithm on the Cell secure system simulator Evaluation results indicate that the proposed secure data clustering outperforms a non-secure clustering algorithm on the general purpose CPU, but incurs a huge performance overhead introduced by the decryption process of the Cell security features.

An intraspecific classification of Papaver somniferum L. cultivars; 4 basic clusters (groups) with white-seeded cultivars (cluster I) and dark-seeded (clusters 2 - 4) were established. Cluster analysis and the k-means method was applied. An evaluation was made of the similarities and differences between the cultivar clusters on the basis of the capsule's size and shape, seed coloration intensity in relation to soil conditions. A significant influence of habitat, particularly soil conditions of the experimental localities on the classification of the given clusters of poppy cultivars when applying the hierarchical clustering was not found. Examples of usage are the selection of parent material for breeding and the selection of appropriate varieties for given cultivation conditions.

Seven domestic maize hybrids (OsSK444, OsSK554, OsSK644 and OsSK713, Bc66-61 and Bc778) and two foreign (ZPSK633 and ZPSK778 - from Serbia) were used. The field trial was conducted in five replicates (gross of basic plot 56 m(2)). Grain yield in 2005 was 13% lower than in 2004 (8.28 and 9.53 t ha(-1), respectively). Yields on eutric cambisol were lower than on eugley (6.96 and 10.84 t ha(-1), respectively). Also, differences of yields among the hybrids were very significant. The hybrid Bc778 yielded 10.37 t ha(-1) or 32% more compared to the hybrids Bc592 and ZpSK704. Leaf-N was in 2005 11% higher than in 2004 (means 2.53% N and 2.81% N, respectively), while leaf-P (mean 0.28% P) and -K (mean 1.68% K) differences between two years were non-significant. Leaf-K under eugley conditions was 25% lower than on cambisol (means 1.44% K and 1.92% K, respectively). Differences in leaf composition among the maize hybrids (influences of genotype) were in the ranges from 2.59% N to 2.76% N, from 0.25% P to 0.30% P and from 1.62% K to 1.76% K. In general, low connection was between leaf nutritional status and yields probably because relative favorable soil fertility of both soil types, although the first-ranged hybrid regarding yield (Bc778) was in the group of the hybrids with the highest leaf-N, -P and -K. Also, two low-yielding hybrids (Bc592 and ZpSK704) characterized considerably lower leaf K.

Liming considerably influenced on maize yields by increases up to 26% (4-year mean) with variation these effects among the years from 7% to even 50%. Yields of sugar beet were increased due to liming up to 43% (30 and 43 t ha(-1), for 0 and 30 t ha(-1) of lime, respectively). However, liming was closely related to lower sugar beet root quality (sucrose = 14.6% and 13.4%, amino-N = 2.62 and 4.58 mmol 100 g(-1), for 0 and 60 t lime ha(-1), respectively). By using 60 t carbocalk ha-1 significantly increased maize leaf P (+45%), Ca (+35%), Mg (+57%) and decreased K (-7%), Zn (-54%) and Mn (-71%) compared to the control treatment (3-year means). Analogical comparison for sugar beet leaf (the 2004 growing season only) resulted by differences as follows: P (+57%), Ca (-18%), Zn (-53%), Mn (-90%), B (-36%), and non-significant differences for K, Mg and Na. Mean concentrations of the nutrients in maize leaves found by our study were as follows: 0.344 % P, 2.42% K, 0.812% Ca, 0.332, mg Mg kg(-1), 33.2 mg Zn kg(-1) and 130.3 mg Mn kg(-1), respectively. Adequate concentrations of these elements were found in maize leaves with emphasis that by using 60 t of lime ha(-1) concentrations of Zn were close to inadeaquate concentration of 20 mg Zn kg(-1). Also, adequate ranges of sugar beet leaf P (mean 0.374% P), K (mean 3.99% K), Ca (1.23% Ca) and Zn (mean 24.5 mg Zn kg(-1)) were found. The levels of leaf B, Mg and Mn were out the adequate ranges (deficit of B: mean 7.4 mg B kg(-1); oversupplies of Mg and Mn: means 1.18% Mg and 160 mg Mn kg(-1), respectively).

However, for each specific problem, the adequate technique must be selected in order to achieve better results. In this paper, a comparative analysis between the three mostly used clustering techniques (k-means, ISODATA, and the sequential clustering algorithm) is presented. The goal of the analysis is to compare the efficiency of each algorithm applied to numerical databases and images. The results of the application of the algorithms to a set of 25 images (natural and artificial) and 5 numerical databases are presented and discussed.			deygaleana06c@cenidet.edu.mx; ehsanchez06c@cenidet.edu.mx; magadan@cenidet.edu.mx					HAMMOUDA K, 2000, COMP STUDY CLUSTERIN; HUA G, 2004, P 3 INT C MACH LEARN, V6, P3568, DOI 10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380408; Likas A, 2003, PATTERN RECOGN, V36, P451; MARAVALL D, 1993, RECONOCIMIENTO FORMA, P176; PAJARES G, 2002, REV ELECT VISION COM; SHEKHAR R, 2007, IEEE T KNOWLEDGE DAT, V19; TRUJILLO M, 2005, 47 INT S ELMAR 2005; YING L, 2007, P 2007 IEEE S COMP I; CI MACHINE LEARNING	9	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA			978-0-7695-3320-9	ELECT ROBOT AUTO MEC			2008							288	292		10.1109/CERMA.2008.103		5	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical; Robotics	Engineering; Robotics	BIP00	WOS:000261441800049

In this paper we propose an effective algorithm to compute new cluster centers for each iterative step for K-means clustering. This algorithm is based on the optimization formulation of the problem and a novel iterative method. The cluster centers computed using this methodology are found to be very close to the desired cluster centers, for iterative clustering algorithms. The experimental results using the proposed algorithm with a group of randomly constructed data sets are very promising.

It takes the mean value of each cluster centroid as the Heuristic information, so it has some disadvantages: sensitive to the initial centroid and instability. The improved clustering algorithm referred to the best clustering centriod which is searched during the optimization of clustering centroid. That increased the searching probability around the best centroid and improved the stability of the algorithm. The experiment on two groups of representative dataset proved that the improved K-means algorithm performs better in global searching and is less sensitive to the initial centroid.

The method is based on an estimation of the number of clusters and an initialization of clusters centroids in order to partition the data with a popular clustering algorithm: K-means. These information are extracted from the construction of a minimal spanning tree (MST) and under the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution. We also introduce some recents populars clustering algorithms based on spectral graph theory: spectral clustering methods. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multidimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences (e.g Kullback-Leibler and ROnyi). The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results than some other clustering methods applied to astrophysical data such as: popular reflectance spectra surveys such as light Color Asteroid Survey and Small Main Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey II, and hyper-spectral images.

Effects of cement dust on soil chemical properties in the Calabar environment, southeastern Nigeria	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						Calabar environment; cement dust; fly ash; limestone	FLY-ASH	Some chemical properties of soils around the Calabar Cement Company operational area were studied from three profile pits sited at the crest, upper slope, and middle slope topographic positions. The results showed that the soil pH was moderately to slightly acid (mean 5.8), organic-matter content was moderate (mean 2.54%), total N (N) content was low (mean 0.04%), and available phosphorus (P) was high (mean 87.43 mg/kg). Exchangeable calcium (Ca) content was moderate to high (3.02 to 7.44 cmol/kg) in the surface soil; most samples had low magnesium (Mg) content (mean 0.25 cmol/kg), medium concentration of exchangeable potassium (K) (mean 0.10 cmol/kg), and medium to high exchangeable sodium (Na) (0.27 to 1.38 cmol/kg). The exchange acidity was low (mean 1.58 cmol/kg), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) had low to medium (2.50 to 15.17cmol/kg) values. The percentage of base saturation was high with most soils having values greater than 50% (mean 70.8%). The moderate to high content of Ca and the favorable pH in the soils of the study area are uncommon in the coastal plain soils of southern Nigeria; these, therefore, were readily attributable to the continuous deposition of cement dusts on the surface and leaching into deeper horizons.

Computational difficulty, however, has limited the adoption of this perspective as a useful model in practice. In this article, we illustrate the use of a new formulation for the clique partitioning problem that is readily solvable by basic metaheuristic methodologies such as Tabu Search. As such, this new model enables the widespread use of CP for clustering in practice. In this article, we present test results demonstrating that our CP model is an attractive alternative to well-known methods such as K-means and Latent Class (LC) clustering. Ours is the first article in the literature making such comparisons.

J	Sarkar, A; Chakraborty, A; Chaudhuri, A				Sarkar, Angshuman; Chakraborty, Arindom; Chaudhuri, Anamika			A method of finding predictor genes for a particular disease using a clustering algorithm	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						EM algorithm; microarray; model-based clustering	EXPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; NETWORK; ARRAYS; MODEL	Clustering Algorithms are nowadays really important tools in microarray data analysis. The different clustering algorithm generally used in biological science does not take into consideration the underlying probability distribution of the data. In this sense, they are heuristic in nature. In this work we proposed a clustering algorithm based on EM Algorithm. It gives 28% less misclassification than the K-means algorithm (which is mostly use in Bio science). We have also shown on a real data set that this algorithm can be efficiently used for detecting the genes which are responsible for a particular disease.

However, the dynamic nature of typical flows of supersonic combustors, gas turbine engines and augmenters can also lead to inhomogenities that cannot be captured by a single line-of-sight TDLAS measurement. Instead, multiple measurements varied over several spatial locations need to be made. In the current study, shock train structure in the isolator section of the Research Cell 18 supersonic combustion facility at Wright-Patterson AFB is measured. Although only two view angles are available for measurement, multiple absorption features along with a priori computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations enable estimates of two dimensional flow features to be formed. Vector quantization/k-means data clustering is used to identify key flow features from the temporal history of the raw sinograms. Through the use of multiple absorption features that are measured nearly simultaneously, an approximate two-dimensional image can be formed. This image can be further refined through the use of an optimal set of basis functions that can be derived from a set of CFD simulations that describes the flow shapes.

We choose to work in the Italian central Apennine intermountain basins because much human activities could mask this kind of landforms and because the timing of alluvial deposition is tied to land surface instabilities caused by regional climate changes. The main aim of the research is to understand where they form and where they extent in an effort to develop a new approach using the backscatter roughness parameters and primary attributes (elevation and curvature) derived from the SRTM DEM. Moreover, this study helps to provide a benchmark against which future alluvial fans detection using roughness and fuzzy logic analysis can be evaluated, meaning that sophisticated coupling of geomorphic and remote sensing processes can be attempted, in order to test for feedbacks between geomorphic processes and topography.

In this paper, a novel partitioning clustering method called KCK-means is proposed based on KCCA. We also show that KCK-means can not only be run on two-view data sets, but also it performs excellently on single-view data sets. KCK-means can deal with both binary-class and multi-class clustering tasks very well. Experiments with three evaluation metrics are also presented, the results of which reflect the promising performance of KCK-means.

The system segments the CT head images into 3 clusters, which are abnormal regions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain matter. Firstly we filter out the abnormal regions from the intracranial area by using the decision free.

It performs very fast categorization of each pixel in an image, a brute-force approach made feasible by three key developments: First, our method reduces the size of a large generic dictionary (on the order of ten thousand words) to the low hundreds while increasing classification performance compared to k-means. This is achieved by creating a discriminative dictionary tailored to the task by following the information bottleneck principle. Second, we perform feature-based categorization efficiently on a, dense grid by extending the concept of integral images to the computation of local histograms. Third, we compute SIFT descriptors densely in linear time. We compare our method to the state of the art and find that it excels in accuracy and simplicity, performing better while assuming less.

In this paper, we propose similarity features to describe the facial appearance for video-based facial event analysis. Inspired by the kernel features, for each sample, we compare it with the reference set with a similarity function, and we take the log-weighted summarization of the similarities as its similarity feature. Due to the distinctness of the apex images of facial events, we use their cluster-centers as the references. In order to capture the temporal dynamics, we use the K-means algorithm to divide the similarity features into several clusters in temporal domain, and each cluster is modeled by a Gaussian distribution. Based on the Gaussian models, we further map the similarity features into dynamic binary patterns to handle the issue of time resolution, which embed the time-warping operation implicitly. The haar-like descriptor is used to extract the visual features of facial appearance, and Adaboost is performed to learn the final classifiers. Extensive experiments carried on the Cohn-Kanade database show the promising performance of the proposed method.

In this paper, we address this problem from a view which utilizes multiple instances to represent the variations in multiple instance learning (MIL) framework. Specifically, logistic multiple instance boost (LMIBoost) is advocated to learn the pedestrian appearance model. To efficiently use the histogram feature, we propose the graph embedding based decision stump for the data with non-Gaussian distribution. First the topology structure of the examples are carefully designed to keep between-class far and within-class close. Second, K-means algorithm is adopted to fast locate the multiple decision planes for the weak classifier. Experiments show the improved accuracy of the proposed approach in comparison with existing pedestrian detection methods, on two public test sets: INRIA and VOC2006's person detection subtask [1].

In these type of applications, it is not known in advance how many ROIs may be segmented from images, and so classification algorithms mainly make use of only image-level features, ignoring important object-level information. In this paper, we will investigate how to preprocess high-dimensional object-level features through a unsupervised learning system and present the outputs of that system as additional image-level features to the supervised learning system. Novel semi-supervised approaches based on K-Means/Tabu Search(TS) and SOM/Genetic Algorithm (GA) with C4.5 as supervised classifier have been proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithms are then applied on real-world CD/DVD inspection system. Results have indicated an increase in the performance in terms of classification accuracy when compared with various existing approaches.	[Tahir, M. A.; Smith, J.

Classical clustering techniques such as hierarchical (HC) and k-means clustering (KM) were also applied to analyze the same data set to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN)-based clustering. Regenerated plants were clustered into two groups in varying numbers by ART 2, SOM, HC and KM. With ART 2, 19 of 55 plants were sorted into group '0' and the remaining 36 plants were placed in group '1', whereas; SOM distributed the regenerated plants in the ratio of 28:27. The clustering ratios of HC and KM were 34:21 and 26:29, respectively. However, a refined clustering of regenerated plants into seven groups was observed with Fuzzy ART. There was a similarity in the number of generated clusters between the training and validation data sets indicating the network efficiency. Biological validation of photometric clustering of regenerated plants was also assessed by indexing the corm induction potential of the sorted groups. A significant difference in corm induction potential between the groups was noted only with ART 2. Fuzzy ART- assisted grouping patterns are not conducive to segregate the potential corm producing shoots.

Two Layered Classification Using Qualitative and Quantitative Attributes for QRS Complex Analysis	COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual Conference on Computers in Cardiology	SEP 14-17, 2008	Bologna, ITALY					QRS complex classification in Holler electrocardiogram have been developed using the correlation coefficient methods. However, the accuracy of this traditional classification is not fully satisfied the clinical needs. In this paper, we propose a two-layered classification using qualitative and quantitative attributes. In the first layer, 24 components in a FFT power spectrum for each beat are calculated as the quantitative attributes and are classified using K-means algorithm. In the second layer, the numbers of low, middle and high peaks before/after an R wave are computed as the qualitative attributes and are also classified by the same way. We evaluated our method for ten cases from MIT-BIH arrhythmia databases and compared with a standard cross correlation coefficient method The classification error rate of the correlation coefficient method and proposed method is 1.10% and 0.79%. We confirmed that the accuracy in our method for the QRS complex analysis is significantly improved	[Kaneko, M.] Fukuda Denshi Co LTD, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan	Kaneko, M (reprint author), Fukuda Denshi Co LTD, Bunkyo Ku, 35-8 Hongo-2-Chome, Tokyo, Japan.	mutsuo.kanek@fukuda.co.jp					Arnold JM, 1975, COMPUT CARDIOL, P163; Dillman R., 1978, Computers in Cardiology 1978; ISERI F, 2008, INF PROC SOC JAP 200; Lewis J.

We have evaluated the methods on the annotated MIT-BIH database. In the case of Ant Colony inspired clustering we have also studied the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) measure. The DTW measure improved Se about 0.7% and Sp about 0.9% when compared to classical feature extraction for a #106 signal. The best-performing has been the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Se=94.3, Sp=74.1), however it is practically unusable as it is memory and computational demanding. Acceptable results (complexity vs. error) have been obtained by the Ant-Colony inspired method for Decision tree generation (Se=93.1, Sp=72.8).

First, an appropriate matrix of delays was constructed; then multiple independent components were calculated using TDSEP; finally, components were projected back onto the measurement space and grouped using K-means. Three single-channel phonograms from different subjects were analysed Results showed a better-quality and more objective extraction of Foetal Heart Sounds (S1-S2), maternal activity and line-noise by using this temporal independent approach (versus a FastICA version). Future work will look for extracting more sources and a robust method to measure the quality of the extraction.

Conventional clustering algorithms, such as the k-means algorithms, the fuzzy c-means algorithms, the Gutstafson-Kessel algorithm, etc., all require that each observation contains the same number of features. These algorithms can not be directly applied to asynchronously sampled observations, of which the feature vectors have different number of elements. The traditional approach to this problem is to first interpolate the asynchronously sampled observations into synchronous observations, and then cluster the observations with the above mentioned algorithms. But this approach gives poor result. In this paper we introduced the concepts of the fuzzy neighborhood and the fuzzy distance norms of asynchronously sampled observations. And using the ideas, we revised the standard FCM algorithm to allow it directly cluster asynchronously sampled data. We call the new algorithm the F2CM algorithm because it is a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm based on fuzzy distance norms between asynchronous observations. Through some examples, it was shown that the F2CM algorithm gave much superior result than the traditional approaches.

In previous works, we presented an algorithm (partSOM) to cluster distributed datasets, based on self-organizing maps (SOM). This work extends this approach presenting a strategy for efficient cluster analysis in distributed databases using SOM and K-means. The proposed strategy applies SOM algorithm separately in each distributed dataset, relative to database vertical partitions, to obtain a representative subset of each local dataset. In the sequence, these representative subsets are sent to a central site, which performs a fusion of the partial results and applies SOM and K-means algorithms to obtain a final result. Experimental results are compared with traditional SOM and partSOM approaches for different datasets.

The underlying unsupervised clustering algorithm is based on swarm technologies from the field of Artificial Life systems. Its basic elements are autonomous agents called Databots. Their unsupervised movement patterns correspond to structural features of a high dimensional data set. Supervising information can be easily incorporated in such a system through the implementation of special movement strategies. These strategies realize given constraints or cluster information. The system has been tested on fundamental clustering problems. It outperforms constrained k-means.

Text document clustering based on frequent word meaning sequences	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						text documents; clustering; frequent word sequences; frequent word meaning sequences; web search; WordNet	SUFFIX TREE CONSTRUCTION	Most of existing text clustering algorithms use the vector space model, which treats documents as bags of words. Thus, word sequences in the documents are ignored, while the meaning of natural languages strongly depends on them. In this paper, we propose two new text clustering algorithms, named Clustering based on Frequent Word Sequences (CFWS) and Clustering based on Frequent Word Meaning Sequences (CFWMS). A word is the word form showing in the document, and a word meaning is the concept expressed by synonymous word forms. A word (meaning) sequence is frequent if it occurs in more than certain percentage of the documents in the text database. The frequent word (meaning) sequences can provide compact and valuable information about those text documents. For experiments, we used the Reuters-21578 text collection, CISI documents of the Classic data set [Classic data set, ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/], and a corpus of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) Track of Text Retrieval Conference, 2004]. Our experimental results show that CFWS and CFWMS have much better clustering accuracy than Bisecting k-means (BKM) [M. Steinbach, G. Karypis, V. Kumar, A Comparison of Document Clustering Techniques, KDD-2000 Workshop on Text Mining, 2000], a modified bisecting k-means using background knowledge (BBK) [A. Hotho, S. Staab, G.

However, in data mining, often the data values are nominal and cannot be assigned meaningful continuous substitutes. The largest advantage of the k-means algorithm in data mining applications is its efficiency in clustering large data sets. The k-means algorithm usually uses the simple Euclidean metric which is only suitable for hyperspherical clusters, and its use is limited to numeric data. This paper extends our work on the D-CV metric which was introduced to deal with nominal data, and then demonstrates how the popular k-means clustering algorithm can be profitably modified to deal with the D-CV metric. Having adapted the k-means algorithm, the D-CV metric will be implemented and the results examined. With this development.	[Al-Harbi, S. H.; Al-Shahri, A.

Kohonen self-organising maps in the data mining of wine taster comments	DATA MINING IX: DATA MINING, PROTECTION, DETECTION AND OTHER SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Data Mining Protection	MAY 26-28, 2008	Cadiz, SPAIN	WIT Transactions Informat & Commun Technol, Wessex Inst Technol, Federal Univ Rio de Janeiro	Univ Cadiz	text mining; wine taster comments and wine sensory data	QUALITY	Computational neural network methods are increasingly being used for research-oriented data mining tasks. Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) techniques are well established within the so-called connectionist paradigm of Artificial Intelligence where neural networks are used to extract both explicit and implicit dependency values often between data that is sometimes disparate in type and kind. The research described here seeks to elicit relationships between grape varieties and their growing conditions using SOM techniques. In addition, utilising k-means and principle component analysis (PCA) methods, the data mined and depicted by the SOM technique is shown to have dependency values that enable a clustering of terms relating to variety quality to be associated with growing condition data to produce optimal locations for each. This study is part of a larger research project that uses comparative data from New Zealand and Chile. The text mining aspect of it forms one element of a 'toolbox' of integrated hardware and software instruments being developed to underpin an environmental modelling methodology oriented not only towards grape growing but also generally for optimal crop production. The example described here uses data from New Zealand in the first instance. The paper begins with a summary of some historical wisdom relating to grape growing with a discussion of some previous studies and then describes the text mining of comments from wine tasters, which are statistically analysed. The results are clustered and the paper concludes with a reflection on the investigation with a pointer to future work in this aspect of the larger research project previously described.

Our approach in clustering avoids the need for data and cluster information transfer between the GPU and CPU in between the iterations. In this paper we present the novelties in our approach and techniques employed to represent data, compute distances, centroids and identify the cluster elements using the GPU. We measure performance using the metric: computational time per iteration. Our implementation of k-means clustering on an Nvidia 5900 graphics processor is 4 to 12 times faster than the CPU and 7 to 22 times faster on the Nvidia 8500 graphics processor for various data sizes. We also achieved 12 to 64 times speed gain on the 5900 and 20 to 140 times speed gains on the 8500 graphics processor in computational time per iteration for evaluations with various cluster sizes.

Recently, with innovative gene expression microarray data technologies, thousands of expression levels of genes (features) can be measured simultaneously in a single experiment. The large number of genes with a lot of noise causes high complexity for cluster analysis. This challenge has raised the demand for feature selection - an effective dimensionality reduction technique that removes noisy features. In this paper we propose a novel filter method for feature selection. The suggested method, called ClosestFS, is based on a distance measure. For each feature, the distance is evaluated by computing its impact on the histogram for the whole data. Our experimental results show that the quality of clustering results (evaluated by several widely used measures) of K-means algorithm using ClosestFS as the pre-processing step is significantly better than that of the pure K-means.

However, KHM as a center-based clustering algorithm can only generate a local optimal solution. In this paper, we develop a new hybrid clustering algorithm combining Particle Swarm Optimization and K-Harmonic Means (HPSO) for solving this problem. This algorithm has been implemented and tested on several real datasets. The performance of this algorithm is compared with KHM and PSO. Our computational simulations reveal the HPSO clustering algorithm combines the ability of global searching of the PSO algorithm and the fast convergence and less sensitive to initial conditions of the KHM algorithm. The HPSO is a robust clustering algorithm.

This paper builds up a performance management system based on the one-class-support vector machine (OCSVM) and K-means clustering algorithm, which achieves not only the automatic detection of network anomalies but also the clustering of the anomalies with different levels. The OCSVM detects the anomalies by solving tin optimal problem to separate the nominal data from the anomalies; these detected anomalies are then classified into minor, medium and severe levels using K-means clustering. The real telecommunication performance data are employed in this paper for the investigation, and the numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of this system.

One of the most powerful sensing modality for robotic system is vision as it enables the robot to see its environment, recognize objects around it and interact with objects to accomplish its task. This paper discusses vision enabling techniques that allows a robot to detect, characterize, classify, and discriminate UneXploded Ordnance (UXO) from clutters in unstructured environments. A soft-computing approach is proposed and validated via indoor and outdoor experiments to measure its performance efficiency and effectiveness in correctly detection and classifying UXO vs. XO and other clutter. The proposed technique has many potential applications for military, homeland security, law enforcement, and in particular, environment UXO remediation and clean-up operations.

Experiences with Applied DSM: Protocol, Availability, Quality and Capacity Building	DIGITAL SOIL MAPPING WITH LIMITED DATA			English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Digital Soil Mapping for Regions and Countries with Sparse Soil Spatial Data Infrastructures	JUL, 2006	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Brazilian Natl Soil Res Ctr			CLASSIFICATION TREE ANALYSIS; FUZZY K-MEANS; SOIL SURVEY; LANDFORM CLASSIFICATION; CATEGORICAL MAPS; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM; PREDICTION; LANDSCAPE; LOCATION	This chapter considers both opportunities and constraints to applied, operational digital soil mapping (DSM) from the points of view of a) availability of suitable input data layers, b) protocols available for DSM, c) quality of input data layers and resultant output maps and d) other efforts required to build predictive mapping capacity and apply it effectively. Many potential DSM practitioners are discouraged by the real or perceived lack of availability of suitable input data layers to support DSM, particularly in regions with weakly developed spatial data infrastructures. Solutions to addressing problems of limited or sparse spatial data sets are identified for input layers derived from digital elevation models (DEM's), remotely sensed imagery and available secondary source maps. A variety of protocols for producing predictive soil maps are discussed under the general headings of unsupervised, supervised and knowledge-based (or heuristic) approaches. These key protocol activities support the ability to make maps of the spatial distribution of soil classes or attributes by developing predictive relations between spatially distributed input variables or classes and the desired output classes. Different strategies are reviewed to acquire and formalize tacit knowledge embodied in soil-landform, conceptual models and to capture this tacit knowledge as quantitative rules. A considerable amount of resistance to DSM arises from real or perceived concems about the quality of the resulting maps in comparison to existing maps produced using traditional mapping methods. Quality, defined as the ability of a map or product to correctly predict the characteristics of the landscape at particular points or within particular small areas, is discussed as are suitable approaches for evaluating and reporting it. The capacity to apply DSM routinely and operationally requires additional support in the form of training, access to suitable tools and software and access to suitable input data. Approaches to developing support for DSM from decision makers and funding agencies in the face of institutional and discipline resistance to embracing new technologies are identified, specifically incremental projects with clearly defined goals and testable measures of success. Finally, it is noted that perhaps the biggest hurdle to building capacity is our own hesitancy to believe in ourselves and to dream big and try big. It is hoped that this chapter will encourage individuals with an interest in applying new predictive mapping techniques to embrace change and to try to create useful, operational maps for large areas in their own regions of interest.

We classify the form images using low level pixel density information from the binary images of the documents. In this paper, we solve the form classification problem with a classifier based on the k-means algorithm, supported by adaptive boosting. Our classification method is tested on the NIST scanned tax forms data bases (special forms databases 2 and 6) which include machine-typed and handwritten documents. Our method improves the performance over published results on the same databases, while still using a simple set of image features.	[Reddy, K. V.

A major opportunity for improving the competitive nature of Greek agriculture is linked to the transformation of its existing structures, through the adoption of more business-oriented, competitive attributes. The aim of this paper is to examine the financing profile of agricultural farms in Greece, based on certain economic parameters, as stated and calculated in the investment plans submitted to the Region of Central Macedonia. The present paper is based on the research involving 296 investment plans (improvement plans) for agricultural holdings, a number which almost fully corresponds to the total number of investment plans included into the financing programme for the period 2002-2004. The examination of the investment plans was conducted on the basis of a point system used during the checking and approval process, and was also related to the level of public participation, and the borrowed and own capital that was invested. A series of analyses was applied to the available data, based on Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and K-Mean Cluster analysis. The above-mentioned applications highlighted 4 clusters of farms with a different profile, regarding the economic parameters mentioned above. Following this, the profile of the clusters was studied in relation to the gender of the beneficiaries, the geographical location of the farms and the proposed investment categories.

Estimating Road Traffic Congestion from Cellular Handoff Information using Cell-Based Neural Networks and K-Means Clustering	ECTI-CON 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2008 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING/ELECTRONICS, COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer Telecommunications and Information Technology	MAY 14-17, 2008	Krabi, THAILAND	Elect Engn, Elect, Comp, Telecommun & Informat Technol Asso c				This research proposes alternative methods for estimating degrees of road traffic congestion by using Cell Dwell Time (CDT) information available from cellular networks. CDT is the duration that a cellular phone remains associated to a base station between handoff events. As a phone in a vehicle travels along a road having different degrees of congestion, the value of CDT varies accordingly. Measurements of CDT were taken and classified into one of the three degrees of congestion using 1) K-means clustering algorithm and 2) backpropagation neural network. These machine-assigned classifications were then compared against human opinion to assess the accuracy. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using K-means and neural networks in classifying degrees of traffic congestion and that the neural network approach performs well for this task.

The aim of this study is to examine whether representation of physicians' expert knowledge in a simple heuristic model can improve data mining methods in prognostic assessments of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Five rheumatology consultants' experiences of clinical data patterns among R-A patients, as distinguished from healthy reference populations, were formally represented in a simple heuristic model. The model was used in K-mean-clustering to determine prognostic subgroups. Cross-sectional validation using physician's global assessment scores indicated that the simple heuristic model performed better than crude data made in identification of prognostic subgroups of RA patients. A simple heuristic model of experts' knowledge was found useful for semi-automatic data mining in the chronic disease setting. Further studies using categorical baseline data and prospective outcome variables are warranted and will be examined in the Swedish TIRA-program.

Linear discriminant analysis was the best method and next multilayer perceptron neural networks provided that the data was input into a network in the form of principal components. Nearest neighbour searching, k-means clustering and Kohonen neural networks achieved almost as good results as the former, but decision trees slightly worse. Thus, these methods fared well, but Naive Bayes rule could not be used since some data matrices were singular. Otoneurological cases subject to the six diseases given can be reliably distinguished.

Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used to visualize and understand the relationships between the variables in the multidimensional data set. K-means clustering was used to cluster the data set into statistically significant clusters. The local multiple-regression models for modeling the H-2 production rate were formulated for each cluster. The data was obtained from the xylose (concentration 20 gCOD/L) based fermentative H-2-producing continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The bioreactor (working volume, 4 L) was operated for 376 days at 35 +/- 1 degrees C and a hydraulic retention time of 12 h. The data was obtained when the bioreactor reached steady-state conditions. Different metabolic patterns (acetate and butyrate as the main metabolic products) in anaerobic xylose degradation were investigated. High H-2 production rates were observed during two states: first, when butyrate metabolism at pH 7 was occurring; and second, when acetate coupled metabolism at pH 6.7 was taking place in the bioreactor.

J	Kerschbaum, F				Kerschbaum, Florian			Building a privacy-preserving benchmarking enterprise system	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						benchmarking; privacy; use case analysis; peer group formation; protocol orchestration		Benchmarking is the process of comparing one's own performance to the statistics of a group of competitors, named peer group. It is a common and important process in the business world for many important business metrics, called key performance indicators (KPI). Privacy is of the utmost importance, since these KPIs allow the inference of sensitive information. Therefore several secure multi-party computation protocols for securely and privately computing the statistics of KPIs have recently been developed. These protocols are the basic building blocks for a privacy-preserving benchmarking system, but in order to complete an enterprise system that offers a benchmarking service to its customers more problems need to be solved. We first analyse how peer group participation impacts privacy and vice versa. Peer group formation is the process of forming sensible peer groups out of the set of subscribers. We characterise subscribers by a set of discrete criteria and therefore view the automatic peer group formation as a data clustering problem. We present a high-performance modification of k-means clustering that takes the minimum cluster size as an additional parameter which might be of independent interest. Our final approach is the first automatic peer group formation algorithm for an enterprise benchmarking system.

The importance of each ion was assessed by standard methods used to examine ionic composition and by multivariate methods. The K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis were applied to the percentages of the major ions. The concentration of the major cations are in the order Na(+) > Mg(2+) > Ca(2+) > K(+) and the major anions, Cl(-) > SO(4)(2-) > HCO(3)(-) > CO(3)(2-), and the salinity was high (mean TDS 2,691 mg l(-1)) due to sodium chloride. Using the proportions of the ions was possible to identify seven types of water within the basin related to discharges of different river sub-catchments and from endorheic catchments (in a sand dune region) actually connected with the basin by canals. The chemical composition of the basin is consequence of surface waters receiving salts from groundwater, evaporation and weathering of Post-Pampeano materials, and of anthropogenic impact by diversion between subcatchments for flood control. These results allowed us to test the marked effects on the ionic balance of basin at the base of a diversion management from endorheic catchments characterized by high salinity waters.

J	Wang, ZS; Maler, A; Logothetis, NK; Liang, HL				Wang, Zhisong; Maler, Alexander; Logothetis, Nikos K.; Liang, Hualou			Single-trial classification of bistable perception by integrating empirical mode decomposition, clustering, and support vector machine	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; FIELD POTENTIALS; EEG; CHOICE	We propose an empirical mode decomposition (EMD-) based method to extract features from the multichannel recordings of local field potential (LFP), collected from the middle temporal (MT) visual cortex in a macaque monkey, for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) perception. The feature extraction approach consists of three stages. First, we employ EMD to decompose nonstationary single-trial time series into narrowband components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with time scales dependent on the data. Second, we adopt unsupervised K-means clustering to group the IMFs and residues into several clusters across all trials and channels. Third, we use the supervised common spatial patterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters for the clustered spatiotemporal signals. We exploit the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We demonstrate that the CSP feature of the cluster in the gamma frequency band outperforms the features in other frequency bands and leads to the best decoding performance. We also show that the EMD- based feature extraction can be useful for evoked potential estimation. Our proposed feature extraction approach may have potential for many applications involving nonstationary multivariable time series such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

J	Da Rugna, J; Konik, H				Da Rugna, Jerome; Konik, Hubert			A Robust Approach to Segment Desired Object Based on Salient Colors	EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article								This paper presents a clustering-based color segmentation method where the desired object is focused on. As classical methods suffer from a lack of robustness, salient colors appearing in the object are used to intuitively tune the algorithm. These salient colors are extracted according to a psychovisual scheme and a peak-finding step. Results on various test sequences, covering a representative set of outdoor real videos, show the improvement when compared to a simple implementation of the same K-means oriented segmentation algorithm with ad hoc parameter setting strategy and with the well-known mean-shift algorithm.

In this paper, we describe our implementation of three important classes of data mining algorithms: clustering (k-Means), classification (RBF network), and association rule ruining (Apriori) on the CBE. We explain our parallelization methodology and describe the exploitation of thread- and data-level parallelism in each of the three algorithms. Finally we present experimental results on the Cell hardware, where we could achieve a high performance of up to 10 GFLOP/s and a speedup of up to 40.

J	Leonard, JT; Roy, K				Leonard, J. Thomas; Roy, Kunal			Exploring molecular shape analysis of styrylquinoline derivatives as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						QSAR; MSA; styrylquinoline; Anti-HIV; integrase; inhibitory activity; GFA; G/PLS; FA	FIELD ANALYSIS; BINDING MODE; QSAR; REPLICATION; PROTEASE	HIV-1 integrase inhibitory activity data of styrylquinoline derivatives have been subjected to 3D-QSAR study by molecular shape analysis (MSA) technique using Cerius(2) version 4.8 software (Accelrys). For the selection of test set compounds, initially a QSAR analysis was done based on topological and structural descriptors and K-means clustering technique was used to classify the entire data set (n = 36). Clusters were formed from the factor scores of the whole data set comprising of topological and structural descriptors without the biological activity, and based on the clusters, the data set was divided into training and test sets (n = 26 and n = 10, respectively) so that all clusters are properly represented in both training and test sets. In the molecular shape analysis, the major steps were (1) generation of conformers and energy minimization; (2) hypothesizing an active conformer (global minimum of the most active compound); (3) selecting a candidate shape reference compound (based on active conformation); (4) performing pair-wise molecular superimposition using maximum common subgroup [MCSG] method; (5) measuring molecular shape commonality using MSA descriptors; (6) determination of other molecular features by calculating spatial and conformational parameters; (7) selection of conformers; (8) generation of QSAR equations by standard statistical techniques. The best model obtained from stepwise regression and GFA techniques shows 51.6% predicted variance (leave-one-out) and 57.3% explained variance. In case of FA- PLS regression, the best relation shows 54.0% predicted variance and 57.9% explained variance. The R-pred(2) and R-test(2) values for the GFA derived model are 0.611 and 0.664, respectively, while the best FA-PLS model has R-pred(2) and R-test(2) values of 0.602 and 0.656, respectively. These models show the importance of Juts descriptors (total polar surface area, relative polar surface area, relative hydrophobic surface area, relative positive charge), fraction area of the molecular shadow in the XZ plane (ShadowXZfrac), common overlap steric volume and the ratio of common overlap steric volume to volume of individual molecules. Statistically reliable MSA models obtained from this study suggest that this technique could be useful to design potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, HH; Ong, CS				Liu, Hsiang-Hsi; Ong, Chorng-Shyong			Variable selection in clustering for marketing segmentation using genetic algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						marketing segmentation; clustering algorithms; genetic algorithms; variables selection	K-MEANS ALGORITHM	Marketing segmentation is widely used for targeting a smaller market and is useful for decision makers to reach all customers effectively with one basic marketing mix. Although clustering algorithms is popularly employed in dealing with this problem, it cannot be useful unless irrelevant variables are removed because irrelevant variables will distort the clustering structure and make the results useless. In this paper, genetic algorithms (GA) is used for variable selection and for determining the numbers of clusters. A real case of bank data set is used for illustrating the application of marketing segmentation. The results show that variable selection through GA can effectively find the global optimum solution, and the accuracy of the classified model is dramatically increased after clustering.

The correct diagnosis of thyroid dysfunctions is very important and early diagnosis is the key factor in its successful treatment. In this article, we used four different kinds of classifiers, namely Bayesian, k-NN, k-Means and 2-D SOM to classify the thyroid gland data set. The robustness of classifiers with regard to sampling variations is examined using a cross validation method and the performance of classifiers in medical diagnostic is visualized by using cobweb representation. The cobweb representation is the original contribution of this work to visualize the classifiers performance when the data have more than two classes. This representation is a newly used method to visualize the classifiers performance in medical diagnosis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, SVC algorithm was employed to identify some samples as outliers and some others as intra-cluster points, so that it removed noise and extracted samples near to the cluster core. Then the proposed method used Minimum Spanning Tree Pruning (MSTP) strategy on those intra-cluster points to initialize the number of clusters and clustering centroids which would be the parameters for k-means algorithm. Finally, it run k-means algorithm on subset without outliers to obtain the clustering result and assigned outliers into the nearest cluster. Applying the proposed algorithm to several test datasets, the experiments results compared with initial SVC algorithm and classical k-means strongly validate the efficiency and feasibility of SVC-KM	[Sun, Ying; Wang, Yan; Wang, Juexin; Du, Wei; Zhou, Chunguang] Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China	Sun, Y (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.	sunying_1230@hotmail.com; wy6868@hotmail.com; cgzhou@jlu.edu.cn					[Anonymous], TUTORIAL CLUSTERING; Ben-Hur A., 2001, J MACHINE LEARNING R, V2, P125; Jain AK, 1999, ACM COMPUT SURV, V31, P264, DOI 10.1145/331499.331504; Laszlo M, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V28, P2359, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2007.08.006; Lee S, 2005, 2005009 U MASS LOW D; Lu JF, 2008, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V29, P787, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2007.12.009; Macqueen J.

Unlike K-means. KHM is less sensitive to initial conditions. However, KHM as a center-based clustering algorithm can only generate a local optimal solution. In this paper, we present a hybrid clustering algorithm combining Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and K-Harmonic Means (HQPSO) for solving this problem. This algorithm has been implemented and tested on several simulated and real datasets. The performance of this algorithm is compared with KHM, PSO, HPSO and QPSO. Our computational simulations reveal the HQPSO clustering algorithm has the advantage of global searching, fast convergence and less sensitive to initial conditions. The HQPSO is a robust clustering algorithm.			luke76@163.com; fkn@163.com; xgqmail2000@l63.com					ABBAS HM, 1994, SIGNAL PROCESS, V36, P111, DOI 10.1016/0165-1684(94)90182-1; BELL DA, 1990, J AM SOC INFORM SCI, V41, P98, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199003)41:2<98::AID-ASI3>3.0.CO;2-1; Carpineto C, 1996, MACH LEARN, V24, P95; Evangelou I.

The IWEKM (Improved Weight Entropy K-means) algorithm is proposed in this paper. I The proposed algorithm overcomes the above problems by modifying the cost function of entropy weighting k-means clustering algorithm by adding a variable that is relevant linearly to the square sum of distances from the mean of all objects and the means of all clusters and a variable that is relevant to relativity degree of categorical data The results of different clustering algorithms applied on Iris data and Flag data show that the proposed algorithm is efficient.

In traditional algorithm, each feature is treated equally and each one gives the same contribution to K-means. In fact, redundant and irrelevant features may disturb the clustering result. This paper proposes a improved K-means algorithm based on a fuzzy feature selection strategy. The method is based on measuring 'Feature Important Factor' (FIF). Firstly, make use of the first time clustering result to get class labels; secondly, set up decision tree to calculate the FIF; thirdly, do the cluster algorithm again with the FIF to modify the similarity measure and then get the modified clustering result. The experiment with UCI datasets proves that, the strategy of fuzzy feature selection can improve the clustering result effectively. At last, the application is done in human resource dataset of a domestic university for further proof of the effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm.

Therefore, this paper proposes a new K-AW algorithm; the algorithm is based on kernel function. Through this change, classification is transformed from linear to non-linear. The max-min distance algorithm and k-means clustering algorithm are used to form the training sample set for the modified K-AW algorithm. By this method Holler waveforms are classified more correctly and automatically.

Due to its self-organization, robustness, flexibility, and visualization, the ant-based clustering approach has been applied to text clustering. In this approach, however, the ant's moving is random, which leads to the convergence speed too slow. Aims at above-mentioned problem, an ant-based fast text clustering approach(AFTC) is presented This approach utilizes pheromone left by ants to avoid ant's moving randomicity, which can make the ant move towards direction which has high pheromone concentration at each step, and the direction of moving is the orientation where the text vectors are relatively concentration. Compared with the K-means algorithm, the ant-based fast text clustering approach performs the self-organization clustering process without setting clustering center number in advance, which can achieve better performance. The experimental results illustrate that the average time of ant-based fast text clustering approach is faster than that of traditional ant-based text clustering.

Genuine traffic traces are collected from the wireless mesh networks testbed, which tends to exhibit long-range dependent behavior under several Hurst index estimators. We analyze traffic traces and use clustering techniques to characterize patterns of individual users' behavior. After extracting traffic data from the raw data logs, we identify session clusters by employing the AutoClass tool and the K-means algorithm. Modeling and simulation were performed using the NS-2 tool. Based on the identified session clusters, we introduce source model based on wavelet. Simulation results indicate that traffic traces, compared to traditional traffic models, predict longer queues and, thus, require larger buffers in the network dimensioning.

This article unifies Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), proposes a numeric clustering algorithm. Chaos and space characteristic ideas are involved in the algorithm to avoid local optimal problem. Furthermore, BIC is also involved to provide an efficient estimation of the number of cluster. The simulation experiments indicated that, the article's algorithm has good performance in the numeric attribute cluster problems both in clustering result and estimation of K.

However, the two systems are too expensive and time-costing. A new comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY) developed based on the single-test multiple indicator measuring principle can reflect the weight, bending, friction and tension basic mechanical behavior as well as handle through only one pulling-out test. The present paper is to select characteristic indexes from the pulling-out force and distance curve acquired by the CHES-FY system, and the characteristics make a vector which expresses the handle of the fabric based on Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transformation; the other is to make clustering on handle of measured fabrics based on K-means fuzzy clustering. The experiments of thirty fabrics and comparisons between experimental and theoretical results were conducted, which shows that K-means fuzzy clustering algorithm is effective and accurate in sorting fabric handle based on the features selected from the pulling-out force and distance curve of the CHES-FY system.

K-means algorithm is not suitable for clustering source code as it is generally difficult for the users to determine the count of clusters for a previously unknown dataset. CURD clustering algorithm works efficiently. However, it can't process nominal attributes. In this paper, we propose NCURD algorithm for clustering source code by making CURD applicable to nominal attributes, and by improving the working efficiency of CURD. The experimental results show that NCURD algorithm has excellent clustering performance for clustering source code.

Most of the existing methods are based on distance measure. But in case of Data Stream these methods are not very efficient as computational point of view. Most of the exiting work on outlier detection in data stream declare a point as an outlier/inlier as soon as it arrive due to limited memory resources as compared to the huge data stream, to declare an outlier as it arrive often can lead us to a wrong decision, because of dynamic nature of the incoming data. In this paper we introduced a clustering based approach, which divide the stream in chunks and cluster each chunk using k-mean in fixed number of clusters. Instead of keeping only the summary information, which often used in case of clustering data stream, we keep the candidate outliers and mean value of every cluster for the next fixed number of steam chunks, to make sure that the detected candidate outliers are the real outliers. By employing the mean value of the clusters of previous chunk with mean values of the current chunk of stream, we decide better outlierness for data stream objects. Several experiments on different dataset confirm that our technique can find better outliers with low computational cost than the other exiting distance based approaches of outlier detection in data stream.

It can be used to discover interesting groups of resources through their (semantic) annotations expressed in the standard logic programming languages. The method exploits an effective and language-independent semi-distance measure for individuals., that is based on the resource semantics w.r.t. a number of dimensions corresponding to a committee of features represented by a group of concept descriptions (discriminating features). The algorithm is a fusion of the classic BISECTING K-MEANS with approaches based on medoids that are typically applied to relational representations. We discuss its complexity and potential applications to several tasks.

An algorithm to infer similarity among cell types and organisms by examining the most expressed sequences	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference of the Brazilian-Association-for-Bioinformatics-and-Computational-Biology	NOV 01-03, 2007	Sao Paulo, BRAZIL	Brazilian Assoc Bioinformat & Computat Biol		Gene expression; Clustering; Similarity measure; Most expressed sequences	GENE-EXPRESSION; OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; PROFILES; DIFFERENTIATION; COMMITMENT; PATTERNS; TISSUES; CANCER	Following sequence alignment, clustering algorithms are among the most utilized techniques in gene expression data analysis. Clustering gene expression patterns allows researchers to determine which gene expression patterns are alike and most likely to participate in the same biological process being investigated. Gene expression data also allow the clustering of whole samples of data, which makes it possible to find which samples are similar and, consequently, which sampled biological conditions are alike. Here, a novel similarity measure calculation and the resulting rank-based clustering algorithm are presented. The clustering was applied in 418 gene expression samples from 13 data series spanning three model organisms: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The initial results are striking: more than 91% of the samples were clustered as expected. The MESs (most expressed sequences) approach outperformed some of the most used clustering algorithms applied to this kind of data such as hierarchical clustering and K-means. The clustering performance suggests that the new similarity measure is an alternative to the traditional correlation/distance measures typically used in clustering algorithms.	[Ortega, J.

Identification of transcripts with enriched expression in the developing and adult pancreas	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; DIABETES RESEARCH; BETA-CELL; REGULATORY PATHWAYS; MOUSE-TISSUES; DIFFERENTIATION; REPRESSION; NETWORK; BINDING	Background: Despite recent advances, the transcriptional hierarchy driving pancreas organogenesis remains largely unknown, in part due to the paucity of comprehensive analyses. To address this deficit we generated ten SAGE libraries from the developing murine pancreas spanning Theiler stages 17-26, making use of available Pdx1 enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and Neurog3 EGFP reporter strains, as well as tissue from adult islets and ducts. Results: We used a specificity metric to identify 2,536 tags with pancreas-enriched expression compared to 195 other mouse SAGE libraries. We subsequently grouped co-expressed transcripts with differential expression during pancreas development using K-means clustering. We validated the clusters first using quantitative real time PCR and then by analyzing the Theiler stage 22 pancreas in situ hybridization staining patterns of over 600 of the identified genes using the GenePaint database. These were then categorized into one of the five expression domains within the developing pancreas. Based on these results we identified a cascade of transcriptional regulators expressed in the endocrine pancreas lineage and, from this, we developed a predictive regulatory network describing beta-cell development. Conclusion: Taken together, this work provides evidence that the SAGE libraries generated here are a valuable resource for continuing to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating pancreas development. Furthermore, our studies provide a comprehensive analysis of pancreas development, and insights into the regulatory networks driving this process are revealed.

The objective of the analysis is preparation of the preliminary landscape map on the basis of Landsat image classification. Dichotomic grouping of the data was performed using K-means method and various remote metrics. On each level iteration procedure was used. Classification result provide identification of various conditions of landscape cover on the basis of various classification levels detailed more and more on following levels. Classification provides grounds for detail identification of natural zonal types of landscapes. In this connection residential areas and significantly transformed natural areas are identified as well. Comparison of classification results with content of forestry map of USSR (1973) of scale 1:1 000 000, and geobotanical map of scale 1:4 000 000, allows reliable identification of basic types, of landscape cover.

In this paper we describe an object-based, top-down algorithm to identify valley floors. The algorithm is based on a region growing approach, seeded by thalwegs with pixels added to the region according to a threshold gradient value. Since such landforms are fiat we compare the results of our algorithm for a particular valley with a number of textual sources describing that valley. In a further comparison, we computed a pixel-based sixfold morphometric classification for regions we classified as either being, or not being, valley floor. The regions classified as valley floor are dominated by planar slopes and channels, though the algorithm is robust enough to allow local convexities to be classified as within the valley floor. Future work will explore the delineation of valley sides, and thus complete valleys.

The purpose is to gain information on the wireless environment for constructing efficient policies and decisions in a flexible radio context. To achieve this, we perform unsupervised classification on data obtained from spectrum power measurements on the GSM 1800 downlink band. The number of spectral states having different spectral characteristics is automatically detected by a well-known efficient rate-distortion criterion. Spectral signals that constitute the power spectrum measurements are classified into these distinct spectral states through the k-means clustering algorithm. In order to eliminate redundancies and to decrease the computational complexity, Principal Component Analysis is performed on the set of spectral signals before classification. The time-averaged frequency profile of each spectral state can be considered as the quantization or compression of the spectral information contained by the spectral signal belonging to that spectral state. The preliminary results obtained on the GSM 1800 downlink spectrum measurements reveal that the proposed method successfully extracts the distinct spectral states of the wireless environment.

However, as many newly-emerged Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications using dynamic port numbers, masquerading techniques, and payload encryption to avoid detection, the classical approaches based on port mapping and payload analysis are ineffective. An alternative approach is to classify traffic by distinguishing the behavior of an application within the first few packets of TCP connection. We pursue this approach and demonstrate that information of few packets is enough to effectively identify P2P traffic. In our work, C4.5 decision tree and REPTree are evaluated and compared with the previously used clustering method K-Means. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform K-Means algorithm in accuracy. In addition, the proposed approaches can accommodate known and unknown P2P traffic and even encrypted traffic in fast and accurate way, which ensures the real-time applications on the Internet traffic surveillance and QoS provisioning.

This platform acts like a virtual teacher that transfers the knowledge of five Tai-Chi movements using feed-back stimuli to compensate the errors committed by a user during the performance of the gesture. The fundamental components of this multimodal interface are the gesture recognition system (using k-means clustering, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) and Finite State Machines (FSM)) and the real-time descriptor of motion which is used to compute and qualify the actual movements performed by the student respect to the movements performed by the master, obtaining several feedbacks and compensating this movement in real-time varying audio-visualtactile parameters of different devices. The experiments of this multimodal platform have confirmed that the quality of the movements performed by the students is improved significantly.

In this paper we propose a general framework to predict the Aerology events with time series streams and events stream using combination of K-means clustering algorithm and Decision Tree C5 algorithm. Firstly, we find the closest time series record for any events; therefore, we have gathered different parameters value when an event is occurring. Using K-means we add afield to data set which determines the cluster of each record after that by using C5 algorithm we predict events. C5 Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the well-known Decision Tree Algorithms. This framework and time series model can predict future events efficiently. We gathered 1961 until 2005 data of aerology organization for Tehran Mehrabad Station. This data contains some fields such as wet bulb, relative humidity, amount of cloud, wind speed and etc. This data set includes 17 types of events. Time series models can predict next time series parameters value and by using this Framework the closest event can be predicted. The C5 method is able to predict Events with Correct 74.11 percent and Wrong 25.89 percent. But with the aims of K-means clustering algorithm the prediction increase to 85 percent and wrong to 15 percent. 90 percent of data was usedfor training set and 10 percent for test set. We use 10-fold cross validation to evaluate our prediction rate. This framework is the first estimation in the area of event prediction for a huge data set of aerology and can be extended in many different data sets in any other environments.

Procreant PSO for Document Clustering	ICCN: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking	DEC 18-20, 2008	Karur, INDIA					Fast and high-quality document clustering algorithms play an important role towards the goal of organizing large amounts of information into a small number of meaningful clusters. Traditional clustering algorithms will search only a small sub-set of all possible clustering and consequently, there is no guarantee that the solution found will be optimal. This paper presents Procreant PSO (PPSO) algorithm for document clustering. In standard PSO the non-oscillatory route can quickly cause a particle to stagnate and also it may prematurely converge on suboptimal solutions that are not even guaranteed to be local optimum. In this paper a modification strategy is proposed for the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The strategy adds reproduction when the stagnation in movement of the particle is identified and carries out local search to improve the goodness of fitting. Procreation has the capability to achieve faster convergence and better solution. Experiments results are examined with document corpus. It demonstrates that the PPSO algorithm statistically outperforms the Simple PSO and K-Means.	[Premalatha, K.; Natarajan, A.

ENSEMBLE BASED DISTRIBUTED SOFT CLUSTERING	ICCN: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking	DEC 18-20, 2008	Karur, INDIA			Distributed Clustering; Fuzzy C-Means; Global Centroid; K-Means; Local Centroid		Due to the explosion in the number of autonomous data sources, there is a growing need for effective approaches for distributed knowledge discovery and data mining. The distributed clustering algorithm is used to cluster the distributed datasets without necessarily downloading all the data to a single site. Manly applications can benefit from soft clustering, where each object is assigned to multiple clusters with membership weight that sum to one. In this paper, a novel distributed soft clustering algorithm based on ensemble learning is proposed by modifying the existing distributed K-Means algorithm, to attain high quality soft clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to cluster multiple homogeneous data sources, distributed over several local sites by combining local clustering results. The Jazzy C-Means algorithm is used to cluster local datasets and the centroids of individual datasets form an ensemble. The global centroid is obtained by clustering local centroids using K-Means algorithm with global K value at central place. The local soft clusters are updated using global centroid The experiments are carried out for various datasets of UCI machine learning data repository to compare the performance the proposed algorithm with conventional centralized fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm.

We show that the UK-means algorithm, which generalises the k-means algorithm to handle uncertain objects, is very inefficient. The inefficiency comes from the fact that UK-means computes expected distances (ED) between objects and cluster representatives. For arbitrary pdf's, expected distances are computed by numerical integrations, which are costly operations. We propose pruning techniques that are based on Voronoi diagrams to reduce the number of expected distance calculation. These techniques are analytically, proven to be more effective than the basic bounding-box-based technique previous known in the literature. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our pruning techniques and to show that our techniques significantly outperform previous methods.

Firstly, the image pre-processing technique was applied to enhance the image before changing the color space to LUV color space. Then Mean-shift segmentation was introduced. However, some region has no semantic meaning since the Mean-shift algorithm performed low level segmentation. To overcome this problem, median-cut algorithm was proposed to join the gap left by the mean-shift.

Our attempt is based on group skeletons defined by a set of orthogonal and unitary eigen vectors (principal directions) of the sample covariance matrix. Our developments impose a set of quite natural working assumptions on the true but unknown nature of the class system. The search process for the optimal clusters approximating the unknown classes towards getting homogenous groups, where the homogeneity is defined in terms of the "typicality" of components with respect to the current skeleton. Our method is described in the third section of the paper. The compression scheme was set in terms of the principal directions corresponding to the available cloud. The final section presents the results of the tests aiming the comparison between the performances of our method and the standard k-means clustering technique when they are applied to the initial space as well as to compressed data.

However, in practice, structural changes of dimensions schema are often necessary to adapt the multidimensional database to changing requirements. This paper presents a new structural update operator for OLAP dimensions, named Rollup-WithKmeans based on k-means clustering method. This operator allows to create a new level to which, a pre-existent level in an OLAP dimension hierarchy rolls up. To define the domain of the new level and the aggregation function from an existing level to the new level, our operator classifies all instances of an existing level into k clusters with the k-means clustering algorithm. To choose features for k-means clustering, we propose two solutions. The first solution uses descriptors of the pre-existent level in its dimension table while the second one proposes to describe the new level by measures attributes in the fact table. Moreover, we carried out some experimentations within Oracle 10 g DBMS which validated the relevance of our approach.

What leads to non-ideal performance and clustering result is that the special treatment of these prefix-coded data structure is not considered in traditional clustering algorithm. To deal with this problem, a new concept of median-tree as well as a method of calculating the coding distance is proposed in this paper. Based upon this, a simple algorithm-dfCluster is put forward, which is capable of dealing with the prefix-coded data streams efficiently. Also, the algorithm analysis is presented in depth. At last, the designed experiment demonstrates that dfCluster is more efficient than the naive algorithm to cluster those kinds of data streams, and meanwhile, the performance of our algorithm is not limited by the specified value of k just as in algorithm k means.

For VRPTW optimization under electronic commerce is a special problem that includes many aspects, hybrid strategy is usually introduced to classify and optimize route by two artificial intelligent methods. Therefore, the Improved Two-Phase Algorithm needs to be adopted to get solutions. Namely, the customer group can be divided into several regions using k-means algorithm in first phase. And in every region it can be decomposed into small scale subsets according with some restraint conditions using scan algorithm. In second phase, it is route optimization problems of several single TSPTW model. Therefore, the study proposes the improved genetic algorithm. Improved partially matched crossover operators can avoid destroying good gene parts during the course of crossover so as that the algorithm can be convergent to the optimization as whole. According to the traditional genetic algorithm shortcomings of slowly convergent speed, weakly partial searching ability and easily premature, the study adopts the strategy of protecting gene as whole, introduce adopts 2-exchange mutation operator, combine hill-climbing algorithm and construct new genetic algorithm on basis of establishing model of optimizing vehicle route with time windows. New algorithm offers a very effective method to solve problem of distribution vehicle schedule with time windows through the test.

PFA involves k-means formulation on significant principal components, and we adopt this PFA methodology for time series prediction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our formulation for the problem of prediction of machine tool wear. For this problem, we first construct our model using the first half of the time series data set, and we use the entire data set, including the second half, for the verification of our model. The verification is done by mean square error (MSE) criterion, and we demonstrate the selection of features for variable MSE, being in the range of 1.5% to 0.9% for the tool wear data set.

Identification of scaling regime in chaotic correlation dimension calculation	ICIEA 2008: 3RD IEEE CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-3	IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA 2008)	JUN 03-05, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE Ind Electron Chap, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc			K-MEANS ALGORITHM; STRANGE ATTRACTORS; DYNAMICS RECONSTRUCTION; TIME-SERIES	For many chaotic systems, accurate calculation of the correlation dimension by using Grassberger-Procaccia (GP) algorithm is sometimes difficult due to the difficulty in selecting the right scaling regime (i.e. straight line portion) from correlation dimension curves which are often irregular. By now "visual inspection" is still widely adopted as the method to determine scaling regime, which suffers from the irregularity in correlation dimension curves and may further lead to a bad correlation dimension. So in this paper, a new computer-implemented method for the identification of scaling regime in correlation dimension plots based on K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by examples based on the data produced by several typical chaotic attractors and the data of a real load time series. Compared with traditional manual selection approach, the proposed approach can deal with the irregular correlation dimension curves more effectively.	[Yang, H. Y.; Ye, H.; Wang, G.

A traffic matrix has tremendous potential utility for many IP network engineering applications[1,2]. In practical networking applications, dealing with thousands of measured traffic matrices is often inconvenient. This seriously limits the applicability of traffic matrices. So it is highly desirable to be able to extract a small number of "critical" traffic matrices[3]. We study the problem of Critical Traffic Matrices Selection (CTMS) in this paper. We developed an approximation algorithm called MinMat which preselects a group of matrices as critical matrix candidates based on entropy analysis. We evaluated MinMat by a large collection of real traffic matrices collected in campus network and Abilene network [4]. Our results demonstrated that MinMat algorithm are effective than K-means, Hierarchical Agglomeration and by simulating on totem[5] we concluded that a small number of critical traffic matrices suffice to yield satisfactory performance.

The traditional method to represent text is that the document is organized as a string of words, while the conceptual similarity is ignored We take advantage of thesaurus-based ontology to overcome this problem. To investigate how ontology method could be used effectively in document clustering, a hybrid strategy which combines the thesaurus-based semantic similarity measure and vector space model (VSM) measure to provide more accurate assessment of similarity between documents are implemented. Considering the influence between the diversity of the population and the selective pressure, an approach of dynamic evolution operators is put forward in this article. In our experiment two data sets of 200 and 600 documents from Reuter-21578 corpus are excerpted for test and the experiment results show that our method of genetic algorithm in conjunction with the hybrid semantic strategy, the combination of the thesaurus-based measure and VSM-based measure, outperforms that with the sole VSM measure. Our clustering algorithm also efficiently enhances the performance of precision and recall in comparison with k-means in the same similarity environments.

A novel 'mulliple' smoothing parameters, which is different from the standard algorithm in which only single smoothing parameter was adopted (Matlab neural network toolbox, for example), were assigned to GRNN model. K-means clustering algorithm was developed so as to reduce the number of smoothing parameters. The training data was firstly partitioned into groups (the number of groups was much smaller than that of training samples) using K-means clustering. A smoothing parameter was then assigned to this group. A recently emerging estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) was employed to optimize the multiple smoothing parameters. EDA presented in this paper was a kind of optimization algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to establish a non-linear model between the parameters of the coal-fired boiler and the NOx emissions. The results showed that the number of cluster has significant effect on the predictive accuracy of GRNN model. GRNN model with multiple smoothing parameters showed better agreement than that with only one smoothing parameter. The modeling errors on the testing subset were 1.24% and 1.62% for GRNN models trained by the present algorithm and the standard algorithm, respectively.

One is the rule disaster problem, that is, the rule number will increase exponentially with the increase of input dimensions. Another problem is the network reasoning failure resulted from input dimensions too large. The paper presented an improved algorithm of T-S fuzzy neural network. The subtraction clustering algorithm was used to make certain rule number to escape the rule disaster. The network reasoning can correctly work by adding a compensated factor on membership. The improved algorithm was used in speech recognition system. The experimental results showed that the recognition results of improved algorithm are better than the ones of radial basis function (RBF) neural network using K-means clustering algorithm to select the centroid.

In order to improve the classification ability of hierarchical ENGs, boosting methods are implemented for better final decision by using weighted sampling approach. The proposed scheme is used to the domain of intrusion detection. Some experiments are carried out on the KDD CUP 1999 Intrusion Detection Evaluation dataset.

Here we propose a new approach to analyze ECoG trails in the case of session-to-session transfer exists. In our approach, firstly, dimension reduction is performed with independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition. Secondly, ECoG trials are clustered by an unsupervised learning algorithm called affinity propagation. Primary experimental results show that the proposed approach gives the reasonable result than that using the classical K-means clustering algorithm.

Based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the mixed signal is separated into several single and pure signals, and the noise is removed from the acoustic signal. Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) which responses the characteristic of the sound more aggressively is are extracted as characteristic parameters in the system. For the Hidden Markov Models Due to work better performance in representing the time-variant signal, the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) models are employed to simulate the model change of the sound signals as the with time going. K-means algorithm is used as cluster MFCC to produce training and identifying eigenvector. Simulation results indicate this approach's is effectiveness in target recognition.

Recent trends seek to apply and extend principles from product design to new service development. This paper proposes a novel methodology for identifying modules in service. The new method comes from deign structure matrix (DSM) and concurrent engineering. Based on service process analysis, a function relation matrix is investigated to define the relationships between the service elements. The generated process of sequential clustering by using K-means clustering is also analyzed. Finally we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through a case study of a pizza restaurant service.

The function of the proposed algorithm is to first find the pixel values along the boundary of the filtering window and then calculate its variance. If this variance is less than a threshold specified, then the corrupted pixel is replaced by the mean of the inside pixels from the filtering window after sorting and trimming. Experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms with significant improvement in image quality than the arithmetic mean, alpha-trimmed mean filter, wiener filter, K-means filter and adaptive window based method. The proposed method removes the Gaussian noise very effectively even at a noise variance as high as 40 with edge preservation.	[Vijaykumar, V.

The ILMD is based on orthogonal Legendre moment polynomial and preprocessing steps required for invariance improvement of ILMD is discussed. A comparative study of the clustering accuracy of ILMD with popular Zernike Moment descriptor (ZMD) and Angular Radial Transformation descriptor (ARTD) is carried out. The clustering accuracy of both contour shape description and region shape description were investigated. The shape databases used for evaluation were MPEG-7 approved CE-1 Set B contour shape database and CE-2 Set A1 region shape database. The k-Means clustering of the shape descriptors shows better accuracy for ILMD than ARTD and for ARTD than ZMD for both region and contour shape descriptor.	[Kumar, Dinesh V.

Clustering is an important datamining technique. Because of the complexity and the high dimensionality of gene expression data, classification of a disease samples remains a challenge. Hierarchical clustering and partitioning clustering is used to identify patterns of gene expression useful for classification of samples. In this paper, we make a comparative study of two partitioning methods namely k-means and PAM to classify the cancer dataset.

Through the combination of modified particle filtering and GVF-snake, a novel energetic particle filtering (EPF) object tracking algorithm is proposed; and the multiple objects can be tracked with modified K-means clustering and energetic particle filtering (EPF). The tracking tactic for partially occluded objects is also proposed to overcome the effects such as occlusions in a complex environment. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can fully utilize the information of mostly non-occluded object contour points in the entire tracking process, and obtain better tracking results even though the tracked objects are occluded for long time.

Through analyzing the wood texture feature by the viewpoint of visual perception and image analysis, some features are structured to depict the relationship between wood texture and human emotional feelings. And the method that extract the features which reflect the emotional changes of wood texture by calculating directionality and coarseness in Tamura texture quantity and coarseness by K-means cluster algorithm, and extracting the golbal color feature in HSV color space is proposed, and Back Propagation Neural Network is employed to map these low level features to emotional feature space.

Creating visual codebook is an important problem in object categorization. The non-informative codeword will increase the vocabulary size which brings more computation cost, and cannot improve the classification performance. We first define a weighted minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMJ ) which is an extension of basic mRMR. And we propose an iterative method to select efficient visual words based on weighted mRMR in backward way. We first get the initial set of codewords through k-means cluster, then we use the proposed method to select the most discriminative subset of codewords which are used to compute histograms. We perform experimental comparison of our algorithm and basic BOV on Caltech database. The experimental results proved that the proposed algorithm can achieve good performance and lower computation cost with smaller size of vocabulary.

We propose features such as line spectral frequency (LSF), differential line spectral frequency (DLSF), mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), discrete cosine transform cepstrum (DCTC), perceptual linear predictive cepstrum (PLP) and mel frequency perceptual linear predictive cepstrum (MF-PLP). These features are captured and training models are developed by K-means clustering procedure. A speaker identification system is evaluated on noise added test speeches and the experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed algorithm in identifying speakers based on minimum distance between test features and clusters and also highlight the best choice of feature set among all the proposed features for 50 speakers chosen randomly from "TIMIT" database. In this work, F-ratio is computed as a theoretical measure to validate the experimental results.

A genetic algorithm-based clustering technique, named CA clustering, in conjunction with ontology is proposed in this article to overcome this problem. In general, the ontology measures can be partitioned into two categories: thesaurus-based methods and corpus-based methods. We take advantage of the hierarchical structure and the broad coverage taxonomy of Wordnet as the thesaurus-based ontology. However, the corpus-based method is rather complicated to handle in practical application. We propose a transformed latent semantic analysis (LSA) model as the corpus-based method in this paper. Moreover, two hybrid strategies, the combinations of the various similarity measures, are implemented in the clustering experiments. The results show that our CA clustering algorithm, in conjunction with the thesaurus-based and the LSA-based method, apparently outperforms that with other similarity measures. Moreover, the superiority of the CA clustering algorithm proposed over the commonly used k-means algorithm anti the standard CA is demonstrated by the improvements of the clustering performance.

This has been collected from GEO data base of NCBI web-site (a genetic time series data consists of 5289 genes & 48 samples). These Microarray data set represents the external manifestation of internal genetic network manipulation (as seen from central dogma). Discovering the hidden genetic network from microarray data is the prime objective of this paper. Since the number of data is huge, here first the microarray data set has been clustered into 135 clusters using k-mean clustering algorithm. This represents important information sets where each cluster is considered to contain gene set of similar expression level. The genetic network has been constructed using Graphical Gaussian Model i.e. GGM amongst the clusters. Thus network developed will help in detecting the culprit gene set, which will ultimately lead to 'Drug Discovery'.

The two most frequently used algorithms are the K-mean and the SOM algorithm. In this paper, a novel unsupervised clustering technology-ISODATA algorithm is proposed for the customer segment based on the customer's purchasing behavior. Unlike the K-mean algorithm, the clusters are merged if either the number of members in a cluster is less than a certain threshold or if the centers of two clusters are closer than a certain threshold in our method. On the contrast, the clusters are split into two different clusters if the cluster standard deviation exceeds a predefined value and the number of members is twice the threshold for the minimum number of members. It has some further refinements by splitting and merging of clusters. The customer clustering will be illustrated through a case study on the e- commerce database of bookshop.

The algorithm estimates a set of linear combinations of image bands that enhance different structures embedded in the image. In particular, the first estimated combination enhances the contrast of the lesion to facilitate its segmentation. Given an N-band image, this first combination corresponds to a line in N dimensions, such that the separation between the two main modes of the histogram obtained by projecting the pixels onto this line, is maximized. The remaining combinations are estimated in a similar way under the constraint of being orthogonal to those already computed. The performance of the algorithm is tested on five different dermatological datasets. The results obtained on these datasets; indicate the robustness of the algorithm and its suitability to deal with different types of dermatological lesions. The boundary detection precision using k-means segmentation was close to 97%. The proposed algorithm can be easily combined with the majority of classification algorithms.

The conventional K-means clustering algorithm has two shortfalls: 1) the clustering result will become unreliable if the assumed number of the clusters is incorrect; 2) during the update of a cluster center, all the data points belong to that cluster are used equally without considering how distant they are to the cluster center. In this paper, we introduce a new reliability evaluation to K-means clustering algorithm by considering the triangular relationship among each data point and its two nearest cluster centers. We applied the proposed algorithm to track objects in video sequence and confirmed its effectiveness and advantages.

The best technique for grouping fingerprints is based on the ART] clustering algorithm. We compare the quality of clustering of ARTI based clustering with K-Mean clustering technique and Self Organizing Neural Network (SOM) [I] clustering algorithm in terms of intracluster distances. Our results show that the average intracluster distance of the clusters formed by SOM and K-Means algorithm varies from 83.36 to 127.372 and 33.925 to 58.17 respectively while the average intra-cluster distance of clusters formed by ART] based clustering technique varies from 4.55 to 13.06, which indicates the clusters formed by ART] Clustering approach are much compact and isolated as compare to Self Organizing Map and K-Means based clustering approaches.

PAM cannot recognize relatively small clusters in situations where good partitions around medoids clearly exist. Also PAM needs O(k(n-k)(2)) operations to cluster a given dataset, which is computationally prohibited for large n and k. In this paper, we propose a new bisecting k-medoids algorithm that is capable of grouping the co-expressed genes together with better clustering quality and time performances. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over three gene expression datasets in which noise components are involved. The proposed algorithm takes less computation time with comparable performance relative to the Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm.

LOCAL OPTIMALITY; PAINTINGS; ALGORITHMS	Ancient manuscript analysis is to aid historian to classify, annotate and judge the authenticity of larger collections of ancient manuscripts. Previous method was to examine the composition of manuscript such as paper support or inks by destructive sampling and chemical analysis. The aim of this paper is to present an image-based non-destructive and non-invasive method to analyze ancient manuscripts. A new unsupervised classification algorithm was designed to distinguish different type of paper support without any priori knowledge. The advantage of this classifier comparing with traditional methods such as K-means is that no pre-defined class number is needed. This is critical important in this application because no any priori knowledge about these manuscript was available before classifying. We presented the multi-model based framework of unsupervised classification, so that different statistical models can be applied to the same flow chart for different applications. This classifier enables us to study the statistical properties of these manuscripts, which is very hard to characterize due to the decay materials and bad resolutions. We evaluated this unsupervised classification performance by a specially developed algorithm. Experiment results show the potential of our unsupervised classification method in ancient manuscript analysis.

The information that is obtained from the clustering of content provides a way to introduce content information into collaborative recommendation and solves the cold start problem. The content-based filtering provides the content but may fail to understand what the user mean by that content while collaborative filtering may succeed in understanding the desire of user but may fail to bring the results for that request However, we succeed to provide the relevant content to user by combining the content-based and collaborative filtering techniques and with the use of fuzzy C-means and the K-means clustering algorithm The results show that our approach contributes to the improvement of prediction quality of the item-based collaborative filtering, especially for the cold start problem.

Cosine similarity in Vector Space Model (VSM) is used as the similarity computation in traditional ways. However it cannot denote the semantic similarity between the contents of two databases. In this paper how to cluster Deep Web databases semantically is discussed. Firstly, a fuzzy semantic measure, which integrates ontology and fuzzy set theory to compute semantic similarity between the visible features of two Deep Web forms, is proposed, and then a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is provided for Deep Web databases clustering. Finally the clustering results are evaluated according to Average Similarity of Document to the Cluster Centroid (ASDC) and Rand Index (RI). Experiments show that: 1) the hybrid PSO approach has the higher ASDC values than those based on PSO and K-Means approaches. It means the hybrid PSO approach has the higher intra cluster similarity and lowest inter cluster similarity; 2) the clustering results based on fuzzy semantic similarity have higher ASDC values and higher RI values than those based on cosine similarity. It reflects the conclusion that the fuzzy semantic similarity approach can explore latent semantics.

The key feature of this problem is that there are no negative examples for learning. Recently, a few techniques have been reported are based on building a classifier in two steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for the first step, which cluster the unlabeled and positive examples to identify the reliable negative document, and then run SVM iteratively. We perform a comprehensive evaluation with other two methods, and show experimentally that it is efficient and effective.

The IR images of objects obtained by these FPAs are readout by an optical method. For the IR images, processed by a sparse representation-based image denoising and inpainting algorithm, which generalizing the K-Means clustering process, for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. The processed image quality is improved obviously. Great compute and analysis have been realized by using the discussed algorithm to the simulated data and in applications on real data. The experimental results demonstrate, better RMSE and highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional methods can be obtained. At last we discuss the factors that determine the ultimate performance of the FPA. And we indicated that one of the unique advantages of the present approach is the scalability to larger imaging arrays.

The method is based on vector quantization (VQ) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The sliding right to left window is used to extract the proper features(we have proposed four features). After feature extraction, K-means clustering is used for generation a codebook and VQ generates a codeword for each word image. In the next stage, HMM is trained by Baum Welch algorithm for each city name. A test image is recognized by finding the best match (likelihood) between the image and all of the HMM words models using forward algorithm. Experimental results show the advantages of using VQ/HMM recognizer engine instead of conventional discrete HMM.

These techniques are used mainly for the treatment of big databases, in which an immense quantity of numeric data is managed, where the final objective is the data classification. This paper presents the results of the "typical testors" technique, for reducing dimensions, and the "k-means" technique, for carrying out the object classification. The main objective of making a reduction of the representation space with typical testors is to facilitate the classification, that is, the classification is a way to check the efficiency of typical testors.

Several researches have been done on Internet phone technology. Many researches were done on how to make use of the Internet phone. The purpose of this paper is to explore users' perceptions on the use of the Internet phone as a survey tool. There are five factors that include usefulness, ease-of-use, perceived liking, perceived self-efficacy and computer anxiety in this study. This questionnaire was designed based on prior factors. Next, the questionnaire is used to collect data that explores users' intentions to using a VoIP survey. The analysis tool of this study is to apply cluster analysis, discrimination analysis and an independent-sample T test. The results show that the k-means clustering is able to detect factor relationships and patterns for users' attitudes towards a VoIP survey. In this study, k-means clustering classifies users' attitudes into high pleasure and low pleasure towards a VoIP survey. After that, classification results indicate 97.3% of original grouped cases correctly classified and 97.3% of cross-validated grouped cases correctly classified.

A comprehensive validity index for clustering	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Clustering; validity index; number of clusters; K-means	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; VALIDATION TECHNIQUES; EXPRESSION DATA	Cluster validity indices are used for both estimating the quality of a clustering algorithm and for determining the correct number of clusters in data. Even though several indices exist in the literature, most of them are only relevant for data sets that contain at least two clusters. This paper introduces a new bounded index for cluster validity called the score function (SF), a double exponential expression that is based on a ratio of standard cluster parameters. Several artificial and real-life data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the score function. These data sets contain a range of features and patterns such as unbalanced, overlapped and noisy clusters. In addition, cases involving sub-clusters and perfect clusters are tested. The score function is tested against six previously proposed validity indices. In the case of hyper-spheroidal clusters, the index proposed in this paper is found to be always as good or better than these indices. In addition, it is shown to work well on multidimensional and noisy data sets. One of its advantages is the ability to handle single cluster case and sub-cluster hierarchies.	[Saitta, S.; Smith, I.

Surface roughness is measured with the help of fractal dimension (D), which lies in the range 2.0 and 3.0. Based on roughness values, i.e., D, various land classes are grouped in different classes. The D values are estimated for a number of local window sizes and thus the window size is very important for classification. The window size is optimized for best classification and in present case it is 9x9, The K-means classifier has been used for this procedure which clusters various land classes according to D values. Although fractal dimension is able to provide the roughness values for various land classes, it can not uniquely identify all classes. In order to remove this discrepancy, the multifractal analysis has been performed, The multifractal dimension has been estimated as 5 generalized dimensions providing 5 multifractal images and then these images are classified. The overall classification accuracy using fractal dimension alone comes to be nearly 60% while it increases to 67% with multifractal images.

The role of digital bathymetry in mapping shallow marine vegetation from hyperspectral image data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							FRAGILE SSP TOMENTOSOIDES; AIRBORNE IMAGERY; CORAL-REEFS; NOVA-SCOTIA; WATER; ALGA; CLASSIFICATION; CANADA; CHLOROPHYTA; COMMUNITIES	Hyperspectral remote sensing is a proven technology for measurement of coastal ocean colour, including sea-bed mapping in optically shallow waters. Using hyperspectral imagery of shallow (<15m deep) sea bed acquired with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-550), we examined how changes in the spatial resolution of bathymetric grids, created from sonar data (echosounding) and input to conventional image classifiers, affected the accuracy of distributional maps of invasive (Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides) and native (kelp) seaweeds off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The addition of a low-resolution bathymetric grid, interpolated from soundings by the Canadian Hydrographic Service, improved the overall classification accuracies by up to similar to 10%. However, increasing the bathymetric resolution did not increase the accuracy of classification maps produced with the supervised (Maximum Likelihood) classifier as shown by a slightly lower accuracy (2%) when using an intermediate-resolution bathymetric grid interpolated from soundings with a recreational fish finder. Supervised classifications using the first three eigenvectors from a principal-components analysis were consistently more accurate (by at least 27%) than unsupervised (K-means classifier) schemes with similar data compression. With an overall accuracy of 76%, the most reliable scheme was a supervised classification with low-resolution bathymetry. However, the supervised approach was particularly sensitive, and variations in accuracy of 2% resulted in overestimations of up to 53% in the extent of C. fragile and kelp. The use of a passive optical bathymetric algorithm to derive a high-resolution bathymetric grid from the CASI data showed promise, although fundamental differences between this grid and those created with the sonar data limited the conclusions. The bathymetry (at any spatial resolution) appeared to improve the accuracy of the classifications both by reducing the confusion among the spectral classes and by removing noise in the image data. Variations in the accuracy of depth estimates and inescapable positional inaccuracies in the imagery and ground data largely accounted for the observed differences in the classification accuracies. This study provides the first detailed demonstration of the advantages and limitations of integrating digital bathymetry with hyperspectral data for the mapping of benthic assemblages in optically shallow waters.

An unsupervised method of classifying remotely sensed images using Kohonen self-organizing maps and agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							ASYMPTOTIC LEVEL DENSITY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LAND-COVER; MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES; SENSING IMAGES; SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; SPATIAL INFORMATION; SEGMENTATION	Unlike conventional unsupervised classification methods, such as K-means and ISODATA, which are based on partitional clustering techniques, the methodology proposed in this work attempts to take advantage of the properties of Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) together with agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods to perform the automatic classification of remotely sensed images. The key point of the proposed method is to execute the cluster analysis process by means of a set of SOM prototypes, instead of working directly with the original patterns of the image. This strategy significantly reduces the complexity of the data analysis, making it possible to use techniques that have not normally been considered viable in the processing of remotely sensed images, such as hierarchical clustering methods and cluster validation indices. Through the use of the SOM, the proposed method maps the original patterns of the image to a two-dimensional neural grid, attempting to preserve the probability distribution and topology of the input space. Afterwards, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method with restricted connectivity is applied to the trained neural grid, generating a simplified dendrogram for the image data. Utilizing SOM statistic properties, the method employs modified versions of cluster validation indices to automatically determine the ideal number of clusters for the image. The experimental results show examples of the application of the proposed methodology and compare its performance to the K-means algorithm.	[Goncalves, M.

Firstly, the whole data was analysed using descriptive analysis of average, mean and standard deviation. The data was then further explored using the factor analysis method. Principal component analysis technique (PCA) was done to reduce the variables to similar factor components. Two components that have Eigen value more than 1 were selected. As a result, two important components were determined which is PC1 named as girth dimensions and PC2 is length dimensions. Next, two key variables were used to segment the children into 4 distinct clusters using K-means cluster method. Four body types were obtained from the segmentation known as stout, petite, slim and big groups. These cluster groups were validated using decision tree. These segmented groups will then be converted into size tables.	[Zakaria, Norsaadah; Taib, Jamil Salleh Mohd.

At present, most privacy preserving clustering algorithms are concentrated on k-means and based on two parties and the trusted third party, these algorithms have the drawbacks of inaccurate results because of choosing initial clustering centers randomly and applying to multi-party difficultly and revealing privacy because of depending on the third party excessively. This paper combines the merits Of hierarchical and k-means clustering and presents a privacy-preserving hierarchical-k-means clustering algorithm and solves the problem of privacy-preserving hierarchical k-means clustering on horizontally partitioned data for semi-honest parties using some secure protocols, such as multi-party computation, secure distance, secure clustering center and standardization.

This approach employs Weighted Segmental K-Means clustering algorithm prior to competitive based learning. The clustering system relies on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for speaker modeling and likelihood estimation. Performance is evaluated on 108 two speaker conversations taken from LDC CALLHOME American English Speech corpus using NIST criterion and shows an improvement of approximately 48% in Cluster Error Rate (CER) relative to the randomly initialized clustering system. The number of iterations was reduced significantly, which contributes to both speed and efficiency of the clustering system.

A HANN trained to map input feature space onto speaker labels through a bottle-neck hidden layer is expected to learn very low dimensional feature subspace essentially containing speaker information. The lower dimensional features are further used in a simple k-means clustering algorithm to obtain speaker segmentation. Evaluation of this approach on a database of real-life conversational speech from call-centers show that clustering performance achieved is similar to that of the state-of-the-art systems, although our approach uses just 1-dimensional features. Augmenting these features with the traditional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features in the state-of-the-art system resulted in improved clustering performance.

In this paper, noise classification is improved to classify more kinds of noises based on k-means clustering, and GMM-based noise reduction is performed using the detection and classification results. As a result of classification, we can determine the kind of noise we arc dealing with, but the power is unknown. in this paper, this problem is solved by combining an estimation of noise power with the noise reduction method. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved good performance for recognition of utterances overlapped by sudden noises.

In this paper, we studied various unsupervised clustering algorithms on several corpora. First we compared the clustering methods with quality metrics such as entropy and purity. Of the techniques studied, two-phase bisecting K-means achieved good performance with relatively fast speed. Then we performed speech recognition experiments on English and Arabic systems using the automatically derived topic-based language models. We obtained modest word error rate improvements, comparable to previously published studies. A careful analysis of the correlation between word error rate and the distribution of misrecognized words, including an information-gain metric, is presented.

The detailed procedure of 2DCDA is to first partition each class of the data into multiple clusters via fast 2D global k-means clustering algorithm, and then try to find some directions such that the projections of every pair of clusters from different classes are well separated while the within-cluster scatter is minimized. Therefore, it fully exploits the cluster information and alleviates the linearly unseparable problem to some extent. According to the projection fashion, we divide 2DCDA into two versions, the right 2DCDA (R-2DCDA) and the left 2DCDA (L-2DCDA). They compress the image row or column only, so they need more features. To solve this problem, two-directional 2DCDA ((2D)(2)CDA) is developed, which compresses the image row and column simultaneously. Experiments have been carried out for recognition of three types of ground vehicles in the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) public database to evaluate and compare the performances of the proposed algorithms with other methods. Results demonstrate that 2DCDA and (2D)(2)CDA are effective. And, the highest recognition rate is up to 97.89%, which is the best ever reported in the literatures.

When detecting new records, we calculate its diversity from the existing clusters to determine its category. This algorithm can detect known and unknown types of attacks, and update detection model automatically. The simulative experiment indicates that the new algorithm improves the performance of detecting attacks, and it is more effective than K-means intrusion detection method.

Reconstructed gene network allows us to understand how genes interact with each. other However, network construction is very complex due to highly interactive nature of genes. A proposed approach to solve this complex problem is to cluster the genes according to similarity in their gene expression profiles. We applied k-means clustering with k = 10 to come up with ten clusters of genes. Then, we applied Bayesian Network structure learning with Hill-climbing search strategy and Akaike Information Criterion score to search for the best network. We compared inferred interactions to a reference positive interactions dataset and found similarities between our inferred interactions and the reference. We further study the gene interactions using Gene Ontology. From our findings, we conclude that the clustering step is essential in gene network reconstruction. Clustering produced better group of genes for Bayesian Network learning. Larger clusters also produced more gene interactions. Gene Ontology can be combined with clustering to produce better quality clusters to improve gene network construction.

In this paper, we study primarily the feature selection of network traffic and its impact on the detection rates. We use KDD CUP 1999 dataset as the sample for the study. We group the features of the dataset into 4 groups: Group I contains the basic network traffic features; Group 11 is actually not network traffic related, but the features collected from hosts; Group III and IV are temporally aggregated features. In this paper, we demonstrate the different detection rates of choosing the different combinations of these groups. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and the ineffectiveness in finding anomalies by looking at the network data alone. In addition, we also briefly investigate the effectiveness of data normalization. To validate our findings, we conducted the same experiments with 3 different clustering algorithms - K-means clustering, fuzzy C means clustering (FCM), and fuzz), entropy clustering (FE).

It was on the basis of water supply network microcosmic model, The water quality indicators, by which the state of water quality was expressed, were choiced as the input vector for the comprehensive evaluation model. The Self-Organizing Feature Map and K-Means arithmetic were taken in the model. As a result, a comprehensive water quality evaluation method was proposed for the defects of single indicator grade evaluation. And the objective water quality evaluation model of water supply water network was taken. Compared with the single-evaluation indicators, SOM can take into account the single water quality monitoring data and the overall data, and reflect the water quality distributing in the water supply network objectively.

The comparison presented here was based on testing of ten natural colour images for quantization into 16, 64 and 256 colours. In evaluation process two criteria were used: the mean squared quantization error (MSE) and the average error in the CIELAB colour space (Delta E). During tests the efficiency of k-harmonic means applied to colour quantization has been proved.

Detection and extraction of text information in such natural images have been used in many applications. Many conditions of natural scene make the problem of text segmentation quite intractable. In this paper, an effective method for the segmentation and binarization of Korean texts from signboard images is proposed, which is robust in blurred images, uneven illumination and strong boundary text images. The proposed approach is based on local K-means clustering on separate words in text region. Firstly, detected text region is divided into local areas with relatively uniform illumination, and then using 3-means clustering with Euclidean distance has been applied to segment text from the background By dividing the region of interest into local areas, the effect of uneven lighting has been minimized. The comparison with Otsu's method and 2-means clustering based on intensity will be representation in some metrics. Natural images from the test database, collected from mobile devices, are used in the experiment and the results show the performance of the proposed method.

To limit the flood search to just a circular local area around the source, the Relative Distance Micro-discovery Ad Hoc Routing (RDMAR) protocol uses the Relative Distance (RD). If the distance of flood discovery is further limited by clustering the nodes with similar characters in to one group, different from the dissimilar characters' group, the performance of the RDMAR implementation can be elevated. The k-means algorithm, similar to the one in unsupervised learning in pattern classification, can be recursively applied to re-classify the clusters as the MANET environment, resource availability, and node demands change. This technique can be more effective in a MANET with comparatively moderate change of the dynamicity and slow change in nodes' demands plus highly accumulated groups of nodes at given sub-areas.

The DTW has been chosen due to this capacity to align beats of different lengths by a non linear time warping. K-means is a classical self-organizing algorithm very popular in ECG applications because it can cluster efficiently signals by making comparisons among them. The two systems are based on a non supervised approach which divides the heart beats of an ECG recording in two different classes. Experiments were carried out using 34 two-channel recordings of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Both systems have shown a very good performance in terms of sensitivity and positive predictivity measures. However, the system based on the DTW has presented some important advantages, since it carries out a full automatic classification, without requiring the manual labeling, and operates on-line, allowing patient monitoring with alarms for cases of arrhythmia.

Nevertheless, this clustering has to address several problems due to factors such as long signal length (high computational burden), noise and artifacts (patient movements, baseline wander, electrode-skin contact variability, powerline interference), and waveform variability because of patient's physiology and pathology. Therefore, it is very important to choose a suitable clustering configuration sufficiently robust against these problems. Such configuration include's the core of the clustering method itself, centroid initialization, dissimilarity measure, feature extraction and selection, and computational cost optimization techniques. To this aim, we present in this work an improved version of the k-means clustering algorithm. First, a preclustering stage is employed to reduce the initial heartbeat set using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a suitable conservative threshold. In the clustering stage, a local search heuristic (k-medians) is analyzed. Feature extraction from heartbeats is carried out by using WT coefficients (from biortogonal 2.2 wavelet) and trace segmentation. The modified k-means considers both the dynamical and nonlinear behavior of ECG signal and provide best performance that k-means standard algorithm. As a result, the modified k-means algorithm is less sensitive to the presence of outliers and hence clustering error declines (up 8% in average) compared to the k-means standard algorithm. Non supervised analysis results are presented for a set of 44872 heartbeats with 16 different types of arrhythmia from MIT's arrhythmia database.	[Rodriguez, J.

A combination of synchrotron and laboratory X-ray techniques for studying tissue-specific trace level metal distributions in Daphnia magna	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							BIOTIC LIGAND MODEL; MICRO-XRF; FLUORESCENCE; TOXICITY; ZINC; WATER; SPECTRA; ION	In the field of environmental toxicology, the study on the effects of the presence of transition metals such as Cu, Ni and Zn on the health of pelagic and benthic invertebrates is an important research topic. Fast dynamic 2D micro-XRF scanning and dynamic XRF micro-CT experiments on D. magna, a frequently used ecotoxicological model organism, allow the quantitative investigation of the accumulation of metals within specific organs with microscopic resolution. K-means clustering allows comparison of the concentrations of the elements of interest between different tissues/organs. Principal component analysis allows most of the significant statistical variations in these large and complex multivariate data sets to be explained. Also, by combining SR-XRF and absorption CT data sets using appropriate software packages, it becomes possible to unravel the tissue-specific 2D/3D distribution of metals in-situ within delicate organic samples on the 3-15 mu m resolution level in an essentially non-destructive manner.

HNRC Group	Variable patterns of neuropsychological performance in HIV-1 infection	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; METHAMPHETAMINE DEPENDENCE; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; HEPATITIS-C; MEN; IMPAIRMENT; DEPRESSION; HIV/AIDS; SCORES	Based upon prior findings with group means, a prototypical pattern of neuropsychological results with HIV infection has emerged: impaired executive functioning, motor skills, speed of information processing, and learning, with intact memory retention, most language skills, and visuospatial functioning. We examined neuropsychological results from 553 HIV+ adults to determine the number of patterns seen among individuals with HIV infection. Factor analysis of a relatively comprehensive neuropsychological battery identified 6 component factors: verbal memory (VeM), visual memory (ViM), processing speed (PS), attention/working memory (A/WM), executive function (EF), and motor (M). These factor scores were submitted to hierarchical cluster analysis, to determine the appropriate number of clusters or patterns in the cohort. Final cluster membership was then determined by K-means analysis, based on the Lange, Iverson, Senior, and Chelune (2002) method. A 6-cluster solution was found to be most appropriate. The definitions of the clusters were based upon ipsative scoring of factor scores to indicate relative strengths and weaknesses (independent of overall level of performance): Cluster 1: strong EF; Cluster 2: strong M, weak VeM and EF; Cluster 3: strong PS, weak ViM and EF; Cluster 4: strong VeM, weak M; Cluster 5: strong A/WM; Cluster 6: strong VeM, weak EF. Neuropsychological-impairment rates differed across clusters, but all 6 clusters contained substantial numbers of impaired and unimpaired individuals. Cluster membership was not explained by demographic variables or psychiatric or neuromedical confounds. Thus, there does not appear to be a single, prototypical pattern of neuropsychological impairment associated with HIV infection for this battery of representative neuropsychological tests.

J	Roy, K; Mandal, AS				Roy, Kunal; Mandal, Asim Sattwa			Development of linear and nonlinear predictive QSAR models and their external validation using molecular similarity principle for anti-HIV indolyl aryl sulfones	JOURNAL OF ENZYME INHIBITION AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						QSAR; indolyl aryl sulfones; validation; anti-HIV-1 activity	TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITOR 2-AMINO-6-ARYLSULFONYLBENZONITRILES; INDEPENDENT 4D-QSAR ANALYSIS; RECEPTOR-BINDING AFFINITY; INTEGRASE INHIBITORS; DERIVATIVES; PROTEASE; DESCRIPTORS; EXPLORATION; CONGENERS; SELECTION	Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on indolyl aryl sulfones, a class of novel HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, using physicochemical, topological and structural parameters along with appropriate indicator variables. The statistical tools used were linear methods (e.g., stepwise regression analysis, partial least squares (PLS), factor analysis followed by multiple regression (FA-MLR), genetic function approximation combined with multiple linear regression (GFA-MLR) and GFA followed by PLS or G/PLS and nonlinear method (artificial neural network or ANN). In case of physicochemical parameters, GFA-MLR generated the best Equation (n=97, R2=0.862, Q2=0.821). Using topological parameters, the best Equation (based on leave-one-out Q2) was obtained with stepwise regression technique (n=97, R2=0.867, Q2=0.811). When topological and physicochemical parameters were used in combination, statistical quality increased to a great extent (n=97, R2=0.891, Q2=0.849 from stepwise regression). Furthermore, the whole dataset had been divided into test (25% of whole dataset) and training (remaining 75%) sets. Models were developed based on the training set and predictive potential of such models was checked from the test set. The selection of the training set was based on K-means clustering of the standardized descriptors (topological and physicochemical). In this case also the best results were obtained with stepwise regression (n=72, R2=0.906, Q2=0.853) but external predictive capacity of this model ([image omitted]) was inferior to the model developed from GFA-MLR technique (R2=0.883, Q2=0.823, [image omitted]). However, the squared regression coefficient between observed activity and predicted activity values of the test set compounds for the best linear model, i.e., GFA-MLR (r2=0.736) was lower in comparison to the best nonlinear model developed using artificial neural network (r2=0.781). Thus, based on external validation, the ANN models were superior to the linear models. The predictive potential of the best linear Equation (stepwise regression model) was superior to that of the previously published CoMFA (Q2=0.81, SDEPTest=0.89) on the same data set (Ragno R. et al., J Med Chem 2006, 49, 3172-3184).

Here a knowledge mining approach is demonstrated to discover fragmentation intensity patterns and elucidate the chemical factors behind such patterns. Fragmentation intensity information from 28330 ion trap peptide MS/MS spectra of different charge states and sequences went through unsupervised clustering using a penalized K-means algorithm. Without any prior chemistry assumptions, four clusters with distinctive fragmentation patterns were obtained. A decision tree was generated to investigate peptide sequence motif and charge state status that caused these fragmentation patterns. This data-mining scheme is generally applicable for any large data sets. It bypasses the common prior knowledge constraints and reports on the overall peptide fragmentation behavior. It improves the understanding of gas-phase peptide dissociation and provides a foundation for new or improved protein identification algorithms.

These typologies were then compared on psychological variables of interest and exercise history. Questionnaires were distributed to Greek older adults aged 60 and above who were recruited from social clubs and city cafes. Only individuals engaging in no regular exercise were recruited (n = 188). The results of hierarchical and k-means cluster analyses revealed two clusters for males (approachable and unconvinced) and three for females (unconcerned, approachable, and unconvinced). The clusters differed significantly on psychological variables not used in the cluster solution. Exercise history distinguished between clusters only among males. The results reveal that physically inactive older adults are not a homogeneous group of individuals. Implementers of physical activity interventions should probably use a range of strategies that take into consideration that some sedentary older adults are more amenable to consider taking up exercise than others.

To obtain the initial trimming we resort to the trimmed k-means, a simple procedure designed for finding the core of the clusters under appropriate configurations. By handling the trimmed data as censored, maximum likelihood estimation provides in each step the location and shape of the next trimming. Data-driven restrictions on the parameters, requiring that every distribution in the mixture must be sufficiently represented in the initial clustered region, allow singularities to be avoided and guarantee the existence of the estimator. Our analysis includes robustness properties and asymptotic results as well as worked examples.	[Cuesta-Albertos, J.

Our system is composed of a hybrid method which couple together background light intensity normalization algorithm and k-means clustering with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, for foreground/background separation. Firstly, the background normalization algorithm performs separation between foreground and background. This foreground is used in later steps. Secondly, our algorithm proceeds on luminance and distort the contrast. These distortions are corrected with a gamma correction and contrast adjustment. Finally, the new enhanced foreground image is segmented to foreground/background on the basis of ML estimation. The initial parameters for the ML method are estimated by k-means clustering algorithm. The segmented image is used to produce a final restored document image. The techniques are tested on a set of Arabic historical manuscripts documents from the National Tunisian Library. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on by real color manuscripts distorted with show-through effects, uneven background color and localized spot.

A popular approach to categorize documents is the Vector Space Model (VSM), which represents texts with feature vectors. The categorizing based on the VSM suffers from noise caused by synonymy and polysemy. Thus, an approach for the clustering of Malay documents based on semantic relations between words is proposed in this paper. The method is based on the model first formulated in the context of information retrieval, called Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). This model leads to a vector representation of each document using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), where familiar clustering techniques can be applied in this space. LSI produced good document clustering by obtaining relevant subjects appearing in a cluster.

From this viewpoint, a learning Course as a series of content also must be adjusted according to the performance of the students. We propose a method that combines clustering and decision tree learning for constructing scenarios of the students' actions. The global statuses of the students are reflected to the clusters, and the local and sequential actions of the students are reflected to the decision trees. The results of e-Learning tests gathered from Japanese junior high school Students was processed by our proposed method. We graded the clusters by adaptation to the trees, and selected a set of clusters as a scenario for the students. These scenarios have a possibility of aiding the adjustment, and revision of learning courses.

The classification schemes are compared with the clusters produced by the K-means algorithm. In the future, we believe that, our comparison method will be coupled with semi-supervised and active learning techniques. Also, this paper presents the idea of combining K-means and Principal Component Analysis for cluster visualization. The described idea allows calculations to be performed in reasonable amount of CPU time.

Apart from very limited and simple cases such problem cannot be solved by a local search algorithm because of multiple local minima. In this paper a Global Optimization (GO) algorithm is used to overcome such difficulty. The proposed algorithm (Controlled Random Search) iterates by maintaining a population of solutions which tends to concentrate around the most "promising" areas. From Data Mining point of view such an approach enables to infer deep information about the underlying structure of data. Collecting and presenting such information in a human understandable manner can help the choice between several possible alternatives. Numerical experiments are carried out on a real dataset, showing that GO produces solutions with much better distortion values than the classical approach, while graphical representation of the whole solution set can be useful to data exploration.

In this paper, we first unite the two frameworks by generalizing the former improvement to Bregman seeding - a biased randomized seeding technique using Bregman divergences - while generalizing its important theoretical approximation guarantees as well. We end up with a complete Bregman hard clustering algorithm integrating the distortion at hand in both the initialization and iterative steps. Our second contribution is to further generalize this algorithm to handle mixed Bregman distortions, which smooth out the asymetricity of Bregman divergences. In contrast to some other symmetrization approaches, our approach keeps the algorithm simple and allows us to generalize theoretical guarantees from regular Bregman clustering. Preliminary experiments show that using the proposed seeding with a suitable Bregman divergence can help us discover the underlying structure of the data.

Water content (WC), inorganic grain size (GS), organic matter (OM), redox potentials (Eh(NHE)) and free sulfides (S) in the upper 2 cm of sediment were measured at 58 stations throughout the inlet to evaluate spatial variations between lease and non-lease locations. MANOVA results showed that mean ( +/- SD) values for WC (64.8 +/- 12.7%), OM (9.8 +/- 4.3 %), and S (1794 +/- 771 mu M) were significantly (p < 0.005) higher and Eh(NHE) lower (-51 +/- 78 mV) within mussel leases In = 24) vs. non-lease areas (n = 34). Negative regressions between S and GS and positive regressions between Eh(NHE) and GS at lease and non-lease locations had similar slopes but intercept values were significantly higher for S and lower for Eh(NHE) (p < 0.007) for lease locations. Eh(NHE) and a Benthic Enrichment Index derived from Eh(NHE), OM and WC were inversely related to S. K-means clustering and multi-dimensional scaling showed that geochemical variables could be used to group stations into categories of benthic organic enrichment within mussel lease and non-lease areas characteristic of oxic-hypoxic sediments described by measures of S and Eh(NHE).

For a distinct discussion on an obtained result, it is important to treat these phenomena separately. In this study, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to separate signals related to cerebral hemodynamic changes and systemic blood-circulation changes. The analysis procedure had three stages: first, OT signals were separated into independent components (IO); second, task-related ICs (TR-ICs) were selected from the separated ICs; and third, the TR-ICs were categorized by k-means clustering into TR activation-related ICs (TR-AICs) and TR noise ICs (TR-NICs). We applied this analysis procedure to the OT signals obtained from experiments using one-handed finger tapping tasks. In the averaged waveform of the TR-AICs, a small overshoot can. be seen for a few seconds after the onset of each task and a few seconds after it ends, and the averaged waveforms of the TR-NICs have an N-shaped pattern.

Our method is based oil an observation that intensities in a relatively small local region are separable. despite of the inseparability of the intensities in the whole image caused by the intensity inhomogeneity. We first define a weighted K-means clustering objective function for image intensities ill a neighborhood around each point with the cluster centers having a multiplicative factor that estimates the bias within the neighborhood. The objective function is then integrated over the entire domain and incorporated into a variational level set formulation. The energy minimization is performed via a level set evolution process. Our method is able to estimate bias Of quite general profiles. Moreover. it is robust to initialization, and therefore allows automatic applications. The proposed Method has been used for images of various, modalities with promising result.

However it could be cured if diagnosed in early stages. The first step in detecting melanoma is the separation of skin lesion from heal thy skin. There are particular. features associated with a malignant lesion whose successful detection relies upon accurately extracted borders. We propose a two step approach. First, we apply K-means clustering method (to 3D RGB space) that extracts relatively accurate borders. In the second step we perform an extra refining step for detecting the fading area around some lesions as accurately as possible. Our method has a number of novelties. Firstly as the clustering method is directly applied to the 3D color space, we do not overlook the dependencies between different color channels. In addition, it is capable of extracting fine lesion borders up to pixel level in spite of the difficulties associated with fading areas around the lesion. Performing clustering in different color spaces reveals that 3D RGB color space is preferred. The application of the proposed algorithm to an extensive data-base of skin lesions shows that its performance is superior to that of existing methods both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

This work segments FLAIR brain images for normal and pathological tissues based on statistical features and wavelet transform coefficients using k-means algorithm. The image is divided into small blocks of 4x4 pixels. The k-means algorithm is used to cluster the image based on the feature vectors of blocks forming different classes representing different regions in the whole image. With the knowledge of the feature vectors of different segmented regions, supervised technique is used to train Artificial Neural Network using fuzzy back propagation algorithm (FBPA). Segmentation for detecting healthy tissues and tumors has been reported by several researchers by using conventional MRI sequences like T1, T2 and PD weighted sequences. This work successfully presents segmentation of healthy and pathological tissues (both Tumors and Edema) using FLAIR images. At the end pseudo coloring of segmented and classified regions are done for better human visualization.

A radiologist experienced in interpreting breast MR scans defined the mass using a cuboid volume of interest (VOI). Our method then used the K-means clustering algorithm followed by morphological operations for initial mass segmentation on the VOI. The initial segmentation was then refined by a three-dimensional level set (LS) method. The velocity field of the LS method was formulated in terms of the mean curvature which guaranteed the smoothness of the surface and the Sobel edge information which attracted the zero LS to the desired mass margin. We also designed a method to reduce segmentation leak by adapting a region growing technique. Our method was evaluated on twenty DCE-MR scans of ten patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Each patient had pre- and post-chemotherapy DCE-MR scans on a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Computer segmentation was applied to coronal T1-weighted images. The inplane pixel size ranged from 0.546 to 0.703 mm and the slice thickness ranged from 2.5 to 4.0 mm. The flip angle was 15 degrees, repetition time ranged from 5.98 to 6.7 ms, and echo time ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 ms. The computer segmentation results were compared to the radiologist's manual segmentation in terms of the overlap measure defined as the ratio of the intersection of the computer and the radiologist's segmentations to the radiologist's segmentation. Pre- and post-chemotherapy masses had overlap measures of 0.81 +/- 0.11 (mean +/- s.d.) and 0.70 +/- 0.21, respectively.

It is characterized by the presence of widespread nodules and fibrosis in the liver which results in characteristic texture patterns. Computerized analysis of hepatic texture patterns is usually based on regions-of-interest (ROIs). However, not all ROIs are typical representatives of the disease stage of the liver from which the ROIs originated. This leads to uncertainties in the ROI labels (diseased or non-diseased). On the other hand, supervised classifiers are commonly used in determining the assignment rule. This presents a problem as the training of a supervised classifier requires the correct labels of the ROIs. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of an unsupervised classifier, the k-means clustering, in classifying ROI based data. In addition, a procedure for generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve depicting the classification performance of k-means clustering is also reported. Hepatic MRI images of 44 patients (16 cirrhotic; 28 non-cirrhotic) are used in this study. The MRI data are derived from gadolinium-enhanced equilibrium phase images. For each patient, 10 ROIs selected by an experienced radiologist and 7 texture features measured on each ROI are included in the MRI data. Results of the k-means classifier are depicted using an ROC curve. The area under the curve (AUC) has a value of 0.704. This is slightly lower than but comparable to that of LDA and ANN classifiers which have values 0.781 and 0.801, respectively. Methods in constructing ROC curve in relation to k-means clustering have not been previously reported in the literature.

DCE-MRI was applied to 24 lesions (12 malignant, 12 benign). After region growing segmentation for each lesion, hole-filling and 3D morphological erosion and dilation were performed for extracting final lesion volume. 3TP method and k-means clustering at full-time points were applied for classifying kinetic curves into six classes. Intratumoral volume fraction for each class was calculated. ROC and linear discriminant analyses were performed with distributions of the volume fractions for each class, pairwise and whole classes, respectively. The best performance in each class showed accuracy (ACC), 84.7% (sensitivity (SE), 100%; specificity (SP), 66.7% to a single class) to 3TP method, whereas ACC, 73.6% (SE, 41.7%; SP, 100% to a single class) to k-means clustering. The best performance in pairwise classes showed ACC, 75% (SE, 83.3%; SP, 66.7% to four class pairs and SE, 58.3%; SP, 91.7% to a single class pair) to 3TP method and ACC, 75% (SE, 75%; SP, 75% to a single class pair and SE, 66.7%; SP, 83.3% to three class pairs) to k-means clustering. The performance in whole classes showed ACC, 75% (SE, 83.3%; SP, 66.7%) to 3TP method and ACC, 75% (SE, 91.7%; 58.3%) to k-means clustering. The results indicate that tumor classification using perfusion volume fractions is helpful in selecting meaningful kinetic patterns for differentiation of malignant and benign lesions, and that two different classification methods are complementary to each other.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the ensemble approach with a knowledge-based (KB) CAD system for the detection of masses in screening mammograms. The system is designed to determine the presence of a mass in a query mammographic region of interest (ROI) based on its similarity with previously acquired examples of mass and normal cases. Similarity between images is assessed using normalized mutual information. Two different approaches of knowledge database decomposition were investigated to create the ensemble. The first approach was random division of the knowledge database into a pre-specified number of equal size, separate groups. The second approach was based on k-means clustering of the knowledge cases according to common texture features extracted from the ROIs. The ensemble components were fused using a linear classifier. Based on a database of 1820 ROIs (901 masses and 919 and the leave-one-out crossvalidation scheme, the ensemble techniques improved the performance of the original KB-CAD system (A(z) = 0.86 +/- 0.01). Specifically, random division resulted in ROC area index of A(z) = 0.90 +/- 0.01 while k-means clustering provided further improvement (A(z) = 0.91 +/- 0.01). Although marginally better, the improvement was statistically significant. The superiority of the k-means clustering scheme was robust regardless of the number of clusters. This study supports the idea of incorporation of ensemble techniques with knowledge-based systems in mammography.

Therefore, a screening system for the early detection of asymptomatic brain diseases is widely used. In this screening system, leukoaraiosis is often detected in magnetic resonance (MR) images. The quantitative analysis of leukoaraiosis is important because its presence and extension is associated with an increased risk of severe stroke. However, thus far, the diagnosis of leukoaraiosis has generally been limited to subjective judgments by radiologists. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a computerized method for the segmentation of leukoaraiosis, and provide an objective measurement of the lesion volume. Our database comprised of T1- and T2-weighted images obtained from 73 patients. The locations of leukoaraiosis regions were determined by an experienced neuroradiologist. We first segment cerebral parenchymal regions in T1-weighted images by using a region growing technique. For determining the initial candidate regions for leukoaraiosis, the k-means, clustering of pixel values in the T1- and T2-weighted images was applied to the segmented cerebral region. For the elimination of false positives (FPs), we determined features such as the location, size, and circularity from each of the initial candidates. Finally, rule-based schemes and a quadratic discriminant. analysis with these features were employed for distinguishing between the leukoaraiosis regions and the FPs. The results indicated that the sensitivity for the detection of leukoaraiosis was 100% with 5.84 FPs per image. Our computerized scheme can be useful in assisting radiologists for the quantitative analysis of leukoaraiosis in T1- and T2-weighted images.

In case of small binning size (Q <= 10), NLB shows significant better accuracy than the LB. K-means NLB (Q = 26) is statistically significant better than every LB. To find optimal binning method and ROI size of the automatic classification system for differentiation between diffuse infiltrative lung diseases on the basis of textural analysis at HRCT Six-hundred circular regions of interest (ROI) with 10, 20, and 30 pixel diameter, comprising of each 100 ROIs representing six regional disease patterns (normal, NL; ground-glass opacity, GGO; reticular opacity, RO; honeycombing, HC; emphysema, EMPH; and consolidation, CONS) were marked by an experienced radiologist from HRCT images. Histogram (mean) and co-occurrence matrix (mean and SD of angular second moment, contrast, correlation, entropy, and inverse difference momentum) features were employed to test binning and ROI effects. To find optimal binning, variable binning size LB (bin size Q: 4 similar to 30, 32, 64, 128, 144, 196, 256, 384) and NLB (Q: 4 similar to 30) methods (K-means, and Fuzzy C-means clustering) were tested. For automated classification, a SVM classifier was implemented. To assess cross-validation of the system, a five-folding method was used. Each test was repeatedly performed twenty times. Overall accuracies with every combination of variable ROIs, and binning sizes were statistically compared. In case of small binning size (Q:S 10), NLB shows significant better accuracy than the LB. K-means NLB (Q = 26) is statistically significant better than every LB. In case of 3000 ROI size and most of binning size, the K-means method showed better than other NLB and LB methods. When optimal binning and other parameters were set, overall sensitivity of the classifier was 92.85%. The sensitivity and specificity of the system for each class were as follows: NL, 95%, 97.9%; GGO, 80%, 98.9%; RO 85%, 96.9%; HC, 94.7%, 97%; ENTH, 100%, 100%; and CONS, 100%, 100%, respectively. We determined the optimal binning method and ROI size of the automatic classification system for differentiation between diffuse infiltrative lung diseases on the basis of texture features at HRCT.

PDE image models are widely used in image restoration and segmentation. In a PDE model, the image can be viewed as the solution of an evolutionary differential equation. The variation of the image can be regard as a descent of an energy function, which entitles us to use PDE models in Bayesian reconstruction. In this paper, two PDE models called anisotropic diffusion are studied. Both of them have the characteristics of edge-preserving and denoising like the popular median root prior (MRP). We use PDE regularization with an Ordered Subsets accelerated Bayesian one step late (OSL) reconstruction algorithm for emission tomography. The OS accelerated OSL algorithm is more practical than a non-accelerated one. The proposed algorithm is called OSEM-PDE. We validated the OSEM-PDE using a Zubal phantom in numerical experiments with attenuation correction and quantum noise considered, and the results are compared with OSEM and an OS version of MRP (OSEM-MRP) reconstruction. OSEM-PDE shows better results both in bias and variance. The reconstruction images are smoother and have sharper edges, thus are more applicable for post processing such as segmentation. We validate this using a k-means segmentation algorithm. The classic OSEM is not convergent especially in noisy condition. However, in our experiment, OSEM-PDE can benefit from OS acceleration and keep stable and convergent while OSEM-MRP failed to converge.

It can provide morphologic as well as pathologic information on the occluded plaques in the coronary arteries. In this paper, we present a new technique using wavelet packet analysis that differentiates between blood and non-blood regions on the IVUS images. We utilized the multi-channel texture segmentation algorithm based on the discrete wavelet packet frames (DWPF). A k-mean clustering algorithm was deployed to partition the extracted textural features into blood and non-blood in an unsupervised fashion. Finally, the geometric and statistical information of the segmented regions was used to estimate the closest set of pixels to the lumen border and a spline curve was fitted to the set. The presented algorithm may be helpful in delineating the lumen border automatically and more reliably prior to the process of plaque characterization, especially with 40 MHz transducers, where appearance of the red blood cells renders the border detection more challenging, even manually. Experimental results are shown and they are quantitatively compared with manually traced borders by an expert. It is concluded that our two dimensional (2-D) algorithm, which is independent of the cardiac and catheter motions performs well in both in-vivo and in-vitro cases.

However, current breast density estimations rely on mammography, which cannot provide accurate volumetric breast representation. Therefore, we explored two techniques of breast density evaluation via ultrasound tomography. A sample of 93 patients was imaged with our clinical prototype; each dataset contained 45-75 tomograms ranging from near the chest wall through the nipple. Whole breast acoustic velocity was determined by creating image stacks and evaluating the sound speed frequency distribution. Ultrasound percent density (USPD) was determined by segmenting high sound speed areas from each tomogram using k-means clustering, integrating over the entire breast, and dividing by total breast area. Both techniques were independently evaluated using two mammographic density measures: (1) qualitative, determined by a radiologist's visual assessment using BI-RADS Categories, and (2) quantitative, via semi-automatic segmentation to calculate mammographic percent density (MPD) for craniocaudal and medio-lateral oblique mammograms. similar to 140 m/s difference in acoustic velocity was observed between fatty and dense BI-RADS Categories. Increased sound speed was found with increased BI-RADS Category and quantitative MPD. Furthermore, strong positive associations between USPD, BI-RADS Category, and calculated MPD were observed.

Surface data from the NCEP-Reanalysis and ECHAM4/OPYC3-climate change GHG simulation (IS92a) are considered. To achieve an optimum separation of clusters of extreme storm conditions, 55 clusters of weather patterns are differentiated. To reduce the computational effort, a PCA is initially performed, leading to a data reduction of about 98 %. The clustering itself was computed on 3-day periods constructed with the first six PCs using "k-means" clustering algorithm. The applied method enables an evaluation of the time evolution of the synoptic developments. The climate change signal is constructed by a projection of the GCM simulation on the EOFs attained from the NCEP-Reanalysis. Consequently, the same clusters are obtained and frequency distributions can be compared. For Central Europe, four primary storm clusters are identified. These clusters feature almost 72 % of the historical extreme storms events and add only to 5 % of the total relative frequency. Moreover, they show a statistically significant signature in the associated wind fields over Europe. An increased frequency of Central European storm clusters is detected with enhanced GHG conditions, associated with an enhancement of the pressure gradient over Central Europe. Consequently, more intense wind events over Central Europe are expected. The presented algorithm will be highly valuable for the analysis of huge data amounts as is required for e.g. multi-model ensemble analysis, particularly because of the enormous data reduction.

Numerous clustering algorithms based on various theories have been developed, and new algorithms continue to appear in the literature. In this paper, supposing that each cluster center is a gravity center and each data point has a constant mass, Newton's law of gravity is transformed from m/d(2) to l/d(2). According to adapted the law, we have proposed novel method called Gravitational Fuzzy clustering. The three main contributions of new algorithm can be summarized as: 1) it becomes more sophisticated technique by taking advantages of K-means, fuzzy C-means and subtractive clustering methods, 2) it removes the dependence on initial condition by taking account of the gravitation effect. 3) it improves the cluster centers by means of the gravity center of clusters. We illustrate the advantage of the resulting of gravitational approach with several examples.

The rough set theory is used to establish the lower and upper bound for data clustering in the K-means algorithm. Then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the solutions of the rough K-means algorithm. The combined algorithm is called the Rough K-means PSO algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better and improves the classification in the blurred and vague areas of test images.

The VNSOptClustering algorithm exploits the basic Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic to allow clustering solutions to get out of local optimality with a poor value; it considers the statistics nature of data distribution to find an optimal solution with no dependency on the initial partition; it utilizes a cluster validity index as an objective function to obtain a compact and well-separated clustering result. As an application for unsupervised Anomaly Detection, our experiments show that (i) VNSOptClust has obtained an average detection rate of 71.2% with an acceptably low false positive rate of 0.9%; (ii) VNSOptClust can detect the majority of unknown attacks from each attack category, especially, it can detect 84% of the DOS attacks. It appears that VNSOptClust is a promising clustering method in automatically detecting unknown intrusions.

Functional quantization is a way to approximate a process, viewed as a Hilbert-valued random variable, using a nearest neighbour projection on a finite code-book. A special emphasis is made on the computational aspects and the numerical applications, in particular the pricing of some path-dependent European options.

A new variable weighting and selection procedure for K-means cluster analysis	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL TEST CLUSTERS; LOCAL OPTIMA; BINARY DATA; DATA SET; NUMBER; STANDARDIZATION; ALGORITHM	A variance-to-range ratio variable weighting procedure is proposed. We show how this weighting method is theoretically grounded in the inherent variability found in data exhibiting cluster structure. In addition, a variable selection procedure is proposed to operate in conjunction with the variable weighting technique. The performances of these procedures are demonstrated in a simulation study, showing favorable results when compared with existing standardization methods. A detailed demonstration of the weighting and selection procedure is provided for the well-known Fisher Iris data and several synthetic data sets.

Out of the great amount of location records, pick-up data are extracted by tracing the state change in the predefined taxi state diagram. To decide a reasonable granularity of location recommendation, refined clustering is performed by means of the well-known k-means method supported by the E-Miner statistics software package. In addition, within each cluster, the temporal analysis creates time-dependent pick-up pattern change along the time axis. As a result, the cluster and its spatio-temporal pick-up frequency make it possible to suggest that the empty taxi go to the nearby cluster location, resulting in the reduction of empty taxi ratio.

The clustering method combined nearest neighbor clustering method with k-means clustering method (NNKM) is adopted in pixel classification. The membership of every image pixel to each cluster center is introduced. And the fused image membership obtained by maximum rule is adopted as the weighting coefficient of the weighted mean strategy, which is used to obtain the fusion image. In this experiment, the fusion results of various Radiuses of Gauss function are compared with the results obtained by nearest neighbor clustering method The experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance of the fused image.

Histogram refinement provides a set of features for proposed for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Standard histograms, because of their efficiency and insensitivity to small changes, are widely used for content based image retrieval. But the main disadvantage of histograms is that many images of different appearances can have similar histograms because histograms provide coarse characterization of an image. Hence histogram refinement method further refines the histogram by splitting the pixels in a given bucket into several classes based on color coherence vectors. Several features are calculated for each of the cluster and these features are further classified using the K-means clustering.

The proposed method decomposes a sentence into the linear combination of sparse non-negative semantic features so that it can represent a sentence as the sum of a few semantic features that are comprehensible intuitively. It can improve the quality of document summaries because it can avoid extracting the sentences whose similarities with query are high but are meaningless by using the similarity between the query and the semantic features. Besides, it uses NMF clustering to remove noises so that it can avoid the biased inherent semantics of the documents to be reflected in summaries. Also it can ensure the coherence of summaries by using the rank score of sentences with respect to semantic features.

The method consists of three steps. First step includes usage of self-organizing maps for determination of potential candidates for regions centers. Secondly, using maxmin algorithm, number of candidates is reduced to initializing number of centers, which are then used for further analysis. During this process, initial number of regions is formed. For every formed region spatial and intensity centers are determined. Finally, in the third step, iterative procedure of modified K-means algorithm is realized during which the number of regions is minimized. The experimental results verify the usability of described algorithm.

It is a simple yet powerful method for finding structure in data using spectral properties of an associated pairwise similarity matrix. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means; algorithm. In this paper we propose a new way of image segmentation based on specifically created similarity matrix and based on it, very simple segmentation algorithm. The algorithm is theoretically motivated and demonstrated on nontrivial examples.

Because RBFNN is characteristic of accurate approximation and good generalization, as well as robustness against interference and scattering from antennas, the proposed method can learn source direction findings of UWB array and work well in existence of manufacturing errors and mutual coupling of UWB array antennas. In order to get rapid training and avoid large network size, a hybrid leaning scheme for RBFNN is adopted. Firstly an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm is employed to determine the centers of hidden neurons, then a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is used to obtain the linear weights of the output layer. Moreover, in order to solve the multiple sources tracking of UWB array, we combine eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) with RBFNN to extract the DoAs of multiple sources. The effectiveness of our scheme is demonstrated through several numerical examples. The results show that this method is characteristic of high accuracy and robustness to mutual coupling, when compared to presently available methods in literatures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we proposed a global sub-division of the posterior cortex into two large-scale systems. One system, labeled extrinsic, comprises the sensory-motor cortex, and is associated with the external environment. The second system, labeled intrinsic, overlaps substantially with the previously described "default-mode" network, and is likely associated with inner-oriented processing. This global partition of the cerebral cortex emerged from hemodynamic imaging data the analysis of which was constrained by pre-determined hypotheses. Here we applied a hypothesis-free, unsupervised two-class clustering algorithm (k-means) to a large set of fMRI data. The two clusters delineated by this unsupervised hypothesis-free procedure showed high anatomical consistency across individuals, and their cortical topography coincided largely with the previously determined extrinsic and intrinsic systems. These new clusterin-based results confirm that the intrinsic-extrinsic subdivision constitutes a fundamental cortical divide. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reduction of points of interest is made by introducing some kind of intelligence in decision step before clustering algorithm. It is numerically less complex and suitable for implementation in the low speed computing devices, such as smart cameras for the traffic surveillance systems. Multiscale edge detection and segmentation are discussed in detail in the paper.

Activities are represented by feature vectors from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on video images and based on these features, recognition is achieved by trained HMMs of activities. Our recognition performance has been compared to the conventional method where Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is typically used to derive activity shape features. Our results show that superior recognition is achieved with our proposed method especially for activities (e.g., skipping) that cannot be easily recognized by the conventional method.	[Uddin, Md.

We used this method for building n-gram language models for Persian continuous speech recognition (CSR) systems. In this method, each word is specified by a feature vector that represents the statistics of parts of speech (POS) of that word. The feature vectors are clustered by k-means algorithm. Using this method causes a reduction in time complexity which is a defect in other automatic clustering methods. Also, the problem of high perplexity in manual clustering methods is abated. The experimental results are based on "Persian Text Corpus" which contains about 9 million words. ne extracted language models are evaluated by the perplexity criterion and the results show that a considerable reduction in perplexity has been achieved. Also reduction in word error rate of CSR system is about 16% compared with a manual clustering method.

The proposed clustering algorithm partitions the N patterns of the gene expression dataset into user-defined K categories to minimize the fitness function of Total Within-Cluster Variation. Thus a partition with high performance is obtained. The experiment results on four gene expression data sets show that our QPSO-based clustering algorithm will be an effective and promising tool for gene expression data analysis.

One of the underlying principles of the PRSP is participation of key actors. Using the ladder of citizen participation framework, the paper investigates the levels of participation of key community partners in the implementation of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) which was produced in 2003. A total of 406 questionnaires were administered to sampled heads of households in six communities chosen from the Twifu-Heman-Lower Denkyira District in the Central Region of Ghana. The chi-square and the K-Means cluster statistical techniques were used to analyse the data. In general, citizens described their participation in the implementation of the GPRSP as non-participation. The cluster analysis showed a significant relationship between cluster membership and the geographical location of respondents. The perception on participation of other key community partners in the GPRSP varied. For instance, participation of the District Assembly members was perceived as citizen power, while participation of traditional authority and unit committee members were considered as non-participation and tokenism respectively.

J	Lin, CN; Tsai, CF; Roan, JS				Lin, Chun-Nan; Tsai, Chih-Fong; Roan, Jinsheng			Personal photo browsing and retrieval by clustering techniques Effectiveness and efficiency evaluation	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						Image processing; Photographs; Cluster analysis; Content management	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM; MAPS; DATABASES; TEXTURE; COLOR; FEATURES	Purpose - Because of the popularity of digital cameras, the number of personal photographs is increasing rapidly. In general, people manage their photos by date, subject, participants, etc. for future browsing and searching. However, it is difficult and/or takes time to retrieve desired photos from a large number of photographs based on the general personal, photo management strategy. In this paper the authors aim to propose a systematic solution to effectively organising and browsing personal photos. Design/methodology/approach - In their system the authors apply the concept of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to automatically extract visual image features,; of personal photos. Then three well-known clustering techniques - k-means, self-organising maps and fuzzy c-means - are used to group personal photos. Finally, the clustering results are evaluated by human subjects in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Findings - Experimental results based on the dataset of 1,000 personal photos show that the k-means clustering method outperforms self-organising maps and fuzzy c-means. That is, 12 subjects out of 30 preferred the clustering results of k-means. In particular, most subjects agreed that larger numbers of clusters (e.g. 15 to 20) enabled more effective browsing of personal photos. For the efficiency evaluation, the clustering results using k-means allowed subjects to search for relevant images in the least amount of time. Originality/value - CBIR is applied in many areas, but very few related works focus on personal photo browsing and retrieval. This paper examines the applicability of using CBIR and clustering techniques for browsing, personal photos. In addition, the evaluation based on the effectiveness and efficiency strategies ensures the reliability of our findings.

Improved training for target detection using Fukunaga-Koontz transform and distance classifier correlation filter	OPTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION XIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Pattern Recognition XIX	MAR 17-18, 2008	Orlando, FL	SPIE		FLIR video sequence; K-means algorithm; target detection; distance classifier correlation filter; Fukunaga-Koontz transform	RECOGNITION; TRACKING	In a FLIR image sequence, a target may disappear permanently or may reappear after some frames and crucial information such as direction, position and size related to the target are lost. If the target reappears at a later frame, it may not be tracked again because the 3D orientation, size and location of the target might be changed. To obtain information about the target before disappearing and to detect the target after reappearing, distance classifier correlation filter (DCCF) is trained manualy by selecting a number of chips randomly. This paper introduces a novel idea to eliminates the manual intervention in training phase of DCCF. Instead of selecting the training chips manually and selecting the number of the training chips randomly, we adopted the K-means algorithm to cluster the training frames and based on the number of clusters we select the training chips such that a training chip for each cluster. To detect and track the target after reappearing in the field-of-view JBF and DCCF are employed.

Through grouping similar documents together, clustering techniques can facilitate user's need of effectively finding interested documents. Since non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) can effectively capture the latent semantic space with non-negative factorization in both the basis and the weight, it has been utilized to clustering general text documents. Considering the stochastic nature of NMF with respect to initialization, we propose to use ensemble NMF for biomedical document clustering. The performance of ensemble NMF was evaluated on clustering a large number of datasets generated from TREC Genomics track dataset. The experimental results show that our method outperforms classical clustering algorithms bisect k-means, k-means and hierarchical clustering significantly in most of the datasets.

PCA is a method that can transform the original data that contains more vectors and some different correlative relationships between these vectors into a new one that contains fewer vectors and disrelated relationships between these vectors, while keeping the most information of the original data. First the PCA is used to obtain the best description features over the entire image which can reduce the dimension of the image and numeration, and then the reduced image data is identified by K-means clustering. The algorithm have a strong global searching capacity and avoids the local minimum problems. At the same time, it's no longer a large degree dependent on the initialization values. The results show that the method is more effective.

In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral clustering in dataset with outliers. Through spectral method we can use the information of feature space with eigenvectors rather than that of the whole dataset to obtain stable clusters. Then we introduce the cluster-based local outlier factor to identify and find the outliers in dataset. The experimental results show that our outlier detection algorithm outperforms the K-means based algorithm with high precision and low false alarm rate as well as desirable coverage ratio.

Image-based discriminating morphological features for gastric atrophy assessment: A step to go further	PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article						gastric atrophy; morphometry; updated Sydney system; K-Means classification; gastritis grading	HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; ANTRAL ATROPHY; SYDNEY SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ARTICLE	The aim of this study is to establish a basis for automated assessment of gastric atrophy according to the Updated Sydney System. We sought to minimize inter- and intra-observer variations in the application of the Sydney System. A total of 160 biopsies were examined by three pathologists and graded using the visual scale of the Updated Sydney System. A consensus was reached on 135 biopsies. Digital images were captured for the studied biopsies. Image processing techniques were used to extract four morphological features that uniquely discriminate each atrophy grade. The features are related to gland density and shape. To validate the reproducibility of these features, the K-Means clustering technique was used. We were able to grade the atrophy with an overall precision of 95.6%. Furthermore, the proposed. features were able to distinguish four discrete grades without any significant overlap. This has not been achieved by previous studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Al-Omari, F. A.; Al-Jarrah, M. A.] Yarmouk Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Irbid 21163, Jordan; [Matalka, I.

Both VQ designs represent the binary pressure information without any loss. The new designs are necessary because standard k-means VQ systems cannot quantize this binary feature adequately, as is shown in this paper. Our experiments show that the new systems provide a relative improvement of r = 1.8% in recognition accuracy on a character- and r = 3.3% on a word-level benchmark compared to a standard k-means VQ system. Additionally, our system is compared and proven to be competitive to a state-of-the-art continuous HMM-based system yielding a slight relative improvement of r = 0.6%.

J	Zhou, H; Liu, YH				Zhou, Hong; Liu, Yonghuai			Accurate integration of multi-view range images using k-means clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						3D modelling; registered range images; k-means clustering; point shift; overlapping area detection and integration; surface details	SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; REGISTRATION; ALGORITHM; FUSION	3D modelling finds a wide range of applications in industry. However, due to the presence of surface scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, reconstructed object surfaces using range images captured from multiple viewpoints are often distorted with thick patches, false connections, blurred features and artefacts. Moreover, the existing integration methods are often expensive in the sense of both computational time and data storage. These shortcomings limit the wide applications of 3D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the k-means clustering approach (from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures) is employed to minimize the integration error and to optimize the fused point locations. To initialize the clustering approach, an automatic method is developed, shifting points in the overlapping areas between neighbouring views towards each other, so that the initialized cluster centroids are in between the two overlapping surfaces. This results in more efficient and effective integration of data. While the overlapping areas were initially detected using a single distance threshold, they are then refined using the k-means clustering method. For more accurate integration results, a weighting scheme reflecting the imaging principle is developed to integrate the corresponding points in the overlapping areas. The fused point set is finally triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient in the sense of either running time or memory usage and reduces significantly the integration error, while desirably retaining geometric details of 3D object surfaces of interest.

The focus of this paper is the partitioning clustering problem with a special interest in two recent approaches: kernel and spectral methods. The aim of this paper is to present a survey of kernel and spectral clustering methods, two approaches able to produce nonlinear separating hypersurfaces between clusters. The presented kernel clustering methods are the kernel version of many classical clustering algorithms, e.g., K-means, SOM and neural gas. Spectral clustering arise from concepts in spectral graph theory and the clustering problem is configured as a graph cut problem where an appropriate objective function has to be optimized. An explicit proof of the fact that these two paradigms have the same objective is reported since it has been proven that these two seemingly different approaches have the same mathematical foundation. Besides, fuzzy kernel clustering methods are presented as extensions of kernel K-means clustering algorithm. (C) 2007 Pattem Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Similar to microarray based investigation, proteomic data generated by such kind of high-throughput experiments are often with high feature-to-sample ratio. Moreover, biological information and pattern are compounded with data noise, redundancy and outliers. Thus, the development of algorithms and procedures for the analysis and interpretation of such kind of data is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system for analyzing such high dimensional data. The proposed method uses the k-mean clustering algorithm based feature extraction and selection procedure to bridge the filter selection and wrapper selection methods. The potential informative mass/charge (m/z) markers selected by filters are subject to the k-mean clustering algorithm for correlation and redundancy reduction, and a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm selector is then employed to identify discriminative m/z markers generated by k-mean clustering algorithm. Experimental results obtained by using the proposed method indicate that it is suitable for m/z biomarker selection and MS based sample classification.

The most common way to represent location information is to use numerical coordinates, e.g., latitudes and longitudes. A problem with this approach is that numerical coordinates are usually meaningless to a user and they contrast with the way humans refer to locations in daily communication. Instead of using coordinates, humans tend to use descriptive statements about their location; for example, "I'm home" or "I'm at Starbucks." Locations, to which a user can attach meaningful and descriptive semantics, are often called places. In this paper we focus on the automatic extraction of places from discontinuous GPS measurements. We describe and evaluate a non-parametric Bayesian approach for identifying places from this kind of data. The main novelty of our approach is that the algorithm is fully automated and does not require any parameter tuning. Another novel aspect of our algorithm is that it can accurately identify places without temporal information. We evaluate our approach using data that has been gathered from different users and different geographic areas. The traces that we use exhibit different characteristics and contain data from daily life as well as from traveling abroad. We also compare our algorithm against the popular k-means algorithm. The results indicate that our method can accurately identify meaningful places from a variety of location traces and that the algorithm is robust against noise.

Toward Bridging the Gap Between Data-Driven and Mechanistic Models: Cluster-Based Neural Networks for Hydrologic Processes	PRACTICAL HYDROINFORMATICS: COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN WATER APPLICATIONS	Water Science and Technology Library		English	Proceedings Paper	General Assembly of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	APR 24-29, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union		Clustering; spiking modular neural networks; actual evapotranspiration; predication; K-mean	GENERAL METHODOLOGY; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; RIVER; FLUXES; HEAT	The emergence of artificial neural network (ANN) applications in hydrology, among other data-driven techniques, has created a new chapter in this field of science that has been termed "neurohydrology" (Abrahart, 1999). However, the number of operational solutions is still limited because most of the practitioners and many researchers have difficulty accepting ANNs as a standard technique. This chapter presents an attempt to bridge the gap between ANN models and mechanistic hydrologic models using cluster-based ANN models. A novel spiking modular neural network (SMNN) model is proposed, configured, and trained in a way that assigns different sub-components of the hydrologic processes to corresponding sub-components of the developed SMNN model. The modular nature of the SMNN helps to find domain-dependent relationships. The proposed model configuration reflects the ability of the ANN technique to mimic mechanistic models in terms of their sensible internal structure and the way they model various hydrologic processes. The meteorological data, including air temperature, ground temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and net radiation, from a semi-arid region in northern Alberta, Canada, are used in this chapter to estimate actual evapotranspiration (AET). The estimated AET is contrasted against the values measured by an eddy covariance system. The results of the SMNN model, which uses an unsupervised clustering technique to group the input data into a definite number of clusters, are compared with the results of another modular ANN model that relies on a supervised clustering technique, and with a traditional global feedforward ANN model. The estimates of AET using the Penman-Monteith model are also presented for reference and comparison purposes. The SMNN model provided the best performance and was shown to be effective in discretizing the complex mapping space into simpler domains that are easier to learn.

S	Ahmad, W; Khokhar, A		Bonchi, F; Ferrari, E; Malin, B; Saygin, Y		Ahmad, Waseem; Khokhar, Ashfaq			Phoenix: Privacy preserving biclustering on horizontally partitioned data	PRIVACY, SECURITY, AND TRUST IN KDD	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Privacy, Security and Trust in KDD	AUG 12, 2007	San Jose, CA	ACM SIGKDD			SECURITY	Emerging business models require organizations to collaborate with each other. This collaboration is usually in the form of distributed clustering to find optimal customer targets for effective marketing. This process is hampered by two problems (1) Inability of traditional clustering algorithm in finding local (subspace) patterns in distributed data and (2) Privacy policies of individual organizations limiting the process of information sharing. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy preserving biclustering algorithm on horizontally partitioned data, referred to as Phoenix, which solves both of these problems. It assumes a malicious adversary model which is more practical than commonly employed semi-honest adversary model. It is shown to outperform traditional K-means clustering algorithm in identifying local patterns. The distributed secure implementation of the algorithm is evaluated to be very efficient both in computation and communication requirements.

This approach employs Segmental K-Means clustering algorithm prior to competitive based learning. The clustering system relies on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for speaker modeling and as a likelihood estimator. Performance is evaluated on 108 two speaker conversations taken from LDC CALLHOME American English Speech corpus using NIST criterion and shows an improvement of 20%-30% in Cluster Error Rate (CER) relative to the randomly initialized clustering system. The number of iterations was reduced significantly, which contributes to both speed and efficiency of the clustering system.

In this framework, multi-document summarization is constructed by utilizing complete sentences from the documents in the collection, sentence is the basic unit, it is described by multi-features such as key word, semantic and syntax, and using the weight to describe the contribution of each feature to the sentence. Then we use an optimizing K-means to improve the effect of sentences clustering. The experimental result shows that this method gives significance to the future research of multi-document summarization.

Therefore, a number of semi-supervised clustering algorithms have been proposed, but few of them are specially designed for multi-type relational data. In this paper, a semi-supervised k-means clustering algorithm for multi-type relational data is proposed, which is based on the combination of semi-supervised k-means method and multi-type relational data clustering. In order to achieve high performance, in the algorithm, we first analyze all kinds of relationships in data, which include intra-relationship, inter-relationship, explicit and implicit relationship; and then extend k-means clustering algorithm by seeding and new similarity measures, where attributes information, labeled data and all kinds of relationships are employed. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

There are many different clustering methods. Among them, k-means clustering is one of the most popular schemes owing to its simple and practicality. This paper investigates the approximate algorithm for the k-means clustering by means of selecting the k initial points from the input point set. An expected 2-approximation algorithm is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, an efficient algorithm for selecting the initial points is also proposed. At last some experimental results are given to test the valid of these algorithms.

The RR interval length are utilised to deduce statistical features on short-time heartbeat. patterns. We demonstrate that these features are biologically relevant to classify the heartbeat patterns by a K-means clustering approach.

In the paper, a new text extraction algorithm under background image based on two-dimensional wavelet transforms is proposed. For the algorithm, firstly the image is transformed into the wavelet domain and then a sliding window is set to scan high frequency sub-bands, through computing the wavelet texture features of the image in the sliding window, k-means clustering algorithm is used to classify the image into text area, simple background area and complex background area. Finally mathematical morphology operations are applied on the text area to locate the text positions exactly. The experimental result shows that the algorithm can extract text information with different languages, fonts, sizes and ways of arrangement from the background image exactly.

In this paper a hybrid clustering algorithm is proposed which is based on ART2 and K-Means. Firstly ATR2 is executed to find the initial cluster numbers and initial cluster centers, K-means uses these values to initialize its parameters and rind new cluster centers, then these new cluster centers are sent back to ART2, ART2 use them to initialize connection weights between F1 layer and F2 layer, and get the final improved clusters. To prove its effectiveness it was applied in intrusion detection. The KDD'99 data sets are used as experimental data. Experiments show that clustering results are improved.

This problem is often caused by the highly non-uniform design of regression data set in the correlation dimension plots. The paper proposes an optimized computer-implemented method to choose of the regression data set for least square fit. Through the calculation and analysis of the max singular value, the appropriate embedding dimension is determined when the saturation effect occurs. Then based on K-means algorithm, the credible scaling regime of corresponding embedding dimension curve can be identified and hence extracting. the reasonable regression data set. Uniform measure criteria guarantee the rationality of the dimension selection and the reliability of scaling regime identification. Experimental results based on typical attractor indicate that the method can not only reduce the numerical calculation, but also deal with the irregular dimension plots more effectively. To have a comparison with the proposed approach, similar experiments using conventional least square regression approach are also performed to prove the validity of the algorithm.

Automatic texture segmentation based on k-means clustering and efficient calculation of co-occurrence features	PROCEEDINGS OF IWSSIP 2008: 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, SIGNALS AND IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing	JUN 25-28, 2008	Bratislava, SLOVAKIA	ZPTS, STU, EURASIP, ISRST, IEEE		co-occurrence matrix; optimization; textural segmentation; Haralick's features; MR images		This work presents a method for automatic texture segmentation based on the k-means clustering technique and co-occurrence texture features. A set of eight features were extracted from the grey-level co-occurrence information. Two of them are proposed here to improve segmentation results for magnetic resonance (MR) images. All the features arc used to segment image regions based on textural homogeneity of its areas. As the process of calculating the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) demands increased computational resources, we propose a new methodology based on an indexed list (IL) for fast clement access. This novel approach highly optimizes the algorithm called grey-level co-occurrencc indexed list (GLCIL). Moreover, we compare the efficiency of the proposed method against two others, namely the traditional GLCM and the grey level co-occurrence linked list (GLCLL), which was suggested as a faster alternative to GLCM. The technique proposed here is the most efficient in terms of computational time, when compared to the other two. Additionally, examples on real time segmentation are presented to illustrate the appropriateness and robustness of this new method.

A new, stochastic method based on Hidden Markov Models to transformer differential protection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OPTIMIZATION OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, VOL I			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment	MAY 22-23, 2008	Brasov, ROMANIA			Discrete Hidden Markov Models (DHMM); inrush current; differential protection; transformer; internal fault; signal classification	MAGNETIZING INRUSH CURRENTS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; INTERNAL FAULTS; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION	This paper proposed a new classification method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to discriminate between magnetizing inrush current and internal faults in transformers. To reduce training procedure time, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to dataset. Since the discrimination method is done with probabilistic characteristics of signals without application of any deterministic index, more reliable and accurate classification is achieved. Based on the proposed algorithm a high speed differential relaying could be performed in about half of a cycle. The suitable performance of this method is demonstrated by simulation of different fault types and switching conditions on a power transformer. All simulation results validate the proposed scheme accuracy. It provides a high operating sensitivity for internal faults and remains stable for inrush currents of the power transformers.

The improved histogram model is proposed for detection and removal of rain in video. The properties of this model, which are suitable for both stationary and dynamic scenes, are particularly discussed. An appropriate and concise K-means clustering algorithm is embedded in our methods, which remarkably reduces the complexity of the existing algorithm. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated using experimental results, which corroborates the significance of the intensity property for detection and removal of rain in video.

It is based on pattern recognition methods, such as k-means, fuzzy k-means and hierarchical clustering, which are properly adapted. The parameters of each clustering method are properly selected by an optimization process using the ratio of within cluster sum of squares to between cluster variation (WCBCR) as an adequacy measure. This methodology is applied for the Greek power system, from which is proved that the separation between work days and non-work days for each season is not so enough descriptive.	[Tsekouras, G.

In this paper, we describe a desktop-based tool, an Internet Webbot which organizes information retrieved from search engines in a form that is more useful to end-users. WebBot meta-searches the web using three Popular search engines, retrieves the web pages from the Internet and groups them according to their theme. Thus a search for "operating system" automatically organizes the results into categories like Microsoft, open source resources, distributed operating systems, memory management etc. We use the K-Means and Subtractive Clustering algorithms to find clusters in the document vector space. In this paper we also define methods used for clustering including suffix tree clustering algorithm used. WebBot can be easily adapted to work on any information source.			shilpi.garg@amdocs.com; shubham.agarwal@airtightnetworks.net					CHIU SL, 1996, P N AM FUZZ INF PROC; ETZIONI O, 1996, P 13 NAT C ART INT A; PORTER MF, 1980, PROGRAM-AUTOM LIBR, V14, P130, DOI 10.1108/eb046814; SELBERG E, 1997, IEEE EXPERT      JAN; SINGHAL A, P 5 DUAL US TECHN AP, P318; Smith L.

Traditional key frame extraction methods only use color, texture, or shape features to represent a frame, while the motion feature is ignored or inappropriately modeled. Since the motion feature contains a lot of semantic information in video analysis, we propose a compact representation of the dominant motion information for each frame, based on a mean shift analysis procedure. Then, an EMD (Earth Mover's Distance) is employed as a similarity metric for the represented motion feature. Moreover, we propose a novel temporal k-means clustering algorithm for the key frame extraction, which naturally incorporates the sequential constraint into extracted key frames. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

In the proposed framework, the domain boundaries predicated by ProDom database are used to provide a better measurement in calculating the sequence similarity. In addition, we use an unsupervised clustering algorithm as the kernel that includes a hierarchical clustering in the first phase to pre-cluster the protein sequences, and a partitioning clustering in the second phase to refine the clustering results. More specifically, we perform the agglomerative hierarchical clustering on protein sequences in the first phase to obtain the initial clustering results for the subsequent partitioning clustering, and then, a profile Hidden Markove Model (HMM) is built for each cluster to represent the centroid of a cluster. In the second phase, the HMMs based k-means clustering is then performed to refine the cluster results as protein families. The experimental results show our model is effective and efficient in clustering protein families.

Firstly, we use self-organizing map to determine the number of clusters and the starting point of each cluster, and then use K-means clustering algorithm to generate clusters of samples. Secondly, we replace the class label of samples with the corresponding the cluster identifier. Thirdly, the pre-processed samples are used for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid credit scoring model by testing it on two real world credit datasets.

Combining advantages with disadvantages of the two algorithms, the improved algorithm DBSK is proposed. Because of the partition of data set, DBSK reduces the requirement of memory; the method of computing variable value is put forward; to the uneven data set, because of adopting different variable values in each local data set, the dependence on global parameters is reduced, so the clustering result is better. Simulative experiment is carried out, which proves the algorithm's feasibility and validity.

A new clustering algorithm based on user transactions was proposed to provide personalized recommendation service for the websites. As an improvement on K-means algorithm, we got best cluster number and initial clustering centers automatically by competitive agglomeration, we established access matrix based on the access sequence, browsing time, click frequency. A new distance method that captures the structure of a web site is defined to measure the similarity between two users. We exploited the definition of clustering centers in k-path algorithm and enhanced CAKPS algorithm to cluster the access users. Experiments are performed to compare the CAKPS algorithm with two other algorithms, and the results show that the enhanced algorithm convergences more rapidly and the difference of user sets are higher than the normal algorithm.

So it is difficult to obtain optimal model by learning from hybrid training pages. In order to improve the accuracy of information extraction, a new approach based on clustering generalized hidden Markov model was proposed. In this approach, the clustering algorithm was applied to web information extraction. The training pages were segregated into a number of clusters by using simple agglomerative hierarchical K-Means clustering (SAHKC) algorithm, and generalized hidden Markov model was trained out through every cluster. Experiment results shows that the new approach could improve the performance of extraction effectively.

The algorithm uses information sampled from around detected corner points in the image. A corner detection approach based on line intersections has been employed using Hough transform for line detection and then finding intersecting, near intersecting or complex shaped corners. As the affine transformations preserve the colinearity of points on a line and their intersection properties, the corner points obtained as such retain the much desired property of repeatability and hence ensure the similar pixel samples under various transformations and are robust to noise. K-means clustering algorithm is used to assign class labels to the extracted sample mean and variance of the corner regions from a random selection of training images and used for learning a Gaussian Byes classifier to classify whole training image data base. Histogram of the class members in an image has been used as a feature vector. The retrieval performance and behavior of the algorithm has been tested using four different similarity measures.

Three different classifiers are evaluated: a Bayesian classifier, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and a neural network approach. The target applications pose several requirements on the classifiers. No a priori knowledge about the event classes is available. Events are only observable as collections of raw sensor data. Accordingly, event classes need to be learned from that raw (training) data. As a consequence, pre-labeling of the events is not possible either In our work, event classes are learned by a k-means clustering algorithm. Any subsequent classifier training is based on these extracted event classes. Thus, the resulting classifiers are completely self-learning. Event classes are learned from emitted signal strength estimations, which are collected and processed by dynamically established tracking groups. The resulting event estimates are reported to a base station, where the classifiers are trained. The learned classifier parameters are then downloaded onto the sensor nodes, where any subsequent classification and filtering is performed.

Determining rock mass permeability in a carbonate reservoir, southern Iran using hydraulic flow units and intelligent systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND IASME/WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY (GES '08): ADVANCED TOPICS ON GEOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY	Mathematics and Computers in Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IASME/WSEAS International Conference on Geology and Seismology	FEB 23-25, 2008	Cambridge, ENGLAND	IASME, WSEAS	Univ Cambridge	hydraulic flow units; flow zone indicator; reservoir quality index; permeability; uncored well; carbonate reservoir		This paper presents hydraulic flow units and flow zone indicator for predicting permeability of rock mass from core- and well log-data. The concept is applied to some uncored wells/intervals to predict their permeability. Flow zone indicator depends on geological characteristics of the material and various pore geometry of rock mass; hence it is a good parameter for determining hydraulic flow units (HFU). Flow zone indicator is a function of reservoir quality index and void ratio. We determined flow zone indicator from well log and core data and divided the reservoir into various hydraulic flow units using K-means. Then a correlation between well log data and hydraulic flow units was drawn using adaptive network fuzzy inference system. The relationship was generalized for uncored wells. Finally, having effective porosity and flow zone indicator, permeability was calculated in each hydraulic flow unit. Results of permeability prediction based on HFU were examined for a number of wells and were compared with the measured permeability value of cores. There was a good correlation between the predicted and measured permeability.

Inspired by the self-organized behaviour of bird flocks, a new dynamic clustering approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed. In this paper, we introduced the PSDC approach, new particle swarm-like agents for multidimensional data clustering. Unlike other partition clustering algorithms, this technique does not require initial partitioned seeds and it can dynamically adapt to the changes in the global shape or size of the clusters. In this technique, the agents have lots of useful features such as sensing, thinking, making decisions and moving freely in the solution space. The moving swarm-like agents are guided to move according to a specific proposed navigation rules. Numerous experiments have been conducted using both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. Cluster validity approaches are used to quantitatively evaluate the results of the clustering algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed particle swarm-like clustering algorithm reaches good clustering solutions and achieves superior performance compared to others.

Prototype based clustering is most widely used clustering method and K-means is the one that gains much interest in the literature for about three decades. Although it is easy to implement and results are attractive, K-means has two main drawbacks. It's winner takes all strategy makes it sensitive to initial conditions and since the Euclidian type objective function is not convex there is a high possibility of getting stuck at local minima in the final solution. K-harmonic means clustering method is proposed to overcome the sensitivity to initial conditions but it does not guarantee optimal result. Stochastic search methods can be used to reach at the global or near global solutions for these kinds of problems. We propose a clustering methodology which is based on particle swarm optimization heuristic (PSO-KHMC) in this study. We compare the PSO-KHMC method with the well-known clustering methods such as K-means, fuzzy K-means and K-harmonic means and apply each method to the real datasets.

This paper proposes a Multi-source Color Transfer algorithm based on A,Multi-labeled Decision Tree. At first, we define an image as a multi-labeled set since it contains multiple objects. Then every source image is divided into several sub-images to form the training samples for the Decision Tree. Through extracting color and texture features from sub-image, training dataset is formed and the corresponding label set is obtained by amended K-mean clustering. After that, a multi-labeled decision tree is constructed using SCC_Sp. Finally, color transfer is performed on object image based on its predicted label set by the built tree. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works well on multi-source color transfer, making up the shortage of color transfer based on single source image.

After analyzing the traditional clustering algorithms, the paper presents a new algorithm to cluster the hybrid data based on lattice. The method changes the object's attributes to lattice based on the conception of simple tuples and hyper tuples in lattice, use the numbers of covers to measure the similarity between labels, and choose the clustering mean-point according to the rule of high covers to high similarity.

Compensation of Environmental Influences for Damage Detection using Classification Techniques	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOURTH EUROPEAN WORKSHOP ON STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2008	Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	JUL 02-04, 2008	Cracow, POLAND	Univ Sci & Technol, Polish Acad Sci, Inst Fundamental Technol Res, PAS, Inst Fluid Flow Machinery, European Off Aerosp Res & Dev, Innowacja Polska Sp z o o				In many real-world applications changing environmental and operational conditions, e.g. temperature and loads, complicate the monitoring of a structure or make it impossible. Thus a need arises to compensate these influences in order to reduce the number of false alarms to a minimum. The knowledge of the environment enables us to incorporate these influences into a reliable statement about the health of the structure. Thus an improvement of damage detection is achieved. In this work a method is presented which uses a combination of statistical pattern recognition technique and damage detection algorithm in order to solve the problem of false alarms which refers to environmental and operational changes. The basic idea is to introduce reference states for the undamaged structure which are functions of the influences. The reference states are systematically found by using classification tools like the K-means or the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, respectively. The compensation of environmental influences is analyzed using a simulation model and a laboratory structure. A simplified beam model of an Offshore Wind Energy Plant (OWEP) with up to five input parameters is investigated. The model is simultaneously excited by loads with different probability distributions in the low frequency range. Simulation studies produce good results with only few false alarms due to statistical outliers. For verification purposes, experiments are performed on a laboratory structure that confirm the good simulation results.

In order to prevent the overheating of real estate investment, this paper presents a pre-warning system developed to monitor and provide pre-warning to the governmental decision makers in real estate market. In the overall structure plan, the warning classification system is the most important so that we make an innovation to it using the novel ACO-PSO-hybrid algorithm. The hybrid algorithm makes use of advantages of both ACO and PSO methods therefore it is of benefit in solving clustering problems. And the experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly better than K-means methods in terms of quality. It is adaptive, robust and efficient, achieving high autonomy, simplicity and efficiency. Therefore it can effectively provide early warning corresponding to reality so that the pre-warning system can provide useful information to regulate the property market.

There is a contradiction between the shortages of higher education tuition fees with the popularization of higher education. Limited funds allocated require resources and targeted toward needy students. RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) method is very effective attributes for customer segmentation. Our goal in this paper is to build improved RFM-based customer segmentation model to identify those needy students through the database of dining room. This study first build a framework for identify needy students based on RFM. Then improved RFM model through redefine Recency as ratio to data mining, and used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine weights of RFM variables. Finally, this study applied K-means algorithm to identify needy students. Through case study, the method can efficiently identify needy students and provide needy students list to department of university as reference.

Given a finite set P, our goal is to find a set C of size k such that the sum of errors D(P,C) = Sigma(p is an element of p) min(c is an element of C){D(p,c)} is minimized. The main result in this paper can be stated as follows: There exists an O(n2((k/t)O(1))) time (I + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the k-median problem with respect to D, if the 1-median problem can be approximated within a factor of (1 + by taking a random sample of constant size and solving the 1-median problem on the sample exactly. Using this characterization, we obtain the first linear time (1+ e)-approximation algorithms for the k-median problem in an arbitrary metric space with bounded doubling dimension, for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy), for Malialanobis distances, and for some special cases of Bregman divergences. Moreover, we obtain previously known results for the Euclidean k-median problem and the Euclidean k-means problem in a simplified manner. Our results are based on a new analysis of an algorithm from [20].

Therefore, the quality of the result is not satisfactory. Furthermore, it is usually designed as memory-resident algorithms, which limit the scalability. In this paper, we an improved K-means clustering algorithm - NK-means is developed. NK-means is based on spectral methods, namely uses Normal matrix that is used in spectral analysis approaches to normalize original datasets, and then finds clusters in the processed datasets by K-means algorithm. During the normalization, weighted adjacency matrix is constructed by the similarity between objects belonged in original datasets, and to generate Normal matrix. NK-means algorithm mainly uses the characteristic structure to process original datasets. In the processing, the data is transformed from a matrix into a vector, and the structures of the clusters are changed from three-dimensional sphere into two-dimensional circle. The experiment shows that NK-means algorithm significantly outperforms K-means in the efficiency and accuracy.

In this paper an improved genetic K-Means algorithm has been given to solve these problems above. It is that when doing these operations such as choosing, crossover and mutant, the method is improved; meanwhile, it has introduced the new gene to guarantee group diversity through development changing the crossover and mutant probability. The experimental result has shown this algorithm overcomes precocity of genetic algorithm effectively, and gets the optimum clustering center.

The advantage of SDA is that since it does not treat the class-conditional distributions as uni-modal ones, the nonlinearly separable problems can be handled as linear ones. The problem with this strategy, however, is that to estimate the number of subclasses needed to represent the distribution of each class, i.e., to find out the best partition, all possible solutions should be verified. Therefore, this approach leads to an associated high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a method that optimizes the computational burden of SDA-based classification by simply reducing the number of classes to be examined through choosing a few classes of the training set prior to the execution of SDA. To select the classes to be partitioned, the intra-set distance is employed as a criterion and a k-means clustering is performed to divide them. Our experimental results for an artificial data set and two face databases demonstrate that the processing CPU-time of the optimized SDA could be reduced dramatically without sacrificing either the classification accuracy or the computational complexity.

Intelligently managing ontological knowledge (classes, properties and instances) enables efficacious ontological interoperability. In this paper, we present a hybrid unsupervised clustering model, which comprises of Formal Concept Analysis, Self-Organizing Map and K-Means for managing ontological knowledge, and lexical matching based on Levenshtein edit distance for retrieving knowledge. The ontological knowledge management framework supports the tasks of adding a new ontological concept, updating and editing an existing ontological concept and querying ontological concepts to facilitate knowledge retrieval through conceptual clustering, cluster-based identification and concept-based query. The framework can be used to facilitate ontology reuse and ontological concept visualization and navigation in concept lattice form through the formal context space.

The infrared thermo-image analysis was tested as an innovative method by means of controlled and defined pre-field conditions. A feasibility study for assessing spray pattern on hedgerow crops is presented. Feasibility was assessed by measuring variations with different sprayer configurations and by comparison with a vertical patternator. Three trials were carried out by spraying water colder than the leaves on a hedge of Prunus laurocerasus. During the first trial, only static thermal images have been taken. In the successive trials, a complete thermal video of the same field of view (FOV) of the hedge was acquired before and after the spraying. A FLIRTM (S40) thermocamera was used. The distribution quality was compared to the temperature differences, obtained from the thermal images between pre-treatment and post-treatment (AT), according to two analysis: the time-trend of Delta T average values for different hedge heights and the imaging Delta T distribution and area coverage by segmentation in k means clustering after 30 s of spraying. The spraying determined a significant thermal reduction of the treated hedge which highest value was achieved after nearly 30 s (near to -8 degrees C). K means clustering allowed to represent water distribution in the hedge greyscale image considering that a whiter level identified an higher Delta T centroid value, that was in relationship with nozzle configuration used during the spraying. The distribution evaluated by means of the vertical patternator resulted correlated (r=0.75) with the thermo-image analysis.

EEG feature extraction for classifying emotions using FCM and FKM	RECENT ADVANCES IN SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTERS	ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING		English	Proceedings Paper	WSEAS Conference on Recent Advances in Systems, Communications and Computers	APR 06-08, 2008	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA			EEG; emotions; wavelet transform; Fuzzy C-Means clustering; Fuzzy k-Means clustering		The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the useful biosignals detect the human emotions. This paper discusses on a research conducted to determine the changes in the electrical activity of the human brain related to distinct emotions. We designed a competent acquisition protocol for acquiring the EEG signals under audio-visual induction environment. The EEG data has been collected from 6 healthy subjects with in an age group of 21-27 using 63 biosensors. From the subjective analysis on each emotion, three emotions have been identified with higher agreement. After preprocessing the signals, discrete wavelet transform is employed to extract the EEG parameters. The feature vectors derived from the above feature extraction method on 63 biosensors form an input matrix for emotion classification. In this work, we have used Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Fuzzy k-Means (FKM) clustering methods for classifying the emotions. We have also analyzed the performance of FCM and FKM on reduced number of 24 biosensors model. Finally, we compared the performance of clustering the discrete emotions using FCM and FKM on both 64 biosensors and 24 biosensors. Results confirm the possibility of using wavelet transform based feature extraction for assessing the human emotions from EEG signal, and of selecting a minimal number of channels for emotion recognition experiment.

For different purposes different clusters may highlight valuable aspects of the texts. Furthermore, standard corpora that are created for evaluating different clustering algorithms compare with standard IR corpora are small because so huge amount of human judgment is needed. We introduce a simple and applicable framework for evaluating clustering algorithms and present a way to compare our results with previous researches. The benefit of this approach is that no specific corpus is needed and we can use any standard and large IR collections to evaluate different clustering algorithms semantically.

Applying multiple correspondence and cluster K-means analysis to the data gathered from the ISSP European survey "Religion-II", a new typology based on five basic cultural positions has been developed: religious; believers; sceptics; agnostics and atheists. These results show the quantitative extent and the qualitative importance of scepticism. Through an interpretation of the contents of each type, it shows that the scepticism regarding both religious and secular world views represents, at this particular moment in time, an essential key to European culture. We cannot affirm that there is a return to religious matters, but it is clear that the secularisation process has lost some of its original strength. Post-modern Europe is immersed in a cultural crossroads, and will have to decide about its future. The article ends by showing the three possible strategies for settling the doubt: the Kierkegaardian resolution, whereby Europeans will take up either exclusive religious or secular positions; the Borgian solution, whereby religious and secular content and forms will be hybridized; and the Hegelian dissolution, through which Europe may possibly develop a new cultural synthesis built from the remains of the old secular and religious world views.

A DISTANCE-TYPE ANALYSIS	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING			English	Article						business risk; convergence; clusters; Eastern European Enlargement	QUANTIZATION	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of 2004 accession to the European Union on perceptions related to business risks in Central and Eastern European countries. The investigation makes use of the data provided by the Regular Reports on Global Competitiveness published annually by the World Economic Forum. Methodologically, our analysis requires the estimation of an average for the core of 15 member states of the European Union (EU 15) for each individual pillar considered to describe properly the business environment. In doing so, it is possible to measure the convergence - in terms of a distance-type analysis - of the new member states with the average of EU 15, prior and after the accession, comparatively. In addition, based on a k-means clustering technique, we investigate similarities between the same countries, as well as the convergence of different groups of countries with the group which contains this average.

In many applications, the membership of some of the objects to a cluster can be ambiguous. Therefore, an ability to specify membership to multiple clusters can be useful in real world applications. Fuzzy clustering makes it possible to specify the degree to which a given object belongs to a cluster. In Rough set representations, an object may belong to more than one cluster, which is more flexible than the conventional crisp clusters and less verbose than the fuzzy clusters. The unsupervised nature of fuzzy and rough algorithms means that there is a choice about the level of precision depending on the choice of parameters. This paper describes how one can vary the precision of the rough set clustering and studies its effect on synthetic and real world data sets.

On the one hand concepts to deal with uncertainty - like probability, fuzzy set or rough set theory - play a major role in the description of real life problems. On the other hand many real life situations are characterized by constant change - the structure of the data changes. For example, the characteristics of the customers of a retailer may change due to changing economical parameters (increasing oil prices etc.). Obviously the retailer has to adapt his customer classification regularly to the new situations to remain competitive. To deal with these changes dynamic data mining has become increasingly important in several practical applications. In our paper we utilize rough set theory to deal with uncertainty and suggest an engineering like approach to dynamic clustering that is based on rough k-means.

This paper addresses the problem of combining the concept of rough sets and entropy measure in the area of image segmentation. In the present study, comprehensive investigation into rough set entropy based thresholding image segmentation techniques has been performed. Segmentation presents the low-level image transformation routine concerned with image partitioning into distinct disjoint and homogenous regions with thresholding algorithms most often applied in practical solutions when there is pressing need for simplicity and robustness. Simultaneous combining entropy based thresholding with rough sets results in rough entropy thresholding algorithm. In the present paper, new algorithmic schemes Standard RECA (Rough Entropy Clustering Algorithm) and Fuzzy RECA in the area of rough entropy based partitioning routines have been proposed. Rough entropy clustering incorporates the notion of rough entropy into clustering model taking advantage of dealing with some degree of uncertainty in analyzed data. Both Standard and Fuzzy RECA algorithmic schemes performed usually equally robustly compared to standard k-means algorithm. At the same time, in many runs yielding slightly better performance making possible future implementation in clustering applications.

Through using Mercer kernel functions, samples in the original space were mapped into a high-dimensional feature space, which the difference among these samples in sample space was strengthened through kernel mapping, combining rough set with k-means to cluster in feature space. These samples were assigned into up-approximation or low-approximation of corresponding clustering centers, and then these data that were in up-approximation and low-approximation were combined and to update cluster center. Through this method, clustering precision was improved, clustering convergence speed was fast compared with classical clustering algorithms The results of simulation experiments show the feasibility and effectiveness of the kernel clustering algorithm.

In the context of uncertain data management, there has been a growing interest in clustering uncertain data. In particular, the classic K-means clustering algorithm has been recently adapted to handle uncertain data. However, the centroid-based partitional clustering approach used in the adapted K-means presents two major weaknesses that are related to: (i) an accuracy issue, since cluster centroids are computed as deterministic objects using the expected values of the pdfs of the Clustered objects; and, (ii) an efficiency issue, since the expected distance between uncertain objects and cluster centroids is computationally expensive. In this paper, we address the problem of clustering uncertain data by proposing a K-medoids-based algorithm, called UK-medoids, which is designed to overcome the above issues. In particular, our UK-medoids algorithm employs distance functions properly defined for uncertain objects, and exploits a K-medoids scheme. Experiments have shown that UK-medoids outperforms existing algorithms from an accuracy viewpoint while achieving reasonably good efficiency.

Electricity demand is influenced (among other things) by the day of the week, the time of year and special periods and/or days such as Ramadhan, all of which must be identified prior to modeling. This identification, known as day-type identification, must be included in the modeling stage either by segmenting the data and modeling each day-type separately or by including the day-type as an input. This paper investigates day-type identification approach for Algerian electricity load Kohonen maps are used to identify day-types. The K-Means clustering method will be used as a complementary method to precisely identify the obtained classes. Clustering validity is done by using a criteria measurement of quality. This work has allowed the identification of six different classes.

The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) has been used to group the data and produce the meteorological prototypes. The number of prototypes of SOM is large, to facilitate quantitative analysis of the map and the data similar units need to be grouped (clustered). As a second clustering stage k-means algorithm has been used to cluster the SOM units. Quantitative (using two categories of validity indices) and qualitative criteria were introduced to verify the results of the clustering. The different experiments developed extracted six distinct classes, which were related to typical meteorological conditions in the area.

We present the enhanced tracking of two hands based on a statistical model using only a skin colour feature with particle filtering for gesture recognition. Our framework employs one particle filter per hand individually with the pixel-wise classification of the likelihood of the skin in the window search. The skin classifier decision was trained from a set of skin samples in YCrCb space using an elliptical model. The tracking scheme employs a reliability measurement derived from the particle distribution which is used to adaptively weight the colour classification. The K-means algorithm is used to discriminate the split and merge between left and right hand. Experiments with a set of videos including the movement of two hands in cluttered backgrounds show that adaptive use of our scheme provides improvement compared to use with other techniques such as mean-shift tracking.

Exploiting the duality between objects and features efficiently helps in better clustering both objects and features. In contrast with current co-clustering algorithms that focus on directly finding some patterns in the data matrix, in this paper we define a (co-)similarity measure, named chi-Sim, which iteratively computes the similarity between objects and their features. Thus, it becomes possible to use any clustering methods (k-means, ...) to co-cluster data. The experiments show that our algorithm not only outperforms the classical similarity measure but also outperforms some co-clustering algorithms on the document-clustering task.

The initial set is subdivided into two subsets whose centroids are farthest from each other, and the process is repeated recursively on each subset. An approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the original integer programming problem which is NP-hard. Experimental evidence shows that the clustering method often outperforms a standard spectral clustering method, albeit at a slightly higher computational cost. The paper also discusses improvements of the standard K-means algorithm. Specifically, the clustering quality resulting from the K-means technique can be significantly enhanced by using the proposed algorithm for its initialization.

The collaboration was formed to study the problem of open ocean biome classification. Biomes are regions on Earth with similar climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) and vegetation structure (e.g., grasslands, coniferous forests, and deserts). To discover biomes in the open ocean, we apply leading methods in high dimensional data analysis, clustering, and visualization to oceanographic measurements culled from multiple existing databases. We compare traditional approaches, such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis, to newer approaches such as Isomap and maximum variance unfolding. Our work provides the first quantitative classification of open ocean biomes from an automated statistical analysis of multivariate data.

The connotation of urban logistic capability (ULC) is analyzed in this paper. Compared with the extensive research on ULC in developed world, empirical work is still rare in developing world. In this paper four categories ULI of China are firstly overviewed, then a new evaluation index system for ULC evaluation is set up which contains factors that reflect the market supply and demand, economic development and transportation accessibility. Thirdly, an empirical study is carried out based on K-Means cluster analysis to classify ULC into 3 clusters for 30 cities in China. Fourthly, after comparing different ULC of 30 cities in China, this paper focuses on that different logistics infrastructure including Hub, Central Distribution Center & Cross Docking Center, Regional Distribution Center & Distribution Center should be build reasonably. Finally, we draw some good conclusions for improving ULC and make suggestions for future study.

SURFACE MESH SMOOTHING, REGULARIZATION, AND FEATURE DETECTION	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						multiscale anisotropic Laplacian; umbrella operator; mesh regularization; crease detection; mesh segmentation; K-means clustering	ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION; SEGMENTATION; CUTS	We describe a hybrid algorithm that is designed to reconstruct a piecewise smooth surface mesh from noisy input. While denoising, our method simultaneously regularizes triangle meshes on flat regions for further mesh processing and preserves crease sharpness for faithful reconstruction. A clustering technique, which combines K-means and geometric a priori information, is first developed and refined. It is then used to implement vertex classification so that we can not only apply different smoothing operators on different vertex groups for different purposes, but also succeed in crease detection, where the tangent plane of the surface is discontinuous, without any significant cost increase. Consequently we are capable of efficiently obtaining different mesh segmentations, depending on user input and thus suitable for various applications.

By modifying the data coding-through use of less than full precision in data values-we can aid appreciably the e. ectiveness and efficiency of the hierarchical clustering. In our first application, this is used to lessen the quantity of data to be hierarchically clustered. The approach is a hybrid one, based on hashing and on the Ward minimum variance agglomerative criterion. In our second application, we derive a hierarchical clustering from relationships between sets of observations, rather than the traditional use of relationships between the observations themselves. This second application uses embedding in a Baire space, or longest common prefix ultrametric space. We compare this second approach, which is of O(nlogn) complexity, to k-means.

We achieve spatial fusion of uncertain position estimates of disparate objects. These objects are portions of larger assemblies that cannot be directly observed by available sensors. Only the individual objects are discernable. The question arises how to fuse estimates of position uncertainty of these objects (potential assembly pieces) into an "assembly" whose location and extent can only be inferred. Our algorithm uses spatial correlation and stacking with voting of positional uncertainty ellipses. We present the positional algorithm and compare it to other methods of grouping uncertainties and find encouraging improved performance.

Texture or color analysis in agronomic images for wheat ear counting	SITIS 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGIES & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Based Systems	DEC 16-19, 2007	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Shanghai Jiatong Univ, SIGAPP fr			CLASSIFICATION	In agronomy, image processing techniques are more and more used to detect crop, weeds, diseases. We proposed to study the feasibility to use color and/or texture analysis to evaluate the number of wheat ears per m(2) to simplify the manual countings currently done. In this paper we present firstly the use of color and texture image processing together to detect the ears, before to propose and compare different texture image segmentation techniques based on feature extraction by first and higher order statistical methods. The extracted features are used for unsupervised pixel classification to obtain the different classes in the image, before to use the k-means algorithm. Three methods have been tested with very heterogeneous results, except the run length technique for which the results are close to the manual countings (66% error). The hypothesis took into account for the textural analysis methods are currently modify to justify them more accurately, especially concerning the number of classes and the size of the analysis window.

The relevancy of such multidimensional structure comes from the set of physical information they carry about the local nature of the target. The admissibility constraints imposed on these images make awkward their analysis and processing and prevent to explore their richness. This induces the need for a proper tool that allows the analysis and processing of polarization-encoded images. In this paper we address a new method to segment Mueller imaging and use the geometric algebra to represent the polarization formalism and segment polarization-encoded images while respecting their physical meaning. The segmentation task is based on the Fuzzy K-mean algorithm.

The use of NMF in the ping-pong strategy can be expected effective for document clustering. However, NMF in the ping-pong strategy often worsens performance because NMF often fails to improve the clustering result given as the initial values. Our method handles this problem with the stop condition of the ping-pong process. In the experiment, we compared our method with the k-means and NMF by using 16 document data sets. Our method improved the clustering result of NMF significantly.

However, spectral clustering needs to solve an eigenvalue problem of the matrix converted from the similarity matrix corresponding to the data set. Therefore, it is not practical to use spectral clustering for a large data set. To overcome this problem, we propose the method to reduce the similarity matrix size. First, using k-means, we obtain a clustering result for the given data set. From each cluster, we pick up some data, which are near to the central of the cluster. We take these data as one data. We call these data set as "committee." Data except for committees remain one data. For these data, we construct the similarity matrix. Definitely, the size of this similarity matrix is reduced so much that we can perform spectral clustering using the reduced similarity matrix	[Shinnou, Hiroyuki; Sasaki, Minoru] Ibaraki Univ, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan		shinnou@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp; msasaki@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp					Berry M., 2003, SURVEY TEXT MINING C; Dhillon Inderjit, 2005, TR0425 U TEX AUST DE; Dhillon IS, 2002, 2002 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS, P131, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2002.1183895; Ding Chris, 2001, 47848 LAWR BERK NAT; Hearst Marti A., 1996, P 19 ANN INT ACM SIG, DOI 10.1145/243199.243216; Kummamuru Krishna, 2004, P 13 INT C WORLD WID, P658, DOI 10.1145/988672.988762; Liu TY, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4425, P319; Pantel P., 2002, P SIGIR 02	8	1	1	EUROPEAN LANGUAGE RESOURCES ASSOC-ELRA	PARIS	55-57, RUE BRILLAT-SAVARIN, PARIS, 75013, FRANCE							2008							201	204				4	Linguistics	Linguistics	BGS66	WOS:000324028900043

Non-stationary spatial covariance structure estimation in oversampled domains by cluster differences scaling with spatial constraints	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						multidimensional scaling; k-means clustering; analysis of dispersion; spatiotemporal processes; non-stationarity	SAMPLING DESIGN; PREDICTION	In the analysis of spatiotemporal processes underlying environmental studies, the estimation of the non-stationary spatial covariance structure is a well known issue in which multidimensional scaling (MDS) provides an important methodological approach (Sampson and Guttorp in J Am Stat Assoc 87:108-119, 1992). It is also well known that approximating dispersion by a non-metric MDS procedure offers, in general, low precision when accurate differences in spatial dispersion are needed for interpolation purposes, specially if a low dimensional configuration is employed besides a high number of stations in oversampled domains. This paper presents a modification, consisting of including geographical spatial constraints, of Heiser and Groenen's (Psychometrika 62:63-83, 1997) cluster differences scaling algorithm by which not the original stations but the cluster centres can be represented, while the stations and clusters retain their spatial relationships. A decomposition of the sum of squared dissimilarities into contributions from several sources of variation can be employed for an exploratory diagnosis of the model. Real data are analyzed and differences between several cluster-MDS strategies are discussed.

In detail, given a set of labeled videos (such as news. sitcoms, sports, etc.), our objective is to classify a new video into one of these categories. To solve this problem, a novel audio features based video classification method combining an unsupervised generative model named probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) with a multi-class discriminative classifier is proposed. Since general audio signals usually show complicated distribution in the feature space, k-means clustering method is firstly used to group temporal signal segments with similar low-level features into natural clusters, which are adopted as "audio words". Then, the audio stream of a video is decomposed into a bag of "audio words". To classify those bags of "audio words" which extracted from videos, latent "topics" are discovered by pLSA, and subsequently, training a multi-class classifier on the "topic" distribution vector for each video. Encouraging classification results have been achieved in Our experiments.

J	Tsai, MC; Liao, CH; Han, CS				Tsai, Ming-Chih; Liao, Chun-Hua; Han, Chia-shing			Risk perception on logistics outsourcing of retail chains: model development and empirical verification in Taiwan	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Distribution management; Risk management; Analytical hierarchy process	TRANSACTION COST APPROACH; INFORMATION; BENEFITS; DECISION; PERFORMANCE; CAPABILITY; FIRMS	Purpose - This paper aims to develop a qualitative risk model to empirically identify the important outsourcing risks of logistical functions using the data of Taiwanese retail chains. Design/methodology/approach - Transaction cost theory (TCT) and resourced based view (RBV) were combined to develop risk events. Analytical hierarchy process was used for risk calibration. Valid data from 75 outsourcer chains and 41 in-house chains were collected through a three-stage survey. Outsourcers were further clustered by risk perception using Wards' and K-mean clustering and examined by an ANOVA. Results of outsourcers and in-house chains were compared using nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test. Findings - The risk perception increases as the number of functions outsourced increases. Risks related to transaction costs and strategic resources were both significant. Of the three main risks identified, asset risk and competence risk are more serious concerns than relationship risk. The values of information risk and loss of control account for the bulk of asset risk, while those of poor competence leverage and poor competence in supporting customer service comprise competence risk. Finally, in terms of risk priority, in-house chains showed no significant difference from outsourcers. Research limitation/implication - interrelationships between risk events were limited to avoid complication. Also, due to the sample limit, the risks calibrated may be more associated with outsourcing execution than outsourcing building/abandoning. Practical implication - The risk structure developed herein can be used as a systematic checklist for outsourcing decision-making. The qualitative results may provide specific indications for further risk analysis and future risk control. Originality/value - The study fills a gap in the literature, where prior work has seldom used empirical research to compare how well TCT and the RBV predict logistics outsourcing risk, in particular for the distribution side of the supply chain.

We propose, implement, and evaluate several schemes that combine partitioning and hierarchical algorithms, specifically k-means and principal direction divisive partitioning (PDDP). Using available theory regarding the solution of the clustering indicator vector problem, we use 2-means to induce partitionings around fixed or varying cut-points. 2-means is applied either on the data or over its projection on a one-dimensional subspace. These techniques are also extended to the case of PDDP(l), a multiway clustering algorithm generalizing PDDR To handle data that do not lend themselves to linear separability, the algebraic framework is established for a kernel variant, KPDDR Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of the above methods and suggest that it is advantageous to steer PDDP using k-means. It is also shown that KPDDP can provide results of superior quality than kernel k-means.

When the dataset is large and does not fit into available memory, one has to compress the dataset to make the application of clustering algorithms possible. The balanced iterative reducing and clustering algorithm (BIRCH) is designed to operate under the assumption that "the amount of memory available is limited, whereas the dataset can be arbitrarily large" [ZRL97]. The algorithm generates a compact dataset summary minimizing the I/O cost involved. The summaries contain enough information to apply the well-known k-means clustering algorithm to the set of summaries and to generate partitions of the original dataset. (See [BFR981 for an application of quadratic batch k-means, and [KT06] for an application of k-means with Bregman distances to summaries.) An application of k-means requires an initial partition to be supplied as an input. To generate a "good" initial partition of the summaries, this chapter suggests a clustering algorithm, PDsDP, motivated by PDDP [Bo198]. We report preliminary numerical experiments involving sequential applications of BIRCH, PDsDP, and k-means/deterministic annealing to the Enron email dataset.

With the aim to enhance fitting design of athletic girdles, we have analyzed the influence of static and dynamic anthropometric data on the structure of athletic girdles. 512 female subjects, aged 20-35 years, were measured by three-dimensional body scanning system ([TC2], USA) under the static state. 30 subjects were measured by two-dimensional manual measurements under the dynamic state. Through using principal components analysis and K-means cluster analysis, we present a new classification of lower body measurements. The body shape analysis was useful for designers to draft the pattern of basic girdles. The result of the present work imply that a new method combining size fit with the freedom of movement is the key to create optimal athletic girdle and realize ergonomic designs.

Many artificial intelligence techniques have been used to solve credit scoring. The paper is to build a classification model based on a decision tree by learning historical data. Clustering algorithm and genetic algorithm are combined to further improve the accuracy of this credit scoring model. The clustering algorithm aims at removing noise data, while the genetic algorithm is used to reduce the redundancy attribute of data. The computational results on the two real world benchmark data sets show that the presented hybrid model is efficient.

Distributed Clustering for Data Sources with Diverse Schema	Third 2008 International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology, Vol 1, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology (ICCIT 2008)	NOV 11-13, 2008	Busan, SOUTH KOREA			Distributed Clustering; Global Centroid; Diverse Schema; K-Means; Local Centroid		Many enterprises incorporate information gathered from a variety of data sources into an integrated input for some learning task. For example, aiming towards the design of an automated diagnostic tool for some diseases, one may wish to integrate data gathered from many different hospitals. Analyzing and mining these distributed heterogeneous data sources require distributed machine learning and data mining technique In this paper, a Modified Distributed Combining Algorithm is proposed to cluster disparate data sources having diverse, possibly overlapping set of features and also need not share objects. First, all objects located at local sites are grouped using K-Means/Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm and resulting centroid is considered as local models. Then, the set of centroids are transformed into unified structure and optimum values are assigned to missing attributes. Finally, global cluster centroid is computed to identify global cluster model based on cluster ensemble and centroid mapping. The experiments are carried out for various datasets of UCI machine learning data repository in order to achieve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	[Visalakshi, N.

To overcome this situation, we propose an effective prediction method which adopts data preprocessing and multiple model TS fuzzy predictors combined with model selection mechanism. The proposed method uses the differences of time series as predictor input instead of the original ones because the difference data can stabilize the statistical characteristics of those time series and reveals better their implicit properties. In data preprocessing procedure, the candidates of optimal difference interval are determined based on the correlation analysis, and corresponding difference data sets are generated for them. And then, TS fuzzy predictors are constructed for multiple model bank, where k-means clustering algorithm is used for fuzzy partition of input space, and the least squares method is applied to parameter identification of fuzzy rules. Among the predictors in the model bank, the best one which minimizes the performance index is selected and it works on hereafter for prediction. Finally, the error compensation procedure based on correlation analysis is added to improve the prediction accuracy. Computer simulation on some typical examples is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Beriplex (R) P/N is a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) that has been developed for the rapid reversal of anticoagulation in patients requiring immediate haemostatic control. Beriplex P/N contains high concentrations of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X, together with the inhibitors protein C and protein S, and it can be rapidly prepared and administered at an infusion rate of up to 8.0 mL/min. The efficacy of Beriplex P/N in patients requiring emergency reversal of oral anticoagulation has been demonstrated in a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study involving 43 patients; 17 with acute bleeding and 26 requiring emergency surgery. Beriplex P/N was administered at a dose of 25-50IU/kg, according to baseline international normalised ratio (INR) in conjunction with vitamin K. Mean INR 30 minutes post-infusion was 1.18, and 93% of patients achieved an INR of <= 1.3. Clinical efficacy was rated as satisfactory or very good in 98% of patients. Therapy was found to be well tolerated. There were no adverse events related to the rapid rate of infusion and, of the 8 serious adverse events reported; only 1 was regarded as being possibly related to treatment. No virus transmission was observed and changes in thrombogenicity markers were found to be transient and did not correspond to any clinically observed thromboembolic events. In conclusion, Beriplex P/N is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for rapid, complete and predictable reversal of anticoagulation in patients with acute bleeding or requiring emergency surgery.

Real-Time Vehicle Classification Using Inductive Loop Signature Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Vehicle class is an important characteristic of traffic measurement, and classification information can contribute to many important applications in various transportation fields. For instance, vehicle classification is helpful in monitoring heavy vehicle traffic for road maintenance and safety, modeling traffic flow, and obtaining performance measurements based on each vehicle class for traffic surveillance. A real-time vehicle classification model was introduced. A heuristic method combined with decision tree and K-means clustering approaches was proposed to develop the vehicle classification model. The features used in the proposed model were extracted from piecewise slope rate values, which were obtained from single-loop inductive signature data. Three vehicle classification schemes-FHWA, FHWA-I, and Real-time Traffic Performance Measurement System-and a data set obtained from square single-loop detectors were used for model development. A data set obtained from round single-loop detectors was applied to test the transferability of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that the proposed real-time vehicle classification model is not only capable of categorizing vehicle types on the basis of the FHWA scheme but also is capable of grouping vehicles into more detailed classes. The classification model can successfully classify vehicles into 15 classes using single-loop detector data without any explicit axle information. In addition, the advantages of the proposed vehicle classification model are its simplicity, its use of the current detection infrastructure, and its enhancement of the use of single-loop detectors for vehicle classification. The initial results also suggest the potential for transferability of the vehicle classification approach and are very encouraging.

Over the last 20 years, the increase in crime has become a problem in the majority of the world's largest cities. Crimes are social nuisance and cost our societies dealing with in several ways. In urban management, law enforcement implies police force, which is responsible for the maintenance of law and order. Most law enforcement agencies today are faced with enormous quantities of data that must be processed and turned into useful information. This paper attempts to implement clustering algorithm as a data mining approach to assist detecting the crime patterns and speed up the process of responding to the crime. We have looked at k-means clustering with some enhancements to aid the process of identification of crime patterns. In this paper the benefits of using Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) to study the high potential crime risk areas has been successfully tested in Tehran using spatial data mining. The achieved results illustrated partitioning of the study area into difference levels of crime-prone locations to be monitored by police force.

J	Boschken, HL				Boschken, Herman L.			A multiple-perspectives construct of the American global city	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article							WORLD CITIES; NETWORK; GLOBALIZATION; POLARIZATION; SYSTEMS; STADIA; POWER	The term 'global city' bestows an image of an urban place that is contemporary, international, multicultural, 'wired', cosmopolitan, polarising and having geographically boundless power. Nevertheless, the literature fails to produce a common identity for setting the global city apart empirically and in analysing policy issues related to it. This paper argues and tests the proposition that the global city is better described and analysed from a holistic construct of competing perspectives. To do this, it: identifies seven global city dimensions; subjects the dimensions to a principal components analysis; and, uses the resulting composite factor to drive a K- means cluster analysis to differentiate 53 US urbanised areas. The results identify significant clusters that set apart global cities and provide a broadened base for cross-disciplinary comparative urban research.

It is based on statistical classification, differential geometry, and multiresolution representation. The Expectation Maximization algorithm and k-means clustering are applied to generate an initial mask of tissue classes of data volume. Then, a hierarchical multiresolution representation is applied to simplify processing. The idea is that the low-resolution description is used to determine constraints for the segmentation at the higher resolutions. Our contribution is the design of a pipeline procedure for brain characterization/labeling by using discrete curvature and multiresolution representation. We have tested our method on several MRI data.

Results obtained from different image search engines using simple keywords are filtered, and it is possible to select images viewing a single object owning a well-defined contour. In order to have a large set of valid images, the implemented system uses lexical web databases (e.g. WordNet) or free web encyclopedias (e.g. Wikipedia), to get more keywords correlated to the given object. The shapes extracted from selected images are represented by Fourier descriptors, and are grouped by K-means algorithm. Finally, the more representative shapes of main clusters are considered as prototypical contours of the object. Preliminary experimental results are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Unlike the K-means and LBG Vector Quantization algorithms, VQIT has a physical interpretation and relies on minimization of quantization error in an efficient way. Vector Quantization based Speaker Verification has proven to be successful; usually a codebook is trained to minimize the quantization error for the data from an individual speaker. In this paper we use a set of 36 speakers from TIMIT database and evaluate MFCC and LPC coefficients of speech samples and later apply it to the K-means Vector Quantization, LBG Vector Quantization and VQIT Vector Quantization and suggest that VQIT performs better than other VQ implementations. We also obtain the results from the GMM classifier for the similar coefficient data and compare it to the VQIT.

Face detection and recognition is one of the challenging research areas in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we present a method to identify skin pixels from still and video images using skin color. Face regions are identified from this skin pixel region. Facial features such as eyes, nose and mouth are then located. Faces are recognized from color images using an RBF based neural network. K means clustering algorithm is used to locate different facial elements. Orientation is corrected by using eyes. Parameters like inter eye distance, nose length, mouth position, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients etc. are computed and used for a Radial Basis Function (RBF) based neural network. This approach reliably works for face sequence with orientation in head, expressions etc.	[Praseeda, Lekshmi., V] Coll Engn Kidangoor, Kottayam, Kerala, India	Praseeda, LV (reprint author), Coll Engn Kidangoor, Kottayam, Kerala, India.	vplekshmi@yahoo.com; drmsasikumar@yahoo.com; divyasvidya@yahoo.co.in					BARTLETT MS, 2002, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V113; CHELLAPPA R, 1995, P IEEE, V83, P705, DOI 10.1109/5.381842; FAGGIAN N, FACE RECOGNITION VID; Gorodnichy D.

In accordance with the literature, we expected flexibility of coping styles to be associated with beneficial health-related outcomes. In a cross-sectional design a frequently applied stress coping questionnaire (SVF) with five subscales and an additional self-developed scale served to assess habitually applied coping strategies. Health-related outcome measures consisted of ICD-10 diagnoses and various self-rating instruments. A total of 145 teachers with relatively homogeneous but elevated levels of professional strain participated in the study. Data analysis relied on hierarchic (Ward) and iterative (k-means) cluster analyses as well as on ANOVAs. The analysis identified three coping clusters with high internal stability called flexible compensation, inconsistent compensation, and ruminative self-isolation. Inspection of the clusters revealed their association with health-related variables. Most beneficial values were found in the flexible compensation group regarding ICD-10 diagnoses, well-being, job satisfaction, depression, burnout and subjective prognosis of gainful employment, confirming our expectations. Inspection of coping patterns contributes to the identification of health-related outcomes. An analysis of coping patterns instead of single coping strategies may widen our perspective on the relationship between occupational stress and health.

J	Zimmermann, HW				Zimmermann, Herbert W.			Quantum thermodynamics of the spontaneous approach to the equilibrium state - irreversible exponential decay of a discrete quantum state of entropy production into a continuum	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHYSIKALISCHE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						quantum thermodynamics of an isolated system; dynamic equation; temporal evolution o entropy and entropy production if; exponential decay and irreversibility		We consider the temporal evolution of the entropy S of an isolated system from an initial non-equilibrium state of entropy S = S-i to the equilibrium state of maximum entropy S = S-max > Si. The application of usual density matrix theory of quantum mechanics leads us to the surprising result P = dS/dt = 0. The entropy does not change in time. This result is valid in case of the equilibrium state. However it is wrong for a non-equilibrium state, because the entropy of the isolated system could not spontaneously increase from S-i to S-max by entropy production P > 0. This contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. We avoid this discrepancy by changing from quantum mechanics to quantum thermodynamics. Now the entropy production P = dS/dt and the time t are the relevant observables. In order to treat the temporal development of S and P, we at first prepare an initial state i of entropy production P-i at time t < 0. Subsequently at V t >= 0 the initial state i interacts with a continuum of final states f, which transfers the entropy production from i to f. The temporal evolution of the entropy production P(t) of our system is treated by means of the time-dependent perturbation theory. For that reason we split the operator of entropy production P = P-0 + W into two parts. The operator P-0 describes the unperturbed basic vectors of entropy production vertical bar i > and vertical bar f >, while the perturbation operator W determines the interaction between vertical bar i > and vertical bar f >. We expand the time-dependent state function < t vertical bar psi > of the isolated system into the complete set of stationary eigenvectors vertical bar i > and vertical bar f > and calculate the time-dependent expansion coefficients c(i)(t) and c(f, t) by means of the dynamic equation of quantum thermodynamics - i k (d/dt) < t vertical bar psi > = < t vertical bar P vertical bar psi >. Here k means the Boltzmann constant, which is characteristic of quantum thermodynamics and represents the atomic entropy unit. The expansion coefficients are given by a system of coupled differential equations, from which we deduce an integral-differential equation for the coefficient c(i)(t) of the initial state i. Unfortunately it has been impossible to obtain an analytic solution of the complicated equation. However approximations are available. Accordingly, in the vicinity of the equilibrium state, the probability of still finding the initial state i of entropy production P-i at time t is given by omega(i)(t) = vertical bar c(i)(t)vertical bar 2 = exp (-Lt). The rate constant L >= sigma depends on the density rho(P-f) of final states f of entropy production P-f near by P-i, and on the squared modulus of the perturbation matrix elements W-if = < i vertical bar W vertical bar f >, which determines the interaction between vertical bar i > and vertical bar f >. The entropyproduction P(t) = P-i omega(i)(t) = P-i exp (-VLt) of the isolated system decreases exponentially and irreversibly with proceeding time t. Its rate-determining step is the transfer of entropy production from i to f. The integral over the entropy production of the final states f vanishes. Therefore the continuum states f do not contribute to the total entropy production P(t). The temporal evolution of the entropy S(t) can easily be calculated by integration of P(t). In conclusion, the entropy production of a non-equilbrium state is finite P(t) > 0 and only vanishes in the case of the equilibrium state P(infinity) = 0. Thus, quantum thermodynamics agrees with the second law of thermodynamics.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.

A large amount of gene expression data even in time series are obtained by microarray technology. Finding gene clusters with similar functions and interconnecting genes by networks has an important role in mining biological gene functional analysis. In this paper, Two Phase Functional Clustering has been presented as a new approach in gene clustering. The proposed approach is based on finding functional patterns of time series gene expression data by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and K-means methods. The gene function similarities over a number of experimental conditions are extracted using Pearson correlation between expression patterns of genes. This leads to visualize genes interconnections.

Since traditional k-means algorithm is very time consuming for large disk resident data, sample based, out-of-core clustering techniques have gained high popularity recently. We have used the concept of elimination of measurement errors by averaging over a number of samples. Here, samples or original data set are chosen randomly, they are clustered individually, in association with a refinement technique, to produce a number of sets of refined cluster centers. Average of these refined centers are expected to form a near approximation of the true centers of the original data set. A comparison of the proposed method with some existing ones proves the efficiency and usefulness of the former.

In details the system architecture will be described, requirements to such a system will be identified and a solution developed at the Heinz Nixdorf Institute and Fraunhofer ALB (application center for logistic-oriented business administration) in Paderborn will be presented.

It enables some classical criteria such as the well-known k-means criterion to be explained. To classify the rows or the columns of a contingency table, an adapted version of k-means known as Mndki2, which uses the chi-square distance, can be used. Unfortunately, this simple, effective method which can be used jointly with correspondence analysis based on the same representation of the data, cannot be associated with a mixture model in the same way as the classical k-means algorithm. In this paper we show that the Mndki2 algorithm can be viewed as an approximation of a classifying version of the EM algorithm for a mixture of multinomial distributions. A comparison of the algorithms belonging in this context are experimentally investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose new optimization methods based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming for hierarchical clustering. A bilevel hierarchical clustering model is considered with different optimization formulations. They are all nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems for which we investigate attractive DC optimization Algorithms called DCA. Numerical results on some artificial and real-world databases are reported. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are more efficient than related existing methods.

J	Tang, J; Tao, J; Urakawa, H; Corander, J				Tang, Jing; Tao, Jinglun; Urakawa, Hidetoshi; Corander, Jukka			T-BAPS: A bayesian statistical tool for comparison of microbial communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) data	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian modelling; Markov chain Monte Carlo; microbial communities; T-RFLP; unsupervised classification	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CHARACTERIZING DIVERSITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MODELS; COMPLEXITY; PROFILES	The investigation of microbial communities is an essential part of the study of the biosphere. Flexible molecular fingerprinting tools such as terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis are often applied in the studies to enable the characterization of the microbial population. However, such data have so far been primarily analyzed using conventional clustering methods. Here we introduce a Bayesian model-based method for the purpose of comparing microbial communities using T-RFLP data. Such datasets have in general several challenging features, e.g. sparseness, missing values and structurally zero-valued observations. These features are taken into account by developing a Bayesian latent class mixture model for the observations in our framework. To make inferences under the model we use a recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) -based method for the Bayesian model selection. To assess the introduced method we analyze both simulated and real datasets. The simulations show that our approach compares preferably to standard statistical clustering tools, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and Autoclass. The developed tool is freely available as a software package T-BAPS.

For improving the generalization ability of support vector machine ensemble, a hybrid clustering algorithm which combines the SOM and K-means algorithm is used to select the most accurate individual support vector machine from every cluster for ensembling, which ensures accuracy of individual support vector machines and improves the diversity of the individual support vector machines. This method can improve support vector machine ensemble generalization ability effectively with low cost. To illustrate the performance of the proposed forecasting model, simulations on chaotic time series prediction of the Mackey-Glass time series and the time series generated by the Lorenz systems are performed. The results show that the chaotic time series are accurately predicted, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method.

This approach has been investigated as a mean of monitoring the change of the biochemical composition of cells and providing a diagnostic tool for various human cancers and other diseases. The discrimination between different types of tissue based upon spectroscopic data is often achieved using various multivariate clustering techniques. However, the number of clusters is a common unknown feature for the clustering methods, such as hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means and fuzzy c-means. In this study, we apply a FCM based clustering algorithm to obtain the best number of clusters as given by the minimum validity index value. This often results in an excessive number of clusters being created due to the complexity of this biochemical system. A novel method to automatically merge clusters was developed to try to address this problem. Three lymph node tissue sections were examined to evaluate our new method. These results showed that this approach can merge the clusters which have similar biochemistry. Consequently, the overall algorithm automatically identifies clusters that accurately match the main tissue types that are independently determined by the clinician.

Independent component analysis and clustering improve signal-to-noise ratio for statistical analysis of event-related potentials	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ICA; signal-to-noise ratio; effect size; channel pooling; N170	EEG DYNAMICS; BRAIN; MODEL; MISALLOCATION; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; VARIANCE; ACCOUNT	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new method of using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of Event-Related Potential (ERP) measurements while permitting standard statistical comparisons to be made despite the inter-subject variations characteristic of ICA. Methods: Per-subject ICA results were used to create a channel pool, with unequal weights, that could be applied consistently across subjects. Signals derived from this and other pooling schemes, and from unpooled electrodes, were subjected to identical statistical analysis of the N170 own-face effect in a Joe/No Joe face recognition paradigm wherein participants monitored for a target face (Joe) presented amongst other unfamiliar faces and their own face. Results between the Joe, unfamiliar face and own face conditions were compared using Cohen's d statistic (square root of signal-to-noise ratio) to measure effect size. Results: When the own-face condition was compared to the Joe and unfamiliar-face conditions, the channel map method increased effect size by a factor ranging from 1.2 to 2.2. These results stand in contrast to previous findings, where conventional pooling schemes failed to reveal an N170 effect to the own-face stimulus (Tanaka JW, Curran T, Porterfield A, Collins D. The activation of pre-existing and acquired face representations: the N250 ERP as an index of face familiarity. J Cogn Neurosci 2006;18:1488-97). Consistent with conventional pooling schemes, the channel map approach showed no reliable differences between the Joe and Unfamiliar face conditions, yielding a decrease in effect size ranging from 0.13 to 0.75. Conclusions: By increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the measured waveforms, the channel pool method demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to the neurophysiological response to own-face relative to other faces. Significance: By overcoming the characteristic inter-subject variations of ICA, this work allows classic ERP analysis methods to exploit the improved signal-to-noise ratio obtainable with ICA.

However, the implementation of many of these techniques is challenging due to the fact that much of the data contained in today's databases is categorical in nature. While there have been recent advances in algorithms for clustering categorical data, some are unable to handle uncertainty in the clustering process while others have stability issues. This research proposes a new algorithm for clustering categorical data, termed Min-Min-Roughness (MMR), based on Rough Set Theory (RST), which has the ability to handle the uncertainty in the clustering process.

J	Gomes, H; Ribeiro, AB; Lobo, V				Gomes, Helena; Ribeiro, Alexandra B.; Lobo, Vitor			Location model for CCA-treated wood waste remediation units using GIS and clustering methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						CCA-treated wood waste; location models; self-organizing maps (SOM); K-means	ELECTRODIALYTIC REMEDIATION; ALLOCATION PROBLEMS; TIMBER WASTE; REMOVAL; CU; CR; OPTIMIZATION; MAPS	In the next decades, a significant increase is expected in the amounts of CCA-treated wood waste that annually need to be properly disposed. This waste should be recycled only after its remediation, so planning and optimisation of the remediation units location is of major importance. A location model for CCA-treated wood waste was implemented using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS 8.2), with geographic information, namely land use information and the results of a questionnaire sent to Portuguese wood preservation industries. Two different clustering methods (Self-Organizing Maps and K-means) were tested in different conditions to solve the multisource Weber problem using SOMToolbox for MATLAB. The solutions obtained with the data and with both clustering methods could be used to decide on the location of these plants. SOM provided more robust and reproducible results than K-means, with the disadvantage of longer computing times. The main advantage of K-means, compared to SOM, is the reduced computing time (considering an average of all the runs, the K-means computing time is half the SOM computing time) together with the fact that it allows to obtain the best solutions in the majority of the cases, in spite of bigger variances and more geographical dispersion.

Data collected from tracking 24 industrial fermentations of Cabernet sauvignon were used in this study to explore how useful is data mining to detect anomalous behaviors in advance. A database held periodic measurements of 29 components that included sugar, alcohols, organic acids and amino acids. Owing to the scale of the problem, we used a two-stage classification procedure. First PCA was used to reduce system dimensionality while preserving metabolite interaction information. Cluster analysis (K-Means) was then performed on the lower-dimensioned system to group fermentations into clusters of similar behavior. Numerous classifications were explored depending on the data used. Initially data from just the first three days were assessed, and then the entire data set was used. Information from the first three days' fermentation behavior provides important clues about the final classification. We also found a strong association between problematic fermentations and specific patterns found by the data mining tools. In short, data from the first three days contain sufficient information to establish the likelihood of a fermentation finishing normally. Results from this study are most encouraging. Data from many more fermentations and of different varieties needs to be collected, however, to develop a reliable and more broadly applicable diagnostic tool. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to analyse whether quality systems that include certain quality improvement designs differ with regard to organisational factors and degrees of organisation. A questionnaire was developed and sent to a random sample of 600 hospital departments in Sweden (response rate = 75%). A k-means cluster analysis was used to group departments into three degrees of organisation. Analyses of variance were done to study differences in organisational factors and quality improvement designs among the clusters. LISREL analyses were done to study the relationships between organisational factors and quality improvement designs. The results showed that quality systems that included certain quality improvement designs differed with regard to the organisational factors available resources, administration, culture, cooperation, and goal achievement. The results also showed that departments with quality systems of different organisational degrees used different quality improvement designs. Some quality improvement designs may require a quality system with a high degree of organisation to support a successful implementation. The appended questionnaire could be used to plan implementations and evaluate their results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Recupero, DR				Recupero, Diego Reforgiato			A new unsupervised method for document clustering by using WordNet lexical and conceptual relations	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						clustering; text documents; bisecting kappa-means; multipole; Antipole; WordNet		Text document clustering provides an effective and intuitive navigation mechanism to organize a large amount of retrieval results by grouping documents in a small number of meaningful classes. Many well-known methods of text clustering make use of a long list of words as vector space which is often unsatisfactory for a couple of reasons: first, it keeps the dimensionality of the data very high, and second, it ignores important relationships between terms like synonyms or antonyms. Our unsupervised method solves both problems by using ANNIE and WordNet lexical categories and WordNet ontology in order to create a well structured document vector space whose low dimensionality allows common clustering algorithms to perform well. For the clustering step we have chosen the bisecting k-means and the Multipole tree, a modified version of the Antipole tree data structure for, respectively, their accuracy and speed.

According to the properties of 3D points, e.g. the non-uniform distribution and unknown topology, an implicit surface model is adopted based on radial basis functions network. And because of the property of locality of radial basis function, the method is fast and robust in surface reconstruction. Furthermore, an adapted K-Means algorithm is used to reduce reconstruction centers. For features completeness, two effective methods are introduced to extract the feature points before the adapted K-Means algorithm. Experiment results show that the presented approach is a good solution for reconstruction from 3D large scattered points.

Guarding the gates of Europe: A typological analysis of immigration attitudes across 21 countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							INTERGROUP CONTACT; ETHNIC PREJUDICE; GROUP CONFLICT; INDIVIDUALISM; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; COLLECTIVISM; COMPETITION; OPPOSITION; DIMENSIONS	With data from the European Social Survey (N = 36,602), individual patterns of three immigration attitudes, referred to as gatekeeping attitudes, were investigated within and across 21 European national contexts. Gatekeeping attitudes, akin to blatant and subtle forms of xenophobia, designate the level of endorsement of different admission standards set for immigrants entering European countries, as well as of expulsion criteria for immigrants transgressing norms and laws. A K-means cluster analysis, performed on national majority members' scores of endorsement of individual (e.g., language and working skills) and categorical (e.g., skin colour, religion) entry criteria and individual expulsion criteria (e.g., criminal act, long-term unemployment), yielded a typology of three constrained combinations of these dimensions. Strict gatekeepers favoured all criteria, lenient gatekeepers opposed all criteria, whereas individualist gatekeepers favoured individual and opposed categorical criteria. Membership in typology groups was predicted with a generalized prejudiced attitude construct, social status, and personal contact with immigrants. Lenient gatekeepers were less homophobic, had a higher education level, felt financially less vulnerable, and had more immigrant friends than strict gatekeepers. Individualist gatekeepers held an intermediate position. Variability was observed in all countries, despite the prevalence of a typology group within a given country. Strict gatekeepers were common among participants from Southern and Eastern European nations, lenient gatekeepers in Scandinavian countries, and individualist gatekeepers in Western European countries. Cross-national differences are discussed in light of European immigration history and policies.	[Green, Eva G.

In IHGCA, the improvement operation including five local iteration methods is developed to tune the individual and accelerate the convergence speed of the clustering algorithm, and the partition-absorption mutation operation is designed to reassign objects among different clusters. By experimental simulations, its superiority over some known genetic clustering methods is demonstrated.

This is usually provided through voice calls-of late, web-chat based support is gaining prominence. In this paper, we consider any conversational text derived from web-chat systems, voice recognition systems etc., and propose a method to identify procedures that are embedded in the text. We discuss here how to use the identified procedures in knowledge authoring and agent prompting. In our experiments, we evaluate the utility of the proposed method for agent prompting. We first cluster the call transcripts to find groups of conversations that deal with a single topic. Then, we find possible procedure-steps within each topic-cluster by clustering the sentences within each of the calls in the topic-cluster. We propose a measure for differentiating between clusters that are procedure-steps and those that are topical sentence collections. Once we identify procedure-steps, we represent the calls as sequences of procedure-steps and perform mining to extract distinct and long frequent sequences which represent the procedures that are typically followed in calls. We show that the extracted procedures are comprehensive enough. We outline an approach for retrieving relevant procedures for a partially completed call and illustrate the utility of distinct collections of sequences in the real-world scenario of agent prompting using the retrieval mechanism.

Using a K-means clustering algorithm to examine patterns of pedestrian involved crashes in Honolulu, Hawaii	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						K-means clustering; pedestrian-involved crashes; visualizing spatial patterns	ACCIDENT	The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to describe a statistical technique known as K-means clustering in term of its advantages and disadvantages in safety research; and, 2) to use this method to analyze spatial patterns of pedestrian-involved crashes in Honolulu. K-means, a partitioning clustering technique, provides a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing spatial patterns. While there are other techniques, one of the advantages of the K-means approach is that it is a well established technique that has been used for many different applications other than traffic safety. In this paper, we compare it to hierarchical clustering techniques and suggest that both are useful in the arsenal of spatial analytic tools for safety research.

We propose a new method called the evolutionary Monte Carlo clustering (EMCC) algorithm, in which three new "crossover moves," based on swapping and reshuffling subcluster intersections, are proposed. We apply the EMCC algorithm to several clustering problems including Bernoulli clustering, biological sequence motif clustering, BIC based variable selection, and mixture of normals clustering. We compare EMCC's performance both as a sampler and as a stochastic optimizer with Gibbs sampling, "split-merge" Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, K-means clustering, and the MCLUST algorithm.

An adaptive method with integration of multi-wavelet based features for unsupervised classification of SAR images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						m-band wavelet packets; SAR images; neuro-fuzzy feature evaluation; texture segmentation; unsupervised classification	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION	In single band and single polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the information is limited to intensity and texture only and it is very difficult to interpret such SAR images without any a priori information. For unsupervised classification of SAR images, M-band wavelet decomposition is performed on the SAR image and sub-band selection on the basis of energy levels is applied to improve the classification results since sparse representation of sub-bands degrades the performance of classification. Then, textural features are obtained from selected sub-bands and integrated with intensity features. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy algorithm is used to improve computational efficiency by extracting significant features. K-means classification is performed on the extracted features and land features are labeled. This classification algorithm involves user defined parameters. To remove the user dependency and to obtain maximum achievable classification accuracy, an algorithm is developed in this paper for classification accuracy in terms of the parameters involved in the segmentation process. This is very helpful to develop the automated land-cover monitoring system with SAR, where optimized parameters are to be identified only once and these parameters can be applied to SAR imagery of the same scene obtained year after year.

J	Saegusa, T; Maruyama, T				Saegusa, Takashi; Maruyama, Tsutomu			An FPGA implementation of real-time K-means clustering for color images	JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						K-means clustering; Color images; Real-time; FPGA	ALGORITHM; HARDWARE	K-means clustering is a very popular clustering technique, which is used in numerous applications. In the k-means clustering algorithm, each point in the dataset is assigned to the nearest cluster by calculating the distances from each point to the cluster centers. The computation of these distances is a very time-consuming task, particularly for large dataset and large number of clusters. In order to achieve high performance, we need to reduce the number of the distance calculations for each point efficiently. In this paper, we describe an FPGA implementation of k-means clustering for color images based on the filtering algorithm. In our implementation, when calculating the distances for each point, clusters which are apparently not closer to the point than other clusters are filtered out using kd-trees which are dynamically generated on the FPGA in each iteration of k-means clustering. The performance of our system for 512 x 512 and 640 x 480 pixel images (24-bit full color RGB) is more than 30 fps, and 20-30 fps for 756 x 512 pixel images in average when dividing to 256 clusters.

A statistical appraisal of disproportional versus proportional microbial source tracking libraries	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH			English	Article						disproportional; library; microbial source tracking; proportional; statistics	ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE PATTERNS; EXTRAGENIC PALINDROMIC-PCR; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FECAL STREPTOCOCCI; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ANIMAL SOURCES; IDENTIFICATION; POLLUTION; WATERS	Library-based microbial source tracking (MST) can assist in reducing or eliminating fecal pollution in waters by predicting sources of fecal-associated bacteria. Library-based MST relies on an assembly of genetic or phenotypic "fingerprints" from pollution-indicative bacteria cultivated from known sources to compare with and identify fingerprints of unknown origin. The success of the library-based approach depends on how well each source candidate is represented in the library and which statistical algorithm or matching criterion is used to match unknowns. Because known source libraries are often built based on convenience or cost, some library sources may contain more representation than others. Depending on the statistical algorithm or matching criteria, predictions may become severely biased toward classifying unknowns into the library's dominant source category. We examined prediction bias for four of the most commonly used statistical matching algorithms in library-based MST when applied to disproportionately-represented known source libraries; maximum similarity (MS), average similarity (AS), discriminant analyses (DA), and k-means nearest neighbor (k-NN). MS was particularly sensitive to disproportionate source representation. AS and DA were more robust. k-NN provided a compromise between correct prediction and sensitivity to disproportional libraries including increased matching success and stability that should be considered when matching to disproportionally-represented libraries.

J	Bartzatt, R				Bartzatt, Ronald			Design and analysis of small-molecule antineoplastic agents targeting brain tumors by utilizing pattern recognition methods and in silico optimized pharmaceutical properties	MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article						anticancer; blood-brain barrier; multivariate; cluster analysis	DRUG-DELIVERY; SURFACE-AREA; TRANSPORT PHENOMENA; RAPID CALCULATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; BARRIER; PENETRATION; PREDICTION; CHILDREN; DESCRIPTORS	The purpose of this work is the in silico design and characterization of small-molecule anticancer agents that target the central nervous system. All agents are cytotoxic nitrogen mustard agents, a class of drugs widely used in the clinical treatment of cancer. Molecular properties such as polar surface area, log P, and formula weight have previously been shown to be highly useful properties to utilize in optimizing drug design for penetration of the blood-brain barrier and subsequently the central nervous system. These properties are rigorously applied in this work for compiling the actual molecular structures of the anticancer agents. In silico molecular modeling and pattern recognition methods such as cluster analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and K-means cluster analysis are applied to determine the importance of various pharmaceutical descriptors and interrelationships. Discriminant analysis of the molecular properties of 17 nitrogen mustard agents designed in this work determined the extent of dissimilarity among members of this group. Utilizing analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) on the ten pharmaceutical descriptors provides a discrete numerical result that indicates overall dissimilarity among these agents. K-means cluster analysis distinguished these agents into clusters of small, moderate, and high molecular weight. Discriminant analysis and cluster analysis generally discerned association of these 17 compounds on a basis of higher and lower formula weight criteria. Another pattern recognition method known as non-metric multidimensional scaling discerned finer associations that fell within categorizations by low, moderate, and higher formula weight. ANOSIM resulted in R = 0.5551, which indicates that there is a moderate level of dissimilarity within these brain-penetrating small anticancer agents. The use of in silico assisted drug design and multivariate analysis of these compounds discerned discrete interrelationships and information for evaluating potential clinical application.

J	Lolis, CJ				Lolis, Christos J.			Climatic features of atmospheric stability in the Mediterranean region (1948-2006): spatial modes, inter-monthly and inter-annual variability	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						K-index; Mediterranean sea; cluster analysis; factor analysis	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; SEVERE LOCAL STORMS; OBJECTIVE CLIMATOLOGY; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; CIRCULATION TYPES; CLASSIFICATION; THUNDERSTORMS; INDEXES; GREECE; WINTER	The predominant spatial modes of atmospheric stability over the Mediterranean region are revealed by applying factor analysis and cluster analysis on the daily 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees grid point values of K-index for the period 1948-2006 . At first, S-mode factor analysis is applied on the K-index time series in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data set. The k-means cluster analysis is then applied to the factor scores time series, and the days are classified into 12 clusters with distinct and characteristic spatial distributions of the K-index. The 12 spatial modes revealed are associated with the prevailing atmospheric circulation types and/or the thermal and humidity characteristics of the lower and the middle troposphere. The inter-monthly variations of their frequency reveal the seasonal factors that contribute to their predominance. The seasonality of the 12 clusters shows that three of them prevail mainly in winter, three of them prevail mainly in summer, and the other six clusters present a relatively even seasonal distribution. The inter-annual variations of their frequency exhibit considerable long-term changes, providing also some possible indications of the oncoming climatic change. The continuous decrease of the typical high instability pattern of late spring and early summer and the recent increase of one of the typical high instability winter patterns provide some useful information about climate variability in the Mediterranean.

Generalized multiscale radial basis function networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						model term selection; neural networks; nonlinear system identification; orthogonal least squares; radial basis functions	BASIS FUNCTION CENTERS; NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; TRAINING ALGORITHM; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; RBF NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; MODELS; REGULARIZATION	A novel modelling framework is proposed for constructing parsimonious and flexible multiscale radial basis function networks (RBF). Unlike a conventional standard single scale RBF network, where all the basis functions have a common kernel width, the new network structure adopts multiscale Gaussian functions as the bases, where each selected centre has multiple kernel widths, to provide more flexible representations with better generalization properties for general nonlinear dynamical systems. As a direct extension of the traditional single scale Gaussian networks, the new multiscale network is easy to implement and is quick to learn using standard learning algorithms. A k-means clustering algorithm and an improved orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm are used to determine the unknown paramenters in the network model including the centres and widths of the basis functions, and the weights between the basis functions. It is demonstrated that the new network can lead to a parsimonious model with much better generalization property compared with the traditional single width RBF networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bandyopadhyay, S; Saha, S				Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra; Saha, Sriparna			GAPS: A clustering method using a new point symmetry-based distance measure	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						unsupervised classification; genetic algorithm; symmetry; point symmetry-based distance; Kd-tree	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; FUZZY; PATTERNS	In this paper, an evolutionary clustering technique is described that uses a new point symmetry-based distance measure. The algorithm is therefore able to detect both convex and non-convex clusters. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used to reduce the complexity of finding the closest symmetric point. Adaptive mutation and crossover probabilities are used. The proposed GA with point symmetry (GAPS) distance based clustering algorithm is able to detect any type of clusters, irrespective of their geometrical shape and overlapping nature, as long as they possess the characteristic of symmetry. GAPS is compared with existing symmetry-based clustering technique SBKM, its modified version, and the well-known K-means algorithm. Sixteen data sets with widely varying characteristics are used to demonstrate its superiority. For real-life data sets, ANOVA and MANOVA statistical analyses are performed.

J	Wu, HM; Lu, HHS				Wu, Han-Ming; Lu, Henry Horng-Shing			Iterative sliced inverse regression for segmentation of ultrasound and MR images	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						unsupervised clustering; K-Means; dimension reduction; multidimensional scaling; sliced inverse regression; nearest mean classifier; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIMENSION REDUCTION; SNAKE MODEL; VISUALIZATION; NETWORKS	In this study, we propose an integrated approach based on iterative sliced inverse regression (ISIR) for the segmentation of ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) images. The approach integrates two stages. The first is the unsupervised clustering which combines multidimensional scaling (MDS) with K-Means. The dimension reduction based on MDS is employed to obtain fewer representative variates as input variables for K-Means. This step intends to generate the initial group labels of the training data for the second stage of supervised segmentation. We then combine the SIR with the nearest mean classifier (NMC) or the support vector machine (SVM) to iteratively update the group labels for supervised segmentation. The method of SIR is introduced by Li [Sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 86 (1991) 316-342] to explore the effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) directions from the training data embedded in high-dimensional space. The test data are then projected onto these directions and the classifiers are further applied to classify the test data. The integrated approach based on ISIR is evaluated on simulated and clinical images, which include ultrasound and MR images. The evaluation results indicate that this approach provides an improvement of image segmentation over the methods to be compared without dimension reduction. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.

J	Xiao, D; Ng, WS; Tsang, CB; Abeyratne, UR				Xiao, Di; Ng, Wan Sing; Tsang, Charles B.; Abeyratne, Udantha Ranjith			A region and gradient based active contour model and its application in boundary tracking on anal canal ultrasound images	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						active contour model; boundary tracking; anal ultrasound image; GMM	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; OPTICAL-FLOW; SEGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK	A novel Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based region and gradient active contour model is proposed for general object boundary tracking and the purpose of boundary tracking for anal muscle layers. Motion information is extracted from adjacent slice and is used to guide the first step of boundary tracking procedure. The idea is that GMM is introduced into the statistical feature computation for object region and background region, thereby providing an accurate model for regional pixel intensity description. Expectation-maximization algorithm and K-means algorithm are used for parameter solutions of GMM. Based on the available region information, gradient information and the self-constraints of the contour, a unifying active contour model is proposed. The proposed active contour models and tracking algorithm were tested on synthetic images and simulated ultrasound images to evaluate some generic features of the model for boundary tracking. Furthermore, it was applied to perform boundary tracking of anal muscle layers. The tracking results were evaluated by three experts. The results showed that the proposed method has a good performance for boundary tracking on anal wall ultrasound image. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Data mining: a tool for detecting cyclical disturbances in supply networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						data mining; supply chains; uncertainty; time series; spectral analysis; incremental k-means clustering; rule induction	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; INFORMATION DISTORTION; CLUSTERING METHODS; RULE INDUCTION; CHAIN; UNCERTAINTY; DEMAND	Disturbances in supply chains may be either exogenous or endogenous. The ability automatically to detect, diagnose, and distinguish between the causes of disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers in order to avoid uncertainty. The spectral principal component analysis (SPCA) technique has been utilized to distinguish between real and rogue disturbances in a steel supply network. The data set used was collected from four different business units in the network and consists of 43 variables; each is described by 72 data points. The present paper will utilize the same data set to test an alternative approach to SPCA in detecting the disturbances. The new approach employs statistical data pre-processing, clustering, and classification learning techniques to analyse the supply network data. In particular, the incremental k-means clustering and the RULES-6 classification rule-learning algorithms, developed by the present authors' team, have been applied to identify important patterns in the data set. Results show that the proposed approach has the capability automatically to detect and characterize network-wide cyclical disturbances and generate hypotheses about their root cause.	[Afify, A.

J	Brusco, MJ; Steinley, D				Brusco, Michael J.; Steinley, Douglas			A comparison of heuristic procedures for minimum within-cluster sums of squares partitioning	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article						combinatorial data analysis; cluster analysis; heuristics; sum of squares criterion	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; BINARY DATA; VALIDATION; VARIABLES; SELECTION; CRITERIA; BRANCH; SETS	Perhaps the most common criterion for partitioning a data set is the minimization of the within-cluster sums of squared deviation from cluster centroids. Although optimal solution procedures for within-cluster sums of squares (WCSS) partitioning are computationally feasible for small data sets, heuristic procedures are required for most practical applications in the behavioral sciences. We compared the performances of nine prominent heuristic procedures for WCSS partitioning across 324 simulated data sets representative of a broad spectrum of test conditions. Performance comparisons focused on both percentage deviation from the "best-found" WCSS values, as well as recovery of true cluster structure. A real-coded genetic algorithm and variable neighborhood search heuristic were the most effective methods; however, a straightforward two-stage heuristic algorithm, HK-means, also yielded exceptional performance. A follow-up experiment using 13 empirical data sets from the clustering literature generally supported the results of the experiment using simulated data. Our findings have important implications for behavioral science researchers, whose theoretical conclusions could be adversely affected by poor algorithmic performances.

J	von Luxburg, U				von Luxburg, Ulrike			A tutorial on spectral clustering	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						spectral clustering; graph Laplacian	RESISTANCE DISTANCE; SPARSE MATRICES; GRAPHS; ALGORITHM; EIGENVECTORS; CONNECTIVITY; REDUCTION; EDGE	In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.

This model satisfactorily predicted the chemical-physical properties of high and low molecular weight acyctic compounds. However, side-chain benzene rings are present in about one half of the selected polymers. In order to render cyclic structures, the molecular representation through hierarchical structures was extended by two methods, named group and cycle breaking, respectively. The latter approach exploits standard unique molecular description systems, i.e. Unique SMILES and InChl. In all cases the prediction was very good, with 15-16 K mean absolute error and 19-21 K standard deviation. This result confirms the robustness Of Our method with respect to the inclusion of different structures. Moreover, the good performance of the cycle breaking representation paves the way for the investigation of data sets that contain a variety of poorly sampled cyclic structures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards the development of an error checker for radiotherapy treatment plans: a preliminary study	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION TREATMENT; QUALITY-ASSURANCE; INCIDENTS; DELIVERY	Major accidents can happen during radiotherapy, with an extremely severe consequence to both patients and clinical professionals. We propose to use machine learning and data mining techniques to help detect large human errors in a radiotherapy treatment plan, as a complement to human inspection. One such technique is computer clustering. The basic idea of using clustering algorithms for outlier detection is to first cluster (based on the treatment parameters) a large number of patient treatment plans. Then, when checking a new treatment plan, the parameters of the plan will be tested to see whether or not they belong to the established clusters. If not, they will be considered as 'outliers' and therefore highlighted to catch the attention of the human chart checkers. As a preliminary study, we applied the K-means clustering algorithm to a simple patient model, i.e., 'four-field' box prostate treatment. One thousand plans were used to build the clusters while another 650 plans were used to test the proposed method. It was found that there are eight distinct clusters. At the error levels of +/-100% of the original values of the monitor unit, the detection rate is about 100%. At +/-50% error level, the detection rate is about 80%. The false positive rate is about 10%. When purposely changing the beam energy to a value different from that in the treatment plan, the detection rate is 100% for posterior, right-lateral and left-lateral fields, and about 77% for the anterior field. This preliminary work has shown promise for developing the proposed automatic outlier detection software, although more efforts will still be required.

J	Ding, YY; Dang, X; Peng, HX; Wilkins, D				Ding, Yuanyuan; Dang, Xin; Peng, Hanxiang; Wilkins, Dawn			Robust clustering in high dimensional data using statistical depths	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Background: Mean-based clustering algorithms such as bisecting k-means generally lack robustness. Although componentwise median is a more robust alternative, it can be a poor center representative for high dimensional data. We need a new algorithm that is robust and works well in high dimensional data sets e. g. gene expression data. Results: Here we propose a new robust divisive clustering algorithm, the bisecting Wk-spatialMedian, based on the statistical spatial depth. A new subcluster selection rule, Relative Average Depth, is also introduced. We demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the componentwise-median-based bisecting k-median algorithm for high dimension and low sample size (HDLSS) data via applications of the algorithms on two real HDLSS gene expression data sets. When further applied on noisy real data sets, the proposed algorithm compares favorably in terms of robustness with the componentwise-median-based bisecting k-median algorithm. Conclusion: Statistical data depths provide an alternative way to find the "center" of multivariate data sets and are useful and robust for clustering.

One bud scale and 26 leaf characters were used to separate T. fuana, T. wallichiana var. wallichiana, T. wallichiana var. mairei, T. wallichiana var. chinensis and T. sumatrana by K-means clustering and dendrograms using Ward's distance. Out of the 27 characters examined 21 were found to be well correlated with geographical patterns. T. fuana was morphologically the most distant taxon, while T. sumatrana clustered among the T. wallichiana varieties. After correcting misidentifications of the specimens in T. wallichiana, its varieties occupied discrete geographical ranges, except for some limited sympatry of varieties mairei and chinensis east of the Tanaka Kaiyong line and the Sichuan Basin, China. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of consistency in character selection and definition in the identification of morphologically difficult taxa and the power of combining morphometric and geographical data in clarifying their spatial distribution.

J	Ahmad, A; Dey, L				Ahmad, Amir; Dey, Lipika			A k-mean clustering algorithm for mixed numeric and categorical data	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						clustering; k-mean clustering; cost function; distance measure; significance of attributes; co-occurrences	ATTRIBUTES	Use of traditional k-mean type algorithm is limited to numeric data. This paper presents a clustering algorithm based on k-mean paradigm that works well for data with mixed numeric and categorical features. We propose new cost function and distance measure based on co-occurrence of values. The measures also take into account the significance of an attribute towards the clustering process. We present a modified description of cluster center to overcome the numeric data only limitation of k-mean algorithm and provide a better characterization of clusters. The performance of this algorithm has been studied on real world data sets. Comparisons with other clustering algorithms illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A data set of 653 compounds, 245 with tyrosinase inhibitory activity and 408 having other clinical uses were used. The active data set was Processed by k-means cluster analysis in order to design training and prediction series. Seven LDA-based QSAR models were obtained. The discriminant functions applied showed a globally good classification of 99.79% for the best model Class = -96.067 + 1.988 x 10(2) XOAv + 91.907 BIC3 + 6.853 CIC1 in the training set. External validation processes to assess the robustness and predictive power of the obtained model were carried out. This external prediction set had an accuracy of 99.44%. After that, the developed models were used in ligand-based virtual screening of tyrosinase inhibitors from the literature and never considered in either training or predicting series. In this case, all screened chemicals were correctly classified by the LDA-based QSAR models. As a final point, these fitted models were used in the screening of new bipiperidine series as new tyrosinase inhibitors. These methods are an adequate alternative to the process of selection/identification of new bioactive compounds. The biosilico assays and in vitro results of inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase showed good correspondence. It is important to stand out that compound BP4 (IC50 = 1.72 mu M) showed higher activity in the inhibition against the enzyme than reference compound kojic acid (IC50 = 16.67 mu M) and L-Mimosine (IC50 = 3.68 mu M). These results support the role of biosilico algorithm for the identification of new tyrosinase inhibitor compounds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Dhillon, IS; Guan, YQ; Kulis, B				Dhillon, Inderjit S.; Guan, Yuqiang; Kulis, Brian			Weighted graph cuts without eigenvectors: A multilevel approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; data mining; segmentation; kernel k-means; spectral clustering; graph partitioning		A variety of clustering algorithms have recently been proposed to handle data that is not linearly separable; spectral clustering and kernel k-means are two of the main methods. In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods-in particular, a general weighted kernel k- means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods such as Metis have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k- means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis, and gene network analysis.

J	Chen, CM; Chen, YY; Liu, CY				Chen, Chih-Ming; Chen, Yi-Yun; Liu, Chao-Yu			Learning performance assessment approach using Web-based learning portfolios for e-learning systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						data mining; learning performance assessment; Web-based learning; Web-based learning portfolio	FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES; ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; ALGORITHMS	Learning performance assessment using learning portfolios or Web log data is essential in the Web-based learning field, owing to the rapid growth of e-learning systems globally and lack of assisted authoring tools for Web-based learning performance assessment. The traditional summative evaluation by performing examinations or feedback forms can be employed to evaluate the learning performance for both traditional classroom learning and Web-based learning environments. However, summative evaluation only considers final learning outcomes without considering learning processes of learners. This means that the interactively controlled learning based on the immediate feedback of learning performance cannot be performed in a Web-based learning system. Based on the reasons mentioned earlier, this study presents a data-mining-based learning performance assessment scheme by combining four computational intelligence theories, i.e., gray relational analysis (GRA), K-means clustering scheme, fuzzy association rule mining, and fuzzy inference, in order to identify the learning performance assessment rules using the gathered Web-based learning portfolios of an individual learner. Experimental results indicated that the evaluation results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative assessment results. In other words, this scheme can help teachers assess the learning performance of the individual learner precisely utilizing only the learning portfolios in a Web-based learning environment. Therefore, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and designing courseware since they save a lot of time in evaluating learning performance. More significantly, teachers could understand the factors influencing learning performance in a Web-based learning environment according to the obtained interpretable learning performance assessment rules. Besides, teachers can also tune teaching strategies for learners with various learning performances. This result also provides useful information to Web-based learning systems to perform personalized learning mechanisms for individual learners.

QCS: A system for querying, clustering and summarizing documents	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Information retrieval systems consist of many complicated components. Research and development of such systems is often hampered by the difficulty in evaluating how each particular component would behave across multiple systems. We present a novel integrated information retrieval system-the Query, Cluster, Summarize (QCS) system-which is portable, modular, and permits experimentation with different instantiations of each of the constituent text analysis components. Most importantly, the combination of the three types of methods in the QCS design improves retrievals by providing users more focused information organized by topic. We demonstrate the improved performance by a series of experiments using standard test sets from the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC) as measured by the best known automatic metric for summarization system evaluation, ROUGE. Although the DUC data and evaluations were originally designed to test multidocument summarization, we developed a framework to extend it to the task of evaluation for each of the three components: query, clustering, and summarization. Under this framework, we then demonstrate that the QCS system (end-to-end) achieves performance as good as or better than the best summarization engines. Given a query, QCS retrieves relevant documents, separates the retrieved documents into topic clusters, and creates a single summary for each cluster. In the current implementation, Latent Semantic Indexing is used for retrieval, generalized spherical k-means is used for the document clustering, and a method coupling sentence "trimming" and a hidden Markov model, followed by a pivoted QR decomposition, is used to create a single extract summary for each cluster. The user interface is designed to provide access to detailed information in a compact and useful format. Our system demonstrates the feasibility of assembling an effective IR system from existing software libraries, the usefulness of the modularity of the design, and the value of this particular combination of modules.

A comparative study of the K-means algorithm and the normal mixture model for clustering: Univariate case	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						Bayes rule; clustering; data mining; EM algorithm; K-means algorithm; misclassification rate; mixture model; prior and posterior probabilities		This paper gives a comparative study of the K-means algorithm and the mixture model (MM) method for clustering normal data. The EM algorithm is used to compute the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the parameters of the MM model. These parameters include mixing proportions, which may be thought of as the prior probabilities of different clusters: the maximum posterior (Bayes) rule is used for clustering. Hence, asymptotically the MM method approaches the Bayes rule for known parameters, which is optimal in terms of minimizing the expected misclassification rate (EMCR). The paper gives a thorough analytic comparison of the two methods for the univariate case Under both homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity. Simulation results are given to compare the two methods for a range of sample sizes. The comparison, which is limited to two clusters, shows that the MM method has substantially lower EMCR particularly when the mixing proportions are unbalanced. The two methods have asymptotically the same EMCR under homoscedasticity (resp., heteroscedasticity) when the mixing proportions of the two clusters are equal (resp., unequal), but for small samples the MM method sometimes performs slightly worse because of the errors in estimating unknown parameters.

Dense mode clustering in brain maps	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						fMRI; clustering; brain maps; localization; ROI analysis; parcellation	PERMUTATION METHODS; SIZE INFERENCE; RANDOM-FIELD; FMRI; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; ACTIVATIONS; INTENSITY; NETWORK; IMAGES	A mode-based clustering method is developed for identifying spatially dense clusters in brain maps. This type of clustering focuses on identifying clusters in brain maps independent of their shape or overall variance. This can be useful for both localization in terms of interpretation and for subsequent graphical analysis that might require more coherent or dense regions of interest as starting points. The method automatically does signal/noise sharpening through density mode seeking. We also discuss the problem of parameter selection with this method and propose a new method involving 2-parameter control surface, in which we show that the same cluster solution results from tradeoff of these 2 parameters (the local density k and the radius r of the spherical kernel). We benchmark the new dense mode clustering by using several artificially created data sets and brain imaging data sets from an event perception task by perturbing the data set with noise and measuring three kinds of deviation from the original cluster solution. We present benchmark results that demonstrate that the mode clustering method consistently outperforms the commonly used single-linkage clustering, k means method (centroid method) and Ward's method (variance method).

J	Xu, Q; Li, Z				Xu, Qisheng; Li, Zhuguo			Recognition of wear mode using multi-variable synthesis approach based on wavelet packet and improved three-line method	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						oil monitoring; wavelet packet transform; feature extraction; feature selection; improved three-line method; K-means; clustering; multi-variable synthesis analysis	TRANSFORM	Condition monitoring is an indispensable means of ensuring smooth running of key equipment, because it can improve machinery availability and performance, and also reduce damage and maintenance cost. One kind of condition monitoring is oil monitoring and it is applied extensively because of its capability to provide warning and to predict faults at early stages, with stronger pertinence. But the extraction and selection of features from oil data have always been the bottleneck of its effective application. In this study, prior to extraction and selection of features, denoising was implemented on the oil spectrometric data using 1D-DPT. For the purpose of mining more effective boundary features, we designed amelioration on classical three-line method based on statistics, and thus improved the three-line method. After the denoised signal was decomposed with WT, the three features, boundary, correlation degree and centroid were extracted, respectively, using the improved three-line method, correlation coefficients and K-means clustering. On the basis of these features, multi-variable synthesis analysis was advanced and the distance criterion parameter of synthesis analysis was proposed to classify and identify wear mode. Finally, through the comparison with examples applying the classical three-line method, we demonstrate the better the ability of the improved method to classify and recognize wear patterns with higher accuracy and precision.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common modifications that propagates signals from extracellular stimuli to downstream effectors. To investigate the global phosphorylation regulation and uncover novel phosphoproteins at the early stages of canonical Wnt signaling, HEK293 cells were metabolically labeled with two stable isotopic forms of lysine and were stimulated for 0, 1, or 30 min with purified Wnt3a. After phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis, 1057 proteins were identified in all three time points. In total 287 proteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change in at least one time point. In addition to many known Wnt signaling transducers, other phosphoproteins were identified and quantitated, implicating their involvement in canonical Wnt signaling. k-Means clustering analysis showed dynamic patterns for the differential phosphoproteins. Profile pattern and interaction network analysis of the differential phosphoproteins implicated the possible roles for those unreported components in Wnt signaling. Moreover 100 unique phosphorylation sites were identified, and 54 of them were quantitated in the three time points. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser-20 phosphorylation on RRM2 increased upon 30-min Wnt3a stimulation. Further studies with mutagenesis, the Wnt reporter gene assay, and RNA interference indicated that RRM2 functioned downstream of beta-catenin as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling and that Ser-20 phosphorylation of RRM2 counteracted its inhibition effect.

This report characterizes the genomic and proteomic response in whole blood of adult male mice exposed i.p. to 264 ng/kg of the Pacific congener of CTX (P-CTX-1) at 1, 4 and 24 h. Whole genome microarray expression data were filtered by tightness of fit between replicates, fold change (1.8) and p-value (10(-5)), resulting in 183 annotated genes used for trending analysis, K-means clustering and ontology classification. Genes involved with cytokine signaling, proteasome complex and ribosomal function were dominant. qPCR performed on 19 genes of interest had a correlation of 0.95 to array results by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Serum protein analysis showed small but significant changes in 6 of 60 proteins assayed: Cc12, Cc112, CD40, IL-10, leptin and M-CSF. In large part, the gene expression was consistent with a Th2 immune response with interesting similarities to expression seen in asthmatic models. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Clustering techniques and their applications in engineering	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Review						data mining; clustering; engineering applications	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; FUZZY-C-MEANS; ORGANIZING FEATURE MAP; ART NEURAL-NETWORK; CELL-FORMATION ALGORITHM; PROCESS QUALITY-CONTROL; PART FAMILY FORMATION; DESIGN RETRIEVAL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; GROUP-TECHNOLOGY	Clustering is an important data exploration technique with many applications in different areas of engineering, including engineering design, manufacturing system design, quality assurance, production planning and process planning, modelling, monitoring, and control. The clustering problem has been addressed by researchers from many disciplines. However, efforts to perform effective and efficient clustering on large data sets only started in recent years with the emergence of data mining. The current paper presents an overview of clustering algorithms from a data mining perspective. Attention is paid to techniques of scaling up these algorithms to handle large data sets. The paper also describes a number of engineering applications to illustrate the potential of clustering algorithms as a tool for handling complex real-world problems.	[Pharn, D. T.; Afify, A.

A broad comparison among fishes' early growth and condition traits is performed in order to determine ecological patterns of early development regarding latitudinal distribution, habitat use and life-history strategies. Based on Winemiller and Rose (1992) classification of life-history strategies, data on early growth and condition indices of 46 fish species worldwide was analysed. Available information on fishes' early features, namely first year length percentage (relative to species maximum theoretical length), age at maturation and Fulton's condition index (K), provided a good segregation of species by latitudinal distribution and habitat use, and evidenced the categories of the three-endpoint model. Higher larvae and juvenile growth rates and condition indices (K, mean RNA-DNA ratios and protein contents) were associated with tropical and temperate fish species that occur in complex or variable habitats (respectively coral reefs and estuaries). These species selected for the opportunistic and periodic strategies, investing highly in rapid growth in order to increase survival probability to counter high mortality rates during early stages or unstable habitat conditions. Later age at maturation, slower larvae and juvenile growth as well as lower mean condition indices were consistent with fish species from more stable or predictable environments, as polar regions and freshwater habitats, which selected for the equilibrium strategy. Nonetheless, differences in energy allocation strategies during early stages were not observed, evidencing the scarcity of available data regarding condition indices and/or the importance of integrating life-history intermediate strategies. Future research into condition indices and other physiological processes, for a broader set of species and for a wider latitudinal and habitat range including seasonal variability (particularly for species from tropical and polar regions), is essential to better understand or test current theories of species ecological patterns. The use of direct quantitative measures of young fishes' metabolic investment and fitness constitutes a new approach for life-history studies, and should be fundamental for predicting species' responses to acute environmental or human constrains, especially in a global climate change scenario that is expected to affect distribution and abundance of fish species worldwide.

Fungal detection in wheat using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						fungal infection; grain quality; hyperspectral imaging; near-infrared	SINGLE CORN KERNELS; SOYBEAN SEEDS; SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSMITTANCE; GRAIN	Different species of fungi infect grain in the field and storage facilities. Contamination by fungi in grain is detected and quantified by traditional methods, such as microbial incubation and microscopic detection, which are subjective, labor intensive, and time consuming. An accurate and timely detection technique for fungal growth in grain is needed to prevent grain from spoiling and to reduce quality loss. In this study, the potential of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging to detect fungal infection in wheat was investigated. Wheat kernels infected with storage fungi, namely Penicillium spp., Aspergillus glaucus, and Aspergillus niger, were scanned using a hyperspectral imaging system, and a total of 20 image slices at evenly spaced wavelengths between 1000 to 1600 nm were acquired to form a hypercube. A multivariate image analysis (MIA) technique based on principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the image hypercubes. Two-class and four-class classification models were developed by applying k-means clustering and discriminant (linear, quadratic, and Mahalanobis) analyses. Two-class discriminant classification models gave maximum classification accuracy of 100%, and on average 97.8% infected kernels were correctly classified by the linear discriminant classifier. The four-class linear discriminant classifier correctly classified more than 95% of the kernels infected with Penicillium and 91.7% healthy kernels. However, the discriminant classifiers misclassified the kernels infected with A. niger and A. glaucus.	[Singh, C. B.; Jayas, D.

Comparison of self-organizing maps classification approach with cluster and principal components analysis for large environmental data sets	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						classification; self-organizing maps; cluster analysis; principal components analysis; water quality; monitoring; river; environmetrics	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; SOM NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER WATER; STATISTICAL-METHODS; YANTRA RIVER; K-MEANS; QUALITY; CHEMOMETRICS; ALGORITHM; BULGARIA	Three classification techniques (loading and score projections based on principal components analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA) and self-organizing maps (SOM)) were applied to a large environmental data set of chemical indicators of river water quality. The study was carried out by using long-term water quality monitoring data. The advantages of SOM algorithm and its classification and visualization ability for large environmental data sets are stressed. The results obtained allowed detecting natural clusters of monitoring locations with similar water quality type and identifying important discriminant variables responsible for the clustering. SOM clustering allows simultaneous observation of both spatial and temporal changes in water quality. The chemometric approach revealed different patterns of monitoring sites conditionally named "tributary", "urban", "rural" or "background". This objective separation could lead to an optimization of river monitoring nets and to a better tracing natural and anthropogenic changes along the river stream. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Aires, F; Prigent, C				Aires, Filipe; Prigent, Catherine			Sampling techniques in high-dimensional spaces for the development of satellite remote sensing database	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; RETRIEVAL; TEMPERATURE; PROFILES; COMPUTATION; INSTRUMENT; INVERSION; AMSU	This study presents various strategies to sample databases from large atmospheric data sets in high-dimensional spaces for satellite remote sensing applications. In particular, two sampling algorithms are examined: the traditional uniform sampling that lists all possible situations and the clustering sampling (K-means) that respects the natural variability probability distribution functions. In order to assess the quality of both sampling methods, the extracted databases are used to extract first guesses for satellite remote sensing schemes. They are also employed as training databases for the calibration of statistical retrieval algorithms. The analysis of these sampling algorithms is illustrated by constructing both a first guess (FG) extraction and a retrieval databases of temperature and water vapor profiles over sea for the Atmospheric Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) instrument. The advantages and problems of each sampling approach are thoroughly examined and sensitivity studies are conducted to analyze the impact on the FG extraction and retrieval of various algorithmic parameters such as the distance being used, the size of the databases, or the instrumental noise sensitivity. The K-means clustering algorithm, not yet used for this kind of problems, is very efficient compared to the more traditional uniform sampling approach. It is also shown that it is important to have quasi-automatic and flexible tools that can be used to generate problem-specific databases.

J	Chavent, M; Lechevallier, Y; Briant, O				Chavent, Marie; Lechevallier, Yves; Briant, Olivier			DIVCLUS-T: A monothetic divisive hierarchical clustering method	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						divisive clustering; monothetic cluster; decision dendrogram; inertia criterion		DIVCLUS-T is a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a monothetic bipartitional approach allowing the dendrogram of the hierarchy to be read as a decision tree. It is designed for either numerical or categorical data. Like the Ward agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm and the k-means partitioning algorithm, it is based on the minimization of the inertia criterion. However, unlike Ward and k-means, it provides a simple and natural interpretation of the clusters. The price paid by construction in terms of inertia by DIVCLUS-T for this additional interpretation is studied by applying the three algorithms on six databases from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

J	Hsu, CC; Chen, CL; Su, YW				Hsu, Chung-Chian; Chen, Chin-Long; Su, Yu-Wei			Hierarchical clustering of mixed data based on distance hierarchy	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						categorical data; distance hierarchy; hierarchical clustering; k-means; mixed data	CATEGORICAL-DATA; ALGORITHM; ATTRIBUTES; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; VALUES; SETS	Data clustering is an important data mining technique which partitions data according to some similarity criterion. Abundant algorithms have been proposed for clustering numerical data and some recent research tackles the problem of clustering categorical or mixed data. Unlike the subtraction scheme used for numerical attributes, there is no standard for measuring distance between categorical values. In this article, we propose a distance representation scheme, distance hierarchy, which facilitates expressing the similarity between categorical values and also unifies distance measuring of numerical and categorical values. We then apply the scheme to mixed data clustering, in particular, to integrate with a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Consequently, this integrated approach can uniformly handle numerical data and categorical data, and also enables one to take the similarity between categorical values into consideration. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces better clustering results than conventional clustering algorithms when categorical attributes are present and their values have different degree of similarity.

J	Guo, FB; Yu, XJ				Guo, Feng-Biao; Yu, Xiu-Juan			Separate base usages of genes located on the leading and lagging strands in Chlamydia muridarum revealed by the Z curve method	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC SUBSTITUTION PATTERNS; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; PROTEIN-CODING GENES; CODON USAGE; BACTERIAL GENOMES; REPLICATION ORIENTATION; COMPOSITIONAL ASYMMETRY; NUCLEOTIDE DISTRIBUTION; BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI; MUTATIONAL BIASES	Background: The nucleotide compositional asymmetry between the leading and lagging strands in bacterial genomes has been the subject of intensive study in the past few years. It is interesting to mention that almost all bacterial genomes exhibit the same kind of base asymmetry. This work aims to investigate the strand biases in Chlamydia muridarum genome and show the potential of the Z curve method for quantitatively differentiating genes on the leading and lagging strands. Results: The occurrence frequencies of bases of protein-coding genes in C. muridarum genome were analyzed by the Z curve method. It was found that genes located on the two strands of replication have distinct base usages in C. muridarum genome. According to their positions in the 9-D space spanned by the variables u(1) - u(9) of the Z curve method, K-means clustering algorithm can assign about 94% of genes to the correct strands, which is a few percent higher than those correctly classified by K-means based on the RSCU. The base usage and codon usage analyses show that genes on the leading strand have more G than C and more T than A, particularly at the third codon position. For genes on the lagging strand the biases is reverse. The y component of the Z curves for the complete chromosome sequences show that the excess of G over C and T over A are more remarkable in C. muridarum genome than in other bacterial genomes without separating base and/or codon usages. Furthermore, for the genomes of Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia muridarum and Chlamydia trachomatis, in which distinct base and/or codon usages have been observed, closer phylogenetic distance is found compared with other bacterial genomes. Conclusion: The nature of the strand biases of base composition in C. muridarum is similar to that in most other bacterial genomes. However, the base composition asymmetry between the leading and lagging strands in C. muridarum is more significant than that in other bacteria. It's supposed that the remarkable strand biases of G/C and T/A are responsible for the appearance of separate base or codon usages in C. muridarum. On the other hand, the closer phylogenetic distance among the four bacterial genomes with separate base and/or codon usages is necessary rather than occasional. It's also shown that the Z curve method may be more sensitive than RSCU when being used to quantitatively analyze DNA sequences.

However, the biological effects of such treatments are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the main effects of an androgen masculinizing treatment (11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11 beta OH Delta 4, 10 mg/kg of food for 3 months) on gonadal gene expression profiles of an all-female genetic population of trout. To characterize the most important molecular features of this process, we used a large scale gene expression profiling approach using rainbow trout DNA microarrays combined with a detailed gene ontology ( GO) analysis. Results: 2,474 genes were characterized as up-regulated or down-regulated in trout female gonads masculinized by androgen in comparison with control male or female gonads from untreated all-male and all-female genetic populations. These genes were classified in 13 k-means clusters of temporally correlated expression profiles. Gene ontology ( GO) data mining revealed that androgen treatment triggers a marked down-regulation of genes potentially involved in early oogenesis processes ( GO 'mitotic cell cycle', 'nucleolus'), an up- regulation of the translation machinery ( GO 'ribosome') along with a down-regulation of proteolysis ( GO 'proteolysis', 'peptidase' and 'metallopeptidase activity'). Genes considered as muscle fibres markers ( GO 'muscle contraction') and genes annotated as structural constituents of the extracellular matrix ( GO 'extracellular matrix') or related to meiosis ( GO 'chromosome' and 'meiosis') were found significantly enriched in the two clusters of genes specifically up- regulated in androgen-treated female gonads. GO annotations 'Sex differentiation' and 'steroid biosynthesis' were enriched in a cluster of genes with high expression levels only in control males. Interestingly none of these genes were stimulated by the masculinizing androgen treatment. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that androgen masculinization results in a marked dysregulation of early gene expression profiles when compared to natural testicular or ovarian differentiation. Based on these results we suggest that, in our experimental conditions, androgen masculinization proceeds mainly through an early inhibition of female development.

In the standard paradigm, GRBs are classified into only two groups, the long and short bursts. However, for both of the clustering techniques, the optimal number of classes was found to be three, a result that is consistent with previous statistical analysis. In this classification, the long bursts are further divided into two groups that are primarily differentiated by their total fluence and duration and hence are called low- and high-fluence GRBs. Analysis of GRBs with known redshifts and spectral parameters suggests that low- fluence GRBs have nearly constant isotropic energy output of 10(52) ergs, while for the high-fluence ones the energy output ranges from 1052 to 1054 ergs. It is speculated that the three kinds of GRBs reflect three different origins: mergers of neutron star systems, mergers between white dwarfs and neutron stars, and collapse of massive stars.

Dendritic thickness: a morphometric parameter to classify mouse retinal ganglion cells	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						ganglion cell morphology; retinal circuitry; intracellular injection of; neurotracers; Lucifer yellow; dendritic thickness	MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; CAT RETINA; LUCIFER YELLOW; RABBIT RETINA; W-CELLS; RAT; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY; INPUTS	To study the dendritic morphology of retinal ganglion cells in wildtype mice we intracellularly injected these cells with Lucifer yellow in an in vitro preparation of the retina. Subsequently, quantified values of dendritic thickness, number of branching points and level of stratification of 73 Lucifer yellow-filled ganglion cells were analyzed by statistical methods, resulting in a classification into 9 groups. The variables dendritic thickness, number of branching points per cell and level of stratification were independent of each other. Number of branching points and level of stratification were independent of eccentricity, whereas dendritic thickness was positively dependent (r = 0.37) on it. The frequency distribution of dendritic thickness tended to be multimodal, indicating the presence of at least two cell populations composed of neurons with dendritic diameters either smaller or larger than 1.8 mu m ("thin" or "thick" dendrites, respectively). Three cells (4.5%) were bistratified, having thick dendrites, and the others (95.5%) were monostratified. Using k-means cluster analysis, monostratified cells with either thin or thick dendrites were further subdivided according to level of stratification and number of branching points: cells with thin dendrites were divided into 2 groups with outer stratification (0-40%) and 2 groups with inner (50-100%) stratification, whereas cells with thick dendrites were divided into one group with outer and 3 groups with inner stratification. We postulate, that one group of cells with thin dendrites resembles cat beta-cells, whereas one group of cells with thick dendrites includes cells that resemble cat alpha-cells.

Evaluation of colon cancer elements contents in serum using statistical methods	CHEMICAL PAPERS			English	Article						colon cancer; serum; atomic absorption spectrometry; univariate analysis; multivariate analysis	COLORECTAL-CANCER; SELENIUM LEVELS; BLOOD SELENIUM; IRON; NETWORKS; DISEASES; TISSUE; BODY	Classification of normal and different cancer groups (TNM classification) with univariate and multivariate statistical methods according to the contents of Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in blood serum is discussed. All serum samples were digested by acid mixture in a microwave mineralization unit prior to the analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results show that univariate methods can distinguish normal and cancer groups. Level of selenium evaluated as arithmetic mean with its standard deviation in colorectal cancer patients was (42.61 +/- 23.76) mu g L(-1). Retransformed mean was used to evaluate levels of managanese (11.99 +/- 1.71) mu g L(-1), copper (1.05 +/- 0.06) mg L(-1), zinc (2.14 +/- 0.21) mg L(-1), and iron (1.82 +/- 0.22) mg L(-1). Conclusions of multivariate statistical procedures (principal component analysis, hierarchical, and k-means clustering) do not correlate very well with the division of serum samples according to the TNM classification.

J	Niu, ZY; Ji, DH; Tan, CL				Niu, Zheng-Yu; Ji, Dong-Hong; Tan, Chew Lim			Learning model order from labeled and unlabeled data for partially supervised classification, with application to word sense disambiguation	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						word sense disambiguation; partially supervised classification; semi-supervised clustering		Previous partially supervised classification methods can partition unlabeled data into positive examples and negative examples for a given class by learning from positive labeled examples and unlabeled examples, but they cannot further group the negative examples into meaningful clusters even if there are many different classes in the negative examples. Here we proposed an automatic method to obtain a natural partitioning of mixed data (labeled data + unlabeled data) by maximizing a stability criterion defined on classification results from an extended label propagation algorithm over all the possible values of model order (or the number of classes) in mixed data. Our experimental results on benchmark corpora for word sense disambiguation task indicate that this model order identification algorithm with the extended label propagation algorithm as the base classifier outperforms SVM, a one-class partially supervised classification algorithm, and the model order identification algorithm with semi-supervised k-means clustering as the base classifier when labeled data is incomplete.

A fuzzy c-means classification of elevation derivatives to extract the morphometric classification of landforms in Snowdonia, Wales	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Geostats-UK 2005 Meeting	2005	Belfast, NORTH IRELAND		Queens Univ	landforms; morphometric classes; fuzzy; digital elevation model; resolution; Snowdonia	K-MEANS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; TOPOGRAPHY; LANDSCAPE; DIMENSION; ELEMENTS; LOGIC; AREA; USA	The increasing global coverage of high resolution/large-scale digital elevation data has allowed the study of geomorphological form to receive renewed attention by providing accessible datasets for the characterisation and quantification of land surfaces. Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide quantitative elevation data, but it is the characterisation and extraction of geomorphologically significant measures (morphometric indices) from these raw data that form more informative and useful datasets. Common to many geographical measures, morphometric measures derived from DEMs are dependent on the scale of observation. This paper reports results of employing a fuzzy c-means classification for a sample DEM from Snowdonia. Wales, with a number of morphometric measures at different resolutions as input, and morphometric classification of landforms at each resolution as output. The classifications reveal that different landscape components or morphometric classes are important at different resolutions, and that morphometric classes exhibit resolution dependency in their geographical extents. Examination of the scale dependency and behaviour of morphometric classifications of landforms at different resolutions provides a fuller and more holistic view of the classes present than a single-scale analysis.

K-TRACE: A kernel k-means procedure for classification	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						classification; k-means; kernel functions		In a computational context, classification refers to assigning objects to different classes with respect to their features, which can be mapped to qualitative or quantitative variables. Several techniques have been developed recently to map the available information into a set of features (feature space) that improve the classification performance. Kernel functions provide a nonlinear mapping that implicitly transforms the input space to a new feature space where data can be separated, clustered and classified more easily. In this paper a kernel revised version of the Total Recognition by Adaptive Classification Experiments (T.R.A.C.E) algorithm, an iterative k-means like classification algorithm is presented.

There are four stages namely, user modelling, benchmarking of clustering algorithms, prediction analysis and recommendation. The first stage is to develop analytical models of common characteristics of Web-user data. These artificial data sets are then used to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms, in particular benchmarking the ART2 neural network with K-means clustering. Afterwards, it is evaluated the predictive accuracy of the clusters applied to a real-world data set derived from access logs to the citizen Web portal Infoville XXI (http://www.infoville.es). The results favour ART2 algorithms for cluster-based collaborative filtering on this Web portal. Finally, a recommender based on ART2 is developed. The follow-up of real recommendations will allow to improve recommendations by including new behaviours that are observed when users interact with the recommender system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Mining association rules through integration of clustering analysis and ant colony system for health insurance database in Taiwan	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; ant colony system; cluster; association rule	K-MEANS; ALGORITHM	In addition to sharing and applying the knowledge in the community, knowledge discovery has become an important issue in the knowledge economic era. Data mining plays an important role of knowledge discovery. Therefore, this study intends to propose a novel framework of data mining which clusters the data first and then followed by association rules mining. The first stage employs the ant system-based clustering algorithm (ASCA) and ant K-means (AK) to cluster the database, while the ant colony system-based association rules mining algorithm is applied to discover the useful rules for each group. The medical database provided by the National Health Insurance Bureau of Taiwan Government is used to verify the proposed method. The evaluation results showed that the proposed method not only is able to extract the rules much faster, but also can discover more important rules. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed method is an improved version of the regular neuro-fuzzy TSK fuzzy inference system. For the proposed method, first, the data that are processed ire grouped by the k-means clustering method. The membership A arbitrary input for each fuzzy rule is then derived through in ELM, followed by a normalization method. At the same time, he consequent part of the fuzzy rules is obtained by multiple ELMs. At last, the approximate prediction value is determined by a weight computation scheme. For the ELM-based TSK fuzzy inference system, two extensions are also proposed to improve its accuracy. The proposed methods can avoid the curse of dimensionality that is encountered in backpropagation and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. Moreover, the proposed methods have a competitive performance in training time and accuracy compared to three ANFIS methods.

Ivan; Barrientos, Gustavo			Analysis of dimorphic structures of the human pelvis: its implications for sex estimation in samples without reference collections	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						unknown sex samples; sciatic notch; ischiopubic region; geometric morphometrics	GREATER SCIATIC NOTCH; DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION; SKELETAL REMAINS; HIP BONE; MORPHOLOGY; RELIABILITY; POPULATION; BLACKS; WHITES	This work deals with the analysis of pelvic sexual dimorphism in skeletal samples of human prehistoric populations for which adequate reference collections of known sex are not available. We use geometric morphometric techniques based on semilandmarks in order to quantify shape variation of the greater sciatic notch and ischiopubic region. Firstly, intra- and interobserver error associated with the placement of point coordinates in geometric morphometric analyses were evaluated through intraclass correlation coefficient and Kappa index. Our results indicate that such techniques, in contrast to morphoscopic analysis, allow quantification and objective description of sexual dimorphism in pelvic traits, as well as, performing repeated analyses of numerous individuals with no previous observer experience required. Secondly, relative warp analyses calculated based on semilandmarks were used to describe sexual dimorphism pattern of the ischiopubic region and the greater sciatic notch of two unknown sex Amerindian samples from Argentina, and k-means clustering analysis was applied to detect two groups within each sample. One sample corresponds to hunter-gatherers from South Argentina (it = 29), whereas the other comprises farmers from Northwest Argentina (n = 30). The results obtained suggest that: (a) the first relative warps axis obtained for both structures summarizes shape changes due to sexual dimorphism; (b) the individuals grouped into clusters can be assigned as female or male based on their shape; and (c) sexual dimorphism is not equally expressed in both archaeological samples. These findings support the hypothesis that patterns of pelvic sexual dimorphism vary among human populations and thus, criteria for sexing are population-specific. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the training process, k-means clustering algorithm was applied to select the network centers of the input training data. Furthermore, an equivalent electrical-circuit model with this internal-resistance was developed for investigation on the stack. Finally using the neural networks model of the equivalent resistance in the PEMFC stack, the simulation results of the estimation of equivalent internal-resistance of PEMFC were presented. The results show that this electrical PEMFC model is effective and is suitable for the study of control scheme, fault detection and the engineering analysis of electrical circuits.

We focus on one particular type of problem related to the clustering of a two-mode binary matrix, which is relevant to the establishment of generalized blockmodels for social networks. In this context, clusters for the rows of the two-mode matrix intersect with clusters of the columns to form blocks, which should ideally be either complete (all Is) or null (all Os). A new procedure based on variable neighborhood search is presented and compared to an existing two-mode K-means clustering algorithm. The new procedure. generally provided slightly greater explained variation; however, both methods yielded exceptional recovery of cluster structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Brains were cryosliced and radio-labelled with a ligand of the peripheral type benzodiazepine-receptor (pBR), H-3-Pk11195 [(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propylene)-3-isoquinoline-carboxamide)] by receptor autoradiography. Manually segmented and automatically registered tumours have been 3D-reconstructed for volumetric comparison on the basis of H-3-Pk11195-based tumour recognition. Furthermore automatically computed areas of -300 mu m inner (marginal) zone as well as 300 mu m and 600 mu m outer tumour space were quantified. These three different regions were transferred onto other adjacent slices that had been labelled by receptor autoradiography with the A(1) Adenosine receptor (A(1)AR)-ligand H-3-CPFPX (H-3-8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluorpropyl)-1-propylxanthine) for quantitative assessment of A(1)AR in the three different tumour zones. Hence, a method is described for quantifying various receptor protein systems in the tumour as well as in the marginal invasive zones around experimentally implanted rat brain tumours and their representation in the tumour microenvironment as well as in 3D space. Furthermore, a tool for automatically reading out radio-labelled rat brain slices from auto radiographic films was developed, reconstructed into a consistent 3D-tumour model and the zones around the tumour were visualized. A(1)AR expression was found to depend upon the tumour volume in C6 animals, but is independent on the time of tumour development. In F98 animals, a significant increase in A(1)AR receptor protein was found in the Peritumoural zone as a function of time of tumour development and tumour volume.

Wushu athletes (n = 40) competing in Intervarsity championships in Malaysia completed Task and Ego Orientations in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) and Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI). Using cluster analysis techniques including hierarchical methods and the non-hierarchical method (k-means cluster) to examine goal profiles, a three cluster solution emerged viz. cluster 1 - high task and moderate ego (HT/ME), cluster 2 - moderate task and low ego (MT/LE) and, cluster 3 - moderate task and moderate ego (MT/ME). Analysis of the fundamental areas of mental toughness based on goal profiles revealed that athletes in cluster 1 scored significantly higher on negative energy control than athletes in cluster 2. Further, athletes in cluster 1 also scored significantly higher on positive energy control than athletes in cluster 3. Chi-square (chi(2)) test revealed no significant differences among athletes with different goal profiles on performance outcomes in the competition. However, significant differences were observed between athletes (medallist and non medallist) in self-confidence (p = 0.001) and negative energy control (p = 0.042). Medallist's scored significantly higher on self-confidence (mean = 21.82 +/- 2.72) and negative energy control (mean = 19.59 +/- 2.32) than the non-medallists (self confidence-mean = 18.76 +/- 2.49; negative energy control mean = 18.14 +/- 1.91).

This algorithm divides parent cells into k daughter cells by using the k-means algorithm. The tree structure provided by the algorithm is independent of the coordinate system. This method also includes a unique procedure for determining cell sizes adjusted to the particle distribution. Comparing the performance of the algorithm to that of the Barnes-Hut octtree by using gravitational calculations at the same error level, including only the monopole term, we found that the calculation cost was lower, the performance was superior, and the calculation incurred a smaller error.

J	Jalali, M				Jalali, Mohsen			Site-specific potassium application based on the fertilizer potassium availability index of soil	PRECISION AGRICULTURE			English	Article						cluster analysis; potassium availability; potassium fixation; principal component analysis; spatial variation	SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SANDY SOIL; PARAMETERS; MANAGEMENT; RELEASE; WATER; RIVER	Soil varies in its potassium (K+) content and ability to supply K+ to crops. Site-specific K+ management aims to optimize crop production and minimize K+ loss from the soil. The spatial variation of available K+ prior to fertilizer application, the K+ fixation capacity of soil and soil texture need to be taken into account for variable-rate K+ application. This study was done to measure the spatial variation of the fertilizer K+ availability index (A(1)), which shows the potential for K+ fixation, and to develop a strategy that takes the spatial distribution of this index into account for site-specific K+ application. To determine the fixation capacity, the linear relation between the amount of K+ added to soil and the amount of K+ fixed was determined on 40 topsoil samples. Samples of soil were equilibrated in a moist condition for 3 weeks after the addition of 0, 25, 75, 225 and 675 mg K+ kg(-1). The increase in exchangeable K+ was described by a linear relationship. The fertilizer K+ availability index (slope) varied from 0.20 to 0.49, indicating 51-80% of added K+ was converted to the non-exchangeable form. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the first two components accounted for most of the variation, 48.7 and 26.3% of total variation, respectively. A non-hierarchical cluster analysis (k-means clustering) identified four groups and the amounts of fertilizer K+ required were calculated for each group. The results suggested that such classes could form a basis for variable-rate application to maintain an adequate K+ status for crop production and to reduce potential K+ loss from soil by leaching.

A novel searching-and-averaging method in time domain (SAMTD) is proposed. It can solve a kind of problems that are very hard to solve by using sparse representation in frequency domain. Bypassing the disadvantages of traditional clustering (e.g., K-means or potential-function clustering), the durative-sparsity of a speech signal in time domain is used. To recover the mixing matrix, our method deletes those samples, which are not in the same or inverse direction of the basis vectors. To recover the sources, an improved geometric approach to overcomplete ICA (Independent Component Analysis) is presented. Several speech signal experiments demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.

J	Krink, T; Paterlini, S; Resti, A				Krink, Thiemo; Paterlini, Sandra; Resti, Andrea			Using differential evolution to improve the accuracy of bank rating systems	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						credit rating; PD bucket; differential evolution; clustering; probability of default	OPTIMIZATION	Credit rating is the evaluation of the likelihood of an obligor to default on a loan. Each obligor in the bank's credit portfolio is assigned to a certain rating class, or PD (probability of default) bucket; all obligors in a PD bucket then receive the same ''pooled'' PD, based on which a capital charge against credit risk must be computed. The only analytical approach to this problem is based on k-means and has some limitations in practice. An error minimization approach to credit rating using differential evolution (DE) is introduced. The performances of DE and other common search heuristics are compared using credit rating data of a major Italian bank. Empirical results show that DE is clearly superior compared to a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), random search (RS) and two naive partitioning approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach obtained better results than k-means in much less runtime for a simplified instance of the problem where within-groups variances can be used for clustering.

J	Hennig, C				Hennig, Christian			Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						cluster validation; bootstrap; robustness; clustering with noise; Jaccard coefficient	TRIMMED K-MEANS; VALIDATION	Stability in cluster analysis is strongly dependent on the data set, especially on how well separated and how homogeneous the clusters are. In the same clustering, some clusters may be very stable and others may be extremely unstable. The Jaccard coefficient, a similarity measure between sets, is used as a cluster-wise measure of cluster stability, which is assessed by the bootstrap distribution of the Jaccard coefficient for every single cluster of a clustering compared to the most similar cluster in the bootstrapped data sets. This can be applied to very general cluster analysis methods. Some alternative resampling methods are investigated as well, namely subsetting, jittering the data points and replacing some data points by artificial noise points. The different methods are compared by means of a simulation study. A data example illustrates the use of the cluster-wise stability assessment to distinguish between meaningful stable and spurious clusters, but it is also shown that clusters are sometimes only stable because of the inflexibility of certain clustering methods.

The resulting series of robust Mahalanobis distances is used to cluster multivariate normal data. The method depends on envelopes of the distribution of the test statistics in forward plots. These envelopes can be found by simulation; flexible polynomial approximations to the envelopes are given.

J	Hresko, MT; Labelle, H; Roussouly, P; Berthonnaud, E				Hresko, Michael T.; Labelle, Hubert; Roussouly, Pierre; Berthonnaud, Eric			Classification of high-grade spondylolistheses based on pelvic version and spine balance - Possible rationale for reduction	SPINE			English	Article						spondylolisthesis; spine deformity; pelvic incidence; posture; sagittal balance	SPINOPELVIC BALANCE	Study Design. Retrospective review of a radiographic database of high-grade spondylolisthesis patients in comparison with asymptomatic controls. Objective. To analyze the sagittal spinopelvic alignment in high-grade spondylolisthesis patients and identify subgroups that may require reduction to restore sagittal balance. Summary of Background Data. High-grade spondylolisthesis is associated with an abnormally high pelvic incidence (PI); however, the spatial orientation of the pelvis, determined by sacral slope (SS) and pelvic tilt ( PT), is not known. We hypothesized that sagittal spinal alignment would vary with the pelvic orientation. Methods. Digitized sagittal radiographs of 133 high-grade spondylolisthesis patients ( mean age, 17 years) were measured to determined sagittal alignment. K-means cluster analysis identified 2 groups based on the PT and SS, which were compared by paired t test. Comparisons were made to asymptomatic controls matched for PI. Results. High-grade spondylolisthesis patients had a mean PI of 78.9 +/- 12.1. Cluster analysis identified a retroverted, unbalanced pelvis group with high PT (36.5 +/- 8.0)/low SS (40.3 +/- 9.0) and a balanced pelvic group with low PT ( mean 21.3 +/- 8.2)/high SS (59.9 +/- 11.2). The retroverted pelvis group had significantly greater L5 incidence and lumbosacral angle with less thoracic kyphosis than the balanced pelvic group. A total of 83% of controls had a "balanced pelvis" based on the categorization by SS and PT. Conclusion. Analysis of sagittal alignment of high-grade spondylolisthesis patients revealed distinct groups termed "balanced" and "unbalanced" pelvis. The PT and SS were similar in controls and balanced pelvis patients. Unbalanced pelvis patients had a sagittal spinal alignment that differed from the balanced pelvis and control groups. Treatment strategies for high-grade spondylolisthesis should reflect the different mechanical strain on the spinopelvic junction in each group; reduction techniques might be considered in patients with an unbalanced pelvis high-grade spondylolisthesis.

In WSNs with tiny sensors, mobility of a sink may provide an energy efficient way for data dissemination. Having a mobile sink in WSN, however, creates new challenges to routing and sensor distribution modeling in the network. In this paper, based on clustering and routing optimization algorithms, we propose a new scheme called K-means and TSP-based mobility (KAT mobility). After clustering the sensor nodes, the proposed method navigates the mobile sink to traverse through the cluster centers according to the trajectory of an optimized route. The mobile sink then collects the data from sensors at the visited clusters. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can provide not only better energy efficiency as compared to those obtained by conventional methods which assume random waypoint for the mobile sink, but also fault-resilience in case of malfunctions of some sensors due to attacks.

Chemical composition and differential time-series CCD photometry of V2314 Ophiuchi: A new lambda Bootis-type star	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars : abundances; stars : individual ( V2314 Ophiuchi SX Phoenicis, delta Scuti lambda Bootis); stars : oscillations	AMPLITUDE DELTA-SCUTI; SX PHOENICIS STARS; NON-LTE ABUNDANCES; VW-ARIETIS; PHE STARS; COMPONENTS; LIGHT; PULSATION; SEARCH; SYSTEM	We investigated V2314 Oph using high-resolution ( R = 45,000) spectral observations. The atmospheric parameters were determined using iron-line abundance analysis. We derived a mean effective temperature of T-eff = 7510 K, mean surface gravity of log g = 3.30, metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.59, and rotation velocity of nu sin i = 38 km s(-1). The abundances of 19 chemical elements were determined. The abundance pattern of V2314Oph was found to be similar to that of lambda Bootis-type stars. V2314 Oph is also a variable star, as are a majority of lambda Bootis stars. A frequency analysis of 10 selected nights of precise differential photometry has preliminarily revealed four pulsational modes. The multiperiodic solution of the light curve is probably more similar to a low-amplitude Population I delta Scuti variable pattern, as is apparent for many lambda Bootis stars. For asteroseismic investigations of the star it is necessary to obtain more prolonged, continuous time-series observations. These features, as well as the small proper motion and relatively large rotational velocity of V2314 Oph, specify the star as not likely to be a field SX Phoenicis Population II variable, as was suggested previously.

Penalized and weighted K-means for clustering with scattered objects and prior information in high-throughput biological data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MIXTURE MODEL; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; EM ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Motivation: Cluster analysis is one of the most important data mining tools for investigating high-throughput biological data. The existence of many scattered objects that should not be clustered has been found to hinder performance of most traditional clustering algorithms in such a high- dimensional complex situation. Very often, additional prior knowledge from databases or previous experiments is also available in the analysis. Excluding scattered objects and incorporating existing prior information are desirable to enhance the clustering performance. Results: In this article, a class of loss functions is proposed for cluster analysis and applied in high- throughput genomic and proteomic data. Two major extensions from K-means are involved: penalization and weighting. The additive penalty term is used to allow a set of scattered objects without being clustered. Weights are introduced to account for prior information of preferred or prohibited cluster patterns to be identified. Their relationship with the classification likelihood of Gaussian mixture models is explored. Incorporation of good prior information is also shown to improve the global optimization issue in clustering. Applications of the proposed method on simulated data as well as high- throughput data sets from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and microarray experiments are presented. Our results demonstrate its superior performance over most existing methods and its computational simplicity and extensibility in the application of large complex biological data sets.

J	Qiu, J; Hwang, JTG				Qiu, Jing; Hwang, J. T. Gene			Sharp simultaneous confidence intervals for the means of selected Populations with application to microarray data analysis	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Bonferroni simultaneous confidence intervals; differential expression; empirical Bayes approach; inference after selection; random effect models	DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION; VARIANCE; MODELS	Simultaneous inference for a large number, N, of parameters is a challenge. In some situations, such as microarray experiments, researchers are only interested in making inference for the K parameters corresponding to the K most extreme estimates. Hence it seems important to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for these K parameters. The naive simultaneous confidence intervals for the K means (applied directly without taking into account the selection) have low coverage probabilities. We take an empirical Bayes approach (or an approach based on the random effect model) to construct simultaneous confidence intervals with good coverage probabilities. For N = 10,000 and K = 100, typical for microarray data, our confidence intervals could be 77% shorter than the naive K-dimensional simultaneous intervals.

J	Moore, TR; Bubier, JL; Bledzki, L				Moore, Tim R.; Bubier, Jill L.; Bledzki, Leszek			Litter decomposition in temperate peatland ecosystems: The effect of substrate and site	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						bog; fen; sedge; moss; shrub; roots	SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; LEAF-LITTER; CARBON ACCUMULATION; NORTHERN PEATLANDS; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; OMBROTROPHIC BOG; VASCULAR PLANTS; BOREAL ALBERTA; LONG-TERM; SPHAGNUM	The large accumulation of organic matter in peat-lands is primarily caused by slow rates of litter decomposition. We determined rates of decomposition of major peat-forming litters of vascular plants and mosses at five sites: a poor fen in New Hampshire and a bog hummock, a poor fen, a beaver pond margin and a beaver pond in Ontario. We used the litterbag technique, retrieving triplicate litterbags six or seven times over 3-5 years, and found that simple exponential decay and continuous-quality non-linear regression models could adequately characterize the decomposition in most cases. Within each site, the rate of decomposition at the surface was generally Typha latifolia leaves = Chamaedaphne calyculata leaves = Carex leaves > Chamaedaphne calyculata stems > hummock Sphagnum = lawn/hollow Sphagnum, with exponential decay constant (k) values generally ranging from 0.05 to 0.37 and continuous-quality model initial quality (qo) values ranging from 1.0 (arbitrarily set for Typha leaves) to 0.7 (Sphagnum). In general, surface decay rates were slowest at the bog hummock site, which had the lowest water table, and in the beaver pond, which was inundated, and fastest at the fens. The continuous-quality model site decomposition parameter (up) ranged from 0.80 to 0.17. Analysis of original litter samples for carbon, nitrogen and proximate fractions revealed a relatively poor explanation of decomposition rates, as defined by k and q(0), compared to most well-drained ecosystems. Three litters, roots of sedge and a shrub and Typha leaves, were placed at depths of 10, 30 and 60 em at the sites. Decomposition rates decreased with depth at each site, with k means of 0.15, 0.08 and 0.05 y(-1) at 10, 30 and 60 cm, respectively, and up of 0.25, 0.13 and 0.07. These differences are primarily related to the position of the water table at each site and to a lesser extent the cooler temperatures in the lower layers of the peat. The distinction between bog and fen was less important than the position of the water table. These results show that we can characterize decomposition rates of surface litter in northern peatlands, but given the large primary productivity below-ground in these ecosystems, and the differential rates of decomposition with depth, subsurface input and decomposition of organic matter is an important and relatively uncertain attribute.

By exploiting the inherent symmetry of the underlying optimal Bayesian detection solution, this SRBF detector is capable of realizing the optimal Bayesian performance by clustering noisy observation data using an enhanced K-means clustering algorithm. The proposed adaptive solution provides a signal-to-noise ratio gain in excess of 8 dB against the theoretical linear minimum bit error rate benchmark, when supporting five users with the aid of three receive antennas.

Wavelet analysis is used to decompose the EEG into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands. Three parameters are employed for EEG representation: standard deviation (quantifying the signal variance), correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent (quantifying the non-linear chaotic dynamics of the signal). The classification accuracies of the following techniques are compared: 1) unsupervised k-means clustering; 2) linear and quadratic discriminant analysis-, 3) radial basis function neural network; 4) Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMBPNN). To reduce the computing time and output analysis, the research was performed in two phases: band-specific analysis and mixed-band analysis. In phase two, over 500 different combinations of mixed-band feature spaces consisting of promising parameters from phase one of the research were investigated. It is concluded that all three key components of the wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology are important for improving the EEG classification accuracy. Judicious combinations of parameters and classifiers are needed to accurately discriminate between the three types of EEGs. It was discovered that a particular mixed-band feature space consisting of nine parameters and LMBPNN result in the highest classification accuracy, a high value of 96.7%.

However, in many clustering applications, the actual number of clusters is unknown beforehand. The general solution to this type of a clustering problem is that one selects or defines a cluster validity index and performs a traditional clustering algorithm for all possible numbers of clusters in sequence to find the clustering with the best cluster validity. This is tedious and time-consuming work. To easily and effectively determine the optimal number of clusters and, at the same time, construct the clusters with good validity, we propose a framework of automatic clustering algorithms (called ETSAs) that do not require users to give each possible value of required parameters (including the number of clusters). ETSAs treat the number of clusters as a variable, and evolve it to an optimal number. Through experiments conducted on nine test data sets, we compared the ETSA with five traditional clustering algorithms. We demonstrate the superiority of the ETSA in finding the correct number of clusters while constructing clusters with good validity.

Similarities between the structures of many tissue engineering polymers may make them difficult to distinguish from the polymer used to embed explants prior to histological sectioning. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a chemical imaging method, Raman microscopv, to discriminate between more than one polymer species. From the perspective of spectroscopy, this is not a straightforward process because of the emergence of multiple peaks, ubiquity of embedding medium, and presence of observations sourcing from points sampled at the interface of two phases. A multivariate K-means data clustering method was used to discriminate between different polymeric components. The method was able to classify 95% of the observations to the correct category. The remaining data displayed multiple memberships because of (1) the laser spot coinciding with the interfaces of more than one phase or (2) infiltration of histological embedding polymer.

Differentials-based segmentation and parameterization for point-sampled surfaces	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						computer graphics; point-sampled surface; segmentation; parameterization; k-means clustering; multidimensional scaling	GEOMETRY; RECONSTRUCTION; 3D	Efficient parameterization of point-sampled surfaces is a fundamental problem in the field of digital geometry processing. In order to parameterize a given point-sampled surface for minimal distance distortion, a differentials-based segmentation and parameterization approach is proposed in this paper. Our approach partitions the point-sampled geometry based on two criteria: variation of Euclidean distance between sample points, and angular difference between surface differential directions. According to the analysis of normal curvatures for some specified directions, a new projection approach is adopted to estimate the local surface differentials. Then a k-means clustering (k-MC) algorithm is used for partitioning the model into a set of charts based on the estimated local surface attributes. Finally, each chart is parameterized with a statistical method-multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach, and the parameterization results of all charts form an atlas for compact storage.

Students' Conceptions of Research. 2: An exploration of contrasting patterns of variation	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						conceptions of research; research as learning; dissonance		This study explores variation in postgraduate students' and supervisors' conceptions of research. Based on earlier work, a Conceptions of Research Inventory (CoRI) was trialled on a mixed sample of postgraduate students and supervisors (n=251). Exploratory factor analyses of resultant data yields a five-dimensional empirical model, the composition of which is consistent with earlier work by the present authors. Four of these five dimensions distinguish between (variation in) conceptions of research such as "truth", "problem-solving", "re-search", and "an insightful process". The fifth dimension captures variation in terms of what are interpreted as "misconceptions". The discrete conceptual dimensions suggested within the factor model are further explored via k-means cluster analyses in terms of partitioning of the dataset, as limited by sample sizes, according to postgraduate status and supervisor designation. These analyses provide further insights into variation, across the various clusters in each case, as expressed in the profiles of cluster mean scores. Such differences as are evidenced highlight contrasting patterns of variation between, for example, experienced and novice researchers. There is also evidence of dissonance in some of the cluster solutions and it is further demonstrated via analysis of variance that dissonant cluster membership is associated with a generally lower level of self-estimated performance. The implications of these findings are finally considered in relation to postgraduate training and supervision.	[Meyer, Jan H. F.] Univ Durham, Sch Educ, Durham DH1 1TA, England; [Meyer, Jan H.

The objective of this study is to investigate the concept of VQ in the setting of fuzzy sets by forming a coherent algorithmic framework referred to as a fuzzy VQ (FVQ). Given the nature of the framework of VQ in which fuzzy sets are involved, we may refer to the discussed processes of FVQ as a fuzzy granulation and fuzzy degranulation. In comparison to the winner-takes-all strategy encountered in VQ where a result of decoding typically arises as a single element of the codebook, in the FVQ we exploit an efficient usage of all components of the codebook (fuzzy sets) in the reconstruction of the original data. In this study, we present a complete development scheme of the FVQ and elaborate on its essential features. Its main design phases involve: (a) an encoding in which we encode data in terms of the elements of the given codebook; (b) a decoding during which we reconstruct the original data; and (c) a development of the codebook. The mechanisms of encoding and decoding are created as a result of some well-formed optimization tasks. The buildup of the codebook is completed through a mechanism of global optimization realized in the form of the particle swarm optimization (PSO). We offer a collection of experiments using synthetic data by focusing on and quantifying the role of fuzzy sets in VQ While FVQ outperforms VQ (which seems to be an intuitively appealing finding), we also show that this improvement could be achieved through a careful optimization of the elements of the granulation scheme. It is also shown that without optimization of the FVQ scheme, the enhancements could not be possible or may become very much limited. A series of experiments involving synthetic data and data sets coming from the Machine Learning repository is included as well. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Same, A; Ambroise, C; Govaert, G				Same, Allou; Ambroise, Christophe; Govaert, Gerard			An online classification EM algorithm based on the mixture model	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						clustering; mixture model; EM; CEM; stochastic gradient; exponential family	MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD; CLUSTERING METHODS; INCOMPLETE DATA	Mixture model-based clustering is widely used in many applications. In certain real-time applications the rapid increase of data size with time makes classical clustering algorithms too slow. An online clustering algorithm based on mixture models is presented in the context of a real-time flaw-diagnosis application for pressurized containers which uses data from acoustic emission signals. The proposed algorithm is a stochastic gradient algorithm derived from the classification version of the EM algorithm (CEM). It provides a model-based generalization of the well-known online k-means algorithm, able to handle non-spherical clusters. Using synthetic and real data sets, the proposed algorithm is compared with the batch CEM algorithm and the online EM algorithm. The three approaches generate comparable solutions in terms of the resulting partition when clusters are relatively well separated, but online algorithms become faster as the size of the available observations increases.

Method: The study included 541 women living in the area of the 7th Primary Health Care Center of Manisa, Turkey. Face-to-face interviews were conducted and a sociodemographic data form, a DSM-IV diagnostic criteria form, and the premenstrual evaluation form (PEF) were administered. In the analysis of the data, K-means cluster analysis was performed and cluster analysis with 3 categories according to the severity was used. In the evaluation of the 18 subscales possible maximum variation quotient is obtained by dividing the maximum possible PEF score to the scores the subjects got. In the group comparison analyses, chi-square test for the categorical variables, and t-test for continuous variables were used. Results: Among the study group, 6.1% had severe PMS symptoms and 72.2% of these women had some dysfunction as defined by DSM-IV The most common symptoms were feeling irritable and restless (72%), anxiety (67.3%), feeling fullness, discomfort or pain in the abdomen (66.6%), lack of energy or easily fatigued (66.6%), and fatigue in the legs (65.5%). Conclusion: The prevalence of the risk of PMS was 6.1%. The most common and severe PMS symptoms were feeling irritable and restless.			drhadiguzel@superonline.com					American Psychiatric Association, 1994, DIAGN STAT MENT DIS; ANDERSCH B, 1986, Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology, V5, P39, DOI 10.3109/01674828609016741; Angst J, 2001, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V104, P110, DOI 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.00412.x; Chang G, 1991, Conn Med, V55, P683; Chau JPC, 1998, J ADOLESCENT HEALTH, V22, P247, DOI 10.1016/S1054-139X(97)00206-1; Cohen LS, 2002, J AFFECT DISORDERS, V70, P125, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00458-X; CONDON JT, 1993, BRIT J PSYCHIAT, V162, P481, DOI 10.1192/bjp.162.4.481; Danaci AE, 2001, ANADOLU PSIKIYATRI D, V2, P15; Dereboy C, 1994, TURK PSIKIYATR DERG, V5, P83; Freeman EW, 1998, PSYCHOPHARMACOL BULL, V34, P291; FREEMAN EW, 1993, J PSYCHOSOM OBST GYN, V14, P41, DOI 10.3109/01674829309084429; Gehlert S, 1999, J WOMENS HEALTH, V8, P75, DOI 10.1089/jwh.1999.8.75; Gehlert S, 1997, J PSYCHOSOM OBST GYN, V18, P36, DOI 10.3109/01674829709085567; GIROLAMO G, 1989, PSYCHOTHER PSYCOSOM, V52, P187; GOKKURT S, 1999, TURKIYE PSIKIYATRI, V2, P123; GRAZE KK, 1990, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V81, P201, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb06479.x; Halbreich U, 1996, PSYCHIAT ANN, V26, P581; HALBREICH U, 1982, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V65, P47; Halbreich U, 2003, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINO, V28, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4530(03)00098-2; HARRISON WM, 1989, PSYCHOSOMATICS, V30, P405; HUERTAFRANCO MR, 1993, J REPROD MED, V38, P448; HURT SW, 1992, AM J PSYCHIAT, V149, P525; KHELLA AK, 1992, EGYPT PUBLIC HLTH AS, V67, P109; Kolarov G, 1996, Akush Ginekol (Sofiia), V35, P10; MAO K, 1985, OBSTET GYNECOL, V25, P118; Muderns II, 1999, KLIN PSIKIYATRI, V2, P197; OZMENLER KN, 1997, BAHAR SEMPOZYUMLARI, V2, P17; Pearlstein T, 1998, PSYCHIAT CLIN N AM, V21, P577, DOI 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70024-1; Perkonigg A, 2004, J CLIN PSYCHIAT, V65, P1314; PETERSEN JL, 1987, OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGY, P619; PLOUFFE L, 1993, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V169, P295; RIVERATOVAR AD, 1990, AM J PSYCHIAT, V147, P403; SEVERINO SK, 1989, AM J PSYCHIAT, V146, P1155; Steiner M, 1996, PSYCHIAT ANN, V26, P571; USTUN N, 2003, PREMENSTRUEL DISFORI, V39, P706; WILSON CA, 1989, J ADOLESCENT HEALTH, V10, P317, DOI 10.1016/0197-0070(89)90065-X; Wittchen HU, 2002, PSYCHOL MED, V32, P119; Yonkers KA, 1997, J CLIN PSYCHIAT, V58, P62; YONKERS KA, 2000, COMPREHENSIVE TXB PS, V7, P1952; Yonkers KA, 1997, J CLIN PSYCHIAT, V58, P4	40	7	7	TURKIYE SINIR VE RUH SAGLIGI DERNEGI	YENISEHIR	PK 401, YENISEHIR, 06442, TURKEY	1300-2163			TURK PSIKIYATR DERG	Turk.

Long-term variability of daily North Atlantic-European pressure patterns since 1850 classified by simulated annealing clustering	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS; LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION; OBJECTIVE CLASSIFICATION; WEATHER REGIMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; NUMBER	Reconstructed daily mean sea level pressure patterns of the North Atlantic - European region are classified for the period 1850 to 2003 to explore long- term changes of the atmospheric circulation and its impact on long- term temperature variability in the central European region. Commonly used k- means clustering algorithms resulted in classifications of low quality because of methodological deficiencies leading to local optima by chance for complex datasets. In contrast, a newly implemented clustering scheme combining the concepts of simulated annealing and diversified randomization ( SANDRA) is able to reduce substantially the influence of chance in the cluster assignment, leading to partitions that are noticeably nearer to the global optimum and more stable. The differences between conventional cluster analysis and the SANDRA scheme are significant for subsequent analyses of single clusters - in particular, for trend analysis. Conventional indices used to determine the appropriate number of clusters failed to provide clear guidance, indicating that no distinct separation between clusters of circulation types exists in the dataset. Therefore, the number of clusters is determined by an external indicator, the so- called dominance criteria for t- mode principal component analysis. Nevertheless, the resulting partitions are stable for certain numbers of clusters and provide meaningful and reproducible clusters. The resulting types of pressure patterns reveal pronounced long- term variability and various significant trends of the time series of seasonal cluster frequency. Tentative estimations of central European temperature changes based solely on seasonal cluster frequencies can explain between 33.9% ( summer) and 59.0% ( winter) of temperature variance on the seasonal time scale. However, the signs of long- term changes in temperature are correctly reproduced even on multidecadal - centennial time scales. Moreover, linear warming trends are reproduced, implying from one- third up to one- half of the observed temperature increase between 1851/ 52 and 2003 ( except for summer, but with significant trends for spring and autumn), indicating that changes in daily circulation patterns contribute to the observed overall long- term warming in the central European region.

The effect of sample size on the extended self-organizing map network - A market segmentation application	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						SOM neural network; extended SOM network; factor analysis; K-means cluster analysis; market segmentation; sample sizes	NEURAL NETWORKS; VISUALIZATION	Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) network maps input data to a lower dimensional output map. The extended SOM network further groups the nodes on the output map into a user specified number of clusters. Kiang, Hu and Fisher used the extended SOM network for market segmentation and showed that the extended SOM provides better results than the statistical approach that reduces the dimensionality of the problem via factor analysis and then forms segments with cluster analysis. In this study, we examined the effect of sample size on the extended SOM compared to that on the factor/cluster approach. Two sampling schemes, one with random sampling and the other one with proportionate sampling were used. Comparisons were made using the correct classification rates between the two approaches at various sample sizes. Unlike statistical models, neural networks are not dependent on statistical assumptions. Thus, the results for neural network models are stable across sample sizes but sensitive to initial weights and model specifications. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Clustering data with measurement errors	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						maximum likelihood; model-based clustering; time-series clustering; Markov chains clustering; income data		Traditional clustering methods assume that there is no measurement error, or uncertainty, associated with data. Often, however, real world applications require treatment of data that have such errors. In the presence of measurement errors, well-known clustering methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering may not produce satisfactory results. In this article, we develop a statistical model and algorithms for clustering data in the presence of errors. We assume that the errors associated with data follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and are independent between data points. The model uses the maximum likelihood principle and provides us with a new metric for clustering. This metric is used to develop two algorithms for error-based clustering, hError and kError, that are generalizations of Ward's hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms, respectively. We discuss types of clustering problems where error information associated with the data to be clustered is readily available and where error-based clustering is likely to be superior to clustering methods that ignore error. We focus on clustering derived data (typically parameter estimates) obtained by fitting statistical models to the observed data. We show that, for Gaussian distributed observed data, the optimal error-based clusters of derived data are the same as the maximum likelihood clusters of the observed data. We also report briefly on two applications with real-world data and a series of simulation studies using four statistical models: (1) sample averaging, (2) multiple linear regression, (3) ARIMA models for time-series, and (4) Markov chains, where error-based clustering performed significantly better than traditional clustering methods.

J	Liang, F				Liang, Faming			Use of SVD-based probit transformation in clustering gene expression profiles	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						gene expression profiles; model-based clustering; probit transformation; singular value decomposition	MIXTURE MODEL; PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; DATA/	The mixture-Gaussian model-based clustering method has received much attention in clustering gene expression profiles in the literature of bioinformatics. However, this method suffers from two difficulties in applications. The first one is on the parameter estimation, which becomes difficult when the dimension of the data is high or the size of a cluster is small. The second one is on the normality assumption for gene expression levels, which is seldom satisfied by real data. In this paper, we propose to overcome these two difficulties by the probit transformation in conjunction with the singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD reduces the dimensionality of the data, and the probit transformation converts the scaled eigensamples, which can be interpreted as correlation coefficients as explained in the text, into Gaussian random variables. Our numerical results show that the SVD-based probit transformation enhances the ability of the mixture-Gaussian model-based clustering method for identifying prominent patterns of the data. As a by-product, we show that the SVD-based probit transformation also improves the performance of the model-free clustering methods, such as hierarchical, K-means and self-organizing maps (SOM), for the data sets containing scattered genes. In this paper, we also propose a run test-based rule for selection of eigensamples used for clustering. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods to interpolate soil categorical variables from profile observations: Lessons from Iran	GEODERMA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Pedometrics Meeting 2005	SEP 12-14, 2005	Naples, FL			categorical variables; terrain parameters; MODIS; multinominal logistic regression; fuzzy k-means; regression-kriging	SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	The paper compares semi-automated interpolation methods to produce soil-class maps from profile observations and by using multiple auxiliary predictors such as terrain parameters, remote sensing indices and similar. The Soil Profile Database of Iran, consisting of 4250 profiles, was used to test different soil-class interpolators. The target variables were soil texture classes and World Reference Base soil groups. The predictors were 6 terrain parameters, 11 MODIS EVI images and 17 physiographic regions (polygon map) of Iran. Four techniques were considered: (a) supervised classification using maximum likelihoods; (b) multinominal logistic regression; (c) regression-kriging on memberships; and (d) classification of taxonomic distances. The predictive capabilities were assessed using a control subset of 30% profiles and the kappa statistics as criterion. Supervised classification and multinominal logistic regression can lead to poor results if soil-classes overlap in the feature space, or if the correlation between the soil-classes and predictors is low. The two other methods have better predictive capabilities, although both are computationally more demanding. For both mapping of texture classes and soil types, the best prediction was achieved using regression-kriging of indicators/memberships (kappa=45%, kappa=54%). In all cases kappa was smaller than 60%, which can be explained by the preferential sampling plan, the poor definition of soil-classes and the high variability of soils. Steps to improve interpolation of soil-class data, by taking into account the fuzziness of classes directly on the field are further discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cluster validation for electronic nose data	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						electronic nose; exploratory data analysis; cluster analysis; cluster validity; unsupervised classification	CHEMICAL SENSOR ARRAY; DATA SET; CRITERIA; STRAINS; NUMBER	In the gas sensor field, principal component analysis (PCA) is still the mostly used technique for exploratory data analysis, although the human judgment of PCA plots often determines the classification results. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on cluster analysis (CA) in combination with cluster validity (CLV) that can be used to objectively infer and assess the data structure. Hierarchical and k-means clustering methods are implemented together with four indices of CLV, aiming to estimating the best partition of data. We initially demonstrate the approach on simulated data sets, and then we apply it to the experimental data coming from an electronic nose. With reference to the e-nose data, the unsupervised classification results are consistent with those achieved by the visual inspection of data through PCA plots. In addition, CLV gives quantitative information about the classification strength of the data categories; this allows to understand which of the different categories better describes the data set. The proposed method, due to its reliability and objectivity, can be used for an automated and standardized evaluation of data in gas sensor devices. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, J; Chen, W				Li, Junhua; Chen, Wenjun			Clustering synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery using an automatic approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL	Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been shown to be useful for land surface applications. Similar to optical imagery, unsupervised or supervised algorithms can also be used to classify SAR data. Supervised classification methods require a priori information, which is usually not available, especially over a large area. Similarly, existing unsupervised classification methods based on clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means and ISODATA) require control input parameters, such as the number of clusters, which are difficult to obtain over a large area. In this paper, we present a new automated clustering method for SAR imagery that does not require input of control parameters. The main advantage of this method over other methods is the capability to automatically determine the number of statistically separable clusters in a SAR image. The performance of the method is assessed over two test sites.

First, seed cells and region growing criteria are specified. Then an object partition framework is defined on the basis of region growing segmentation. Size filtering is applied to objects and connected components labelling identifies background and foreground objects that are parametrically represented on the basis of elevation and slope. K-means classification reveals a set of clusters. The interpretation of the spatial distribution of clusters assisted by the interpretation of cluster centroids, allows for the identification of the building class, as well as building sub-classes with different geomorphometric characteristics.

The systems are constructed as either single or two-stages. In contrast to single-stage systems, the two-stage system comprises a pre-classifier stage realized by a neural network. The FCM based two-stage system is also compared to a similar system implemented using the K-means clustering algorithm. The results imply that an FCM based two-stage system should be preferred as the spike detection System. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, we use k-means clustering algorithm classify data and extract abnormal data from the normal data in intrusion detection. But, it is known that k-means technique is especially sensitive to initial starting conditions and converges to local minima. In this paper, a detection method combining k-means clustering with simulated annealing algorithm is proposed. Simulated annealing has powerful search capability and optimization performance in complex problems, the introduction of the simulated annealing into the intrusion detection is to make the convergence of k-means algorithm to the global optimization and reduce the dependence on the initial conditions. The experiments with KDD cup 1999 show that the proposed approach is effective for intrusion detection.

However, traditional market segm.entation ntethod such as K-7neans needs the statistical assumptions and violation, of the assumptions may lead to bias and incorrect market segmentation.. Artificial Neural Network market segmentation suffers from the overfitting. As a nonparametric and unsupervised learning neural networks, Self-organizing map (SOM), which makes no assumptions about the underlying population. distribution, may be more appropriate than parametric model for market segmentation. To carry out a new exploratory segmentation of market,. this paper proposes a new three-step method including introducing an improved SOM and building an evaluation system.. Firstly, use factor analysis to eliminate factors with low loadings or loadings on multiple constructs. Secondly, introduce an improved Self-organizing map (SOM) method to cluster the market. Finally we compare the K-means clustering method with the proposed three-step method. The experiment indicates that our method has achieved better performance than the combination of factor analysis and K-means cluster of market segmentation.

It has become a vital factor to reduce the efficiency of sorting of the conventional multi-parameters signal sorting system. Secondly, a de-interleaving/recognition system of radar pulses is presented that based on the combination of SVC and K-means clustering. Compared the conventional de-interleaving system, it can produce more complex and compact clustering boundaries according to the distribution characteristics of data set and has good generalization performance. It prevented tolerance from affecting radar signal sorting. The simulation experiment result shows that the system can sort efficiently radar signals in the high density and complex pulses environment.

Prospective dynamic balance control in healthy children and adults	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						dynamic balance; gait initiation; movement control; prospective control; Tau-G analysis; children	HUMAN POSTURAL CONTROL; STANDING BALANCE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; WALKING; GAIT; ACQUISITION; INFORMATION; INITIATION; VISION; STANCE	Balance control during gait initiation was studied using center of pressure (CoP) data from force plate measurements. Twenty-four participants were divided into four age groups: (1) 2-3 years, (2) 4-5 years, (3) 7-8 years, and (4) adults. Movement in the antero-posterior (CoPy) direction during the initial step was tau-G analyzed, investigating the hypothesis that tau of the CoPy motion-gap (tau(CoPy)), i.e., the time it will take to close the gap at its current closure rate, is tau-coupled onto an intrinsic tau-G guide (tau(G)), by maintaining the relation tau(CoPy) = K tau(G), for a constant K. Mean percentage of tau-guidance for all groups was >= 99%, resulting in all r(2) exceeding 0.95, justifying an investigation of the regression slope as an estimate of the coupling constant K in the tau-coupling equation. Mean K values decreased significantly with age and were for 2- to 3-year-olds 0.56, for 4- to 5-year-olds 0.50, for 7- to 8-year-olds 0.47, and for adults 0.41. Therefore, the control of dynamic balance develops from the youngest children colliding with the boundaries of the base of support (K > 0.5) to the older children and adults making touch contact (K <= 0.5). The findings may provide us with a measure for testing prospective balance control, a helpful tool in assessing whether a child is following a normal developmental pattern.

The purpose of clustering in this paper is to help the foundry more effectively assign a family of machines to orders that appear in various forms such as emergent or quality-demanding and are highly dynamic in nature. Given the clusters, we use the technique of parallel coordinates to plot each attribute's centers in clusters so that the foundry can take advantage of visualization to determine what machines can be assigned to orders. To plot these centers, we map the input values into the range of -1 and +1 so that proper parallel coordinates can be used. Originating from the graphs, we also compare the same machines appearing in clusters that are produced by applying different clustering methods. These identical machines form the important basis to support the clustering results for the management of machines. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our new algorithm is motivated by the fact that terminal reduction can lead to a more compact order-reduced model and the observation that very large-scale integration interconnect circuits have many similar terminals in terms of their timing and delay metrics due to their closeness in structure or due to the mathematical discretization using meshing in finite-difference or finite-element scheme during the extraction process. The new method, called TermMerg (Proc. ICCAD, p. 821, 2005), is based on the moments of the circuits as the metrics for the timing or delay. It then employs a singularvalue-decomposition (SVD) method to determine the best number of clusters based on the low-rank approximation. After this, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the moments of the terminals into the different clusters. The proposed method can work with any passive-model order reduction and ensure the passive models. In contrast, we show that singular value decomposition model order reduction (SVDMOR) does not generate passive models in general. Passivity enforcement in SVDMOR will significantly hamper the terminal-reduction effectiveness. Experimental results on a number of real industry interconnect circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show also that the proposed method is more accurate than SVDMOR when the used moment matrix does not give good terminal correlations.

J	Jing, L; Ng, MK; Huang, JZ				Jing, Liping; Ng, Michael K.; Huang, Joshua Zhexue			An entropy weighting k-means algorithm for subspace clustering of high-dimensional sparse data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						k-means clustering; variable weighting; subspace clustering; text clustering; high-dimensional data		This paper presents a new k-means type algorithm for clustering high-dimensional objects in subspaces. In high-dimensional data, clusters of objects often exist in subspaces rather than in the entire space. For example, in text clustering, clusters of documents of different topics are categorized by different subsets of terms or keywords. The keywords for one cluster may not occur in the documents of other clusters. This is a data sparsity problem faced in clustering high-dimensional data. In the new algorithm, we extend the k-means clustering process to calculate a weight for each dimension in each cluster and use the weight values to identify the subsets of important dimensions that categorize different clusters. This is achieved by including the weight entropy in the objective function that is minimized in the k-means clustering process. An additional step is added to the k-means clustering process to automatically compute the weights of all dimensions in each cluster. The experiments on both synthetic and real data have shown that the new algorithm can generate better clustering results than other subspace clustering algorithms. The new algorithm is also scalable to large data sets.

It is based on pattern recognition methods, such as k-means, Kohonen adaptive vector quantization, fuzzy k-means, and hierarchical clustering, which are theoretically described and properly adapted. In the first stage, typical chronological load curves of various customers are estimated using pattern recognition methods, and their results are compared using six adequacy measures. In the second stage, classification of customers is performed by the same methods and measures, together with the representative load patterns of customers being obtained from the first stage. The results of the first stage can be used for load forecasting of customers and determination of tariffs. The results of the second stage provide valuable information for electricity suppliers in competitive energy markets. The developed methodology is applied on a set of medium voltage customers of the Greek power system, and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

J	Zheng, R; Yu, W; Fan, JT				Zheng, Rong; Yu, Winnie; Fan, Jintu			Development of a new chinese bra sizing system based on breast anthropometric measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS			English	Article						bra sizing system; 3d breast anthropometric measurements; principle component factor analysis; K-means cluster analysis	SIZE	Since 1935, the bra sizing system has been based on bust girth and underbust girth. Woman's breast is however a very complex 3D geometry. the existing sizing system based on just two girth measurements may be inappropriate in the categorization of breast sizes for bras. Through analyzing the nude breast measurements from 456 subjects aged between 20 and 39, we hereby propose a new bra sizing system for Chinese women. The new sizing system uses underbust girth and the breast depth width ratio as the classifying parameters. They were identified through principal component factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis as the two most critical parameters out of 98 measurements obtained from 3D body scanning and 5 supplementary manual measurements as well as other relevant breast parameters including breast angles, distance, width, thickness, volume and curvature. Relevance to industry The existing bra sizing system is inadequate in classifying breast sizes for bras. This paper presents a method for classifying nude breast shape for establishing a new bra sizing system. The application of the new sizing system will be important to improve fitting comfort in intimate apparel. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, Q; Gong, J; Zhang, YT				Zhu, Qing; Gong, Jun; Zhang, Yeting			An efficient 3D R-tree spatial index method for virtual geographic environments	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						virtual geographic environments; 3D spatial index; R-tree; spatial cluster grouping		A three-dimensional (3D) spatial index is required for real time applications of integrated organization and management in virtual geographic environments of above ground, underground, indoor and outdoor objects. Being one of the most promising methods, the R-tree spatial index has been paid increasing attention in 3D geospatial database management. Since the existing R-tree methods are usually limited by their weakness of low efficiency, due to the critical overlap of sibling nodes and the uneven size of nodes, this paper introduces the k-means clustering method and employs the 3D overlap volume, 3D coverage volume and the minimum bounding box shape value of nodes as the integrative grouping criteria. A new spatial cluster grouping algorithm and R-tree insertion algorithm is then proposed. Experimental analysis on comparative performance of spatial indexing shows that by the new method the overlap of R-tree sibling nodes is minimized drastically and a balance in the volumes of the nodes is maintained.

J	Chen, Y; Zhang, G; Hu, D; Fu, C				Chen, Yun; Zhang, Guozheng; Hu, Dengfeng; Fu, Chuan			Customer segmentation based on survival character	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	PROLAMAT 2006 Conference on Knowledge Enterprise	JUN 15-17, 2006	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IFIP TC5	Shanghai Univ	customer segmentation; survival character; data mining; survival analysis	MARKET	Customer Segmentation is an increasingly pressing issue in today's over-competitive commercial area. More and more literatures have researched the application of data mining technology in customer segmentation, and achieved sound effectives. But most of them segment customer only by single data mining technology from a special view, rather than from systematical framework. Furthermore, one of the key purposes of customer segmentation is customer retention. Although previous segment methods may identify which group needs more care, it is unable to identify customer churn trend for taking different actions. This paper focus on proposing a customer segmentation framework based on data mining and constructs a new customer segmentation method based on survival character. The new customer segmentation method consists of two steps. Firstly, with K-means clustering arithmetic, customers are clustered into different segments in which customers have the similar survival characters (churn trend). Secondly, each cluster's survival/hazard function is predicted by survival analyzing, the validity of clustering is tested and customer churn trend is identified. The method mentioned above has been applied to a dataset from China Telecom, which acquired some useful management measures and suggestions. Some propositions for further research is also suggested.

Associations among empathy, social competence, & reactive/proactive aggression subtypes	JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE			English	Article						adolescence; aggression; proactive; reactive; empthy; social competence; expectation for reward	INFORMATION-PROCESSING FACTORS; PROACTIVE AGGRESSION; REACTIVE AGGRESSION; PEER GROUPS; INTRACLASS CORRELATION; RELATIONAL AGGRESSION; ELEMENTARY STUDENTS; YOUNG ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; ADJUSTMENT	Differences between proactive and reactive aggression subtypes on self-reported measures of empathy, social competence, and expectation for reward were examined among 433 middle school students (65.4% White, 33.9% Black). As hypothesized, males scored higher on proactive and reactive aggression scales and lower on empathy measures than females. K-means cluster analysis yielded the following four distinct groups: reactive, proactive, proactive/reactive aggressive, and uninvolved. Overall, uninvolved (nonaggressive youth) had higher empathy and social competence scores and lower expectation of reward for the use of aggression. The reactive and proactive groups did not differ significantly on study variables. Limitations and implications are discussed.

J	Madden, C; Cheng, EDH; Piccardi, M				Madden, Christopher; Cheng, Eric Dahai; Piccardi, Massimo			Tracking people across disjoint camera views by an illumination-tolerant appearance representation	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						tracking; disjoint camera views; colour histograms; online k-means clustering; object similarity measurement	RETRIEVAL; DISTANCE	Tracking single individuals as they move across disjoint camera views is a challenging task since their appearance may vary significantly between views. Major changes in appearance are due to different and varying illumination conditions and the deformable geometry of people. These effects are hard to estimate and take into account in real-life applications. Thus, in this paper we propose an illumination-tolerant appearance representation, which is capable of coping with the typical illumination changes occurring in surveillance scenarios. The appearance representation is based on an online k-means colour clustering algorithm, a data-adaptive intensity transformation and the incremental use of frames. A similarity measurement is also introduced to compare the appearance representations of any two arbitrary individuals. Post-matching integration of the matching decision along the individuals' tracks is performed in order to improve reliability and robustness of matching. Once matching is provided for any two views of a single individual, its tracking across disjoint cameras derives straightforwardly. Experimental results presented in this paper from a real surveillance camera network show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Chen, QR; Cham, WK; Lee, KK				Chen, Qinran; Cham, Wai-kuen; Lee, Kar-kin			Extracting eyebrow contour and chin contour for face recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						eyebrow; chin contour; face recognition; feature extraction		This paper proposes a novel method for extraction of eyebrow contour and chin contour. We first segment rough eyebrow regions using spatial constrained sub-area K-means clustering. Then eyebrow contours are extracted by Snake method with effective image force. For chin contour extraction, we first estimate several possible chin locations which are used to build a number of curves as chin contour candidates. Based on the chin like edges extracted by proposed chin edge detector, the curve with the largest likeliness to be the actual chin contour is selected. Finally, the credible extracted eyebrow contour and the estimated chin contours are used as geometric features for face recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can extract eyebrow contours and chin contours with good accuracy and the extracted features are effective for improving face recognition rates.

Organizing Gaussian mixture models into a tree for scaling up speaker retrieval	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						multimedia indexing and retrieval; speaker recognition; Gaussian mixture; tree-based indexing structure		Numerous pattern recognition tasks set in the probabilistic framework face the following issue: it is expensive to evaluate the likelihood function for test data, when there are given very many candidate probabilistic models for explaining this data. We consider the application of this general and important problem to speaker recognition for indexing and retrieval purposes in radio archives. More precisely, we propose to reduce complexity at query time, by prior organization of speaker models into a hierarchy. This is very classically done for multi-dimensional vectors, but we propose herein a technique for building a hierarchy of probabilistic models, in the case these models take the form of a Gaussian mixture. From a closed-form approximation of Kullback-Leibler divergence between parent and children, an optimality criterion and an optimization technique are derived, from which we propose an efficient approach for building a tree of models, using clustering techniques (dendrogram-based or k-means-like). The proposed scheme is evaluated on real data. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, T; Wang, YC				Chen, T.; Wang, Y-C			A fuzzy-neural system with error feedback to adjust classification for forecasting wafer lot flow time: a simulation study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						hybrid approach; back propagation network; fuzzy c-means; flow time prediction; wafer fabrication; simulation	DUE-DATE ASSIGNMENT; PREDICTION; RULES; SOM	Estimating lot flow (cycle) time is a critical task for a wafer fabrication plant (wafer fab). Many recent studies have shown that pre-classifying wafer lots before estimating the flow times is beneficial to estimation accuracy. In this aspect, various classification approaches, e.g. k-means (kM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), and self- organization map (SOM), have been applied. After pre-classification, to estimate the flow times for lots belonging to different categories, different approaches (that are in fact the same approaches but with different parameter settings) are applied. However, these applications of classification approaches considered only the data of wafer lots, but ignored whether the classification approaches combined with the subsequent estimation techniques were suitable for the data. To tackle this problem, instead of trying many possible classification and forecasting approaches to find out the most suitable combination, a FCM and back propagation network (BPN) combination is chosen in the current study. In the proposed methodology, the classification results by FCM will be adjusted with forecasting error fed back from the BPN. In this way, if the FCM-BPN combination is not good enough for the data, then a forecasting error will be generated and fed back to the FCM classifier to adjust the classification results. After some replications, the FCM-BPN combination will become more suitable for the data. To evaluate the effectiveness, production simulation is applied in the present study to generate test data. According to experimental results, the forecasting accuracy of the proposed methodology is significantly better than those of many existing approaches. The effects of adjusting classification results with prediction error are also revealed.

Some sparse source separation methods, which. rely on source sparseness and an anechoic mixing model, have already been proposed. These methods utilize level ratios and phase differences between sensor observations as their features, and they separate signals by classifying them. However, some of the features cannot form clusters with a well-known clustering algorithm, e.g., the k-means. Moreover, most previous methods utilize a linear sensor array (or only two sensors), and therefore they cannot separate symmetrically positioned sources. To overcome such problems, we propose a new feature that can be clustered by the k-means algorithm and that can be easily applied to more than three sensors arranged non-linearly. We have obtained promising results for two- and three-dimensionally distributed speech separation with non-linear/non-uniform sensor arrays in a real room even in underdetermined situations. We also investigate the way in which the performance of such methods is affected by room reverberation, which may cause the sparseness and anechoic assumptions to collapse. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Basing itself on a multivariate comparison, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) grouped 1292 samples collected in a 3-year-long monitoring program in 187 sets and identified a representative synthetic sample for each group. These groups were further classified in seven clusters, which identified the water typology. The complexity of the space and time coevolution of 12 variables was so reduced to variation of one categorical variable. Results included an objectively derived typology of water masses and their typical temporal succession, a spatial dividing based on biogeochemical processes, a conceptual scheme of biogeochemistry in the Gulf. Results clearly indicated the importance of river input in triggering plankton blooms and pointed out that trophodynamics followed current paradigms of marine ecosystem functioning, with shifts from conditions dominated by classical food chain to situations in which most of the energy flowed through the autotrophic and heterotrophic parts of the microbial food web.

J	Xu, D; Redman-Furey, N				Xu, Dong; Redman-Furey, Nancy			Statistical cluster analysis of pharmaceutical solvents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						cluster analysis; principal component analysis; solvent group; polymorph screening	SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP; CHROMATOGRAPHIC DATA; PARAMETERS; DESCRIPTORS; CONSTRUCTION; LIQUIDS; SCALES	High efficiency in polymorph screening and crystallization optimization can be gained by judicious selection of solvents for the study design. Examination of all 57 (classes 2 and 3) pharmaceutical solvents may enable a complete study design but is costly in terms of time and resources. Based on a 17 descriptor dataset specifically constructed for all the classes 2 and 3 pharmaceutical solvents recognized by the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH), an optimal two-stage cluster analysis was carried out together with principal component analysis as a dimensionality and colinearity reduction pre-processor. Both hierarchical average linkage cluster analysis and non-hierarchical K-means cluster analysis converged on a 20-cluster solution with strong statistical criteria support and excellent agreement in cluster memberships, which can be reasonably interpreted from a chemical perspective. This 20-cluster solution is offered as an option for design of more efficient solid state screening studies. Rather than designing a polymorph screen to include all 57 solvents, the inclusion of a single member from each of the 20 clusters would be expected to adequately represent the full range of solvent properties exhibited by the entire 57 member solvent set.

J	Fathian, M; Amiri, B; Maroosi, A				Fathian, Mohammad; Amiri, Babak; Maroosi, Ali			Application of honey-bee mating optimization algorithm on clustering	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						clustering; meta-heuristic; K-means; honey-bee	K-MEANS; SEARCH	Cluster analysis is one of attractive data mining technique that use in many fields. One popular class of data clustering algorithms is the center based clustering algorithm. K-means used as a popular clustering method due to its simplicity and high speed in clustering large datasets. However, K-means has two shortcomings: dependency on the initial state and convergence to local optima and global solutions of large problems cannot found with reasonable amount of computation effort. In order to overcome local optima problem lots of studies done in clustering. Over the last decade, modeling the behavior of social insects, such as ants and bees, for the purpose of search and problem solving has been the context of the emerging area of swarm intelligence. Honey-bees are among the most closely studied social insects. Honey-bee mating may also be considered as a typical swarm-based approach to optimization, in which the search algorithm is inspired by the process of marriage in real honey-bee. Honey-bee has been used to model agent-based systems. In this paper, we proposed application of honeybee mating optimization in clustering (HBMK-means). We compared HBMK-means with other heuristics algorithm in clustering, such as GA, SA, TS, and ACO, by implementing them on several well-known datasets. Our finding shows that the proposed algorithm works than the best one. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, J; Kim, JH				Kim, Jihoon; Kim, Ju Han			Difference-based clustering of short time-course microarray data with replicates	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; SERIES; SET	Background: There are some limitations associated with conventional clustering methods for short time-course gene expression data. The current algorithms require prior domain knowledge and do not incorporate information from replicates. Moreover, the results are not always easy to interpret biologically. Results: We propose a novel algorithm for identifying a subset of genes sharing a significant temporal expression pattern when replicates are used. Our algorithm requires no prior knowledge, instead relying on an observed statistic which is based on the first and second order differences between adjacent time-points. Here, a pattern is predefined as the sequence of symbols indicating direction and the rate of change between time-points, and each gene is assigned to a cluster whose members share a similar pattern. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm to those of K-means, Self-Organizing Map and the Short Time-series Expression Miner methods. Conclusions: Assessments using simulated and real data show that our method outperformed aforementioned algorithms. Our approach is an appropriate solution for clustering short time-course microarray data with replicates.

Nearest Neighbor Networks: clustering expression data based on gene neighborhoods	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							CDNA MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTS; YEAST; IDENTIFICATION; PROFILES; PATTERNS; SYSTEM	Background: The availability of microarrays measuring thousands of genes simultaneously across hundreds of biological conditions represents an opportunity to understand both individual biological pathways and the integrated workings of the cell. However, translating this amount of data into biological insight remains a daunting task. An important initial step in the analysis of microarray data is clustering of genes with similar behavior. A number of classical techniques are commonly used to perform this task, particularly hierarchical and K-means clustering, and many novel approaches have been suggested recently. While these approaches are useful, they are not without drawbacks; these methods can find clusters in purely random data, and even clusters enriched for biological functions can be skewed towards a small number of processes ( e. g. ribosomes). Results: We developed Nearest Neighbor Networks ( NNN), a graph-based algorithm to generate clusters of genes with similar expression profiles. This method produces clusters based on overlapping cliques within an interaction network generated from mutual nearest neighborhoods. This focus on nearest neighbors rather than on absolute distance measures allows us to capture clusters with high connectivity even when they are spatially separated, and requiring mutual nearest neighbors allows genes with no sufficiently similar partners to remain unclustered. We compared the clusters generated by NNN with those generated by eight other clustering methods. NNN was particularly successful at generating functionally coherent clusters with high precision, and these clusters generally represented a much broader selection of biological processes than those recovered by other methods. Conclusion: The Nearest Neighbor Networks algorithm is a valuable clustering method that effectively groups genes that are likely to be functionally related. It is particularly attractive due to its simplicity, its success in the analysis of large datasets, and its ability to span a wide range of biological functions with high precision.

This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example, "home", "work" or "Northwest Health Club". It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware applications in the dark about their choices. Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale experiment that collected real users' location data and personally meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence that shapes more complex than "points" are required to represent the full range of people's everyday places.
