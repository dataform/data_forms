The clusters are preliminarily determined at the first stage. The local outliers of each cluster are found out and their influences on the centroid are removed at the second stage. Global outliers are consequently identified. Finally, the clusters, the densities of which are similar and some parts of which overlap, are merged. Simulation results show that the algorithm supports the discovery of clusters of different densities, different sizes and non-spherical shapes.

Additionally, a robust method for hand tracking in a complex environment using Mean-shift analysis in conjunction with 3D depth map is introduced. The depth information solve the overlapping problem between hands and face, which is obtained by passive stereo measuring based on cross correlation and the known calibration data of the cameras. 3D combined features of location, orientation and velocity with respected to Cartesian systems are used. And then, k-means clustering is employed for HMMs codeword. The hand gesture path is recognized using Left-Right Banded topology (LRB) in conjunction Viterbi path. Experimental results demonstrate that, our system can successfully recognize hand gestures with 98.33% recognition rate.

Quality estimations are made using fault proneness data available from previously developed similar type of projects and the training data consisting of software measurements. To predict faulty modules in software data different techniques have been proposed which includes statistical method, machine learning methods, neural network techniques and clustering techniques. The aim of proposed approach is to investigate that whether metrics available in the early lifecycle (i.e. requirement metrics), metrics available in the late lifecycle (i.e. code metrics) and metrics available in the early lifecycle (i.e. requirement metrics) combined with metrics available in the late lifecycle (i.e. code metrics) can be used to identify fault prone modules by using clustering techniques. This approach has been tested with three real time defect datasets of NASA software projects, JM1, PC1 and CM1. Predicting faults early in the software life cycle can be used to improve software process control and achieve high software reliability. The results show that when all the prediction techniques are evaluated, the best prediction model is found to be the fusion of requirement and code metric model.

HFCM takes advantage of optimizing the hierarchical structure and tuning weights of different kind of distances.

It is known that the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm depend highly on initial cluster centers. Generally initial cluster centers are selected randomly, so the algorithm could not lead to the unique result. In this paper, we present a method to compute initial cluster centers for K-means clustering. Our method is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. We apply the new method to the K-means algorithm. The experimental results show better performance of the proposed method.

Therefore a global discretization and attribute reduction algorithm is proposed based on clustering and rough sets theory. After comparing different discretization methods, the k-means clustering algorithm is used. In order to avoid the shortcomings of k-means clustering algorithm, the F analysis of variance statistics and support strength of condition attributes are introduced to control the discretization effectiveness.

Particularly, several ant based clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature. These clustering models were derived from several phenomena among real ants such as cemetery organization, recognition system, building alive structures, etc. In this work, we try to adapt the properties of sound communication among real ants to resolve the clustering problem. Artificial ants move randomly on a 2D toroidal grid where objects are initially scattered at random. They communicate with each others in order to recruit ants having similar heaps of objects. We have applied this algorithm on many databases and we get very good results compared to the K-means algorithm. An application to image clustering is also realized.

The DNA Microarray Technique participates as one of the leading methods in Cancer Research. Due to the presence of immense noise, fewer numbers of samples and huge amount of genes, the useful genomic knowledge extraction from this technique is an important question in today's Biological Research. Scientists and Researchers are exploring efficient mathematical procedure to rind realistic gene expressed knowledge. In this study K-Means Clustering technique is used on an efficient 3(rd) order polynomial based technique to normalize the genomic data of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphocyte Leukemia (ALL). AML was used as a model to generate the coefficients of the polynomial by considering non trending, decorellation and offset based techniques. The K nearest Neighbor technique is used to estimate the missing values of microarray data and avoid the impact of missing data on clustering algorithm. The data can be regenerated easily using 3(rd) order polynomial normalization based on model generated by AML. Top ranked genes in each cluster have been presented in this paper which helps in finding functionally coregulated genes in ALL and AML..

Loose repeat algorithm and K-means algorithm are used to resolve the stomach epidermis tumor segmentation, but many conglutinated cells cannot be separated by others with the help of traditional segmentation algorithms. So the Vincent watershed algorithm as well as the Inver watershed algorithm is designed to do segmentation experiments about stomach epidermis tumors. A lot of experiments about several kinds' images were done to build the right segmentation theory. The conclusion of these experiments show that these two algorithms could get good segmentation results while the image has few conglutinated areas.Moreover, the Inver algorithm may get better result than the Vincent algorithm while the image has many conglutinated areas. As a defect of the Inver algorithm, it may take many very small areas after segmentation. Finally, boundary tracing algorithm is designed to obtain the boundaries of tumor cells.

The main idea of the new algorithm is to solve clustering problem using the fast search ability of the particle swarm optimization, each particle is composed of a cluster center vector, and represents a possible solution of the clustering problem. To escape from local optimum, a new idea is proposed, that is the neighborhood structure of individual optimum is enriched using the probabilistic jumping property of the simulated annealing (SA). The individual optimum of the particles is disturbed randomly, that is the data pattern clustering label is changed randomly, so the search ability of the global space is enhanced. The experimental results on different datasets show that the new algorithm has better performance than particle swarm optimization and K-means algorithm, has better global convergence, and it is an effective clustering algorithm.

Unsupervised feature selection method well solves this problem and has got a good effect in features selection with unlabeled data. Laplacian Score (LS) is a newly proposed unsupervised feature selection algorithm. However it uses k-means clustering method to select the top k features, therefore, the disadvantages of k-means clustering method greatly affect the result and increases the complexity of LS. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called LSE (Laplacian Score combined with distance-based entropy measure) for automatically selecting subset of features. LSE uses distance-based entropy to replace the k-means clustering method in LS, which intrinsically solves the drawbacks of LS and contribute to the stability and efficiency of LSE. We compare LSE with LS on six UCI data sets. Experimental results demonstrate LSE can outperform LS on stability and efficiency, especially when processing high dimension datasets.

The algorithm divides two-stage procedures. The traditional k-means is used to partition the whole customers into several areas in the first stage and a border adjustment algorithm aims to adjust the unbalanced areas to be balanced in the second stage. The objective of partitioning areas is to design a group of geographically closed customers with balanced number of customers. The presented algorithm is specifically designed for large-scale problems based on decomposition strategy. The computational experiments were carried out on a real dataset with 1882 customers.

First, the color images are converted from RGB into NTSC color space. Then, we scale the data of the saturation channel in NTSC color space to the range of 0-255 and obtain its histogram. Using this histogram, we can obtain two peaks in the enteromorpha and background class respectively. Thus, two positions in these two classes can be obtained. Thirdly, those two positions are used as the centroids in the k-means algorithm. By means of k-means algorithm, every enteromorpha image can be divided into two classes: enteromorpha and background class. In fact, it is only a pre-processing for enteromorpha detection. Experimental results show that our approach can segment the enteromorpha images very accurately.

Audio classification serves as the fundamental step towards it. Accuracy in classifying data relies on the strength of the features and on the efficacy of classification scheme. In this work, we have focused on the features only. We have restricted ourselves further in the time domain based low level features. Zero crossing rate (ZCR) and shot time energy (STE) are the most widely used features in this category. We have tried to develop the features reflecting the quasi-periodic pattern of the signal by studying the occurrence pattern of ZCR and STE. Co-occurrence matrix for ZCR and STE are formed and features are computed from that to parameterize the signal. For classification, simple k-means clustering is followed and experimental result indicates that proposed features perform better than the traditional feature derived from ZCR and STE.

Based on the characteristics of the indentation images, this article uses texture features to extract the indentation silhouette from the point view of texture segmentation. We adopt fractal dimension and co-occurrence matrix algorithm to describe the texture characteristics of the indentation image, forming a n-dimensional feature vector, introducing EPNSQ to smooth the features. Finally we combine with the k-means clustering algorithm to get texture segmentation result. The experiment demonstrates that in the material Vickers hardness image segmentation the proposed algorithm was significantly effective and robust.

Usually a two channel microarray Red Green (RC) image is obtained. Due to the nature of cDNA microarray technology, a number of impairments affect the cDNA microarray image before the analysis such as identification of differentially expressed genes. Microarray image processing plays a crucial role in the extraction and quantitative analysis of the relative abundance of the DNA product. In this paper, a method combined K-means clustering algorithm and mathematical morphology is presented. Mathematical morphology is a useful tool for extracting image components. K-means clustering algorithm has a good performance in the segmentation of microarray image processing.

The constraints included in this problem formulation are basic, cardinality, bounding and class constraints. Due to complex constraints, the solution to the problem has been beyond the reach of traditional methods. Hence, heuristic approaches have been sought for its solution. In this paper, the empirical covariance matrix, which is one of the primary inputs to the constrained portfolio rebalancing problem, is initially de-noised using wavelet shrinkage de-noising technique for proper estimation of risk. Secondly, cardinality constraint is eliminated by employing k-means cluster analysis. Finally, the proposed Evolutionary Wavelet Hopfield Network Strategy (EWHNS) with weight standardization procedures is employed to solve a class of portfolio rebalancing problem. EWHNS reports faster convergence and efficiently handles diversification in both large and small portfolios. Experimental studies of EWHNS on newly proposed portfolio rebalancing problem have been undertaken on the Bombay Stock Exchange, India (BSE200 index, period: July 2001 - July 2006) and Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan (Nikkei225 index: period: March 2002 -March 2007) data sets and the results are compared with those obtained using Evolutionary Hopfield Network strategy (EHNS), the only existing alternative solution strategy for this proposed model. Finally, Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is also carried out to prove the efficiency of EWHNS over EHNN.	[Suganya, N. C.; Pai, G. A.

In most unstructured P2P systems with flooding mechanism, with exponential growth of the number of messages, serious network congestion and waste of bandwidth result in low efficiency of resources search. In this paper, we propose an unstructured P2P resources search algorithm based on Small-world model, in which peers perform k-means clustering on local resources separately, and then build a few similar-links between peers who own similar clusters and some random-links between non-similar peers. Experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively shorten the average searching length and gel high success rate.

In this new method we use self-organizing map (SOM) neural network to cluster roughly the samples, and the next step the K-means clustering algorithm is adopted to refine the clustering. By the characters of wireless sensor networks and the differences between common nodes and cluster headers, each a agent has different tasks and its strategy detection is also different.

The outcomes will be evaluated with intuitive visualization qualitatively and objective metrics quantitatively. Watershed segmentation is applied for pattern recognition. The watershed transform locates watershed ridges and catchment basins in an image, assuming that bright pixels are high and dark pixels are low on the surface. Segmentation can be improved using markers for foreground objects and background locations. Another approach to separate groups of objects is clustering. K-means segmentation assigns each object a space location via content-based clustering. Through K-means clustering using distance metric criteria, aerial images can be processed and analyzed. Matlab programming is a useful software tool for image processing while visualization effects of two approaches can be observed directly from visual appeals. To evaluate image segmentation objectively, quantitative metrics should be taken into account. Thus, the notions of the discrete entropy, gray level energy, relative entropy and mutual information are used to measure effects of image segmentation approaches.

SEC is based on the observation that the cluster assignment matrix of high dimensional data can be represented by a low dimensional linear mapping of data. We also discover the connection between SEC and other clustering methods, such as spectral clustering, Clustering with local and global regularization, K-means and Discriminative K-means. The experiments on many real-world data sets show that SEC significantly outperforms the existing spectral clustering methods as well as K-means clustering related methods.

In this paper, we propose an omni-view learning approach to enable learning from multiple data collections. The theme is to organize heterogeneous data sources into a unified table with global data view. To achieve the omni-view learning goal, we consider that the objective dataset and the auxiliary datasets share some instance-level dependency structures. We then propose a relational k-means to cluster instances in each auxiliary dataset, such that clusters can help build new features to capture correlations between the objective and auxiliary datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that omni-view learning can help build models which outperform the ones learned from the objective dataset only. Comparisons with the co-training algorithm further assert that omni-view learning provides an alternative, yet effective, way for semi-supervised learning.

In such cases, it is important to be able to trace the evolution of the individual clusters as the number of dimensions of the clustering is varied. While the dendrograms produced by bottom-up clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering are very useful for this purpose, the approach is known to produce unreliable clusters due to its instability w.r.t. resampling. Moreover, hierarchical clustering does not apply to overlapping (bi) clusters, such as those obtained in gene expression studies. On the other hand, the instability w.r.t. the initialization of top-down methods, such as k-means, prevents the comparison between clusters obtained at different dimensionalities. In this paper, we present a method for constructing generalized dendrograms for overlapping biclusters, which depict the evolution of the biclusters as their number is varied. An essential ingredient is a stable biclustering method based on positive tensor factorization of a number of nonnegative matrix factorization runs. We apply our approach to a large colon cancer dataset, which shows several distinct subclasses whose dimensional evolution must be carefully analyzed to enable a more meaningful biological interpretation and sub-classification.			badea@ici.ro	Badea, Liviu/B-8807-2011				Banerjea A, 2004, MOL CANCER, V3, DOI 10.1186/1476-4598-3-21; Birkenkamp-Demtroder K, 2007, MOL ONCOL, V1, P181, DOI 10.1016/j.molonc.2007.05.005; Cheng Y, 2000, P 8 INT C INT SYST M, P93; Eisen MB, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P14863, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.25.14863; Hong Y, 2007, CLIN CANCER RES, V13, P1107, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1633; Irizarry RA, 2003, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V31, DOI 10.1093/nar/gng015; Ishiguro A, 2006, J GASTROEN HEPATOL, V21, P1334, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2006.04137.x; Jass JR, 1999, J CLIN PATHOL, V52, P455; Kim IJ, 2006, CARCINOGENESIS, V27, P392, DOI 10.1093/carcin/bgi237; Kim PM, 2003, GENOME RES, V13, P1706, DOI 10.1101/gr.903503; Lee DD, 1999, NATURE, V401, P788; Lee DD, 2000, P NIPS, ppp; LIVIU B, 2007, P IJCAI 07, P2651; LIVIU B, 2005, P ECML 2005, V3720, P10; Thalamuthu A, 2006, BIOINFORMATICS, V22, P2405, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl406; Thompson J, 1997, CANCER RES, V57, P1776; Welling M, 2001, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V22, P1255, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8655(01)00070-8	17	0	0	IJCAI-INT JOINT CONF ARTIF INTELL	FREIBURG	ALBERT-LUDWIGS UNIV FREIBURG GEORGES-KOHLER-ALLEE, INST INFORMATIK, GEB 052, FREIBURG, D-79110, GERMANY			978-1-57735-426-0				2009							1383	1388				6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BRU77	WOS:000283727900220

The main task of this work is to develop and verify the procedures for observing of muscle and brain activity. The developed procedures have no negative impact to brain activity (the tracking does not affect the measured EEG signals). The procedures required only standard hardware equipment accessible on neurological laboratories. The body motions are non-contact sensed using a pair of standard DV camcorders. This work includes the description of observing, discerning and parameterization procedures and the discussion of motion classification. The set of classifiers - hierarchical clustering algorithm, recursive clustering algorithm, k-means classifier, Bayes classifier and classifier based on discrimination functions - was developed and implemented. The analysis of the classifiers properties was accomplished in this work. The accuracy of classification was tested for selected classifiers.

An increasing number of multimodal images represent a valuable increase in available image information, but at the same time it complicates the extraction of diagnostic information across the images. Multispectral analysis (MSA) has the potential to simplify this problem substantially as unlimited number of images can be combined, and tissue properties across the images can be extracted automatically. Materials and methods. We have developed a software solution for MSA containing two algorithms for unsupervised classification, an EM-algorithm finding multinormal class descriptions and the k-means clustering algorithm, and two for supervised classification, a Bayesian classifier using multinormal class descriptions and a kNN-algorithm. The software has an efficient user interface for the creation and manipulation of class descriptions, and it has proper tools for displaying the results. Results. The software has been tested on different sets of images. One application is to segment cross-sectional images of brain tissue (T1- and T2-weighted MR images) into its main normal tissues and brain tumors. Another interesting set of images are the perfusion maps and diffusion maps, derived images from raw MR images. The software returns segmentations that seem to be sensible. Discussion. The MSA software appears to be a valuable tool for image analysis with multimodal images at hand. It readily gives a segmentation of image volumes that visually seems to be sensible. However, to really learn how to use MSA, it will be necessary to gain more insight into what tissues the different segments contain, and the upcoming work will therefore be focused on examining the tissues through for example histological sections.

On the basis of cluster analysis three, significantly different, groups of observations in relation to the course of growth and development, determining different volumes of cucumber yields in Poland, were isolated. Cluster 2 included observations which were characterised by high yields (amounting to 37.7 t.ha(-1) for the total yield and 20.1 t.ha(-1) for the marketable yield), and cluster 3 by low yields (respectively 27.6 and 15.6 t.ha(-1)). The following calendar of agrotechnical dates and phenological phases was conducive to high yield of cucumber (cluster 2): sowing on 14(th) May, the end of emergence 27(th) May, the beginning of flowering 29(th) June, the beginning of fruit setting 4(th) July, the beginning of harvesting 13(th) July, the end of harvesting 24(th) August. The delay, in relation to the dates in cluster 2 (high yield), of the sowing date by 6 days, emergence by 16 days, flowering and fruit setting by 18 days, the beginning of harvesting by 19 days, and the end of harvesting by 22 days may contribute to a decrease in cucumber yields even by about 27% and 22%, respectively for the total yield and the marketable yield. Higher than average values of both sunshine duration and air temperature, which during the vegetation season amounted respectively to 7.9h and 17.5 degrees C, were conducive to earlier agrotechnical and phenological dates, and, in consequence, high cucumber yields (cluster 2).

The aim was to obtain the optimal process parameters in respect to the flue gas nitrogen oxide (NO) content in different predefined states of process. The data processing procedure in the research went as follows. First, the process data were processed by using a self-organizing map and k-means clustering to generate subsets representing the separate process states in the boiler. These process states represent the higher level process conditions in the combustion, and can include for example start-ups, shutdowns, and idle times in addition to the normal process flow. Next, optimal areas were discovered from the map within each process state, and the reference vectors of the optimal neurons were used to approximate the values of desired process parameters. In addition, a subtraction analysis of reference vectors was performed to analyze the optimal situations. In conclusion, the method showed potential considering its wider use in the field of energy production.

The aim was to classify documents to separate classes according to their topics. We therefore constructed self-organising maps that were effective for this task and tested them with German newspaper documents. We compared the results gained to those of k nearest neighbour searching and k-means clustering. For five and ten classes, the self-organising maps were better yielding as high average classification accuracies as 88-89%, whereas nearest neighbour searching gave 74-83% and k-means clustering 72-79% as their highest accuracies.

However, its quadratic dependency on the number of clusters can be too slow in case of some data sets. Deterministic selection of the swapped prototype can speed-up the algorithm but only if the swap can be performed fast enough. In this work, we introduce an efficient implementation of the swap-based heuristic and compare its time-distortion efficiency against random and deterministic variants of the swap-based clustering, and repeated k-means.

In addition to building appropriate financial distress prediction models, it is also of extreme importance to devise dimensionality reduction methods able to extract the most discriminative features. Here we show that Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for successful extraction of features in this financial setting. NMF is a technique that decomposes financial multivariate data into a few basis functions and encodings using non-negative constraints. We propose an approach that first performs proper initialization of NMF taking into account original data using k-means clustering. Second, builds a bankruptcy prediction model using the discriminative financial ratios extracted by NMF decomposition. Model predictive accuracies evaluated in real database of French companies with statuses belonging to two classes (healthy and distressed) are illustrated showing the effectiveness of our approach.

This map is generally the subject of a clustering analysis step which aims to partition the referents vectors (map neurons) in compact and well-separated groups. In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering self-organizing map using a modified graph minimal coloring algorithm. Unlike the traditional clustering SOM techniques, using k-means or hierarchical classification, out-approach has the advantage to provide a partition of self-organizing map by simultaneously using dissimilarities and neighborhood relations provided by SOM. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm is able to cluster data in a, better Way than classical ones and indicates the effectiveness of SOM to offer real benefits for the original minimal coloring clustering approach.

Two conventional approaches that can solve one of these problems accurately are K-means and DBSCAN. However, DBSCAN is inefficient while K-means has poor accuracy. ANGEL and G-TREACLE have been proposed to improve current clustering tribulations, but require complicated procedures and numerous thresholds. This work presents a new clustering technique, called "GOD-CS", which employs grid-based clustering, neighborhood 8-square searching and tolerance rate to reduce these problems. Simulation results indicate that GOD-CS clusters large databases very quickly, while having almost identical or even better clustering performance in comparison to several existing well-known approaches with the original patterns in a simple procedure. Thus, GOD-CS performs well and is simple to implement.

Therefore, the study of the initialization methods is of great importance for the success of finding a, better sub-optimal solution in practice. However, existing initialization methods for mixture model based clustering using EM-style algorithms do not account for the unique properties of spatial data, such as spatial autocorrelation.

As a consequence these components need to be designed and controlled to allow for a homogeneous performance. In our case antigen-antibody-reactions take place on small measurement chips, which are processed at several units of art analysis system. Signals are measured on the two dimensional chip surface. In order to optimize the measurement process it is necessary to compare the outcome of the separate processing units and to identify the units of equal performance. Clustering, the unsupervised partitioning of data into groups, is a task with broad application in many disciplines. We compare some cluster algorithms in the aforementioned situation. The algorithms that we analyze and compare are classical multivariate ones like K-means or hierarchical clustering, as well as a more recent one emerging from functional data analysis. The latter method is based on nonparametric functional principal component analysis. Furthermore a clustering method based on the coefficients of a parametric linear model fit is taken into consideration.

Spot intensity measurements and gene expression ratios directly depend on the effectiveness and accuracy of the segmentation results. However, since the ground truth is unknown in microarray experiments, quantification of the accuracy of the segmentation process is a very difficult task. In this paper an improved unsupervised technique based on the combination of clustering algorithms and Markov Random Fields (MRF) is proposed to separate the foreground and background intensity signals used in the spot ratio computation. The segmentation algorithm uses one of two alternative methods to provide for initialization, namely K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) clustering. This initial segmentation is then processed via MRF. Accuracy is measured by means of a set of microarray images containing spike spots where the target ratios are known a prori, thus making it possible to quantify the expression ratio errors. Results show improvements over state-of-the-art procedures.

Recently, it is very popular to use file evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem. This paper proposes ail automatic clustering differential evolution (DE) technique for the problem. This approach can be characterized by (i) proposing a modified point symmetry-based cluster validity index (M) as a measure of the validity of the corresponding partitioning, (ii) using the Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search to reduce the complexity of finding the closest symmetric point, and (iii) employing a new representation to represent an individual. Experiments conducted on 6 artificial data sets of diverse complexities indicate that this approach is Suitable for both the symmetrical intra-clusters and the symmetrical inter-clusters. In addition, it is able to find the optimal number of clusters of the data. Furthermore, based oil the comparison with the original point symmetry-based CVI, this proposed point symmetry-based CVI shows better performance in terms of the F-measure and the number of clusters found.

With their characteristics of space-dependence and space volatility, the regional data determine the accuracy of the prediction model. With consideration of the sectional instability of the spatial pattern, the paper brings forward a modeling method based on regional neural network. First, the space units of researching regions are divided into different sub-regions by improved K-means algorithm based on spatial adjacency relationship, corresponding with sub-regions. Then, a modular BP network is built tip, which is composed with main network, gate-network and sub-network. This network is thus named as regional spatio-temporal neural network (RSTN) model. Afterwards, the sub-networks are traiend respectively for every sub-region, and the output of sub-networks is input of main network with adjustment of gate-network The output of main network is predictive results. The spatio-temporal predictive capability of model is measured by average variance rate (AVR) and dynamic similar rate (DSR). At last, the RSTN model and the global BPN model are compared by the analysis of an example: prediction for influenza cases of 94 Countries in France. The comparison declares that RSTN model has more powerful prediction capability.

A time series and its translated copy appear dissimilar under the Euclidean distance (because the comparison is made pointwise), whereas a human would perceive both series as similar. As the human perception is tolerant to translational effects, using the cross correlation distance would be a better choice than Euclidean distance. We show how to modify a k-means variant such that it operates correctly with the cross correlation distance. The resulting algorithm may also be used for meaningful clustering of time series subsequences, which delivers meaningless results in Case of Euclidean or Pearson distance.

These algorithms may be un-successful if the choice of parameters is inappropriate with respect to the data set being clustered. Most of these algorithms work very well for compact and hyperspherical clusters. In this paper, a new hybrid clustering algorithm called Self-Partition, and, Self-Merging (SPSM) is proposed. The SPSM algorithm partitions the input data set into several subclusters in the first phase and, then, removes the noisy data in the second phase. In the third phase, the normal subclusters are continuously merged to form the larger clusters based on the inter-cluster distance and intra-cluster distance criteria. From the experimental results, the SPSM algorithm is very efficient to handle the noisy data set; and to cluster the data. sets of arbitrary shapes of different density.

A decision cluster forest (DCF) consist's of a set of decision cluster trees, in which the leaves of each tree are clusters labeled with the same class that determines the class of new objects falling in the clusters. By recursively calling a variable weighting k-means algorithm, a decision cluster tree can be generated from a subset of the training data that contains the objects in the same class. The set of m decision cluster trees grown front the subsets of m classes constitute the decision cluster forest. Anderson-Darling test is used to determine the stopping condition of tree growing. A DCF classification (DCFC) model is selected from all leaves of the m decision cluster trees in the forest. A series of experiments oil both synthetic and real data sets have shown that the DCFC model performed better in accuracy and scalability than the single decision cluster tree method and the methods of k-N N, decision tree and SVM. This new model is particularly suitable for large, high dimensional data with many classes.

Model Based Penalized Clustering for Multivariate Data	ADVANCES IN MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS	Statistical Science and Interdisciplinary Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Multivariate Statistical Methods	DEC 28-29, 2006	Calcutta, INDIA					Over the last decade a variety of clustering algorithms have evolved. However one of the simplest (and possibly overused) partition based clustering algorithm is K-means. It can be shown that the computational complexity of K-means does not suffer from exponential growth with dimensionality rather it is linearly proportional with the number of observations and number of clusters. The crucial requirements are the knowledge of cluster number and the computation of some suitably chosen similarity measure. For this simplicity and scalability, among large data sets K-means remains an attractive alternative when compared to other competing clustering philosophies especially for high dimensional domain. However being a deterministic algorithm, traditional K-means have several drawbacks. It only offers hard decision rule, with no probabilistic interpretation. In this paper we have developed a decision theoretic framework by which traditional K-means can be given a probabilistic footstep. This will not only enable us to do a soft. clustering, rather the whole optimization problem could be re-casted into Bayesian modeling framework, in which the knowledge of cluster number could be treated as an unknown parameter of interest, thus removing a severe constrain of K-means algorithm. Our basic idea is to keep the simplicity and scalability of K-means, while achieving some of the desired properties of the other model based or soft clustering approaches.

In this paper, we introduce fuzzy clustering algorithms into the domain of automatic speaker clustering, and present a novel fuzzy-based hierarchical speaker clustering algorithm by applying fuzzy theory into the state-of-the-art agglomerative hierarchical clustering. This method follows a bottom-up strategy, and determines the fuzzy memberships according to a membership propagation strategy, which propagates fuzzy memberships in the iterative process of hierarchical clustering. Further analysis reveals that this method is an extension of conventional hierarchical clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our method exhibits quite competitive performances compared to conventional k-means, fuzzy c-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms.

In this paper, we introduce a novel clustering method into Web page clustering, which is an extension of affinity propagation (AP). This method is called partition adaptive affinity propagation (PAAP), which can automatically rerun AP procedure to yield optimal clustering results and eliminate number oscillations if they occur. Experiments are carried out to compare PAAP with K-means and AP on ten different Web page data sets. The results verify that PAAP can find better clusters when compared with similar methods. And the results also demonstrate that PAAP is robust and effective when clustering Web pages.

These algorithms may fail if it chooses a set of incorrect parameters in the static model with respect to the objects being clustered, or when the objects consist of patterns that are of non-spherical or not the same size. Furthermore, they could produce an instable result. This investigation presents a new partition clustering algorithm named SDCC. which can improve the problem of instable results in partitioning-based clustering, Such as K-means. As a hybrid approach that utilizes double-centroid concept, the proposed algorithm can eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks to produce stable results while recognizing the non-spherical patterns and clusters that are not the same size. Experimental results illustrate that the new algorithm can identify non-spherical pattern correctly, and efficiently reduces the problem of long Computational time when applying KGA and GKA. It also indicates thin the proposed approach produces much smaller errors than K-means, KGA and GKA approaches in most cases examined herein.

In this paper we propose a 3D representative face (RF) and clustering based method, which can estimate 13 illumination conditions under certain poses. First, all faces are adaptively categorized into 31 facial types by k-means clustering, so people with similar facial appearance M-e Clustered together Then the representative face of each cluster is generated. Finally we select the most discriminative features to train a group of SVM classifiers and get 96.88% estimation accuracy when estimating the test set with frontal view. Compared with other related works, ours does not rely on 3D reconstruction, and to get the generalization ability, We use Our RE and Clustering technique.

Literature shows clustering techniques, like K-means, are very useful methods for the intrusion detection but suffer several major shortcomings, for example the value of K of K-means is particularly unknown, which has great influence on detection ability. In this paper, a heuristic Clustering algorithm called G-means is presented for intrusion detection, which is based on density-based clustering and K-means and overcomes the shortcomings of K-means. The results of experiments show that G-means is an effective method for the intrusion detection with the high Detection Rate and the low False Positive Rate, as it can reveal the number of clusters in the dataset and initialize reasonably the cluster centroids, which makes G-means accelerate the convergence and obtain preferable performance than K-mens.

Global feature selection tries to identify a single subset of features which are relevant to all clusters. However, the clustering process might be improved by considering different subsets of features for locally describing each cluster. In this work, we introduce the method ZOOM-IN to perform local feature selection for partitional hierarchical clustering of text collections. The proposed method explores the diversity of clusters generated by the hierarchical algorithm, selecting a variable number of features according to the size of the clusters. Experiments were conducted on Reuters collection, by evaluating the bisecting K-means algorithm with both global and local approaches to feature selection. The results of the experiments showed an improvement in clustering performance with the use of the proposed local method.	[Ribeiro, Marcelo N.; Prudencio, Ricardo B.

Consequently, real-time surveillance of private or public spaces which relies on such equipment is gaining wider acceptance. While the human brain is very good Lit image analysis, fatigue and boredom may contribute to a less-than-optimum level of monitoring performance. Clearly, it would be good if highly accurate vision systems could complement the role of humans in round-the-clock video surveillance. This paper addresses an image analysis problem for video surveillance based on the particle swarm computing paradigm. In this study three separate datasets were used. The overall finding of the paper suggests that clustering using Particle Swarm Optimization leads to better and more consistent results, in terms of both cluster characteristics and subsequent recognition, as compared to traditional techniques such as K-Means.			lee.ng@mimos.my; lim.mkuan@mimos.my; thomas.henrique@mimos.my; lai@mimos.my					ALI AT, 1990, IEE C EL IM IM PROC, P1; CHIEN YT, 2003, IEEE 37 ANN 2003 INT, P190; Fisher RA, 1936, ANN EUGENIC, V7, P179; Fong ACM, 2001, COMPUT CONTROL ENG J, V12, P263, DOI 10.1049/cce:20010603; Kenneth J, 1995, P IEEE INT C NEUR NE, P1942, DOI DOI 10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968; Ou GB, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P4, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2006.04.041; Schwenker F., 2001, Pattern Recognition. 23rd DAGM Symposium.

In this paper we present a measure for the degree to which a given clustering algorithm depends on the choice of initial centers, for a given data set. This measure is calculated for four well-known offline clustering algorithms (k-means Forgy, k-means Hartigan, k-means Lloyd and frizzy c-means), for five benchmark data sets. The measure is also calculated for ECM, an online algorithm that does not require the number of initial centers as input, but for which the resulting clusters can depend oil the order that the input arrives. Our main finding is that this initialization dependence measure call also he used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Lower-frequency 2-D DCT coefficients of binarized edge images are utilized in both methods as features for recognition. The first approach uses a constructive one-hidden-layer (OHL) feedforward neural network (OHL-NN) and the second approach is based oil the K-means algorithm as classifiers. The 2-D DCT is used to compress the binarized edge images to capture the important features for recognition. Facial expression "neutral" is regarded as a subject of recognition in addition to two other expressions, "smile" and "surprise". The two proposed recognition techniques are applied to two databases which contain 2-D front face images of 60 men (database (a)) and 60 women (database (b)), respectively. Experimental results reveal that the proposed two techniques yield performances that are comparable to or better than that of two other recognition methods using vector matching and fixed-size BP-based NNs, respectively. The first proposed method yields testing recognition rates as high as 100% and 95%, and the second one achieves as high as 100% and 98.33%, for databases (a) and (b), respectively.

In this paper, web access pattern disclosing user unique interest is transformed as a fuzzy vector with the same length, in which each element is a fuzzy linguistic variable or 0 denoting the visited web page and its fuzzy time duration. Then we proposed a modified rough k-means clustering algorithm based on properties of rough variable to group the gained fuzzy web access patterns. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the clustering process. Using this approach, web transactions with the same or similar behavior can be grouped into one class.

Since pixels are categorized using a bag of features scheme, the major bottleneck of such an approach would be the feature pooling in local histograms of visual words. Therefore, we propose to bypass this time-consuming step and directly obtain the score from a linear Support Vector Machine classifier. This is achieved by creating an integral image of the components of the SVM which can readily obtain the classification score for any image sub-window with only 10 additions and 2 products, regardless of its size. Besides, we evaluated the performance of two efficient feature quantization methods: the Hierarchical K-Means and the Extremely Randomized Forest. All experiments have been done in the Graz02 database, showing comparable, or even better results to related work with a lower computational cost.

The proposed texture attributes are inspired by the human description of texture and allows a general description of texture. Moreover it is more convenient for a user to understand features signification particularly in a man-aided application. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, our characteristics gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 12 different solid textures. Using these texture features, segmentation results obtained with the classical K-means method on solid textures and real three-dimensional ultrasound images of the skin are presented and discussed.

This paper aims at analyzing group actions in video clips containing several activities. We combine the probability summation framework with the space-time (ST) interest points for this task. First, ST interest; points are extracted from video clips to form the feature space. Then we use k-means for feature clustering and build a. compact representation, which is then used for group action classification. The proposed approach has been applied to classification tasks including four classes: badminton, tennis, basketball, and soccer videos. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

Principal component analysis is used to improve the selection of evaluation factors and confirmation of weights. K-Means clustering by distance is used to enhance the efficiency of land gradation. What's more, we propose the method of zoning by regional economic development level to determine reasonable capitalization rate and capacity rate. Representative and central cities are chosen based on coincidence level between scores of evaluation units in land gradation and datum land prices, on the basis of improved piecewise linear interpolation, urban datum land prices are balanced among cities. In this paper, we present the method of verification by piecewise regression analysis and spatial interpolation, and achieve satisfactory results. Based on the essence of diversity of land prices among cities, the method using city gravitation model and prices diffusion equations has been discussed as well.

The new method AutoCPB (Auto-Clustering based on particle bacterial foraging) makes use of autonomous agents whose primary objective is to cluster chunks of data by using simplistic collaboration. Inspired by the advances in clustering using particle swarm optimization, we suggest further improvements. Moreover, we gathered standard benchmark datasets and compared our new approach against the standard K-means algorithm, obtaining promising results. Our hybrid mechanism outperforms earlier PSO-based approaches by using simplistic communication between agents.

Effects of Alcoholism Typology on Response to Naltrexone in the COMBINE Study	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alcoholism; Pharmacotherapy; Typology; Naltrexone; Randomized Clinical Trial	EMPIRICALLY DERIVED TYPOLOGY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; OPIOID RECEPTOR GENE; DOUBLE-BLIND; COMBINED PHARMACOTHERAPIES; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; CLINICAL PREDICTORS; DEPENDENT PATIENTS; HEAVY DRINKING; B ALCOHOLICS	This study investigated whether subgroups of alcohol-dependent patients responded differently to naltrexone versus placebo in the NIAAA COMBINE study. In particular, the A versus B and the Early Onset versus Late Onset typologies were examined. Relative to Type A alcoholics, Type B alcoholics are characterized by greater severity, earlier onset, stronger family history, more childhood risk factors (e.g., conduct disorder), and greater frequency of comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders. COMBINE study participants were categorized as Type A or Type B using k-means cluster analysis and variables from 5 domains that have been shown to replicate the original Babor typology efficiently. Early Onset was defined as alcohol dependence beginning before age 25. For the planned analyses, the sample was reduced to the 618 participants receiving naltrexone alone or placebo, either with medical management (MM) alone or with MM plus the Combined Behavioral Intervention (CBI). The a priori primary outcome was percent heavy drinking days during treatment in the groups receiving MM without CBI. Among those receiving MM without CBI, Type A alcoholics had better drinking outcomes with naltrexone than placebo, whereas medication condition did not influence outcomes significantly in the Type Bs. Age of onset was not significantly related to outcome. For those receiving CBI, no significant effects were found for either typology. In this sample, the beneficial effects of opioid antagonism were limited to Type A alcoholics receiving treatment in a MM model. Future studies should investigate the relationship between clinically relevant genotypes, phenotypes such as typologies, and treatment response. More work is also needed to develop practical algorithms for phenotypic assignment.

Most of the theoretical work is restricted to the case that squared Euclidean distances are used as similarity measure. In many application's, however, data is to be clustered with respect to other measures like, e.g., relative entropy, which is commonly used to cluster web pages. In this paper, we analyze the running-time of the k-means method for Bregman divergences, a very general class of similarity measures including squared Euclidean distances and relative entropy. We show that the exponential lower bound known for the Euclidean case carries over to almost every Bregman divergence. To narrow the gap between theory and practice, we also study k-means in the semi-random input model of smoothed analysis. For the case that n data points in R(d) are perturbed by noise with standard deviation sigma, we show that for almost arbitrary Bregman divergences the expected running-time is bounded by poly(n(root k), 1/sigma) and k(kd) . poly(n, 1/sigma).

The method is based on measuring a vertical series of confocal Raman sections of samples by a high numerical aperture Raman microscope. Using the known characteristics of the wavelength-dependent focal shift of the optical system, the Raman intensities can be corrected to allow the rearrangement of Raman data from different focal planes. In the present study the computational correction routine was applied to an experimental data set of 4-dimensional (xyz spatial and the spectral dimension) confocal Raman spectra collected from single spores of Bacillus cereus. After correcting the axial component of the chromatic aberration, univariate and multivariate spectral parameters were obtained and used in the following for 3D segmentation and volume rendering on the basis of the structural and compositional information contained in the Raman spectra of the spore. Using univariate Raman intensities from defined functional group frequencies or k-means cluster membership values as a multivariate parameter for volume rendering, we demonstrate a high degree of correlation between confocal Raman microspectroscopy and the spores' morphology. In this paper we will also present cluster mean spectra which will be discussed in light of the presence of proteins and Ca-DPA, a calcium chelate of dipicolinic acid in the spore.

In this research, we will present how cluster analysis can be used as a substitute method for industrial market segmentation in telecommunications instead of the common approach based on the location and the total revenue of telecommunication services invoiced to the user. The goal of data mining analysis was to determine if cluster analysis could be used for finding interesting segments in the business sector of the telecommunication market. The sample consisted of data of the companies that were clients of a telecommunication company.

In the case of data measured as a function of a dependent variable such as time, the most used algorithms, e.g. K-means, may not pattern each of the individual shapes properly. Therefore, in the presented paper we namely focus on some efficient methods of clustering trajectories. Our clustering algorithms are based on a principled method for probabilistic modeling of a set of trajectories as sequences of points generated from a finite mixture model consisting of regression model components. Unsupervised learning is carried out using maximum likehood principles to deal with the hidden data problem the cluster memberships.

OPTIMIZATION METHODS AND THE k-COMMITTEES ALGORITHM FOR CLUSTERING OF SEQUENCE DATA	APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						optimization methods; classification algorithms; DNA sequences		The present paper is devoted to new algorithms for unsupervised clustering based on the optimization approaches due to [2], [3] and [4]. We consider a novel situation, where the datasets consist of nucleotide or protein sequences and rather sophisticated biologically significant alignment scores have to be used as a measure of distance. Sequences of this kind cannot be regarded as points in a finite dimensional space. Besides, the alignment scores do not satisfy properties of Minkowski metrics. Nevertheless the optimization approaches have made it possible to introduce a new k-committees algorithm and compare its performance with previous algorithms for two datasets. Our experimental results show that the k-committees algorithms achieves intermediate accuracy for a dataset of ITS sequences, and it can perform better than the discrete k-means and Nearest Neighbour algorithms for certain datasets. All three algorithms achieve good agreement with clusters published in the biological literature before and can be used to obtain biologically significant clusterings.	[Yearwood, J. L.; Kelarev, A.

J	Boryczka, U				Boryczka, Urszula			Finding groups in data: Cluster analysis with ants	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant-based clustering algorithm; Data clustering; Visual data clustering; Classification		We present in this paper a modification of Lumer and Faieta's algorithm for data clustering. This approach mimics the clustering behavior observed in real ant colonies. This algorithm discovers automatically clusters in numerical data without prior knowledge of possible number of clusters. In this paper we focus on ant-based clustering algorithms, a particular kind of a swarm intelligent system, and on the effects on the final clustering by using during the classification different metrics of dissimilarity: Euclidean, Cosine, and Gower measures. Clustering with swarm-based algorithms is emerging as an alternative to more conventional clustering methods, such as e. g. k-means, etc. Among the many bio-inspired techniques, ant clustering algorithms have received special attention, especially because they still require much investigation to improve performance, stability and other key features that would make such algorithms mature tools for data mining. As a case study, this paper focus on the behavior of clustering procedures in those new approaches. The proposed algorithm and its modi. cations are evaluated in a number of well-known benchmark datasets. Empirical results clearly show that ant-based clustering algorithms performs well when compared to another techniques. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our series consisted of 473 patients aged 70 years or more. K-means cluster analysis was used to generate 3 clusters on the basis of age, gender, education, perception of personal economic situation, difficulty to reach health services, need for formal or informal support, family arrangement, and population density of residence municipality. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlates of "negative" SES. Correlates of "negative" SES cluster were older age (odds ratio = OR = 5.19, 95% CI = 2.28-11.8), cognitive impairment (OR = 6.36, 95%CI = 3.11-13.0), emergency hospital admission (OR = 3.11; 95%CI = 1.52-6.35), and dependency in at least 1 BADL (OR = 4.36, 95%CI = 1.53-12.4). In conclusion, "negative" SES is associated with age and selected indices of frailty in elderly hospitalized patients. The evaluation of socio-economic problems should be routinely addressed in elderly hospitalized patients in order to tailor appropriately post-discharge use of health care resources.

The proposed method is to use 4 different kinds of process. First process is the pixel value which indicates the light and shade of image is acquired as matrix type. Second process is an image preprocessing phase that is aimed to maximize a contrast of image and to prevent a leak of personal information. The next process is the heuristic noise filter which is based on the opinion of medical specialist and it is applied to remove noises. The last process is to detect a seed point automatically by applying K-MEANS algorithm. As a result, the noise is effectively eliminated in all images and an automated detection is possible by determining seed points on each tumor.

Using K-Means cluster analysis, four types of navigational profiles were created. One cluster including participants who navigated primarily linearly through the learning environment, one showed high levels of non-linear progression, one included participants who opened the images very frequently, and the last cluster had a balance of all the navigational variables included in the analysis. Data from the learning measures used indicated that the balanced cluster and the cluster which opened the image frequently had the highest learning outcomes. Implications for the design of adaptive hypermedia learning systems are discussed.

SOM is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which has one of its characteristics, the nonlinear projection from a high dimensionality of the sensorial space. AK is based in the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is a recently proposed meta-heuristic approach for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. The AK algorithm modifies the K-means on locating the objects and these are then clustered according to the probabilities which in turn are updated by the pheromone. The SOMAK has a good performance when compared with some clustering techniques and reduces the computational time.

The time duration on a web page is characterized as a fuzzy linguistic variable because it is easily understandable for people and the subtle difference between two durations is disregarded. Thus a web access pattern is transformed as a fuzzy web access pattern, which is a fuzzy vector that are composed of n fuzzy linguistic variable or 0. Furthermore, the clusters in web access patterns do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. This paper proposes a modified k-means clustering algorithm based oil properties of rough set to group the gained fuzzy, web access patterns. Finally, an example is provided for clustering the given web access patterns. The results are proved to be effective.

Here, a novel methodology based on unsupervised multivariate statistical techniques has been developed and used to identify the transport and dispersion patterns of tropospheric ozone. The hierarchical Clustering method is used to visualize air flow patterns at two time scales relevant for ozone buildup. Sequentially executed statistical methods consider hourly 1-h surface wind field measurements. First, clustering is performed at the hourly time scale to identify 1-h surface flow patterns. Then, sequencing, is performed at the daily time scale to identify groups of days sharing similar diurnal cycles for the surface flow. Selection of appropriate numbers of air flow patterns allows inference of regional transport and dispersion patterns for understanding population exposure to ozone. The methods are applied to the Houston, Galveston, and Beaumont-Porr Arthur, TX study domain. Representative hourly wind field patterns are determined for the entire 2004 ozone season. Then, sequencing is performed for the 32 days in exceedance of the NAAQS for 8-h ozone. Four diurnal flow patterns capturing different ozone exceedance scenarios are isolated; each scenario is associated with a distinct spatial distribution for atmospheric pollutants.

Identifying common near-surface and subsurface stratigraphic units using EM34 signal data and fuzzy k-means analysis in the Darling River valley	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						electromagnetic induction; EM34; fuzzy k-mean; irrigation salinity; paleochannels; prior-stream channels; soil salinisation; stratigraphy	LOWER NAMOI VALLEY; ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION DATA; DEEP DRAINAGE RISK; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; IRRIGATED COTTON; SOIL-SALINITY; C-MEANS; CLASSIFICATION; AUSTRALIA; SYSTEM	In irrigated areas of central and northern New South Wales secondary soil salinisation is of increasing concern. This is particularly the case for the Bourke Irrigation District (mid-Darling River valley) where incipient traces of point-source salinisation are evident. Much of this is attributed to significant changes in the water balance and in particular increased deep drainage and mobilisation of primary salts. In the first instance, near-surface prior-stream channels and subsurface paleochannels evident within Cenozoic alluvial deposits act as significant hydrological features. Owing to the porosity and connectivity of the Cenozoic sediments, deep draining water interacts with ancient and highly saline Cretaceous marine mudstones. Unfortunately, natural resource data on the spatial distribution of near-surface and subsurface stratigraphy are not readily available to understand these processes or determine best management. In this paper, we demonstrate how fuzzy k-means (FKM) analysis of EM34 signal data collected across the Bourke Irrigation District can be used to identify and map common near-surface and subsurface stratigraphic units. EM34 survey was carried out in the horizontal mode of operation with measurements made at coil spacing of 10, 20 and 40m (i.e. EM34-10, -20 and -40, respectively). In all, 1236 sites were visited on a 0.5-1km grid. The EM34 signal data were classified numerically using the FKM clustering algorithm. The iteration of fuzzy exponents (f) and various indices, including the fuzziness performance index (FPI) and normalised classification entropy (NCE) enabled the determination of f=1.6 and k=4 classes to be selected for further investigation. Using fuzzy canonical analysis we find that the EM34-10 and EM34-20 signal data best discriminate the classes. The resulting k=4 classes (i.e. Class A, B, C and D) are then mapped using a method that ensures summation of class membership (m) values to unity and using local ordinary kriging. Class A represents saline and clay-rich sediments associated with outcrops of the Cretaceous marine mudstone. Class D represents interbedding of sand within the clay units indicative of the Cenozoic alluvial deposits that overly the Cretaceous mudstone. Similarly, Class B represents Cenozoic sediments with the presence of paleochannel(s). Class C characterises the eolian dune and alluvial floodplain physiographic units. The use of a confusion index (CI) highlights areas of uncertainty in the FKM classification mapping and indicates where the collection of additional information is appropriate. Validation of the FKM approach is confirmed by calculating near-surface (0-6m) and subsurface (6-12m) class average soil physical and chemical property (i.e. clay content, cation exchange capacity and salinity) variance (i.e. S2Z) and total within-class variance (i.e. S2T) of a FKM map. Overall, the average subsurface ECe data produces the greatest reduction in variance. This suggests the FKM classification of EM34 signal data is influenced by saline groundwater-tables in the Cenozoic sediments which lie above the Cretaceous marine mudstone. The FKM class memberships and CI along a short but detailed transect across the Bourke Irrigation District are interpreted with respect to the spatial distribution of near-surface and subsurface soil property data. We conclude the FKM analysis of EM34 provides a better understanding of the spatial distribution and horizontal layering of the various stratigraphic units which characterise the Bourke Irrigation District.

Stratification Methodologies for Neural Networks Models of Survival	BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS: COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE, PT 1	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2009)	JUN 10-12, 2009	Salamanca, SPAIN			Prognostic risk index; risk stratification	BREAST-CANCER; PROGNOSTIC MODEL	Clinical management often relies on stratification of patients by outcome. The application of flexible non-linear time-to-event models to stratification of patient populations into different and clinically meaningful risk groups is currently an important area of research. This paper proposes a definition of prognostic index for neural network models of survival. This index underpins different stratification strategies including k-means clustering, regression trees and recursive application of the log-rank test. It was obtained with multiple imputation applied to a neural network model Of Survival fitted to a Substantial data set for breast cancer (n=931) and was evaluated with a large out of sample data set (n=4,083). It was found that the constraint imposed by regression trees on the form of the permitted rules makes it less specific than stratifying directly from the prognostic index and deriving unconstrained low-order rules with Orthogonal Search Rule Extraction.

The K-means cluster analysis was applied on the satellite time-series of chlorophyll concentration. The resulting coherent patterns were then explained on the basis of the present knowledge of the basin's functioning. Winter biomass enhancements were shown to occur in most of the basin and last for 23 months depending on the region. Classical spring bloom regimes were also observed, regularly in the NorthWestern Mediterranean, and intermittently in four other specific areas. The geographical correspondence between specific clusters and regions showing high values of mean chlorophyll concentration indicates that, at least in the Mediterranean Sea, accumulations of phytoplankton are observed only where specific temporal trends are present.

First, it is the presence of kernel properties that allow using popular and well-performing computational tools designed for linear spaces, like SVM and k-means. Second, it is very important to take into account common evolutionary descent of homologous proteins. However, none of the existing similarity measures possesses both of these properties at once. In this paper, we propose a simple probabilistic evolution model of amino acid sequences that is built as a straightforward generalization of the PAM evolution model of single amino acids. This model produces a class of kernel functions each of which is computed as the likelihood of the hypothesis that both sequences are results of two independent evolutionary transformations of a hidden common ancestor under some specific assumptions on the evolution mechanism. The proposed class of kernels is rather wide and contains as particular subclasses not only the family of J.-P Vert's local alignment kernels, whose algebraic structure was introduced without any evolutionary motivation, but also some other families of local and global kernels. We demonstrate, via k-means clustering of a set of amino acid sequences from the VIDA database, that the global kernel can be useful in bringing to-ether otherwise very different protein families.

Cluster of Microcalcifications (MCC) in mammograms can be an important early sign of breast cancer, the detection is important to prevent and treat the disease. In this paper, we present a novel method for the detection of MCC in mammograms which consists of image enhancement by histogram adaptive equalization technique, MCC edge detection by Coordinate Logic Filters (CLF), generation, clustering and labelling of suboptimal features vectors by means of Self Organizing Map (SOM) Neural Network. Like comparison we applied an unsupervised clustering K-means in the stage of labelling of our method. In the labelling stage, we obtain better results with the proposed SOM Neural Network compared with the k-means algorithm. Then, we show that the proposed method can locate MCCs in an efficient way.(1)	[Quintanilla-Dominguez, J.; Cortina-Januchs, M. G.; Buendia-Buendia, F.

In this context, unsupervised classification of trees arises as a challenging new area that depends on the careful development of novel mathematical framework. The discussion will center on statistical aspects of clustering in a framework where the tree data to be clustered has been sampled from some unknown probability distribution. Following Ref. 12, we will try to verify two conditions: appropriateness, the clustering of the data set should reveal some structure of the underlying data rather than model artifacts due to the random sampling process; and steadiness, the more sample points we have, the more reliable the clustering should be. We will argue about steadiness and reliability by showing an extension of the convergence properties for a class of non-parametric clustering algorithm: k-means, defined on different metric spaces of trees. We will explore the appropriateness of the clustering outputs of k-means on a real data set from proteomics, and we will comment the results from Ref. I on three real data sets of phylogenetic trees.

OPTIMIZATION OF EMG-SIGNAL SOURCE CLASSIFICATION BASED ON ADAPTIVE WAVELETS K-MEAN ALGORITHM	BIOSIGNALS 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Bio-Inspired Systems and Signal Processing	JAN 14-17, 2009	Oporto, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technologies Informat, Control & Commun, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc, Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence, ACM SIGART		EMG decomposition; Spike overlapping; Wavelet coefficient; MUAP's clustering; Firing spikes	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DECOMPOSITION; MUSCLE	In this paper the optimization of EMG signals segmentation and decomposition based on wavelet representation and k-mean clustering technique is presented. It is shown that wavelet decomposition can be usefull in detecting particular spikes in EMG signals and the presented segmentation algorithm may be useful for the detection of active segments in related MUAP's action potentials. The algorithms has been tested on the synthetic model signal and on real signals recorded with intramuscular multi-point electrode. The efficiency of EMG signal decomposition and classification with adaptive wavelet algorithm were presented. Single and multiple fibers MUAP patterns were tested and identified. By applying a Debauchies wavelet transformation and k-mean clustering algorithm to localize the action-potential source in the presence of specific neuromuscular diseases like NMI neuropathy, muscular dystrophy and myasthenia gravis (MG), instead of many decomposition and pattern recognition algorithm, wavelets and k-mean clustering have its flexibility for robustly classify and localize the signal stochastic sources with a linear way, in addition to identify the blind source for EMG bioelectric potential.

Many methods for clustering genes using gene expression profiles have been suggested, but it is not easy to interpret the biological significance of the results or utilize these methods for understanding the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. In this study, we introduce an algorithm for readjusting the boundaries of clusters by adopting the advantages of both k-means and singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we suggest a methodology for searching the principal genes that can be the most crucial genes in regulation of clusters. We found 34 principal genes from 171 clusters having strong concentratedness in their expression patterns and distinct ranges of oscillatory phases, by using a time-series microarray dataset of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells after induction of dopaminergic neural differentiation. The biological significance of the principal genes examined in the literature supports the feasibility of our algorithms in that the hierarchy of clusters may lead the manifestation of the phenotypes, e.g., the development of the nervous system.

In this work we propose a new cDNA microarray image analysis system. A cDNA microarray analysis system consists of three main parts which are Gridding, Segmentation and Information Extraction, respectively. In gridding stage we propose a new automated gridding technique which is based on mathematical morphology. For segmentation we propose two different algorithm which are based on K-Means clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering respectively. On the final stage, information extraction, our proposed system uses a classical approach which calculates background values locally. The proposed system has open parts in the way of developement and is still being worked on.

Existing techniques perform welt oil structured processes, but still have problems discovering and visualizing less structured ones. Unfortunately, process mining is most interesting in domains requiring flexibility. A typical example would be the treatment process in a hospital where it is vital that people call deviate to deal with changing circumstances. Here it is useful to provide insights into the actual processes but at the same time there is a lot of diversity leading to complex models that are difficult to interpret. This paper presents an approach using trace clustering, i.e., the event log is split into homogeneous subsets and for each subset a process model is created. We, demonstrate that our approach, based oil log profiles, can improve process mining results in real flexible environments. To illustrate this we present a real-life case study.

Our approach increases task-execution efficiency of multiple robots by reducing the response time to each task. It clusters the request points based on the k-means algorithm, then pre-positions the robots at standby locations obtained by considering Steiner trees in their designated clusters. Robots travel along shortest paths to serve requests and have collision avoidance ability. A switching strategy for robots is also presented. By switching designated clusters, robots further shorten the total response time and balance their workloads implicitly. Thus, the total task execution time is reduced. The performance of our approach is evaluated through simulations.

The sample was formed by pupils of the seventh and ninth classes of primary schools or their equivalents on the other types of schools in regional capitals of the Czech Republic. The sample was gained due to the international SAHA project and consisted of 2973 persons. The twelve years old cohort consisted of 1447 persons (54% of girls) and the fourteen years old cohort consisted of 1526 persons (53% of girls). By the means of non-hierarchic cluster analysis (k-means) of items of antisocial behavior scale, four types of persons were identified. The typology was validated by help of relation to substances (cigarettes, alcohol, marihuana, and hard drugs). The higher was the measure of antisocial behavior showed by the persons, the more the persons reported the use of substances.

Forty-four compounds accounting for 86.7-96.7% of the oil were identified. The oils consisted mainly of monoterpene hydrocarbons, in particular, limonene (9.2-53.9%), beta-phellandrene (3.7-25.2%), alpha-pinene (1.4-33.7%), and sabinene (0.1-33.6%). The 109 oil compositions were submitted to k-means partitioning and principal component analysis, which allowed the distinction of two groups within the oil samples. ne composition of the major group (92% of the samples) was dominated by limonene and beta-phellandrene, while the second group contained mainly sabinene beside limonene and beta-phellandrene.

However, under non-ideal situations, its recognition accuracy can be reduced dramatically. Under such situations, video images can be used to improve the accuracy. The traditional single image based segmentation method could be inefficient. Video image based thresholding method can help improve the segmentation efficiency. However, traditional thresholding methods are not designed for iris images. In this paper, the multi-level iris video image thresholding method is proposed. It takes advantage of the correlations between consecutive images for video based thresholding. It is an orientation invariant thresholding scheme. K-mean clustering is used to find the clusters and PCA is used to quickly project the image to the clusters. The experimental results show the proposed method is effective. The thresholded images show clear pupil and iris areas, which can help further iris segmentation and processing. In addition, the proposed method can be applied to non-video images if they are obtained from the same sensor with similar illumination conditions.	[Du, Yingzi; Thomas, N.

In this work we present a novel scheme to model the shape of white matter fiber tracts reconstructed from DTI and cluster them into bundles using Fourier descriptors. We characterize a tract's shape by using Fourier descriptors which are effective in capturing shape properties of fiber tracts. Fourier descriptors derived from different shape signatures are analyzed. Clustering is then performed on these multidimensional features in conjunction with mass centers using a k-means like threshold based approach. The advantage of this method lies in the fact that Fourier descriptors achieve spatial independent representation and normalization of white matter fiber tracts which makes it useful for tract comparison across subjects. It also eliminates the need to find matching correspondences between two randomly organized tracts from whole brain tracking. Several issues related to tract shape representation and normalization are also discussed. Real DTI datasets are used to test this technique. Experiment results show that this technique can effectively separate multiple fascicles into plausible bundles.

The problem is solved by minimizing the distance between the components and the centers of the clusters. It is therefore critical to determine the best centers of the clusters. Once the centers of each class are determined, the rule of center neighbourhood is applied to assign an element to a class. The problem of clustering has several applications in various contexts, such as the problems of data mining, bioinformatics and finance. The implementation of the method was applied in the operational process of the Packing Techniques in Cardboard Mayr-Melnhof Packaging firm.

Thus, the aim of this study was to test an automated registration method. We studied 10 patients who had rest and stress CMR perfusion exams. For both exams, three short-axis slices were selected. Then, a rigid edge based registration algorithm was performed. Its quality was assessed 1) qualitatively by comparing the k-means clustering maps obtained before and after registration. 2) quantitatively by estimating noise amplitude within the myocardium. Registration substantially improved myocardial symmetry and heart structures identification on the k-means maps in 12/16 slices at rest and 22/27 slices at stress. It reduced noise amplitude from 48 +/- 26 to 28 +/- 10 at rest (p<0.05) and from 53 +/- 13 to 31 +/- 10 during stress (p<0.05). Our method performed successfully on both rest and stress CMR perfusion data.

The basis images are considered like the membership degree of the data to a particular class. A hard clustering algorithm is easily derived based on these images. This algorithm is applied on a multivariate image to perform image segmentation. The results are compared with those obtained by Fuzzy K-means algorithm and better clustering performances are found for NMF based clustering. We also show that NMF performs well when we deal with uncorrelated clusters but it cannot distinguish correlated clusters.

The proposed classifier is applied for indicating supraventricual arrhythmia in order to verify the performance of the proposed approach. A generic approach based on a histogram of 1(st) derivative of signals is applied for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) is considered for both reducing dimension of features and extracting more plausible features from the extracted features. A simple k-means algorithm works for ECG signal classification in feature space for discriminating abnormal ECG beats caused by supraventricular arrhythmia from normal ECG ones.

Time efficient, automated analytic techniques are therefore required to enjoy the power of such methods. In this study it was investigated if hyperspectral imaging followed by automated noise filtering and statistical image analysis is a suitable method for characterization of the macroscopic structure of atherosclerotic lesions. Ten human aorta samples (6x8 cm) were collected during autopsy. Hyperspectral white light and fluorescence images and 5 - 6 biopsies were collected from each sample. The biopsies were stained (HES, Sudan red), and grouped according to histology. All images were noise filtered and normalized. Fluorescence spectra were collected from all biopsied regions, and used to compute average spectra for each histological group. Supervised classification was performed using Spectral angle mapping (SAM) with the average spectra as endmembers. K-means-and ISO-data clustering was used for unsupervised classification. The results show that noise filtering and normalization is essential for reliable classification. Supervised classification was in general found to perform better than unsupervised classification. However, the SAM results strongly depend on the variation in the spectra used to compute the average endmember spectra. The analysis show that fatty deposits, calcifications, connective tissue and hemoglobin can be identified. The lesions were found to have a complex structure where vulnerable regions could be found next to stabile regions within the same lesion. In conclusion hyperspectral imaging, automated filtering and -analysis was found to be a suitable tool to classify advanced atherosclerotic lesions.	[Randeberg, Lise L.; Larsen, Eivind L.

The enlarging volumes of information emerging by the progress of technology, makes clustering of very large scale of data a challenging task. In order to deal with the problem, many researchers try to design efficient parallel clustering algorithms. In this paper, we propose a parallel k-means clustering algorithm based on MapReduce, which is a simple yet powerful parallel programming technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can scale well and efficiently process large datasets on commodity hardware.

The robustification follows from the application of an impartial trimming procedure inspired on the trimmed k-means method. Asymptotic results for that trimmed maximal F-ratio are given. These results show that the prize to be paid (in terms of increased asymptotic variance) for the robustification is affordable. An example arising from a genetical study shows the interest of the proposed robustification in applied studies.	[Garcia-Escudero, L.

The system works in the whole spectral range [400-700nm] and the high spectral resolution. An algorithm is presented for effectively classifying the surface material on each pixel point into several elements such as substrate, metal, resist, footprint, and paint, based on the surface-spectral reflectance estimated from the spectral imaging data. The proposed approach is an incorporation of spectral reflectance estimation, spectral feature extraction, and image segmentation processes for material classification of raw PCBs. The performance of the proposed method is compared with other methods using the RGB-reflectance based algorithm, the k-means algorithm and the normalized cut algorithm. The experimental results show the superiority of our method in accuracy and computational cost.

Especially, it is impossible to achieve prefect prediction results for the relatively small number of samples in high dimensional data, such as gene expression data. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm, K-Gravity, that groups interdependent features into clusters. Each feature cluster is treated as a single entity for classification evaluation. Unlike previous work that selects a subset of top feature groups from each cluster or top feature groups from all clusters to make up feature pools in final classification, a new classification evaluation method, Embedded Classification Learning (ECL) picks up some top feature groups and builds a classifier on each selected feature groups. The experiment results present that the proposed methods can achieve better feature clustering in final classification than conventional samples-based methods, such as K-Means clustering. Also the proposed evaluation methods, Embedded Classification Learning (ECL), can pay more attention to diversity between different feature groups and improve final classification accuracy further.

SVM classifier based on k-means algorithm has an advance for classifying unlabeled data. To classify the vehicle types automatically, the combined method is implemented with radar signals. This paper proposed a classifier training algorithm based on SVM and k-means clustering as follows (i) using the k-means algorithm to label the input feature data extracted from radar signal into two subsets, (ii) train SVM with labeled data, and (iii) classify unidentified radar signal into large vehicle or small vehicle with the trained classifier. Training features of radar signal includes (i) signal volume and (ii) sum of signal variations, both in frequency domain. These features are taken as system input, while vehicle types as system output. The proposed algorithm is implemented and demonstrated with real FMCW radar signals. With the numerical experiment, satisfying result is obtained.

In particular, transferring of selected video clips obtained through scene change detection is more important than transferring an entire video. In this paper, inter-frame difference values are first computed through combining the chi(2) histogram with the color histogram, as well as normalization. Next, key frames for a cluster are determined through distance clustering and K-mean clustering. Lastly, key frames for a group are determined through a likelihood ratio. According to our experiments, the proposed method surpassed other methods in its ability to detect scene changes due to the use of three steps: difference value calculation, clustering, and key frame extraction.			s3397220@kunsan.ac.kr; jhlee@kunsan.ac.kr; lubimia@kunsan.ac.kr; chan2000@kunsan.ac.kr; ywrhee@kunsan.ac.kr	Lee, Jongchan/; Shin, Seong-Yoon/	Lee, Jongchan/0000-0002-7177-4025; Shin, Seong-Yoon/0000-0002-8085-1467			Antani S, 2002, PATTERN RECOGN, V35, P945, DOI 10.1016/S0031-3203(01)00086-3; Ferman AM, 2002, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V11, P497, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2002.1006397; KIM YL, 2006, J KOREA SOC COMPUTER, V11, P193; Lee MS, 2001, PATTERN RECOGN, V34, P711, DOI 10.1016/S0031-3203(00)00007-8; SARAH VP, 2004, THESIS U BRISTOL; Shin SeongYoon, 2006, [Journal of The Korea Society of Computer and Information, 한국컴퓨터정보학회논문지], V11, P147; Yeo B.-L., 1996, THESIS PRINCETON U; Yeung M, 1998, COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND, V71, P94, DOI 10.1006/cviu.1997.0628; YEUNG MM, 1995, VIDEO BROWSING USING; ZHANG HJ, 1994, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V2182, P142, DOI 10.1117/12.171062; Zhang H.-J., 1995, MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS, V2, P256, DOI DOI 10.1007/BF01225243; ZHONG D, 1997, IEEE INT C CIRC SYST	12	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-02453-5	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5592						604	614				11	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology	BMA15	WOS:000271635000044

To show the effectiveness of the framework, we applied the framework to analyze moving patterns of taxis based on the real-life location history data accumulated from the Taxi Telematics system developed in Jeju, Korea. The analysis aims at obtaining value-added information necessary to provide empty taxis with location recommendation services for the efficient operations of taxis. The proposed framework provides the flow chart which would have a quick look around the overall analysis process and help quickly deal with the same or similar analysis, while saving the temporal and economic costs. Data mining tool used in the framework is Enterprise Miner (E-Miner) in SAS which is one of the most widely used statistics packages and can effectively address huge amounts of log data. Especially, we perform the refined analysis by means of doing repeatedly the well-known k-means clustering method under various spatial or temporal conditions. The paper proposes the refined data mining process 1) extracting the interested dataset about meaningful information driven from the previous cluster results, 2) performing again the detailed clustering with the extracted dataset, and 3) finally extracting the value-added information such as the good pick-up spots or 4) returning the feedback. As a result, the spatiotemporal pattern analysis within the each refined clustering method makes it possible to recommend that the empty taxis go to the nearby cluster location with a high pick-up frequency statistically, resulting in the reduction of empty taxi ratio.

Clustering is a useful tool in discovering interesting patterns and structures within the multivariate geospatial data. One of the key issues in clustering is the specification of appropriate number of clusters, which is not obvious in many practical situations. In this paper we provide all extension of G-means algorithm which automatically learns the number of clusters present in the data and avoids over estimation of the number of clusters. Experimental evaluation on simulated and remotely sensed image data, shows the effectiveness of our algorithm.

In the graph-based k-means algorithm, the centers of the clusters have been traditionally represented using the set median graph. We propose ail approximate method for the generalized median graph computation that allows to use it to represent the centers of the clusters. Experiments on three databases show that using the generalized median graph as the clusters representative yields better results than the set, median graph.

J	Giannakeas, N; Fotiadis, DI				Giannakeas, Nikolaos; Fotiadis, Dimitrios I.			An automated method for gridding and clustering-based segmentation of cDNA microarray images	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Microarray image processing; Gridding; Segmentation; K-means; Fuzzy C means	DNA MICROARRAY; GENE-EXPRESSION	Microarrays are widely used to quantify gene expression levels. Microarray image analysis is one of the tools, which are necessary when dealing with vast amounts of biological data. In this work we propose a new method for the automated analysis of microarray images. The proposed method consists of two stages: gridding and segmentation. Initially, the microarray images are preprocessed using template matching, and block and spot finding takes place. Then, the non-expressed spots are detected and a grid is fit on the image using a Voronoi diagram. In the segmentation stage, K-means and Fuzzy C means (FCM) Clustering are employed. The proposed method was evaluated using images from the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD). The results that are presented in the segmentation stage show the efficiency of our Fuzzy C means-based work compared to the two already developed K-means-based methods. The proposed method can handle images with artefacts and it is fully automated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results have been compared with that obtained from cone classification chart, hierarchical and K-mean clustering techniques. It was observed that variation in result with self-organizing map (SOM) and fuzzy clustering for isolating soil layers is marginal. These techniques are found to be efficient compared to hierarchical clustering technique. The results of K-mean clustering show that the identified soil strata are similar to that obtained from cone classification chart, SOM and fuzzy clustering. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no effective assessment mechanism for learning performance yet exists for e-learning systems. Learning performance assessment aims to evaluate what learners learned during the learning process. Traditional summative evaluation only considers final learning outcomes, without concerning the learning processes of learners. With the evolution of learning technology, the use of learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment can be beneficially adopted to record the procedure of the learning, which evaluates the learning performances of learners and produces feedback information to learners in ways that enhance their learning. Accordingly, this study presents a mobile formative assessment too[ using data mining, which involves six computational intelligence theories, i.e. statistic correlation analysis, fuzzy clustering analysis, grey relational analysis, K-means clustering, fuzzy association rule mining and fuzzy inference, in order to identify the key formative assessment rules according to the web-based learning portfolios of an individual learner for the performance promotion of web-based learning. Restated, the proposed method can help teachers to precisely assess the learning performance of individual learner utilizing only the learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment. Hence, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and designing courseware, since they save a lot of time in measuring learning performance. More importantly, teachers can understand the main factors influencing learning performance in a web-based learning environment based on the interpretable learning performance assessment rules obtained. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative assessment results and the factor analysis provides simple and clear learning performance assessment rules. Furthermore, the proposed learning feedback with formative assessment can clearly promote the learning performances and interests of learners. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The algorithm requires user to state and initialize centroid values of each group in advance. This creates problem for novice users especially to those who have no or little knowledge on the data. Trial-error attempt might be one of the possible preference to deal with this issue. In this paper, an optimization algorithm inspired from the bees foraging activities is used to locate near-optimal centroid of a given data set. Result shows that propose approached prove it robustness and competence in finding a near optimal centroid on both synthetic and real data sets.

The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering technique. It attempts to solve the clustering problem by assigning each to a sin-le cluster. However, in practice especially in case of Bioinformatics data. one gene can be found in many clusters simultaneously. To sort out this problem, FUZZY C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is applied to microarray data. Two pattern recognition data (IRIS and WBCD data) and thirteen microarray data is used to evaluate performance of K-means and Fuzzy C-means. Improvement of approx. 30 percent clustering accuracy is achieved in case of FCM compared to K-means algorithm. Extensive Simulation results shows that the FCM clustering algorithm was able to provide the highest accuracy and generalization results compared to K-means clustering algorithm.

We use diffusion maps to automatically learn a semantic visual vocabulary from abundant quantized midlevel features. Each midlevel feature is represented by the vector of pointwise mutual information (PMI). In this midlevel feature space, we believe the features produced by similar sources must lie on a certain manifold. To capture the intrinsic geometric relations between features, we measure their dissimilarity using diffusion distance. The underlying idea is to embed the midlevel features into a semantic lower-dimensional space. Our goal is to construct a compact yet discriminative semantic visual vocabulary. Although the conventional approach using k-means is good for vocabulary construction, its performance is sensitive to the size of the visual vocabulary. In addition, the learnt visual words are not semantically meaningful since the clustering criterion is based on appearance similarity only Our proposed approach can effectively overcome these problems by capturing the semantic and geometric relations of the feature space using diffusion maps. Unlike some of the supervised vocabulary construction approaches, and the unsupervised methods such as pLSA and LDA, diffusion maps can capture the local intrinsic geometric relations between the midlevel feature points on the manifold. We have tested our approach on the KTH action dataset, our own You Tube action dataset and the fifteen scene dataset, and have obtained very promising results.

Based on a soft fiber representation, we extend the tensor kernel to deal with fiber tracts using the multi-instance kernel that reflects not only interactions between points along fiber tracts, but also the interactions between diffusion tensors. This unsupervised method is fill-titer extended by way of an atlas-based registration of diffusion-free images, followed by a classification of fibers based on nonlinear kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Promising experimental results of tensor and fiber classification of the human skeletal muscle over a significant set of healthy and diseased subjects demonstrate the potential of our approach.

J	Hong, TP; Wang, PC; Lee, YC				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Wang, Po-Cheng; Lee, Yeong-Chyi			AN EFFECTIVE ATTRIBUTE CLUSTERING APPROACH FOR FEATURE SELECTION AND REPLACEMENT	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature clustering; Feature selection; Genetic algorithms; k-Means; Reduct	ALGORITHMS	Feature selection is an important preprocessing step in mining and learning. A good set of features cannot only improve the accuracy of classification, but can also reduce the time to derive rules. It is executed especially when the amount of attributes in a given training data is very large. In this article, an attribute clustering method based on genetic algorithms is proposed for feature selection and feature replacement. It combines both the average accuracy of attribute substitution in clusters and the cluster balance as the fitness function. Experimental comparison with the k-means clustering approach and all combinations of attributes also shows the proposed approach can get a good trade-off between accuracy and time complexity. Besides, after feature selection, the rules derived from only the selected features may usually be hard to use if some values of the selected features cannot be obtained in current environments. This problem can be easily solved in our proposed approach. The attributes with missing values can be replaced by other attributes in the same clusters. The proposed approach is thus more flexible than the previous feature-selection techniques.

The problem we solved by means of clustering was to partition the local feature descriptors space so that thousands of partitions represent visual words, which may be effectively employed in video retrieval using classical information retrieval techniques. It has proved that well-known algorithms as K-means do not work well in this task or their computational complexity is too high. Therefore we developed a simple clustering method (referred to as MLD) that partitions the high-dimensional feature space incrementally in one to two database scans. The paper describes the problem of video retrieval and the role of clustering in the process, the MLD method and experiments focused on comparison with other clustering methods in the video retrieval application context.

Indeed they allow decision makers to examine data at different levels of detail with On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) operators such as drill-down and roll-up. The granularity levels which compose a, dimension hierarchy are usually fixed during the design step of the data warehouse, according to the identified analysis needs of the users. However, in practice, the needs of users may evolve and grow in time. Hence, to take into account the users' analysis evolution into the data warehouse, we propose to integrate personalization techniques within the OLAP process. We propose two kinds of OLAP personalization in the data warehouse: (1) adaptation and (2) recommendation. Adaptation allows users to express their own needs in terms of aggregation rules defined from a child level (existing level) to a. parent level (new level). The system will adapt itself by including the new hierarchy level into the data warehouse schema. For recommending new OLAP queries, we provide a new OLAP operator based on the K-means method. Users are asked to choose K-means parameters following their preferences about the obtained clusters which may form a new granularity level in the considered dimension hierarchy. We use the K-means clustering method in order to highlight aggregates semantically richer than those provided by classical OLAP operators. In both adaptation and recommendation techniques, the new data warehouse schema allows item, and more elaborated OLAP queries. Our approach for OLAP personalization is implemented within Oracle 10 g as it prototype which allows the creation of new granularity levels in dimension hierachies of the data warehouse. Moreover, we carried out some experiments which validate the relevance of our approach.

These decisions are difficult to make and their impact on clustering performance is significant. We propose a family of algorithms for weighted graph clustering that neither requires a predefined number of cluster, unlike K-means, nor a threshold for the weight of edges, unlike Star. To do so, we use re-assignment of vertices as a halting criterion, as in K-means, and a metric for selecting clusters' seeds, as in Star. Pictorially, the algorithms' strategy resembles the rippling of stones thrown in a pond, thus the name 'Ricochet'. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms using standard datasets and evaluate the impact of removing constraints by comparing the performance of our algorithms with constrained algorithms: K-means and Star and unconstrained algorithm: Markov clustering.

The techniques have been used to manage the heat dissipation and operating temperature to avoid thermal emergencies, but are not aware of application behavior in Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). In this paper, we propose a temperature-aware scheduler based on applications' thermal behavior groups classified by a K-means clustering method in multicore systems. The application's thermal behavior group has similar thermal pattern as well as thermal parameters. With these thermal behavior groups, we provide thermal balances among cores with negligible performance overhead. We implement and evaluate our schemes in the 4-core (Intel Quad Core Q6600) and 8-core (two Quad Core Intel XEON E5310 processors) systems running several benchmarks. The experimental results show that. the temperature-aware scheduler based on thermal behavior grouping reduces the peak temperature by up to 8 degrees C and 5 degrees C in our 4-core system and 8-core system with only 12% and 7.52% performance overhead, respectively, compared to Linux standard scheduler.

In this paper, three definitions of face area are compared on the context of Three dimensional (3D) face shape similarity based clustering. The first method defines the face area by spanning from the whole head grid surface by the front pi/2 wedge angle along a line going through the centroid and pointing to the top of the head. The second method defines the face area as the grid surface enclosed by several anthropometric landmark points (sellion, both zygions, and menton) on the facial surface. The zonal surface where the respirator interferes with the wear's face is taken as the third alternative definition for the comparative study. By utilizing the block-distance measure, each face was converted into a compact block-distance vector. Then, k-means clustering was performed on the vectors. 376 3D face data sets were tested in this study. One-way ANOVA on the block distance based vectors was conducted to evaluate the influence on clustering results by utilizing different face area definitions. No difference was found at the significant level of 0.05. However, the cluster membership shows great difference between different definitions. This emphasizes the value of the selection of face area in 3D face shape-similarity-based clustering.

The objective of this study was to examine the sensitivity of clustering results on block-division. Such a block-division technique means to divide each 3D surface into a predefined number of blocks. Then by using a block-distance measure, each surface is converted into a block-distance based vector. Finally, k-means clustering is performed on the vectors to segment a population into several groups. Totally 447 3D head samples have been analyzed in the case study. The influence of block division number on clustering was evaluated by using One-way ANOVA. No significant difference was found between the three block division alternatives. This means the adopted method is robust to block division.

The composed algorithm, Anomalous Pattern Fuzzy Clustering (AP-FCM), is applied in the segmentation of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) images for the identification of Coastal Upwelling. A set of features are constructed from the AP-FCM clustering segmentation taking into account domain knowledge and a threshold procedure is defined in order to identify the transition cluster whose frontline is automatically annotated on SST images to separate the upwelling regions from the background. Two independent data samples in a total of 61 SST images covering large diversity of upwelling situations are analysed. Results show that by timing the AP-FCM stop conditions it fits a good number of clusters providing art effective segmentation of the SST images whose spatial visualization of fuzzy membership closely reproduces the original images. Comparing the AP-FCM with the FCM using several validation indices shows the advantage of the AP-FCM avoiding tinder or over-segmented images. Quantitative assessment of the segmentations is accomplished through ROC analysis. Compared to FCM, the number of iterations of the AP-FCM is significantly decreased. The automatic annotation of upwelling frontlines from the AP-FCM segmentation overcomes the subjective visual inspection made by the Oceanographers.

The objects come from a multi-table stream e.g. streams of Customer and Transaction. As the Transactions stream accumulates, the Customers' profiles grow. First;, we use all incremental propositionalisation to convert the multi-table stream into a single-table stream upon which we apply clustering. For this purpose, we develop an online version of K-Means algorithm that can handle these swelling objects and any new objects that arrive. The algorithm also monitors the quality of the model and performs re-clustering when it deteriorates. We evaluate our method on the PKDD Challenge 1999 dataset.

This paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm named PKM. PKM is based on similarity degree among data points made by cumulated K-means, and get the final clustering partition via fuzzy clustering analysis (Transitive Closure Method), to make the precise rate of clustering higher, and reduce the effects made by isolated points and random clustering center, at the same time, can recognize isolated points better.

Classical models can be insufficient to visualise the results because the water quality variables used to describe dynamic pollution sources are complex, multivariable, and nonlinearly related. Artificial intelligence techniques with the ability to analyse multivariant water quality data by means of a sophisticated visualisation capacity can offer an alternative to current models. In this study, the Kohonen self-organising feature maps (SOM) neural network was initially applied to analyse the complex nonlinear relationships among multivariable surface water quality variables using the component planes of the variables to determine the complex behaviour of water quality parameters. The dependencies between water quality variables were extracted and interpreted using the pattern analysis visualised in component planes. For further investigation, the k-means clustering algorithm was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by partitioning the maps and utilising the Davies-Bouldin clustering index, leading to seven groups or clusters corresponding to water quality variables. The results reveal that the concentrations of Na, K, Cl, NH(4)-N, NO(2)-N, o-PO(4), component planes of organic matter (pV), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were significantly affected by seasonal changes, and that the SOM technique is an efficient tool with which to analyse and determine the complex behaviour of multidimensional surface water quality data. These results suggest that this technique could also be applied to other environmentally sensitive areas such as air and groundwater pollution.

In this work, we emphasize the importance of the correctness of this averaging subroutine and propose a novel shape averaging method, called Prioritized Shape Averaging (PSA), rising hierarchical clustering approach. In experimental evaluation, our proposed method, PSA, achieves a lower discrepancy distance between an averaged sequence and every original sequence than existing method on various domains.

The responses of an analog circuit were difference at some node with the normal and failure conditions. However, the identification of the faulted location was not easily task due to the variability of circuit components. So this paper presented a novel extension method for fault diagnosis of analog circuit, which is based on the matter-element model and extended relation functions. The proposed method has been tested on a practical analog circuit, and compared with the multilayer neural network (MNN) based methods and k-means classification method. The application of this new method to some testing cases has given promising results.

The so called Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC ill short) is first, formulated in the form of a hard combinatorial optimization problem. It is afterwards recast; as a (continuous) DC program with the help of exact penalty in DC programming. A DCA scheme is then investigated. The related DCA is original and very inexpensive because it amounts to computing, at each iteration, the projection of points onto a simplex and/or onto a, ball, that all are given in the explicit form. Numerical results oil real word data sets show the efficiency of DCA and its great superiority with respect to K-means, a standard method of clustering.

We revisit this information-theoretic clustering problem under the auspices of mixed-type Bregman divergences, and show that the approach of Davis and Dhillon [2] (NIPS*06) can also be derived directly, by applying the Bregman k-means algorithm, once the proper vector/matrix Legendre transformations axe defined. We further explain the dualistic structure of the sided k-means clustering, and present a novel k-means algorithm for clustering with respect to the symmetrical relative entropy, the J-divergence. Our approach extends to differential entropic clustering of arbitrary members of the same exponential families in statistics.

Its assessment and diagnosis, especially the decision about performing a surgical operation of the abdomen, continues to be a clinical challenge. This study investigates the possibilities of applying state of the art computational intelligence methods for the analysis of abdominal pain data. Specifically, the application of a Genetic Clustering Algorithm and of the Random Forests algorithm (RF) is explored. Clinical appendicitis prediction involves the estimation of at least 15 clinical and laboratory factors (features). The contribution of each factor to the prediction is not known. Thus, the goal of abdominal pain data analysis is not restricted to the classification of the data, but includes the exploration of the underlying data structure. In this study a genetic clustering algorithm is employed for the later task and its performance is compared to a classical K-means clustering approach. For classification purposes, tree methods are frequently used in medical applications since they often reveal simple relationships between variables that can be used to interpret the data. They are however very prone to overfitting problems. Random Forests, applied in this study, is a novel ensemble classifier which builds a number of decision trees to improve the single tree classifier generalization ability. The application of the above mentioned algorithms to real data resulted in very low error rates, (less than 5%), indicating the usefulness of the respective approach. The most informative diagnostic features as proposed by the algorithms are in accordance with known medical expert knowledge. The experimental results furthermore confirmed both, the greater ability of the genetic clustering algorithm to reveal the underlying data patterns as compared to the K-means approach and the effectiveness of RF-based diagnosis as compared to a single decision tree algorithm.

Wavelet decomposition was adopted to provide flexible descriptions of 3-D shapes on different resolution levels. A block-division technique was then proposed to divide each decomposed 3-D surface into a predefined number of blocks. Afterwards, by using the block-distance metric, each decomposed surface was converted into a block-distance vector. Not only the size information but also the geometric information of the 3-D surfaces are contained in the vector. Finally, k-means clustering was performed on the vectors to segment the sample population into several groups. A total of 378 3-D upper head and face samples were analysed to illustrate the applicability of the method. Clustering was validated by using two measures, size-weighted variances and Clustering Validity Index. K-means clusterings of different variables were compared, including head length and head breadth, the top five principal components from principal component analysis (PCA) on the proposed block distance-based vectors and the block distance-based vectors directly. No obvious difference was found between clustering on the vectors with and without PCA. Lower values of the two measures when clustering on the block distance-based vectors indicated that the proposed block distance-based descriptor is superior to the traditional sizing dimensions of head length and head breadth. Unlike the traditional sizing methods based on key dimensions or derived variables, the method proposed in this study is based on the 3-D shape of the body surface. The proposed block-distance vector reflects not only the overall size but also the local spatial geometric features of a 3-D surface. The new method can be expected to improve the ergonomic design of those products requiring close fitting, such as face shields, goggles and helmets.

As online signature is a temporal signal, we measure the time-normalized entropy of each genuine signature, namely, its average entropy per second. Entropy is computed locally, on portions of a genuine signature, based on local density estimation by a Client-Hidden Markov Model. The average time-normalized entropy computed on a set of genuine signatures allows then categorizing writers in an unsupervised way, using a K-Means algorithm. Linearly separable and visually coherent classes of writers are obtained on MCYT-100 database and on a subset of BioSecure DS2 containing 104 persons (DS2-104). These categories can be analyzed in terms of variability and complexity measures that we have defined in this work. Moreover, as each category can be associated with a signature prototype inherited from the K-Means procedure, we can generalize the writer categorization process on the large subset DS2-382 from the same DS2 database, containing 382 persons. Performance assessment shows that one category of signatures is significantly more reliable in the recognition phase, and given the fact that our categorization can be used online, we propose a novel criterion for enhanced writer enrolment.

A Parallel Point Matching Algorithm for Landmark Based Image Registration Using Multicore Platform	EURO-PAR 2009: PARALLEL PROCESSING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Euro-Par Conference on Parallel Computing	AUG 25-28, 2009	Delft, NETHERLANDS	Parallel & Distributed Syst Grp	Delft Univ Technol		BROAD-BAND ENGINE; CELL/BE	Point snatching is crucial for many computer vision applications. Establishing the correspondence between a large number of data points is a computationally intensive process. Some point; matching related applications; such as medical image registration; require real time or near real time performance if applied to critical clinical applications like image :assisted surgery. In this paper; we report a new multicore platform based parallel algorithm for fast point matching in the context of landmark based medical image registration. We introduced a non-regular data, partition algorithm which utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to group the landmarks based on the number of available processing cores; which optimize the memory usage and data transfer. We have tested our method using the IBM Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.) platform. The results demonstrated a significant speed up over its sequential implementation. The proposed data partition and parallelization algorithm, though tested only on one multicore platform, is generic by its design. Therefore the parallel algorithm can be extended to other computing platforms, as well as other point matching related applications.

A Geospatial Implementation of a Novel Delineation Clustering Algorithm Employing the K-means	EUROPEAN INFORMATION SOCIETY: TAKING GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE ONE STEP FURTHER	Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference of the Association-of-Geographic-Information-Laboratories-for-Europe	2008	Girona, SPAIN	Assoc Geograph Informat Lab Europe		spatial data; data mining; clustering techniques; large datasets; k-means	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP	The overarching objective of this paper is to introduce a novel Fast, Efficient, and Scalable k-means (FES-k-means*) algorithm. This algorithm is designed to increase the overall performance of the standard k-means clustering technique. The FES-k-means* algorithm uses a hybrid approach that comprises the k-d tree data structure, the nearest neighbor query, the standard k-means algorithm, and Mashor's adaptation rate. The algorithm is tested using two real datasets and two synthetic datasets and is employed twice on all four datasets. The first trial consisted of previously MIL-SOM* trained data, and the second was on raw, untrained data. The approach presented with this method enables unfounded knowledge discovery, otherwise unclaimed by conventional clustering methods. When used in conjunction with the MIL-SOM* training technique, the FES-k-means* algorithm reduces the computation time and produces quality clusters. In particular, the robust FES-k-means* method opens doors to (1) faster cluster production than conventional clustering methods, (2) scalability allowing application in other platforms, and its ability to handle small and large datasets, compact or scattered, and (3) efficient geospatial data analysis of large datasets. All of the above makes FES-k-means* live up to defending its well-deserved name-Fast, Efficient, and Scalable k-means (FES-k-means*). The findings of this study are vital to the relatively new and expanding subfield of geospatial data management.

Diversity in Image Retrieval: DCU at ImageCLEFPhoto 2008	EVALUATING SYSTEMS FOR MULTILINGUAL AND MULTIMODAL INFORMATION ACCESS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF 2008)	SEP 17-19, 2008	Aarhus, DENMARK			Content-Based Image Retrieval; Data Fusion; Clustering		DCU participated in the ImageCLEF 2008 photo retrieval task, which aimed to evaluate diversity in linage Retrieval, submitting runs for both the English and Random language annotation conditions. Our approaches used text-based and image-based retrieval to give baseline runs, with the the highest-ranked images from these baseline runs clustered using K-Means clustering of the text annotations, with representative images from each cluster ranked for the final submission. For random language annotations, we compared results from translated runs with untranslated runs. Our results,,how that combining image and text outperforms text alone and image alone, both for general retrieval performance and for diversity. Our baseline image and text runs give our best overall balance between retrieval and diversity; indeed, our baseline text and image run was the 2nd best automatic run for ImageCLEF 2008 Photographic Retrieval task. We found that clustering consistently gives a large improvement in diversity performance over the baseline, unclustered results, while degrading retrieval performance. Pseudo relevance feedback consistently improved retrieval, but always at the cost of diversity. We, also found that the diversity of untranslated random runs was quite close to that of translated random runs, indicating that for this dataset at, least, if diversity is our main concern it may not, be necessary to translate the image annotations.

Our system uses Lucene for text indexing and LIRE for image indexing. We experiment with several clustering methods in order to retrieve images from diverse clusters. The clustering methods are: k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Our own method based on WordNet. We present results for thirteen runs, in order to compare retrieval based on text description, to image-only retrieval, and to merged retrieval, and to compare results for the different clustering methods.

SEARCHING FOR PATTERNS OF THERMOSTABILITY IN PROTEINS AND DEFINING THE MAIN FEATURES CONTRIBUTING TO ENZYME THERMOSTABILITY THROUGH SCREENING, CLUSTERING, AND DECISION TREE ALGORITHMS	EXCLI JOURNAL			English	Article						Bioinformatics; modeling; protein; thermostability	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; THERMOPHILIC PROTEINS; THERMOTOGA-MARITIMA; FAMILY-11 XYLANASE; MUTANT STABILITY; CODON USAGE; MUTATIONS; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; RESOLUTION	Finding or making thermostable enzymes has been identified as an important goal in a number of different industries. Therefore, understanding the features involved in enzyme thermostability is crucial, and different approaches have been used to extract or manufacture thermostable enzymes. Herein we examined features that contribute to the thermostability of 2,946 proteins. We used various screening techniques (anomaly detection, feature selection), clustering methods (K-Means, TwoStep cluster), decision tree models (Classification and Regression Tree, CHAID, Exhaustive CHAID, QUEST, C5.0), and generalized rule induction (association) (GRI) models to search for patterns of thermostability and to find features that contribute to enzyme thermal stability. We found that Arg as the N-terminal amino acid was found solely in proteins working at temperatures higher than 70 degrees C. Fifty-four protein features were shown to be important in feature selection modeling, and the number of peer groups with an anomaly index of 2.12 declined from 7 to 2 after being run using only important selected features; however, no changes were found in the numbers of groups when K-Means and TwoStep clustering modeling was performed on datasets with/without feature selection filtering. The depth of the trees generated by various decision tree models varied from 14 (in the C5.0 model with 10-fold cross-validation and with feature selection of the dataset) to 4 (in CHAID models) branches. The performance evaluation of the decision tree models tested here showed that C5.0 was the best and the Quest model was the worst. We did not find any significant difference in the percent of correctness, performance evaluation, and mean correctness of various decision tree models when feature selected datasets were used, but the number of peer groups in clustering models was reduced significantly (p<0.05) compared to datasets without feature selection. In all decision tree models, the frequency of Gln was the most important feature for decision tree rule sets; moreover, in all GRI association rules (100 rules), the frequency of Gln was used in antecedent to support the rules. The importance of Gln in protein thermostability is discussed in this paper.

J	Lai, CC; Chang, CY				Lai, Chih-Chin; Chang, Chuan-Yu			A hierarchical evolutionary algorithm for automatic medical image segmentation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Image segmentation; Hierarchical evolutionary algorithm	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; HOPFIELD NEURAL-NETWORK; INFORMATION; DESIGN; MRI	Image segmentation denotes a process of partitioning an image into distinct regions. A large variety of different segmentation approaches for images have been developed. Among them, the clustering methods have been extensively investigated and used. In this paper, a clustering based approach using a hierarchical evolutionary algorithm (HEA) is proposed for medical image segmentation. The HEA can be viewed as a variant of conventional genetic algorithms. By means of a hierarchical structure in the chromosome, the proposed approach can automatically classify the image into appropriate classes and avoid the difficulty of searching for the proper number of classes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can produce more continuous and smoother segmentation results in comparison with four existing methods, competitive Hopfield neural networks (CHNN), dynamic thresholding, k-means, and fuzzy c-means methods.

Modular service architecture reduces the complexities of operation while at the same time speeding in bringing new products to market. In this paper, we create a novel methodology for identifying modules in service. Through service process analysis, a function relation matrix is examined to define the relationships between the service elements. The reintegration process by using ward's method and K-means clustering is also analyzed. Finally we test such approach on the specific case of an express mail delivery service.

Conventional initialization methods tend to loss effectiveness due to the so-called "curse of dimensionality" when clustering high-dimensional data. In this paper, a local density based method is proposed to search for initial cluster centers on high-dimensional data. We define the probability density of a point as the amount of its highly similar neighborhoods with weight coefficient. Points with high density neighborhoods and low similarity are chosen as the initial cluster centers. Experimental results on real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

FPGAs have shown very high performance in spite of their low operational frequency by fully extracting the parallelism. In recent micro processors, it also becomes possible to utilize the parallelism using multi-cores which support improved SIMD instructions, though programmers have louse them explicitly to achieve high performance. Recent GPUs support a large number of cores, and have a potential for high performance in many applications. However, the cores are grouped, and data transfer between the groups is very limited. Programming tools for FPGA, SIMD instructions on CPU and a large number of cores on GPU have been developed, but it is still difficult to achieve high performance on these platforms. In this paper, we compare the performance of FPGA, GPU and CPU using three applications in image processing; two-dimensional filters, stereo-vision and k-means clustering, and make it clear which platform is faster under which conditions.

Recently, the estimation of fibre structure has been simplified with diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). In order to assess the heart architecture and its underlying function, with the goal of dealing with pathological tissues and easing inter-patient comparisons, we propose a methodology for finding cardiac myofibrille trace correspondences across a fibre population obtained from DT-MRI data. It relies on the comparison of geometrical and topological clustering operating on different fibre representation modes (fixed length sequences of 3-D coordinates with or without ordering strategy, and 9-D vectors for trace shape approximation). In geometrical clustering (or k-means) each fibre path is assigned to the cluster with nearest barycenter. In topological (or spectral) clustering the data is represented by a similarity graph and the graph vertices are divided into groups so that intra-cluster connectivity is maximized and inter-cluster connectivity is minimized. Using these different clustering methods and fibre representation modes; we predict different fibre trace classifications for the same cardiac dataset. These classification results are compared to the human heart architecture models proposed in the literature.

The ITS dataset consists of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, where rather sophisticated alignment scores have to be used as a measure of distance. These scores do not form a Minkowski metric and the sequences cannot be regarded as points in a finite dimensional space. This is why it is necessary to develop novel machine learning approaches to the analysis of datasets of this sort. This paper introduces a k-committees classifier and compares it with the discrete k-means and Nearest Neighbour classifiers. It turns out that all three machine learning algorithms are efficient and can be used to automate future biologically significant classifications for datasets of this kind. A simplified version of a synthetic dataset, where the k-committees classifier outperforms k-means and Nearest Neighbour classifiers, is also presented.	[Yearwood, J. L.; Kelarev, A.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) are adopted to realize the identification. An improved Back Propagation neural network (BP) algorithm, nearest neighbor-clustering Radial Basis Function (RBF) algorithm and K-means clustering RBF algorithm are used. Results show that the classification of the different wine samples is possible using the response signals of the E-nose. For the three neural networks BP, improved RBF and K-means RBF, the correct classification rates are 100%, 83.3%; 83.3% to original data, and they are 95.83%, 83.3%, 83.3% after process with PCA. From the test of two alcohols, the correct classification rates can reach 87.5%. The overall results show that the two neural networks can be employed for classification of the different wine samples. The classification method of ANN & PCA. is proved to be a, rapid and exact identification measure for pattern identification.

Accurate quantification of overall and subtype Cerrado distributions is essential for regional monitoring. In this research, unsupervised fuzzy ARTMAP was compared against conventional k-means classification of Cerrado and agriculture, based on Hyperion satellite data. We systematically tested a range of fuzzy ARTMAP parameters, determining the best parameter combinations. The effect of an additional surface liquid-water input vector was also tested. Similar results were obtained when only Hyperion apparent surface reflectance data were used; fuzzy ARTMAP, however, was generally markedly more accurate than k-mcans when the additional surface liquid-water input was included.

Understanding the power characteristics of a microprocessor under design requires a careful study using a variety of workloads. These workloads range from benchmarks that represent typical behavior up to hand-tuned stress benchmarks (so called stressmarks) that stress the microprocessor to its extreme power consumption. This paper closes the gap between these two extremes by studying techniques for the automated identification of stress patterns (worst-case application behaviors) in typical workloads, For doing so, we borrow from sampled simulation theory and we provide two key insights. First, although representative sampling is slightly less effective in characterizing average behavior than statistical sampling, it is substantially more effective in finding stress patterns. Second, we find that threshold clustering is a better alternative than k-means clustering, which is typically used in representative sampling, for finding stress patterns. Overall, we can identify extreme energy and power behaviors in microprocessor workloads with a three orders of magnitude speedup with an error of a few percent on average.

We use DCT mapping to extract features from sequences, and discuss sequence similarities of whole similarity and partial similarity. The two kinds of similarity concepts will be applied when clustering sequences of equal-length and variable-length, respectively. In the case of equal-length, we map a sequence to a f-dimensional point in the feature space, and then cluster these sequences accordingly by applying hierarchical clustering and partitional clustering (i.e., K-means). In the case of variable-length, we cut a sequence into subsequences by sliding window, and map subsequences to f-dimensional points. We propose a Modified K-means (MK) algorithm to handle partial similarity of subsequences. Finally, we implement our methods and perform experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

Therefore, many methods of initializing K-means clustering have been proposed in the literatures. Compared with K-means clustering, a novel clustering algorithm called affinity propagation (AP clustering) has been developed by Frey and Dueck, which can produce a good set of cluster exemplars with fast speed. Taking the convergence property of K-means and the good performance of affinity propagation, we presented a new clustering strategy which can produce much lower squared error than AP and standard K-means: initializing K-means clustering using cluster exemplars produced by AP.

This paper proves that the objective function of Otsu method is equivalent to that of K-means method in multilevel thresholding. They are both based on a same criterion that minimizes the within-class variance. However, Otsu method is an exhaustive algorithm of searching the global optimal threshold, while K-means is a local optimal method. Moreover, K-means does not require computing a gray-level histogram before running, but Otsu method needs to compute a gray-level histogram firstly. Therefore, K-means can be more efficiently extended to multilevel thresholding method, two-dimensional thresholding method and three-dimensional method than Otsu method. This paper proved that the clustering results of K-means keep the order of the initial centroids with respect to one-dimensional data set. The experiments show that the k-means thresholding method performs well with less computing time than Otsu method does on three dimensional image thresholding.

Such algorithm selects neighbor nodes at random, and this reduces routing efficiency. In this paper a new algorithm of optimizing p2p overlay network topology is proposed, which is based on minimum maximum k-means principle. According to the communication history, the division presents a steady network topology with k clusters and k cluster center nodes. This optimized p2p network topology presents a high performance of routing efficiency. The minimum maximum principle makes the division more appropriate, so that there will be less probability of being unsteady for the p2p network. The conclusions show that this algorithm is an efficient p2p network topology optimized algorithm.

To help developers, we propose Kahn process networks, which are based on message-passing and shared-nothing model, as a simple and flexible tool for modeling parallel applications. We argue that they are more flexbile than MapReduce, which is widely recognized for its efficiency and simplicity. Nevertheless, Kahn process networks are equally intuitive to use, and, indeed, MapReduce is implementable as a Kahn process network. Our presented benchmarks (word count and k-means) show that a Kahn process network framework permits alternative implementations that bring significant performance advantages: the two programs run by a factor of up to similar to 2.8 (word-count) and similar to 1.8 (k-means) faster than their implementations for Phoenix, which is a MapReduce framework specifically optimized for executing on multicore machines.

This knowledge can be modelled in several ways, Such its by means of rules or probabilistic models. These models are validated by checking the system Output fit to the input in a supervised way. However, when there is no such knowledge or when it is hard to obtain a model of it, it is alternatively possible to use an Unsupervised method to detect anomalies and failures. Different unsupervised methods (HCL, K-Means, SOM) have been used in present work to identify abnormal behaviours Oil the system being monitored. This approach has been tested into a real-world monitored system related to the railway domain, and the results show how it is possible to successfully identify new abnormal system behaviours beyond those previously modelled well-known problems.

Based on the interactive mechanism between the urban system and the Olympics' venue projects, as well as the demand theory, this paper explores the main factors of the urban system are per capita GDP, population, ratio of the service industries of the urban system, which influence post-Games development of the Olympics' venues. Meanwhile, with the relevant statistic materials of the recent Games host cities in the Games year, applies two methods of ward cluster analysis and k-means cluster analysis to verify the validity of the three factors which influence post-Games development of the Olympics' venues. The Olympic Events hosted cities in China-Beijing, Hongkong, Qingdao and other cities are clustered with the recent Games host cities, and the differences are discussed. So conclusions are given that support of urban system of hosting the 2008 Olympic Games in China for the post-Games development of Olympics' venues is no strong, and the relevant strategies are introduced, such as attracting external consumption, improving the relative industries of the urban system, etc.	Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Prod Res Ctr, Harbin, Peoples R China	Cheng, XD (reprint author), Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Prod Res Ctr, Harbin, Peoples R China.	chxdok@126.com					ANNEMARIEL H, 2005, J SPORT TOURISM, V10, P187; BALLOUA B, 2000, J ACCOUNTANT ED, V17, P433; Burton R., 2003, Sport Marketing Quarterly, V12, P37; Chalkley B., 1999, PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, V14, P369, DOI DOI 10.1080/026654399364184; CHENG XD, 2008, P 2008 INT C CONSTR, P235; CHENG XD, 2008, COMPETITIVENESS CITI, P92; CUI J, 2007, LOW TEMPERATURE ARCH, V115, P19; Gratton C, 2005, URBAN STUD, V42, P985, DOI 10.1080/00420980500107045; HUO JX, 2007, J WUHAN I PHYS ED, V41, P36; ICKKEUN O, 2004, P 2002 KASTLE ANN AU, P415; LI N, 2005, ARCHITECTURE J, V6, P38; LIN X, 2005, J BEIJING SPORT U, V28, P1441; Lins MPE, 2003, EUR J OPER RES, V148, P312, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00687-2; LUO P, 2007, J XIAN U PHYS ED, V24, P17; MARK H, 2007, MANAGERIAL EC, P56; MARTE PA, 2003, PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC, V4, P106; MONCLUS J, 2003, PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, V18, P399; MORPHETT D, 2000, ENERG POLICY, V23, P1059; Pitsis TS, 2003, ORGAN SCI, V14, P574, DOI 10.1287/orsc.14.5.574.16762; Rebeggiani L., 2006, PUBLIC FINANCE MANAG, V6, P395; Todorovic´ M., 2005, Leisure Studies, V24, P415, DOI 10.1080/02614360500200763; Tufts S, 2004, GEOFORUM, V35, P47, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2003.01.001; ZHAO G, 2003, J NANJING I PHYS ED, V17, P18	23	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA			978-0-7695-3653-8				2009							397	402		10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.30		6	Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications	Computer Science	BNW36	WOS:000275728100082

To further pursue this aim, in this study, we compare three different k-means algorithms (including MMk-means) results from an in-vitro microarray data (Le Roch et al., Science, 2003) with the classification from an in-vivo microarray data (Daily et al., Nature, 2007) in other to perform a comparative functional classification of P. falciparum genes and further validate the effectiveness of our MMk-means algorithm. Results from this study indicate that the resulting distribution of the comparison of the three algorithms' in-vitro clusters against the in-vivo clusters are similar thereby authenticating our MMk-means method and its effectiveness. However, Daily et al. claim that the physiological state (the environmental stress response) of P. falciparum in selected malaria-infected patients observed in one of their clusters can not be found in any in-vitro clusters is not true as our analysis reveal many in-vitro clusters representation in this cluster.

A count of the number of local maxima in the density of the data is first used to obtain a rough guess of the actual number of components. Mutual Information criteria are then used to judge if components need to be added or removed in order to reach the optimum number An incremental K-means algorithm is used to add components to the mixture model if required. An obvious advantage of the proposed method is in terms of computational time, as a good guess of the optimum number of components is quickly obtained. The technique has been successfully tested on a variety of univariate as well as bivariate simulated data and the Iris dataset.

It also facilitates the easy identification of visually similar scenes. Such grouping also help in the creation of semantic content table and efficient content browsing. In this work, we present an effective scheme to form such groupings. We address the important issue of representing a shot with the help of keyframes and other sampled frames from the shot. Finally, the content of the shot is denoted by the low-level feature vectors corresponding to the representative frames. Similar shots are grouped following a modified k-means clustering algorithm. Modifications have been incorporated to accommodate the differing roles played by the keyframes; and sampled frames. We have carried out the experiment with different type of video data and result obtained is satisfactory.

Real-coded encoding of the cluster centers is used for this purpose. The multiobjective clustering scheme produces a number of non-dominated solutions, each of which contains some information about the clustering structure. Hence it is required to obtain the final optimal clustering by combining those information. For this, clustering ensemble is used to combine the non-dominated solutions of the final Pareto front produced The proposed method is applied on several simulated TI-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density-weighted normal MRI brain images. Superiority of the proposed method over K-means, Fuzzy C-means, Expectation Maximization and Single Objective Genetic clustering have been demonstrated.

To enable fast clustering of this large data, in this article, a distributed space and time-efficient scalable parallel approach for point symmetry-based K-means algorithm has been proposed. A natural basis for analyzing gene expression data using this symmetry-based algorithm, is to group together genes with similar symmetrical patterns of expression. This new parallel implementation satisfies the quadratic reduction in timing, as well as the space and communication overhead reduction without sacrificing the quality of clustering solution. The parallel point symmetry-based K-means algorithm is compared with another newly implemented parallel symmetry-based K-means and existing parallel K-means over four artificial, real-life and benchmark microarray datasets, to demonstrate its superiority, both in timing and validity.

Thus, security problem should get more attention. This paper proposes an intelligent video analysis technology for elevator cage abnormality detection in computer vision. By collecting, processing, and analyzing video images in real time, the feature vectors including the variation of foreground pixels, the variation of length and width of foreground region's enclosing rectangle and the variation of enclosing rectangle's center of mass are obtained. Then these feature data are processed via K-Means clustering to get observation sequences, which are used to model a Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) for the normal activity. Last, the abnormalities are identified by the log-likelihood difference from normal activity mode, and the standard value is predetermined by observing series of normal activity sequence. This paper mainly presents an overview of the technology and significant results so far achieved.

The proposed method consists of mainly three steps, namely skull removal, image segmentation and volume calculation. The present method uses morphological operations followed by 3D connected component labeling and image subtraction for extracting the brain mask from the original brain slices. The skull stripped images are then segmented into the three tissues namely Gray Matter, White Matter and Cerebrospinal fluid using an efficient clustering technique namely, Weighted k-means clustering algorithm followed by Expectation Maximization algorithm. Finally the volume of the segmented tissues is calculated using Cavalier's estimator of morphometric volume method and some sample results are presented. The proposed method gives reliable results for making quantitative analysis and diagnosis of tissues from Magnetic Resonance brain image slices.

However, SIFT descriptors may produce poor result especially if the object does not have enough information of its texture features. Due to this problem, we hypothesize that the use multi feature may increase the performance of object class recognition. In this paper, we use additional global shape features, Fourier Descriptors combined with SIFT descriptors to help in improving the performance of object class recognition. The selection of shape features is chosen due to the objects are easier to describe based on this features from human perspective compare to other features. We have divided our experiments into two: Experiment E I is limited to the side view of bike, car, horse, and cow images whereas Experiment E2 consists of similar categories of dataset but in arbitrary views, rotations, and scales. The dataset we used in our experimentation are obtained from PASCAL, Weizmann and TU Darmstadt database. We assume that all objects are segmented manually before the feature extraction process. We validate our selection features using K-Means algorithm to evaluate the features for the purpose of object class recognition. Our results indicate that the combination of additional shape features together with SIFT descriptors performs better than using SIFT descriptors alone by up to 15% with limitation views of images.

Then, K-means clustering method is adopted. This technique avoids data overlapping at the origin, thus improving the accuracy of mixing matrix estimation. The validity of the method for true voice separation is verified by computer simulation. Also comparison with other methods is made to verify the efficiency of the algorithm. Simulations show that the algorithm has the property of accuracy and low-cost computation.

Secondly, a T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy neural network which consists of 11 BP sub-networks is developed to model the combustion process characteristics. As the LOI measuring device does not work well and thermal efficiency is a calculation value which is dependent on other primary parameters especially those of coal quality which are hard to be measured accurately and timely, the data collected are unavoidably spoiled by noise seriously. Normal neural networks such as BP and RBF are not capable of dealing with such a noise case. Validation tests demonstrate that the proposed T-S fuzzy neural network, which synthesizes well the advantages both of neural network and fuzzy reasoning, is much friendly to data noise and can be chose as an applied data mining tool.

Therefore, this study intends to propose a novel two-stage clustering algorithm for grouping the orders together before scheduling in order to reduce the SMT setup time. The first stage first uses the adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) neural network for finding the number of clusters and then feed the results to the second stage, which uses particle swarm K-means optimization (PSKO) algorithm. An internationally well-known industrial PC manufacturer provided the related evaluation information. The results show that the proposed clustering method outperforms other three clustering algorithms. Through order clustering, scheduling products belonging to the same cluster together can reduce the production time and the machine idle time.	[Kuo, R.

However, the use of the approach in image retrieval has been limited. In this paper, a method of using LSI in combination with the salient image representation based on a saliency-based bottom-up Visual Attention Computational Model(VACM) motivated by visual physiological experimental results was proposed. Firstly, VACM was used to detect the salient region of the image, which is composed of salient or interest points. Meanwhile, a method to select number of the salient points to be extracted for each image is presented. Then color and texture features of the pixels in a small window around each salient point was computed as the Visual Attention Descriptor(VAD). VADs of all images in the training data-set were to be clustered by K-Means algorithm to construct a codebook. The term-document matrix was to be built based on the codebook and VADs of all images in the test data-set. Then LSI with four weighting schemes were applied to the term-document matrix for image retrieval. According to the preliminary experiment results, some conclusions can be drawn. The best weighting for the LSI technique appears to be applying both local and global weight. With experimental image database used in this paper, the optimal number of dimensions of the semantic space for the LSI model, i.e., the rank of the approximation matrix, was found to be about 21 and the optimal codebook's size should be 900.

In most automatic genre classification systems global statistical features based on timbral dynamics such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are utilized but so far rhythmic information has not so effectively been used. In order to extract bar-long unit rhythmic patterns for a music collection we propose a clustering method based on one-pass dynamic programming and k-means clustering. After extracting the fundamental rhythmic patterns for each style/genre a pattern occurrence histogram is calculated and used as a feature vector for supervised learning. Experimental results show that the automatically calculated rhythmic pattern information can be used to effectively classify musical genre/style and improve upon current approaches based on timbral features.

The reference units are derived by clustering the bag-of-feature vectors extracted from the whole audio library using an unsupervised clustering technique. Indexing is achieved through reduced-rank approximation (using singular-value decomposition) of the unit-document co-occurrence measure matrix that is obtained for the given set of reference clusters and the collection of audio clips. In our initial investigation, the k-means algorithm was used to derive the reference units. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the computation load requirements for the k-means algorithm and singular-value decomposition by randomly splitting the training data into smaller sized parts instead of working on it as a whole. We present results of classification experiments on the BBC sound effects library and our results indicate this approach can significantly reduce the computation time without significant loss in classification performance.

While the GMM mean supervector has turned out to be an effective representation of speakers, its dimensionality is usually very high. The locality preserving projection (LPP) maps the high-dimensional GMM mean supervector space into a lower-dimensional subspace in an unsupervised fashion where the local neighborhood structure of the data points is optimally preserved. Our speaker clustering experiments clearly show that in the reduced-dimensional LPP subspace, traditional clustering techniques such as k-means and hierarchical clustering perform significantly better than they would in the original high-dimensional GMM mean supervector space and in its principal component subspace.

Video text extraction is a crucial step to retrieve video text characters. Most of papers perform video text extraction in a whole text row. Compared with whole text row extraction, single character extraction can achieve higher accuracy because the background of single character is relatively simple. However, character segmentation is difficult because of the low resolution of the characters in video. Therefore, we propose a character segmentation method, which can accurately locate the character boundary in the text row. In the text extraction, we perform k-means clustering in single character and define a method to quickly select one of the images as the final binary image. Experimental results on TV news video show the encouraging performance of the proposed algorithm.

According to the method, the five characteristic gases dissolved in transformer oil were extracted by the K-means clustering (KMC) method as feature vectors, which were input to chaotic optimal multi-classified SVMs for training. Then the CSVMs diagnosis model was established to implement fault samples classification. Experiment showed that by adopting facture extraction with KMC, the diagnosis information was concentrated and the consuming in parameter determination was solved effectively. On the other hand, chaos optimization enhanced model extension ability perfectly. Moreover, the presented method enabled to detect transformer faults with a high correct judgment rate, and can be used as an automation approach for diagnosis under condition of small samples.

Even though CUDA and other related recent developments are accelerating the use of GPUs for general purpose applications, several challenges still remain in programming the GPUs. Thus, it is clearly desirable to be able to program GPUs using a higher-level interface. In this paper, we offer a solution that targets a specific class of applications, which are the data mining and scientific data analysis applications. Our work is driven by the observation that a common processing structure, that of generalized reductions, fits a large number of popular data mining algorithms. In our solution, the programmers simply need to specify the sequential reduction loop(s) with some additional information about the parameters. We use program analysis and code generation to map the applications to a GPU. Several additional optimizations are also performed by the system. We have evaluated our system using three popular data mining applications, k-means clustering, EM clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The main observations from our experiments are as follows. The speedup that each of these applications achieve over a sequential CPU version ranges between 20 and 50.

The algorithm is used for learning association rules from transactional data bases and is based on simple counting procedures. In this paper we propose enhancements to Apriori which allow it to perform concept classification similar to the way decision tree algorithms learn. Specifically, training examples are modified and treated as transactional data and the results are verified and further improved by C4.5 decision tree and k-means clustering algorithms, respectively. To demonstrate the novelty of the enhanced Apriori algorithm, we present a hybrid data mining model (HDMM) which identifies at-risk students based on their academic performance and other pertinent data.

Firstly, the weighted k-means algorithm changes the descriptive approach of text objects, and converts the categorical attributes to numeric ones to measure the dissimilarity of text objects by Euclidean distance; then, the weighted k-means algorithm uses weight vector to decrease the affects of irrelevant attributes and reflect the semantic information of text objects. Through an experiment, the weighted k-means algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective than k-means algorithm when used to cluster texts.

Gene Classification Using Codon Usage and Support Vector Machines	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Codon usage bias; gene classification; Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA); Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC); relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU); Support Vector Machines (SVMs)	MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE-SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; BINDING PEPTIDES	A novel approach for gene classification, adopting codon usage bias as feature inputs to support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. The DNA sequence is first converted to a 59-dimensional feature vector, where each element corresponds to the relative synonymous usage (RSCU) frequency of a codon. Since the input to the classifier is independent of sequence length, the approach is especially useful when sequences to be classified are of differing lengths and homology-based methods tend to fail. The method is demonstrated with 1,841 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) sequences, which are classified into two major classes, HLA-I and HLA-II. Each major class is further classified into subgroups. Using codon usage frequencies, binary SVM achieved an accuracy rate of 99.3 percent for HLA major class classification and multiclass SVM achieved accuracy rates of 99.73 percent and 98.38 percent for the subclass classification of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules, respectively. Comparisons with K-Means clustering and other classifiers and homology-based features are given. Results indicate that the classification based on codon usage bias is consistent with biological functions of HLA molecules.

Partition-optimization approaches, such as k-means or expectation-maximization ( EM) algorithms, are suboptimal and find solutions in the vicinity of their initialization. This paper proposes a staged approach to specifying initial values by finding a large number of local modes and then obtaining representatives from the most separated ones. Results on test experiments are excellent. We also provide a detailed comparative assessment of the suggested algorithm with many commonly used initialization approaches in the literature. Finally, the methodology is applied to two data sets on diurnal microarray gene expressions and industrial releases of mercury.

The new algorithm employs neighbors searching operator and vertices spanning operator to construct the linkage paths between vertices. Additionally, in order to obtain the ideal clusters the temperature coefficient is used to completely adjust the linkage paths between vertices. Experimental results on nine benchmark synthetic datasets with different manifold structure demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm as a clustering technique. Compared with the K-means algorithm, a genetic algorithm-based clustering algorithm (GAC) and minimum spanning tree clustering algorithm (MST) for clustering task, the presented algorithm has the ability to identify the number and location of the clusters jointly and its clustering performance is clearly better than that of the aforementioned algorithms for complex manifold structures dataset.

While accurate depiction of object geometry requires the increase of the resolutions of images and thus, the amount of data to process, an efficient processing of such data then usually becomes an issue. In this paper, we first employ the efficient tensor analysis and k means clustering methods to hierarchically segment and cluster the original range images into a small number of planar patches represented as the closest points in the original images to their centroids. Then an advanced ICP variant is adopted to register such closest points. Finally, another ICP variant is used to refine the registration results obtained over all the points in the images. The experimental results based on real range images show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the selected two state of the art ones for accurate and efficient registration of overlapping range images.

In most scientific disciplines, to test hypotheses and discover insights, scientists are interested in looking for connections among different variables, or among different spatial locations within a data field. In response, we propose a suite of techniques to analyze the correlations in time-varying multivariate data. Various temporal curves are utilized to organize the data and capture the temporal behaviors. To reveal patterns and find connections, we perform data clustering and segmentation using the k-means clustering and graph partitioning algorithms. We study the correlation structure of a single or a pair of variables using point-wise correlation coefficients and canonical correlation analysis. We demonstrate our approach using results oil time-varying multivariate climate data sets.

An Unsupervised Method For Intrusion Detection Using Spectral Clustering	IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN CYBER SECURITY			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security	MAR 30-APR 02, 2009	Nashville, TN	IEEE				In this paper we present an unsupervised approach for Intrusion Detection based on Spectral Clustering (SC). Recently Spectral Clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses Spectral Graph Theory to form a laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an Intrusion Detection System. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a Detection Rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the False Positive Rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.

Scene Detection in Videos Using Shot Clustering and Sequence Alignment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Global k-means; key-frames; scene detection; sequence alignment	SEGMENTATION; RETRIEVAL	Video indexing requires the efficient segmentation of video into scenes. The video is first segmented into shots and a set of key-frames is extracted for each shot. Typical scene detection algorithms incorporate time distance in a shot similarity metric. In the method we propose, to overcome the difficulty of having prior knowledge of the scene duration, the shots are clustered into groups based only on their visual similarity and a label is assigned to each shot according to the group that it belongs to. Then, a sequence alignment algorithm is applied to detect when the pattern of shot labels changes, providing the final scene segmentation result. In this way shot similarity is computed based only on visual features, while ordering of shots is taken into account during sequence alignment. To cluster the shots into groups we propose an improved spectral clustering method that both estimates the number of clusters and employs the fast global k-means algorithm in the clustering stage after the eigenvector computation of the similarity matrix. The same spectral clustering method is applied to extract the key-frames of each shot and numerical experiments indicate that the content of each shot is efficiently summarized using the method we propose herein. Experiments on TV-series and movies also indicate that the proposed scene detection method accurately detects most of the scene boundaries while preserving a good tradeoff between recall and precision.

Neither is particularly effective for classifying data by different temporal activities. Important temporal trends can be missed due to the lack of ability to find them with current visualization methods. In this paper, we propose a method to explore data at different temporal resolutions to discover and highlight data based upon time-varying trends. Using the wavelet transform along the time axis, we transform data points into multiscale time series curve sets. The time curves are clustered so that data of similar activity are grouped together at different temporal resolutions. The data are displayed to the user in a global time view spreadsheet, where she is able to select temporal clusters of data points and filter and brush data across temporal scales. With our method, a user can interact with data based on time activities and create expressive visualizations.

Three-dimensional channel modelling using spherical statistics for multiple-input multiple-output systems	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Recently, the third generation partnership standards bodies (3GPP/3GPP2) have defined a two-dimensional channel model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the propagating plane waves are assumed to arrive only from the azimuthal direction and therefore not include the elevation domain. As a result of this assumption, the derived angle-of-arrival (AoA) distribution is characterised only by the azimuth direction of these waves. The AoA distribution of multipaths is implemented with a novel three-dimensional approach. The von Mises-Fisher (VMF) probability density function is used to describe their distribution within the propagation environment in both azimuth and co-latitude. More specifically, the proposed model uses a mixture of VMF distributions. A mixture can be composed of any number of clusters and this is clutter specific. The parameters of the individual cluster of scatterers within the mixture are derived and an estimation of those parameters is achieved using the spherical K-means algorithm and also the expectation maximisation algorithm. Statistical tests are provided to measure the goodness of fit of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model fits well with MIMO experimental data obtained from a measurement campaign in Germany.	[Mammasis, K.; Stewart, R.

In this paper, a new training method for neural network ensemble which is based on the improved K-means algorithm is presented. The space diversity among the sample datasets can be realized by clustering the entire dataset using K-means algorithm. To avoiding the sample subset too simple, the sample subsets are interpolated some samples which are randomly chosen from the entire sample space. By contrast experiments with Boosting and Bagging, the presented learning algorithm is proved that can reduce the prediction error of neural network ensemble and enhance the prediction accuracy.

The behavior of any meta-heuristic for a given problem is directed by both: the variation operators, and the values selected for the parameters of the algorithm. Therefore, it is only natural to expect that not only the parameters, but also the neighborhood topology play a key role in the behavior of PSO. In this paper, we want to analyze whether the type of communication employed to interconnect the swarm accelerates or affects the algorithm convergence. In order to perform a wide study, we selected six different neighborhoods topologies: ring, fully connected, mesh, toroid, tree and star; and two clustering algorithms: k-means and hierarchical. Such approaches were incorporated into three PSO versions: the basic PSO, the Bare-bones PSO (BBPSO) and an extension of BBPSO called BBPSO(EXP). Our results indicate that the convergence rate of a PSO-based approach has an strongly dependence of the topology used. However, we also found that the topology most widely used is not necessarily the best topology for every PSO-based algorithm.

In a training phase, GP evolves programs with multiple components. One component analyses statistical features extracted from EMG to divide the signals into blocks. The blocks' labels are decided based on the number of zero crossings. These blocks are then projected onto a two-dimensional Euclidean space via two further (evolved) program components. K-means clustering is applied to group similar data blocks. Each cluster is then labelled into one of three types (Fatigue, Transition-to-Fatigue and Non-Fatigue) according to the dominant label among its members. Once a program is evolved that achieves good classification, it can be used on unseen signals without requiring any further evolution. During normal operation the data are again divided into blocks by the first component of the program. The blocks are again projected onto a two-dimensional Euclidean space by the two other components of the program. Finally blocks are labelled according to the k-nearest neighbours. The system alerts the user of possible approaching fatigue once it detects a Transition-to-Fatigue. In experimentation with the proposed technique, the system provides very encouraging results.

Thus, it is computationally infeasible for very large datasets. Reducing the size of training dataset is naturally considered to solve this problem. SVM classifiers depend on only support vectors (SVs) that lie close to the separation boundary. Therefore, we need to reserve the samples that are likely to be SVs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the edge detection technique to detect these samples. To preserve the entire distribution properties, we also use a clustering algorithm such as K-means to calculate the centroids of clusters. The samples selected by edge detector and the centroids of clusters are used to reconstruct the training dataset. The reconstructed training dataset with a smaller size makes the training process much faster, but without degrading the classification accuracies.

SNNs guarantee to compute non negative and symmetric measures, and show good generalization capabilities even if a small set of supervised pairs is used for training. The application of the new model to K Means like semi supervised clustering is investigated, introducing a technique that allows the algorithm to compute cluster centroids by means of Backpropagation on the input layer of the SNN, biased by a regularization function. The experiments carried out on some datasets from the UCI repository show that SNN based clustering almost always outperforms other methods proposed in the literature.

In particular, an extension of Gaussian-means (G-means) and Projected Gaussian-means (PG-means) algorithms is proposed. All these methods are based on one-dimensional statistical hypothesis test. G-means and PG-means are wrapper algorithms of the k-means and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, respectively. Although G-means is a simple and fast algorithm, it does not perform well when clusters overlap since it is based on k-means. PG-means can handle overlapped clusters but requires more computation and sometimes fails to find the right number of clusters. In this paper, we propose an extension, called Extended Projected Gaussian means (XPG-means). XPG-means is a wrapper algorithm of Possibilistic Fuzzy C-means (PFCM) algorithm. XPG-means integrates the advantages of both algorithms while resolving some of the disadvantages involving overlapped clusters, noise, and computational complexity. More specifically, XPG-means handles overlapped clusters better than G-means because of the use of fuzzy clustering, handles noise better than both algorithms because it uses possibilitistic clustering. XPG-means is less computationally expensive than PG-means because it uses local hypothesis testing scheme used by G-means that is specific to Gaussians wherease PG-means uses a more general Kolmogorov-Smirnow test on Gaussian mixtures. In addition, XPG-means demonstrates less variance in estimating the number of components than either of the other algorithms.

Improved Propensity Matching for Heart Failure Using Neural Gas and Self-Organizing Maps	IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 14-19, 2009	Atlanta, GA	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			ASSOCIATION	We studied heart failure mortality and hospitalization of N=7,788 subjects in the Digitalis Intervention Group (DIG) clinical trial. Cases were defined as subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class symptoms, while controls were defined as subjects with NYHA class I-II symptomatology. Controls were propensity matched with cases using logits from logistic regression, best winning nodes for neural gas and self-organizing maps, and k-means cluster analysis. Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models were ran to determine the all-cause mortality and hospitalization hazard ratio (HR) for having NYHA functional class III-IV. Unmatched data resulted in a mortality HR of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.17-1.41), while logit-based propensity matching resulted in a mortality HR of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.15-1.44). When neural gas (NG) was used for propensity matching with normalized and standardized features, the mortality HR was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.19-1.50) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94-1.17), respectively. Propensity matching with self-organized maps (SOM) and normalized and standardized features yielded mortality HRs of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.16-1.46) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94-1.17), respectively. Crisp K-means cluster-based matching performed worse and biased the HRs towards the null value of HR=1. The strongest influence of matching was observed for NG when normalized features were used.

We observed that use of standardized features for input into SOM resulted in clusters for which the pattern of features were much different from clusters obtained using K-means and SOM with normalized features. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling allowed us to identify clusters whose subjects had increased all-cause mortality risk due to digoxin treatment. Results indicate that increased all-cause mortality risk with digoxin treatment was associated with female gender, older age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, CT ratio, ejection fraction, history of diabetes mellitus, history of hypertension, diuretic use, and less prevalence of a third heart sound. Combined use of cluster analysis and Cox regression identified an association with increased risk of all-cause mortality with treatment of digoxin in certain heart failure patients.

However, its use for automatic medical image segmentation has been limited particularly due to oversegmentation and sensitivity to noise. Employing prior shape knowledge has demonstrated robust improvements to medical image segmentation algorithms. We propose a novel method for enhancing watershed segmentation by utilizing prior shape and appearance knowledge. Our method iteratively aligns a shape histogram with the result of an improved k-means clustering algorithm of the watershed segments. Quantitative validation of magnetic resonance imaging segmentation results supports the robust nature of our method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The software, run on real-world medical data, is a tool that enables medical decisions to be reached by analysing past records from patients. The k-means algorithm, which is a clustering algorithm in data mining, was used to point out the intensities in the data set and to display two dimensions on the charts. The data of three screens that were named as selective clustering, different pre- and post-operation stages and clustering operations based on pre-operation T values, were processed using clustering with the k-means algorithm and one screen, which named relapse and survival percentages, was processed through classifying. It helps the future decision-making process by considering false estimates of pre-operation stages of the cases and by using the information gathered from past cases concerning tumour relapse and the survival percentage for prognostication. The characteristics of laryngeal cancer operations data, that involve causal links, were exposed by using two data mining techniques in this application.

To address this problem, we propose a novel clustering framework based on adaptive space mapping and rescaling, referred as M-R framework. The basic idea of our approach is to adjust the data representation to make the data distribution fit the model assumptions better. Specifically, documents are first mapped into a low dimensional space with respect to the cluster centers so that the distribution statistics of each cluster could be analyzed on the corresponding dimension. With the statistics obtained in hand, a rescaling operation is then applied to regularize the data distribution based on the model assumptions. These two steps are conducted iteratively along with the clustering algorithm to constantly improve the clustering performance. In our work, we apply the M-R framework on the most widely used clustering algorithm, i.e. k-means, as an example. Experiments on well known datasets show that our M-R framework can obtain comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.

In the present study, pulmonary function and gene-expression profiles in the lung were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarray after 30 days of consecutive exposure to manual metal arc welding combined with stainless-steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes, and again after 30 days of recovery from MMA-SS fume exposure. In total, 577 genes were identified as being either up-regulated or down-regulated (over twofold changes, p 0.05) in the lungs of low-dose or high-dose groups. Differentially expressed genes were classified based on a k-means clustering algorithm and biological functions and molecular networks were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Among the genes affected by exposure to or recovery from MMA-SS fumes, the transcriptional changes of 13 genes that were highly altered by treatment were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, Mmp12, Cd5l, Ccl7, Cxcl5, and Spp1 related to the immune response were up-regulated only in the exposure group, whereas Trem2, IgG-2a, Igh-1a, and Igh were persistently up-regulated in both the exposure and recovery groups. In addition, several genes that might play a role in the repair process of the lung were up-regulated exclusively in the recovery group. Collectively, these data may help elucidate the molecular mechanism of the recovery process of the lung after welding fume exposure.

Since the ITI method can not handle new instances with new service value, the SC+ITI cascading method is proposed to avoid this. Two steps are in SC+ITI cascading methods. First, the Service Classifier method partitions the training instances into n service clusters according to different service value. Second, in order to avoid handling instances with new service value, the ITI method is trained with instances with the same service value in the cluster. In 2007, Gaddam et al. showed KMeans+ID3 cascading method which mitigates two problems 1) the Forced Assignment problem and 2) the Class Dominance problem. His method with Nearest Neighbor (NN) combination rule outperforms the other three methods (i.e., K-Means, ID3 and KMeans+ID3 with Nearest Consensus rule) over the 1998 MIT-DARPA data set. Since the KDD'99 data set was also extracted from the 1998 MIT-DARPA data set, Nearest Neighbor combination rule within K-Means+ITI and SOM+ITI cascading methods is used in our experiments. We compare the performance of SC+ITI with the K-Means, SOM, ITI, K-Means+ITI and SOM+ITI methods in terms of the Detection Rate and False Positive Rate (FPR) over the KDD'99 data set. The results show that the ITI method have better performance than the K-Means, SOM, K-Means+ITI and SOM+ITI methods in terms of the overall Detection Rate. Our method, the Service Classifier and ITI cascading method outperforms the ITI method in terms of the Detection Rate and FPR and shows better Detection Rate as compared to other methods. Like the ITI method, our method also provides the additional options of handling missing values data and incremental learning.

The total logistics cost and facility establishment cost are the main objectives of the location selection procedure. With the increasing size of this problem in today's applications, the aspects of efficiency and scalability have developed into major challenges. In this paper, we study the use of spatial clustering methods to solve this problem and propose two new algorithms. The new algorithms determine the optimal locations of the new facilities plus their optimal total count during the search process. We have conducted many experiments for empirical comparative study on the application of several spatial clustering algorithms for optimal facility establishment. The benchmarks are conducted with both real world and synthetic data sets. The results reveal advantages of the proposed algorithms and confirm that these algorithms have better performance in terms of efficiency and objectives in the field-based services. Hence, the higher scalability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms make them suitable solutions for the problem of optimal facility establishment with large databases.

OLINDDA, an OnLIne Novelty and Drift Detection Algorithm that implements this approach, uses efficient standard clustering algorithms to continuously generate candidate clusters among examples that were not explained by the current known concepts. Clusters complying with a validation criterion that takes cohesiveness and representativeness into account are initially identified as concepts. By merging similar concepts, OLINDDA may enhance the representation of some concepts as it advances toward its final goal of describing novel emerging concepts in an unsupervised way. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated by the use of several measures taken throughout the learning process. Results show that it is capable of identifying novel concepts that are pure and correspond to real classes, disregarding unrepresentative clusters and outliers.

Extraction of the texture relies on measuring the similarity of neighboring patterns. Our proposed clustering algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, sub-clusters are created based on the similarity of their structures and in the second stage, the sub-clusters with similar textures and closeness of their distance are hierarchically combined to create a larger cluster. A theoretical justification for the proposed cluster isolation measure has been represented. Experimental results with complex data reveal that the performance of our method is superior than the well known K-means and Single Link methods. The proposed clustering algorithm is independent of the order of training samples appearance and its computational complexity is less than that of the traditional hierarchical algorithms.

J	Alshalalfah, M; Alhajj, R				Alshalalfah, Mohammed; Alhajj, Reda			Cancer class prediction: Two stage clustering approach to identify informative genes	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Clustering; classification; microarray; validity analysis; support vector machines; fuzziness parameter; Fuzzy C-means	EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY DATA; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; SELECTION; PROFILE	Cancer classification is an important research area that has attracted the attention of several research groups over the last decades. However, there has been no general agreed upon approach for assigning tumors to known classes (a.k.a. class prediction). One challenge in microarray analysis, especially in cancerous gene expression profiles, is to identify genes or group of genes that are highly expressed in tumor cells but not in normal cells and vice versa. All of the methods described in the literature deal with features obtained directly from the data. Further, several clustering techniques have been proposed for the analysis of genome expression data, such as k-means, Self organizing maps, etc. However, these methods do not provide information about the influence of a given gene on the overall shape of the clusters. In this paper, we try to generate informative data, which can be more powerful in the classification of genes. We identify a set of reduced features capable of distinguishing between two classes by two stage clustering of genes using fuzzy c-means. In the first stage, the proposed clustering method clusters the original data. In the second stage, it clusters genes in each of the clusters produced from the first stage. We decided on using fuzzy c-means because a fuzzy model fits better gene expression data analysis by having a gene belong to different classes with a degree of membership per class. However, fuzziness parameter m is a major problem in applying fuzzy c-means for clustering. In this approach, we try to better identify the value of the fuzziness parameter when applying fuzzy c-means for microarray data. Support vector machine combined with different kernel functions are used for classification. The results from the experiments conducted on three benchmark data sets (including one multi-class data set) demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to the other approaches described in the literature.

The composed algorithm, Anomalous, Pattern Fuzzy Clustering (AP-FCM), is applied in the segmentation of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) images for the identification of Coastal Upwelling. Two independent data samples Of two upwelling seasons, in a total of 61 SST images covering large diversity Of upwelling situations, are analysed. Results show that; by tuning the AP-FCM stop conditions it fits a good number of clusters providing an effective segmentation of the SST images whose spatial visualization of fuzzy membership closely reproduces the original images. Comparing the AP-PCM with the FCM using several validation indices to determine the number of clusters shows the advantage of the AP-FCM since FCM typically leads to under or over-segmented images. Quantitative assessment of: the segmentations is accomplished through ROC analysis with ground-truth maps constructed from the Oceanographers' annotations. Compared to FCM, the number of iterations of the AP-FCM is significantly decreased.

The main task of the procedure regards clustering students such that different pedagogical approach will be used for each cluster. K-means algorithm has been used as Clustering method. The final goal is to create a model of analysis which may conclude whether or not an e-Learning platform is capable of classifying students depending on accumulated knowledge.

NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), available from the G80 GPU family onwards, is used as the programming environment. Emphasis is placed on optimizations directly targeted at this architecture to best exploit the computational capabilities available. Additionally drawbacks and limitations of previous related work, e.g. maximum instance, dimension and centroid count are addressed. The algorithm is realized in a hybrid manner, parallelizing distance calculations on the GPU while sequentially updating cluster centroids on the CPU based on the results from the GPU calculations. An empirical performance study on synthetic data is given, demonstrating a maximum 14x speed increase to a fully SIMD optimized CPU implementation.

Among several characteristics like color or edges, texture is useful for segmenting. This paper proposes an intensive multiresolution approach to texture segmentation based on a wavelet transform. The technique delivers schematic descriptions of images. That is to say, it provides the main regions of interest (ROIs) according to image information. Firstly; the process divides images into 2 x 2 blocks. Then, it tracks texture through the multiresolution offered by the wavelet transform to form featuring vectors. Next, a K-means algorithm partitions the texture vector space into clusters. Finally, a connected component extraction delivers the image schema.

The cracks are detected by thresholding the output of the morphological top-hat transform. Afterwards, the thin dark brush strokes, which have been misidentified as cracks are removed using a semi-automatic procedure based on region growing. The cracks are classified using an unsupervised approach, which incorporates fuzzy clustering of the patterns. This system classifies cracks using the fuzzy k-means technique. The watermarked information is stored on the specific category of cracks. The user gives the input of the category of crack. The resulting image is the watermarked image. While retrieving the watermark information, the above procedure for identifying cracks is conducted and the watermark information is retrieved from the same category of cracks specified during the hiding stage.

Because of these difficulties, most of the previous publications often focus only on low-articulated postures, e.g. pedestrians, in still images. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect a human region from still images using raw edges. Not exhaustively detecting all of people occurrences in images; nevertheless; our approach can perform significantly on many types of images, typically, sports images with various poses. Instead of sliding window-style approaches for detecting, we rely on characteristics of boundaries and interest points by combining several image-processing techniques such as image filter, image segmentation, edge detection. Afterward, we use K-mean algorithm and probability for choosing a human region. Especially, we do not need a training phase. Despite not being the same purpose on detecting domain to previous works, in certain degrees, we also try to compete to typical works. Two challenging datasets are involved in discovering interesting facts needed to be concerned when designing proposed method for detecting people.			tntrung@fit.hcmuns.edu.vn; vdphong@fit.hcmuns.edu.vn; lhbac@fit.hcmuns.edu.vn					BOIMAN O, 2006, NEURAL INFORM PROCES, P177; Dalal N, 2005, PROC CVPR IEEE, P886; FELZENSZWALB PF, 2000, IEEE COMP SOC C CVPR, V2; FORSYTH DA, 2006, COMPUTER, V1, P3; JONES MJ, 1999, IEEE COMP SOC C CVPR; Junejo E., 2008, ECCV; LAN, 2005, ICCV; Lee MW, 2004, PROC CVPR IEEE, P334; LIN Z, ECCV 2008; Maire M., 2008, CVPR; Moravec H., 1980, CMURITR3; Mori G., 2004, CVPR; PERONA P, 1990, IEEE T PAMI; Ramanan D., 2006, P IEEE INT C COMP VI, P206; Ramanan D., 2006, PAMI; Ren X., 2007, CVPR, P2; Shi J., 2000, PAMI; SIGAL L, 2006, CVPR, V2; Tuzel O., 2007, CVPR; Viola P., 2003, P ICCV, V2, P734	20	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-5086-2				2009							73	80				8	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BUX93	WOS:000290647800013

Recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of sparse decomposition algorithm and dictionary design algorithm. In this paper, a novel dictionary design algorithm called K-LMS is proposed It generalized the K-Means clustering process, for adapting dictionaries to achieve sparse representation of signals. As regards to the image denoising, a new denoising method is introduced With the application of image's sparse representations in over-complete dictionary, it reconstructs a simple threshold to realize image denoising.

Privacy-preserving data mining techniques enable knowledge discovery without requiring disclosure of private data. The existing privacy preserving algorithms mainly concentrated on association rules and classification, only few algorithms on privacy preserving clustering, and these algorithms mainly concentrated on centralized and vertically partitioned data. So we proposed privacy preserving hierarchical k-means clustering algorithm on horizontally partitioned data, denoted as HPPHKC. The complexity on k-means clustering algorithm is only O(n), so most existing privacy preserving clustering algorithms are concentrated on k-means and based on two parties and the trusted third party, these algorithms have the drawbacks of inaccurate results because of choosing initial clustering centers randomly and applying to multi-party difficult and revealing privacy because of depending on the third party excessively. By introduction of three protocols for secure multi-party computation: distance computation, cluster center computation, and standardization and combination of the merits of hierarchical and k-means clustering, we presented a privacy-preserving hierarchical-k-means clustering algorithm on horizontally partitioned data for semi-honest parties using some secure multi-party computation protocols. The algorithm uses the security protocol mentioned above to achieve the protection of the privacy data, and uses the hierarchical clustering algorithm to obtain k cluster centers, then uses the k-means clustering algorithm to obtain the final k clusters. We introduce the clustering feature and the clustering feature tree, which are used to summarize the cluster representations. A clustering feature (CF) is a three-dimensional vector summarizing information about clusters of objects. The ith clustering feature is CFi = (cni,cci,cpi), where cni is the number of ith clusters, denoted as the size of ith cluster, cci is the center of the cni objects, and cpi is the pointer of the list of cni objects. The algorithm has two phases: the first phase, every object can be as a cluster, a secure computation protocol is used to compute the dissimilarity matrix and the most similar clusters will be merged. This process is repeated until we get the assigned clusters number k and get k clustering centers. In the second phase, the semi-honest third party and all data involved parties use the k-means algorithm refine the results of the first phase and get the final clustering results. Finally, we give the proof of security of the algorithm and analysis of communication costs, and we show that our scheme is secure and complete with good efficiency.

Our method emphasises the decrease of bias so as to produce the high-quality stratifying frame. For this purpose, the method takes some necessary measures such as use of auxiliary variables including spectral bands, physical and socioeconomic data to help cluster analysis, correlation analysis between auxiliary variables and the goal variable to remove irrelevant data and consideration of spatial correlation in cluster analysis through the density-based unsupervised learning etc. Furthermore, considering the time-consuming characteristic of clustering huge spatiotemporal datasets, the method uses non-parametric supervised learning to induce rules for clustered classes. The rules could be efficiently used to group pixels into different classes of similarity. Then in the method, the pixel-level similarity image was vectorised into polygons with different group labels, thus producing the vector map of geospatial heterogeneity as an easy-to-use stratification frame. Last, to have an accurate estimation of the goal variable, our method re-divided sample units while the units covered by different strata and considered the effect of the sample size in the estimation algorithm. In the survey case of the cultivated land area, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and a better coefficient of relative efficiency (RE) of stratification with its estimate closer to the observed value in comparison with other stratification strategies, e.g., k-means, SOM and those similar to eco-regions. Our method has potential practical merits as a good stratification strategy can increase the precision and considerably save the cost of sampling for many large regions, such as those in China, to be surveyed.

Phase-correlation-based hyperspectral image classification using multiple class representatives obtained with k-means clustering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Letter								In this letter, a modification to a phase-correlation-(PC-)based supervised classification method for hyperspectral data is proposed. An adaptive approach using different numbers of multiple class representatives (CRs) extracted using PC-based k-means clustering for each class is compared with the use of selecting a small, pre-determined number of dissimilar CRs. PC is used as a distance measure in k-means clustering to determine the spectral similarity between each pixel and cluster centre. The number of representatives for each class is chosen adaptively, depending on the number of training samples in each class. Classification is performed for each pixel according to the maximum value of PCs obtained between test samples and the CRs. Experimental results show that the adaptive method gave the highest classification accuracy (CA). Experiments on the effect of reducing the size of the feature vectors found that CA increased as the feature vector decreased.	[Cesmeci, D.; Gullu, M.

Grouping decomposition under constraints for design/build life cycle in project delivery system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						design/build life cycle; DSM; design structure matrix; grouping; AHP; analytic hierarchy process; K-means clustering	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; ENGINEERING DESIGN; MODEL; ITERATION	The design/build project delivery system has been adopted in the construction industry for many years. The numerous iterations of activities (tasks) can result in a hierarchical structure that reflects the life cycle of this type of delivery system. The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) approach has been used for simplifying complex project activities by clarifying the relationships between activities through grouping. However, if there are a large number of coupled activities it can increase the design/build cycle time and it is difficult to apply grouping decomposition. This paper presents the Grouping Decomposition (GD) model that decomposes a large number of activities through grouping. It is used together with the K-means clustering algorithm which quantifies the relative coupling strength of the design/build activities. An example is proposed that demonstrates the GD modelling method. The results are compared with different grouping methods. These show that the proposed GD model performs well in partitioning and extremely well in clustering the coupled activities.

However, rare class analysis remains a critical challenge, because there is no natural way developed for handling imbalanced class distributions. This paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a method for classification using local clustering (COG). Specifically, for a data set with an imbalanced class distribution, we perform clustering within each large class and produce sub-classes with relatively balanced sizes. Then, we apply traditional supervised learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), for classification.

The purpose of the study was to characterize African yam bean germplasm to identify genotypes with desirable attributes such as seed yield. Data collected were subjected to principal component (PC) and K-means non hierarchical clustering analyses. The collections were significantly different for most of the characters evaluated with the greatest variation in pod and seed yields per plant. The first five PCs explained 70% of the total variation with PC1 and PC2 being responsible for 23 and 17% of the variance respectively. Specific grouping of the collections into five showed that members of clusters 1 and 3 were low yielding. The only member of cluster 2 had the highest seed yield but, it was late flowering. Members of cluster 4 were high yielding and early flowering while the collections in cluster 5 had the highest values for vegetative characters.

Nowadays port based and payload based classification methods have become inadequate as many applications use dynamically allocated port numbers, masquerade to be another application by using some standard port number or use encryption to avoid detection. Recent studies propose an alternative technique for network traffic classification utilizing statistical characteristics of network flows in classification. Most of these studies focus on classifying flows when flows have finished. This kind of classification is not sufficient for quality of service management purposes, therefore network flows have to be classified as early as possible. This paper introduces a two-phased classification method which is capable of classifying network flows early in the connection and providing a secondary classification phase to improve the classification accuracy. A simple K-Means clustering technique is utilized in both classification phases. The classifier was trained and evaluated using manually generated training and evaluation datasets. According to the results two-phased classifier classified 97.8 % of target applications correctly and was able to detect untrained application flows at high precision. Also individual classification phases produced high overall accuracies and precise detections of unknown traffic.

After obtaining cluster centers attaining the minimum squared-error distortion or its approximation by KMA, clustering based on the distortion-ratio criterion, whose criterion provides a measure of the validity of clustering, is introduced. When the criterion is not satisfied, a split and merge procedure based on the distortion-ratio measure is executed. Focusing on an interesting data set which is not resolved by KMA, clustering based on the distortion-ratio criterion and the split and merge procedure is investigated.

Statistical algorithms can be used to determine the likelihood of the occurrence of avalanches which was shown in several previous studies. The common use of two statistical methods offers the possibility to analyze the data set in regard to specific weather conditions. In the first step the k-mean cluster analysis selects days with similar weather conditions; so that each day is assigned to a predefined group. Significant weather conditions are used for the definition of the initial conditions of each cluster. Each group represents a typical weather situation. In the second step the discriminant analysis is used to separate between avalanche and non-avalanche days for each group. Consequently the coefficients of the discriminant functions can differ and the best fit of the discriminant function depending on the predominant weather situation is applied. Results of the clustering algorithm and the hit rate of the subsequent discriminant analysis are shown.

This method combined K-means clustering method with differential evolution algorithm (DE) in the presence of initial value sensitiveness and prematurity with K-means and FCM algorithms. Differential evolution is a floating-point encoding evolutionary algorithm for global optimization over continuous space. Using the robustness and efficient global search capability of differential evolution algorithm, this method can overcome the shortcomings of k-means and FCM algorithms. Through fault clustering analyzing, this algorithm can accurately fulfill failure recognition. The proposed scheme is applied to flight control system failures of an aircraft altitude holding model. The results show that the proposed method can effectively classify failures.

The aim of this study was to determine the most salient food attributes that influence consumer food choices using factor analysis and then to identify consumer group profiles by k-means cluster analysis. The results showed that price was the most prominent food attribute that influenced the buying decisions of consumers in all groups. Consumer satisfaction with food products, brand loyalty and price were the most effective factors in cluster 1(C1), C2 and C3, respectively. The results of this study show the interrelationships among product attributes, consumption, preference values and attitudes of Turkish consumers. This information could be used to develop predominant strategies and policies for marketing food products in Turkey.	[Topcu, Y.; Isik, H. B.; Uzundumlu, A.

The aim of this study was to determine the most salient factors affecting customer retailer loyalty by using factor analysis and then to identify consumer group profiles by k-means cluster analysis. The results showed that satisfaction with the product and store image in Cluster 1, satisfaction with the sales process and perceived service quality in Cluster 2, and variety seeking in Cluster 3 were the most prominent retailer attributes that affected consumer retailer loyalty. The results of this study provide insights into understand interrelationships among retailer attitudes, preference values and attitudes of Turkish consumers, and could be used to develop marketing strategies and more effective policies to improve customer retailer loyalty in Turkey.

Weighting variables in K-means clustering	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						K-means clustering; variable weighting; penalty constant		The aim of this study is to assign weights w1, , wm to m clustering variables Z1, , Zm, so that k groups were uncovered to reveal more meaningful within-group coherence. We propose a new criterion to be minimized, which is the sum of the weighted within-cluster sums of squares and the penalty for the heterogeneity in variable weights w1, , wm. We will present the computing algorithm for such k-means clustering, a working procedure to determine a suitable value of penalty constant and numerical examples, among which one is simulated and the other two are real.

Complex Question Answering: Unsupervised Learning Approaches and Experiments	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information. In this paper, we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. We compare the results of these approaches. Our experiments show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and EM performs better than K-means. However, the performance of these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these features. In order to measure the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic) for each of the document sentences. We use a local search technique to learn the weights of the features. To the best of our knowledge, no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntactic/ semantic information for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences and the document sentences in order to generate query-focused summaries (or answers to complex questions). For each of our methods of generating summaries (i.e. empirical, K-means and EM) we show the effects of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over the bag-of-words (BOW) features.

Evaluation of Beach Hydromorphological Behaviour and Classification Using Image Classification Techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas		Coastal features; Image classification algorithms; Geographic information technologies		The development of new techniques on coastal studies, such as Geographic Information Technologies (GIT), using aerial photography and high resolution satellite images is an important issue on Coastal Engineering and Geo-Spatial Sciences research. Several aerial photographs (between 1958 and 2003), using visual interpretation on a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, were used on the identification of the coastal features in a high energetic selected area of the NW Portuguese coast, between Esmoriz and Mira beach. The main goal of this work, based on the image classification techniques, is to identify and to analyse morphological features and hydrodynamic patterns and to compare these results with the visual interpretation. To achieve these objectives different techniques of image analysis were tested. Different supervised classification algorithms such as parallelepiped, minimum distance and maximum likelihood, were applied in order to identify morphological features and hydrodynamic patterns. Unsupervised classification algorithms (clustering) were also employed in order to determine the natural groupings or structures in the aerial photographs. The supervised classification algorithm presents good performance, demonstrated by the results of the confusion matrix, Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy. The parallelepiped classifier presents an overall accuracy of 95.65% and a Kappa statistics of 0.95661. The results for maximum likelihood were similar, 95.85% and 0.95840, respectively. The minimum distance classifier presents lower performance. The unsupervised classification algorithms (K-means and ISODATA) allows for indentify several classes such as breaking zone, beach face and beach. The results of the supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms were compared with the visual identification. The obtained results were in agreement with the visual interpretation.

In this study, we investigated differences in codon usage preferences among the highly mutable single strain RNA viruses which infect vertebrate or invertebrate hosts, respectively. We incorporate principal component analysis (PCA) and k-mean methods to clustering viruses infected with different type of hosts. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) indices of all genes in 32 RNA viruses were calculated, and the correlation of the RSCU indices among different viruses was analyzed by the PCA. Our results show a positive correlation in codon usage preferences among viruses that target the same host category. Results of k-means clustering analysis further confirmed the statistical significance of this study, demonstrating that viruses infecting vertebrate hosts have different codon usage preferences to those of invertebrate viruses. Based on the analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) in relation to the GC-content at the synonymous third codon position (GC3s), we further identified that mutational pressure was the dominant evolution driving force in making the different codon usage preferences. This study suggests a new and effective way to characterize host-dependent RNA viruses based on the codon usage pattern.

The whole data set was divided into a training set (75% of the dataset) and a test set (remaining 25%) on the basis of K-means clustering technique. Models developed from the training set were used to assess the predictive potential of the models using test set compounds. Initially classical type QSAR models were developed using structural, spatial, electronic, physicochemical and/or topological parameters using statistical methods like stepwise regression, partial least squares (PLS) and factor analysis followed by multiple linear regression (FA-MLR). Using topological and structural parameters, FA-MLR provided the best equation based on internal validation (Q2 =0.514) but the best externally validated model was obtained with PLS ([image omitted] =0.565). When structural, physicochemical, spatial and electronic descriptors were used, the best Q2 value (0.562) was obtained from the stepwise regression derived model whereas the best [image omitted] value (0.571) came from the PLS model. When topological descriptors were used in combination with the structural, physicochemical, spatial and electronic descriptors, the best Q2 and [image omitted] values obtained were 0.530 (stepwise regression) and 0.580 (PLS) respectively. Attempt was made to develop 3D-QSAR models using molecular shape analysis descriptors in combination with structural, physicochemical, spatial and electronic parameters. Linear models were developed using genetic function algorithm coupled with multiple linear regression. However, the results from the 3D-QSAR study were not superior to those of the classical QSAR models. Finally, artificial neural network was employed for development of nonlinear models. The ANN models showed acceptable values of squared correlation coefficient for the observed and predicted values of the test set compounds. From the view point of external predictability, selected ANN models were superior to the linear QSAR models. All reported models satisfy the criteria of external validation as recommended by Golbraikh and Tropsha (J Mol Graphics Mod 2002; 20: 269-276), whereas the majority of the models have modified r2 ([image omitted]) value of the test set for external validation more than 0.5 as suggested by Roy and Roy (QSAR Comb Sci 2008; 27: 302-313).

Genetic relationships among improved cassava accessions and landraces for resistance to the cassava mosaic disease	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC); cassava mosaic disease; genetic relationships; phenotypic response; virus resistance level	PEDIGREE DATA; DIVERSITY; CULTIVARS; DISTANCE; CROPS	This study was conducted to determine the genetic relationships among 21 accessions of cassava (Manihot esculenta), with varying levels of resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD), based on their phenotypic response to the disease. The accessions were ranked according to their area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Hierarchical cluster analysis based on Ward's linkage method separated the accessions into three major groups and the susceptible clones were distinct from the resistant accessions. Further analysis using K-means defined four groups which were similar to the groupings by the hierarchical method, but the susceptible landrace TME 117 was distinct from the other susceptible accessions. Principal component analysis showed that there was considerable amount of variation and the first three components accounted for 78.87% of the total variation in the accessions. A scatter-plot of the scores of the first and second principal components for responses to CMD showed that, generally, the resistant accessions were different from the susceptible accessions and the most susceptible landrace TME 117 formed a single member group distinct from the other susceptible groups. The large amount of variation implies that using any combination of resistant accessions to recombine different favorable alleles will not reduce the overall diversity of the breeding population.

Robust linear clustering	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Affine subspaces; Orthogonal regression; Principal components; Robustness; Trimmed k-means; Trimming	FIXED-POINT CLUSTERS; COMPUTER VISION; DATA VISUALIZATION; SELF-CONSISTENCY; PRINCIPAL CURVES; FAST ALGORITHM; REGRESSION; FEATURES; IDENTIFICATION; METHODOLOGY	Non-hierarchical clustering methods are frequently based on the idea of forming groups around 'objects'. The main exponent of this class of methods is the k-means method, where these objects are points. However, clusters in a data set may often be due to certain relationships between the measured variables. For instance, we can find linear structures such as straight lines and planes, around which the observations are grouped in a natural way. These structures are not well represented by points. We present a method that searches for linear groups in the presence of outliers. The method is based on the idea of impartial trimming. We search for the 'best' subsample containing a proportion 1-alpha of the data and the best k affine subspaces fitting to those non-discarded observations by measuring discrepancies through orthogonal distances. The population version of the sample problem is also considered. We prove the existence of solutions for the sample and population problems together with their consistency. A feasible algorithm for solving the sample problem is described as well. Finally, some examples showing how the method proposed works in practice are provided.	[Garcia-Escudero, L.

While many validation measures have been developed for evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms, these measures often provide inconsistent information about the clustering performance and the best suitable measures to use in practice remain unknown. This paper thus fills this crucial void by giving an organized study of 16 external validation measures for K-means clustering. Specifically, we first introduce the importance of measure normalization in the evaluation of the clustering performance on data with imbalanced class distributions. We also provide normalization solutions for several measures. In addition, we summarize the major properties of these external measures. These properties can serve as the guidance for the selection of validation measures in different application scenarios. Finally, we reveal the interrelationships among these external measures. By mathematical transformation, we show that some validation measures axe equivalent. Also, some measures have consistent validation performances. Most importantly, we provide a guide line to select the most suitable validation measures for K-means clustering.

Fast Approximate Spectral Clustering	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Unsupervised Learning; Spectral Clustering; Data Quantization	ALGORITHM; QUANTIZATION; CUTS	Spectral clustering refers to a flexible class of clustering procedures that can produce high-quality clusterings on small data sets but which has limited applicability to large-scale problems due to its computational complexity of O(n(3)) in general, with n the number of data points. We extend the range of spectral clustering by developing a general framework for fast approximate spectral clustering in which a distortion-minimizing local transformation is first applied to the data. This framework is based on a theoretical analysis that provides a statistical characterization of the effect of local distortion on the mis-clustering rate. We develop two concrete instances of our general framework, one based on local k-means clustering (KASP) and one based on random projection trees (RASP). Extensive experiments show that these algorithms can achieve significant speedups with little degradation in clustering accuracy. Specifically, our algorithms outperform k-means by a large margin in terms of accuracy, and run several times faster than approximate spectral clustering based on the Nystrom method, with comparable accuracy and significantly smaller memory footprint. Remarkably, our algorithms make it possible for a single machine to spectral cluster data sets with a million observations within several minutes.

A partitional clustering algorithm is presented. It is applied for grouping resources contained in knowledge bases and expressed in the standard ontology languages. The method exploits a language-independent semi-distance measure for individuals that is based on the semantics of the resources w.r.t. a context represented by a set of concept descriptions (discriminating features). The clustering algorithm adapts BISECTING K-MEANS method to work with medoids. Besides, we propose simple mechanisms to assign each cluster an intensional definition that may suggest new concepts for the knowledge base (vivification). A final experiment demonstrates the validity of the approach through absolute quality indices for clustering results.

The supervision is generally given as pairwise constraints; such constraints are natural for graphs, yet most semi-supervised clustering algorithms are designed for data represented as vectors. In this paper, we unify vector-based and graph-based approaches. We first show that a recently-proposed objective function for semi-supervised clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields, with squared Euclidean distance and a certain class of constraint penalty functions, can be expressed as a special case of the weighted kernel k-means objective (Dhillon et al., in Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2004a). A recent theoretical connection between weighted kernel k-means and several graph clustering objectives enables us to perform semi-supervised clustering of data given either as vectors or as a graph. For graph data, this result leads to algorithms for optimizing several new semi-supervised graph clustering objectives. For vector data, the kernel approach also enables us to find clusters with non-linear boundaries in the input data space. Furthermore, we show that recent work on spectral learning (Kamvar et al., in Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2003) may be viewed as a special case of our formulation. We empirically show that our algorithm is able to outperform current state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms on both vector-based and graph-based data sets.

It is a powerful tool in visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data in various application domains such as Web analysis, information retrieval, and many other domains. The SOM maps the data on a low-dimensional grid which is generally followed by a clustering step of referent vectors (neurons or units). Different clustering approaches of SOM are considered in the literature. In particular, the use of hierarchial clustering and traditional k-means clustering are invetigated. However, these approaches don't consider the topological organization provided by SOM. In this paper, we propose BcSOM, an extension of a recently proposed graph b-coloring clustering approach for clustering self organized map. It exhibits more important clustering features and enables to build a fine partition of referents by incorporation the neighborhood relations provided by SOM. The proposed approach is evaluated against benchmark data sets and its effectiveness is confirmed.

The approach is an implementation of the specialized A-Team architecture called JABAT. The paper includes an overview of JABAT and the description of the agent-based algorithms solving the non-distributed and distributed clustering problems. To evaluate the approach the computational experiment, involving several well known benchmark instances has been carried out. The results obtained by JABAT-based algorithms are compared with the results produced by the non-distributed and distributed k-means algorithm. It has been shown that the proposed approach produces, as a rule, better results and has the advantage of being scalable, mobile and parallel.

Presently, mammographic analysis is the most used method for early detection of abnormalities. This paper presents a computational methodology to help the specialist with this task. In the first step, the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Template Matching technique are used to detect Suspicious regions. Next. the texture of each region is described using the Simpson's Diversity Index, which is used in Ecology to measure the biodiversity of an ecosystem. Finally, the information of texture is used by SVM to classify the suspicious regions into two classes: masses and nonmasses. The tests demonstrate that the methodology has 79.12% of accuracy, 77.27% of sensitivity, and 79.66% of specificity.

In this paper, we extend the K-means clustering to accommodate extended clusters in subspaces, such as line-shaped clusters, plane-shaped clusters, and ball-shaped clusters. The algorithm retains much of the K-means clustering flavors: easy to implement and fast to converge. A model selection procedure is incorporated to determine the cluster shape. As a result, our algorithm can recognize a wide range of subspace clusters Studied in various literatures, and also the global ball-shaped clusters (living in all dimensions). We carry extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

K-means-clustering of the 2001-2005 data sets suggests dividing the sampling area into five geographical areas based upon levels and compositions of PAHs. The five areas are Svalbard offshore, Bear Island Trough, SW Barents Sea, NE Barents Sea and SE Barents Sea. Comparison of the two groups of data sets revealed no significant differences between geometric means of PAH concentrations and PAH ratios for sediments from Svalbard offshore, Bear Island Trough and NE Barents Sea. These results are supported by down core analyses of PAH distributions. In the SW Barents Sea area, mean total PAH concentrations found in the 2000s and 1990s did not differ significantly. However, the sum of two- to three-ring PAH compounds and Fossil Fuel Pollution Index in samples of 2000s were significantly higher than in data sets from the 1990s. In the SE Barents Sea area, both total concentrations of pyrogenic PAHs and PAH ratios in the data sets from the 2000s were significantly higher than the 1990s data sets, which suggest higher input of combustion and/or anthropogenic PAHs.

Based on this feature, an image retrieval method is also provided to seek the database images most similar to a given query image. In this paper, a genetic-based parameter detector is presented to decide the fittest parameters used by the proposed image retrieval method, as well. The experimental results manifested that the image retrieval method is insensitive to the rotation, translation, distortion, noise, scale, hue, light, and contrast variations, especially distortion, hue, and contrast variations.

Compared with other existing applications, we show the photo clusters instead of all photos where the number of photo clusters is much less than that of all photos. We designed a clustering algorithm that clusters geotagged photos (abbreviated as GPCA) in accordance to thresholds of different scales. In general, GPCA is an alternative of k-means clustering algorithm. Given a scale graduation of a map, the distance threshold is also determined Before clustering geotagged photos, we use the distance threshold to decide the number of clusters. In other words, the number of centriods is chosen according to the graduation scale of a map. GPCA clusters geotagged photos into different photo clusters. Then, GPCA recomputed the new centeriods of photo clusters. GPCA executes the computation of new centeriods iteratively until all centeriods are fixed Note that prior partition-based clustering algorithms choose an arbitrary number of initial centriods at random. Also, choosing the number of centriods is considered as an application-dependent issue. As a result, they did not guarantee that the clustering quality is not the same every time. By taking advantage of the result of using photo clusters, the performance of map-enabled photo service is improved efficiently.

A Sensitivity Clustering Method for Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms	METHODS AND MODELS IN ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL COMPUTATION, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Work-Conference on the Interplay Between Natural and Artificial Computation	JUN 22-26, 2009	Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN				FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK	The machine learning community has traditionally used the correct classification rate or accuracy to measure the performance of a classifier, generally avoiding the presentation of the sensitivities (i.e. the classification level of each class) in the results, especially in problems with more than two classes. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are powerful global optimization techniques but they axe very poor in terms of convergence performance. Consequently, they axe frequently combined with Local Search (LS) algorithms that can converge in a few iterations. This paper proposes a new method for hybridizing EAs and LS techniques in a classification context, based on a clustering method that applies the k-means algorithm in the sensitivity space, obtaining groups of individuals that perform similarly for the different classes. Then, a representative of each group is selected and it is improved by a LS procedure. This method is applied in specific stages of the evolutionary process and we consider the minimum sensitivity and the accuracy as the evaluation measures. The proposed method is found to obtain classifiers with a better accuracy for each class than the application of the LS over the best individual of the population.

This paper proposes a new approach to k-Means with variable selection by introducing variable weighting mechanism into PCA-guided k-Means. The relative responsibility of variables is estimated in a similar way with FCM clustering while the membership indicator is derived from a PCA-guided manner, in which the principal component scores are calculated by considering the responsibility weights of variables. So, the variables that have meaningful information for capturing cluster structures are emphasized in calculation of membership indicators. Numerical experiments including an application to document clustering demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed method.

We have therefore developed quantitative structure-toxicity relationship models with extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices for hERG K+ channel blocking activity of diverse functional drugs using different chemometric tools like factor analysis followed by multiple linear regression (FA-MLR), stepwise regression and partial least squares. The data set was divided into a training set of 50 compounds and a test set of 17 compounds based on K-means clustering technique. The ETA models were compared with those developed with a pool of other topological indices. Finally, an attempt was made to develop models from the combined pool of topological (ETA and non-ETA) descriptors. It was found that on using ETA parameters along with non-ETA ones, there was a considerable increase in the quality of the models. The best model came from stepwise regression using a combined set of descriptors (Q(2) = 0.546, R-pred(2) = 0.619). The ETA model suggests that hERG channel blocking increases with the increase of molecular bulk and electron richness and decreases with the increase of functionalities of the carboxylic acid group and the aliphatic tertiary nitrogen fragment.

An unsupervised method, k-means algorithm, is used to separate the whole galaxy sample into early- and late-type galaxies. Then, we investigate the photometric redshift measurement with different input patterns by means of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the total sample and two subsamples. The experimental result indicates that ANNs show better performance when more parameters are applied in the training set, and the mixed accuracy sigma(mix)= root sigma(2)(searly)+s sigma(2)(late) of photometric redshift estimation for the two subsets is superior to sigma(z) for the overall sample alone. For the optimal result, the rms deviation of photometric redshifts for the mixed sample amounts to 0.0192, that for the overall sample is 0.0196, meanwhile, that for early- and late-type galaxies adds up to 0.0164 and 0.0217, respectively.

The main characteristics of atmospheric circulation associated with fog in Greece	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RADIATION FOG; NEW-YORK; THESSALONIKI; CLIMATOLOGY; SIMULATION; FORECAST; MODEL; AREA	The characteristics of the atmospheric circulation over Europe and the Mediterranean associated with the formation and the dissipation of fog in Greece are examined. The data used consists of: i) 3-hourly meteorological observations recorded at 16 meteorological stations in Greece and ii) daily (00:00 UTC) 2.5x2.5 grid point values of mean sea-level pressure, 500 hPa geopotential height, 850 hPa and 500 hPa air temperatures and 1000-500 hPa thickness over Europe for the period 1957-2002. 1055 fog events are extracted from the 3-hourly meteorological observations. A specific methodology scheme including S-mode Factor Analysis and k-means Cluster Analysis is applied to the grid point data sets for the first day of a fog event (D day), the day prior to D day (D-1 day) and the day that follows the last day of a fog event (END day) and the 1055 evolutions of the atmospheric circulation associated with fog events in Greece are classified into 10 clusters. The mean patterns of MSL Pressure, 850 hPa and 500 hPa air temperatures, 1000-500 hPa thickness and 500 hPa geopotential height show that in most of the clusters, the presence of anticyclonic conditions over the Balkans, a warm front passage, or a weak, humid southerly flow induced by the presence of a shallow depression over the western Mediterranean favor fog formation in Greece, while the dissipation of fog occurs when drier air masses are transferred over the Balkans. The main differences among the 10 clusters refer to the exact position, the intensity and the specific evolution of the surface and the upper air systems, the season of their predominance and the area of the Greek territory that mainly refer to.

Using an application installed on users' mobiles and client-server architecture, the mobile interacts with the recommender through its built-in communications facilities and the wireless LAN installed in shopping centers. Recommender system can infer what individual customers want and thus give those appropriate recommendations according to the user's tastes (ratings) and enhanced k-means clustering algorithm.

As network security functions spread, an increasing amount of traffic is natively encrypted due to privacy issues (e.g. VPN). This makes ineffective current traffic classification systems based on ports and payload inspection, e.g. even powerful Deep Packet Inspection is useless to classify application flow carried inside SSH sessions. We have developed a real time traffic classification method based on cluster analysis to identify SSH flows from statistical behavior of IP traffic parameters, such as length, arrival times and direction of packets. In this paper we describe our approach and relevant obtained results. We achieve detection rate up to 99.5 % in classifying SSH flows and accuracy up to 99.88 % for application flows carried within those flows, such as SCP, SFTP and HTTP over SSH	[Maiolini, Gianluca] Elsag Datamat, Automat Secur & Transportat Div, I-00143 Rome, Italy	Maiolini, G (reprint author), Elsag Datamat, Automat Secur & Transportat Div, V Laurentina 760, I-00143 Rome, Italy.	gianluca.maiolini@elsagdatamat.com; andrea.baiocchi@uniroma1.it; alfonso.lacovazzi@uniroma1.it; antonello.rizzi@uniroma1.it	Rizzi, Antonello/D-4961-2014	Rizzi, Antonello/0000-0001-8244-0015			ALSHAMMARI R, 2007, IEEE INT C SYST MAN; BERNAILLE L, 2006, P CONEXT DEC; Crotti M, 2007, ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM, V37, P5, DOI 10.1145/1198255.1198257; Karagiannis T., 2005, P ACM SIGCOMM 2005 P; McGregor A, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3015, P205; Moore A., 2005, ACM SIGMETRICS 2005; *MTU, 879 MTU RFC; Wright CV, 2006, J MACH LEARN RES, V7, P2745; ZANDER S, 2005, LCN 2005	9	4	4	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-01398-0	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5550						182	194				13	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BJX88	WOS:000267377300015

Due to the extremely short length of web snippets, many traditional clustering techniques which adopt the bag of words model often yields unsatisfactory clustering results. In this paper, we propose a method of text; enrichment for improving performance of web snippet clustering. The main idea is to expand the original snippets with some related conceptual terms. We apply the Open Directory Project (ODP), a web taxonomy organized by humans, to provide the concept hierarchy of the web contents. Using a test data set of 240 queries, we performed the experiments by using two clustering techniques: K-means clustering as the non-overlapping approach and the Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) as the overlapping approach. Using the proposed text enrichment method, the K-means clustering yielded the overall performance improvement up to 15.51% based on the F1 measure. On the other hand, the Suffix Tree Clustering with text enrichment helped improve the performance up to 53.71%.

In this paper, we have proposed an augmented version of the bisecting k-means clustering algorithm for automated text categorization tasks. In our augmented version, we have added (1) a bootstrap aggregating procedure, (2) a bisecting criteria that relies on dispersions of data within clusters, and (3) a method to automatically terminate the algorithm when an optimal number of clusters have been produced. We have performed text categorization experiments in order to compare our algorithm against the standard bisecting k-means and k-means algorithms. The results showed that our augmented version improved approximately 15% and 20% in classification accuracies compared to the standard bisecting k-means and k-means, respectively.

Previous cluster analytic studies with the TAI identified four distinct patterns of alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to replicate the cluster profiles of the TAI in an Austrian clinical sample. The discriminative validity of the TAI cluster profiles was evaluated with several external independent socio-demographic and clinical variables. A practical method to determine the similarity between an individual and a group profile of the TAI was also explored. Methods: The TAI was administered to N = 238 patients who were admitted to an inpatient unit for alcohol withdrawal. Data were submitted to k-means cluster analysis with different starting partitions. Different cluster solutions were compared with regard to their stability, similarity (Rand-Index) and the consistency of the within-cluster profiles. Results: A five-cluster solution was found to be stable. The five cluster represent different and distinctive alcohol consumption patterns: 1) Socially integrated alcohol consumption; 2) Excessive consumption, loss of self-control and severe psychosomatic consequences of long-term alcohol abuse; 3) Isolated and hidden alcohol consumption, 4) Inconspicuous alcohol consumption; 5) Residual cluster of non-classifiable cases. The discriminative validity of the Cluster solution was supported with regard to age, gender, unemployment, living-situation, problems with partner, symptoms of psychological distress, and number of withdrawal treatments within the last five years. Conclusions: The study found further evidence for distinct patterns of alcohol consumption as measured by the Trierer Alcoholism Inventory. The development of clinical treatment concepts for patients with alcohol use disorders can be expected to benefit from the information obtained by the administration of the TAI-typology of alcohol consumption patterns.			dirk.dunkel@tilak.at					Bacher Johann, 1996, CLUSTERANALYSE; BELITZWEIHMANN E, 1993, SUCHT, V6, P384; BERGEMANN N, 1998, ZDDP, V19, P113; DUFEU P, 1995, SUCHT, V41, P395; Epstein EE, 2002, ADDICTION, V97, P1041, DOI 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00164.x; FABOR TF, 1996, ALCOHOL HEALTH RES W, V20, P6; FAH M, 1991, SUCHT, V37, P26; Franke G.

How to extract the implicit and useful information with lower time cost and high correctness is of priority concern in data mining, explaining why many clustering methods have been developed in recent decades. This work presents a new clustering algorithm named NPUST, which is an enhanced version of KIDBSCAN. NPUST is a hybrid density-based approach, which partitions the dataset using K-means, and then clusters the resulting partitions with IDBSCAN. Finally, the closest pairs of clusters are merged until the natural number of clusters of dataset is reached. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can handle the entire cluster, and efficiently lower the run-time cost. They also reveal that the proposed new clustering algorithm performs better than several existing well-known approaches such as the K-means, DBSCAN, IDBSCAN and KIDBSCAN algorithms. Consequently, the proposed NPUST algorithm is efficient and effective for data clustering.

This approach requires the determination of a scale factor parameter (eta), which affects the local search performed by GAKM. The problem of auto-adapting the local search in GAKM, by adjusting the eta parameter, is addressed in this work by the proposal of a Terrain-Based Memetic Algorithm (TBMA), derived from existing spatially distributed evolutionary models. Simulation results regarding image VQ show that this new approach is able to adjust the scale factor (eta) for different images at distinct coding rates, leading to better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio values for the reconstructed images when compared to both K-Means and Cellular Genetic Algorithm + K-Means. The TBMA also demonstrates capability of tuning the mutation rate throughout the genetic search.	[Azevedo, Carlos R. B.; Azevedo, Flavia E. A.

This paper illustrates an evolution in state-of-the-art Speaker Verification by highlighting the contribution of recently established information theoretic based vector quantization technique. We explore the novel application of three different vector quantization algorithms, namely K-means, Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) and Information Theoretic Vector Quantization (ITVQ) for efficient speaker verification. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm used by GMM requires a prohibitive amount of iterations to converge. In this paper, comparable alternatives to EM including K-means, LBG and ITVQ algorithm were tested. The GMM-ITVQ algorithm was found to be the most efficient alternative for the GMM-EM It gives correct classification rates at a similar level to that of GMM-EM Finally, representative performance benchmarks and system behaviour experiments on NIST SRE corpora are presented.

Original clustering center is exactly obtained by FCABFS through training foregone samples; Clustering center and non-similarity is calculated by separating objects. This Algorithm solved problem of the higher false positive rate and the lower detection rate caused by using traditional clustering method with random selecting original clustering center and computing single attribute(continual or discrete) only in network anomaly detection. The experimental results compared with traditional clustering algorithm show that the detection rate is promoted 30%, and the false positive rate is diminished 25%. This Algorithm can also obtain detections to new type attack through the method of Unsupervised Learning.

Side Scan Sonar Image Resolution and Automatic Object Detection, Classification and Identification	OCEANS 2009 - EUROPE, VOLS 1 AND 2	OCEANS-IEEE		English	Proceedings Paper	OCEANS 2009 Conference	MAY 11-14, 2009	Bremen, GERMANY	IEEE				Operational requirements for naval applications have shifted towards the fast, reliable detection and avoidance or elimination of underwater threats (e.g. mines, IEDs (improvised explosive devices), ...) over the last decade. For these purposes the ability to reliable separate mines or IEDs from rocks or bottom features is essential. This separation can be much more difficult for IEDs compared to traditional cylindrical or spherical mines. Furthermore, automatic target recognition (ATR) approaches are gaining more and more importance for autonomous UUVs. Since no operator is in the loop, these systems are harmed by a limited number of missed detections or a significant number of false targets. In this context the ability to automatically detect and classify objects depends directly on the true resolution of the acoustic imaging system. All this points towards the need for a high resolution sensor for reliable object detection, classification and identification. Starting with some examples, this paper presents theoretical considerations about the required resolution for the detection, classification and identification process of objects in side scan sonar images. Clues for the required resolution can be directly derived from the Johnson-Criterion for electro-optics systems [1]. Secondly, an image processing software for automatic object detection and classification currently under development at FWG with the assistance of FU-Berlin and FGAN-FOM is presented. This part focuses on an overview of the system and recently developed and tested algorithms. Before applying different detection algorithms, the side scan sonar images are preprocessed including normalization, height estimation plus slant range correction and geo-referencing. Different normalization algorithms can be used. Currently six different screening algorithms for detecting regions of interests (ROIs) with objects of interest are implemented. These screening algorithms base on statistical features within a sliding window, a highlight / shadow analysis after threshold segmentation, a normalized 1d-cross correlation with a template, a modified Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) approach, a k-means and a higher order statistic based segmentation. Afterwards false detections of ROIs without objects of interest are eliminated by applying a single snake algorithm for the entire highlight and shadow area, a coupled snake algorithms for the highlight area and for the shadow area, a 2d-cross correlation with reference images of MLOs and an iterative segmentation, all combined with robust and fast classifiers. The final processing step is a classifier (Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)). Also a simple data fusion strategy was tested based on the output of the different screening and reduction of false positives algorithms. Finally, consequences for image processing with improved sensor resolution are discussed. All algorithms were tested using a data set representing roughly 25 km(2) of the sea floor. This data set was in part collected by the SeaOtter MK I AUV from Atlas Elektronik and gathered in the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Different side scan sonar systems were used.

The problem of identification of noise sources in the ocean is of great importance because of its varied practical applications. Hidden Markov Models can provide an effective architecture for classification of underwater noise sources. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the Code book generation of feature vectors extracted from under water signals. The generated Codebook can be utilized in the design and training of HMMs for the efficient classification of underwater targets.

VRP is the fundamental problem in the research fields of transportation, we focus on variations of CVRPTW (Capacitated VRP with Time Windows). Various types of VRP are studied to determine the optimal route under various constraints of locations, distance, time window and activities. Therefore it is difficult to straightly apply one case result to other cases, because the different constraints cause various difficulties. In this paper, based on previous results in our researches, we consider the problem of "Multi-Agents Scheduling and Routing Problem with Time Windows and Visiting Activities". Firstly, we introduce the result of "Vehicle scheduling and routing problems in day-care center". Secondly, based on other research result of "Scheduling of teachers for visiting high schools", we generalize the problems to VRP with time windows and visiting activities. Based on these case studies, we propose five parameters, such as"activities at the visiting points", "time windows", "numbers of visiting spots within a route", "total visiting time", "time-lag between different routes". We evaluate the quality of optimization based on three performance measures. Thirdly, we present our algorithm of k-means clustering under the constraints of visiting sequence. Finally, we use ArcGIS Network Analyst tool for computing cost of routes, and we evaluate the optimal visiting route with time windows and visiting activities.

This investigation hence presents a novel data clustering algorithm that can be applied to a large database efficiently. The proposed algorithm, called RAD because it is a Radar-alike data-clustering algorithm for large databases, attains this aim because its computation time rises linearly as the data size increases. Experimental results indicate that RAD performs clustering quickly and with fairly good clustering quality and outperforms K-means, DBSCAN and IDBSCAN.

Base on the K-mean clustering technique, the history data can be classified into different clusters, thus the noise of the original data can be reduced and a more accurate prediction model can be established. Numerical data of various affecting factors and actual demand of the past 5 years of the printed circuit board (PCB) factory are collected and input into the hybrid model for future monthly sales forecasting. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the hybrid model when comparing it with other approaches.

A typical example is, with the advent of DNA Microarrays, clustering analysis becomes a powerful way to explore the expression profiles of all genes in the genome. And many algorithms have been developed for this problem. Here, we aim to introduce a more robust clustering technique (neural gas algorithm) for this problem and hope it can be applied to other problems in bioinformatics.

In order to understand the structure of these networks, it can be helpful to decompose the network into communities.. In this paper, we propose a linear projection approach for detecting community structure by transforming network community detection problem into a low-dimension vector clustering problem. Furthermore, the optimal number of communities can be inferred by using the gap statistic idea, if no prior information is provided.

Traditional MS algorithm uses a large number of color histogram, say typically 16x16x16, which makes parallel implementation infeasible. We thus employ K-Means clustering to partition the object color space that enables us to represent color distribution with a quite small number of bins. Based on this compact histogram, all key components of the MS algorithm are mapped onto the GPU. The resultant parallel algorithm consist of six kernel functions, which involves primarily the parallel computation of the candidate histogram and calculation of the Mean Shift vector. Experiments on public available CAVIAR videos show that the proposed parallel tracking algorithm achieves large speedup and has comparable tracking performance, compared with the traditional serial MS tracking algorithm.

In this direction, clustering microarray time-series data via pairwise alignment of piece-wise linear profiles has been recently introduced. We propose a k-means clustering approach based on a multiple alignment of natural cubic spline representations of gene expression profiles. The multiple alignment is achieved by minimizing the sum of integrated squared errors over a tune-interval, defined oil a, set of profiles. Preliminary experiments on a well-known data set of 221 pre-clustered Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression profiles yields excellent results with 79.64% accuracy.

The structure of a class is represented in terms of the estimates of its principal directions computed from data, the overall dissimilarity of a particular object with a given class being given by the "disturbance" of the structure, when the object is identified as a member of this class. In case of unsupervised framework, the clusters are computed using the estimates of the principal directions. Our attempt uses arguments based on the principal components to refine the basic idea of k-means aiming to assure soundness and homogeneity to the resulted clusters. Each cluster is represented in terms of its skeleton given by a set of orthogonal and unit eigen vectors (principal directions) of sample covariance matrix, a set of principal directions corresponding to the maximum variability of the "cloud" from metric point of view. A series of conclusions experimentally established are exposed in the final section of the paper.

Traditionally, the k-means algorithm is one of the most popular methods to classify, the input patterns of the radial basis function network (RBFN). Although the KMA has an ability to cluster the training patterns rapidly, it usually converges to a local minimum and can be oversensitive to randomly initial partitions. To solve these significant problems, a hybrid skill called Genetic k-Means Algorithm is proposed to improve the effectiveness of maximum power point track. By precisely clustering of the training patterns, the objective to accurately and rapidly approximate the MPP of PV system can be achieved with the least squares criterion in RBF network.

A lot of papers have proved the superiority of its estimation accuracy. However, the choice of discretization methods when building a BN model is seldom mentioned, while data discretization is an important step of the whole modeling process, which may lead significantly to different estimating results even based on the same dataset and BN structure. In this paper, we develop a BN model based on previous literature. Within this model, we further compare the effect of three different discretization methods (equal width, equal frequency and k-mean) on the estimated result, combined with different number of discretization categories. These empirical studies are performed on a subset of ISBSG R8 dataset. Estimation accuracy is measured in common used metrics. Qualitative analysis shows that k-mean discretization algorithm can obviously improve the estimation accuracy, especially with discrete categories as 5. And also, the result presents the advantage of k-mean discretization in its monotonicity. The accuracy metrics is better when the number of discretization categories is closer to the optimal value.

It is an efficient approximation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Unlike k-means it forms a hierarchy of clusters. It has been extended to address issues with sparse representations. We compare performance and quality to CLUTO using document collections. The K-tree has a low time complexity that is suitable for large document collections. This tree structure allows for efficient disk based implementations where space requirements exceed that of main memory.

It is a rising challenge for the network operators to understand network user behavior. In this paper, we present a general approach for identification and profiling user behavior model by using data mining technique to analyze user activity data. We present analysis of a data set comprised of the dial-up users' usage data in a typical metropolitan area network of a national broadband operator in China. The data recorded activity of over 250,000 unique user accounts. We identify several main behavior groups by using K-means algorithm, and further summarize behavior profile of each user group as main user, behavior models. The results show that our approach can properly identify user behavior models. Our results provide a basis for network operators to understand dial-up user behavior, optimize network planning and adjust customer related policies accordingly.

Firstly, the density of every node was calculated, and the first K nodes with the highest density were selected as initial clustering centers. Then the marginal nodes were prioritized to avoid the bad effect that marginal nodes might cause on clustering result. The experimental result demonstrated that the improved clustering algorithm not only avoided the local optima but also gave serious consideration to every important marginal node.

The optimal set of features is selected using a hybrid selection model. In this approach, the wireless frame attributes are first ranked according to a score assigned by the information gain ratio measure. K-means classifier is then used to build the optimal subset of features that maximizes the accuracy of the detectors while reducing their learning time. Experimental results with three types of neural networks architectures show clearly that the optimization of the wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.

In this paper, a novel gas identification approach based on Cluster-k-Nearest Neighbor. The effectiveness of this approach has been suc-cessfully demonstrated on an experimentally obtained data set. Our classify takes advantage of both k-NN which is highly accurate and K-means cluster which is able to reduce the time of classification, we introduce Cluster-k-Nearest Neighbor as "variable k"-NN dealing with the centroid or mean point of all subclasses generated by clustering algo-rithm. In general the algorithm of K-means cluster is not stable in term of accuracy. Therefore for that reason we develop another algorithm for clustering space which contributes a higher accuracy compares to K-means cluster with less subclass number, higher stability and bounded time of classification with respect to the variable data size. We find 98.7% of accuracy in the classification of 6 different types of Gas by using K-means cluster algorithm and we find almost the same by using the new clustering algorithm.			brahim.belhaouari@petronas.com.my; riadh.abaza@a3.epfl.ch					BELHOUARI SB, 2004, COMPUTAT STAL DATA A, V47; BERMAK A, 2006, IEEE T INSTRUMENTATI, V55; BERMAKL A, DOMINIQUE MARTINEZ2; Bishop CM, 1995, NEURAL NETWORKS PATT; BRAHIMBELHOUARI S, 2005, PATTERN RECOGNITION; BRAHIMBELHOUARI S, 2004, IEEE TENCON, VA, P693; BRAHIMBELHOUARI S, 2005, IEEE SENSORS J, V5; BRAHIMBELHOUARI S, 2008, MODIFIED K MEANS CLU; CHAN PCH, 2002, SENSOR ACTUAT B-CHEM, V82; DASARSTHY BV, 1990, NEAREST NEIGHBOR NN; Duda R.

An improved technique combining chaotic map particle swarm optimization (CPSO) with an acceleration strategy, is proposed in this paper. Accelerated chaotic particle swarm optimization (ACPSO) searches for cluster centers of an arbitrary data set and can effectively find the global optima. ACPSO is tested on six experimental data sets, and its performance is compared to the performance of PSO, NM-PSO, K-PSO, K-NM-PSO and K-means clustering. Results indicated that ACPSO is both robust and suitable for solving data clustering problem.

However, this is often impossible in real applications since preparing good initial training samples is difficult and time-consuming. It is ideal and appealing for a topical crawler if it can learn knowledge concerning the target topics from the ever-changing environment and adapt itself to these changes during successive crawling process. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised clustering method for building a learnable topical crawler. Our approach employs a constrained k-means clustering algorithm to detect new samples from crawled pages, which is fed to page classifier and link predictor for updating the learned models. This approach enables topical crawling systems with incremental learning capability and in turn improves crawling performance. Comparison experiments have been carried out between our approach and another traditional relevance score based sample generation approach. The experimental results have shown that our approach achieves better performance.

The dictionary applied to word segmentation is reduced by deleting words which are useless for clustering, and the dictionary tree is created to be applied to word segmentation. Then the speed of word segmentation is improved. Correspondence between words and integers is created by coding words. Then the title is expressed by integer set, and the cost of space and time for clustering is decreased largely. Determining the value of k is a shortcoming of stream data mining based on k-means. By this new method, the value of k is adjusted in clustering. Then both the accuracy and the speed are improved.

The inverse problem is how to split a given dataset into two clusters such that the margin between the two clusters attains maximum. However the training time for inverse problem of SVM is incredible. Clustering is a feasible way to simplify the process of it, but it is difficult to estimate the number of the clusters. In this paper, we design a margin-merging cluster algorithm to solve this problem. We compare our approach with the k-means solution in terms of accuracy loss and training time. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can solve it efficiently.

The radar emitter signal information is converted into discrete value in this paper. The attribute of radar emitter signal is reduced and the decision rules are extracted based on Rough Sets. Then the cluster center of radial basis function (RBF) neural network is gain by Rough K-means cluster method. The RBF neural network is constructed with the help of decision rules extracted from information table. The simulation result shows this radar emitter recognition model base on Rough Sets and RBF neural network can cut down the redundant attribute, lessen the neural network structure and recognize radar emitter signal effectively.

We introduce a new objective function with group weight variables and present the Lagrangian method to derive the formula to calculate the group weights. This formula is added as a new step in the standard km cans iterative clustering process to automatically compute the group weights according to the distribution of features. This new process guarantees the convergency of the clustering process to a local optimal solution. The experimental results have shown that this new algorithm performed better than k-means without group feature weighting on different blog data sets.

This method combines improved K-means clustering and simulated annealing algorithm to match SIFT feature points. Firstly, high robust points are extracted by SIFT algorithm; Secondly, cluster with the initial centers obtained by density function, and then optimize the results of clustering which are used as initial results of simulated annealing algorithm by perturbation; Thirdly, match feature points according to Nearest Neighbor algorithm; Finally, calculate the homography and realize image mosaic. This method does not need to traverse all feature points and avoid trapping in a local extremum. Experimental results prove that the method is only relative to geometric position of feature points, and is robust on scale invariant, arbitrary rotation and scaling.

Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCCs) are proved to be better features for speech recognition. In LP analysis, the generation of speech is modeled with an autoregressive (AR) random process. In fact, speech from vocal cord goes through vocal tract first, and then goes through channel. However, general LP analysis does not consider the effect of channel and the LPCCs show little robustness in speech recognition under channel distortion. In this paper, distorted speech is modeled by two different AR models which denote vocal tract and channel, respectively. After the poles are computed, K-means is used to cluster all poles and a new method is proposed to choose Channel poles. For each frame of test utterances, instead of designing a filter using channel poles, robust LPCCs are computed directly by removing channel poles from all poles. Experiment shows that this approach can obtain a better performance than general methods.

Clustering analysis is an important approach of data mining. This paper introduces a new concept of Dynamic Data Windows, and then puts forward a new fusion clustering algorithm with Dynamic Data Windows, the idea of k-means algorithm and density-based method. This new fusion clustering algorithm overcomes some disadvantages of traditional methods. Comparing with clustering based on density, integrated clustering analysis algorithm and clustering based on ANN, the new fusion clustering algorithm is more valuable in data mining. This new fusion clustering algorithm was used in Geographic Information System (GIS). Some analysis results show that the significant improvement to ship-routing design using the new fusion clustering algorithm with Dynamic Data Windows in database of GIS.

To use the feature similarities information, this paper presents an application of k-means clustering algorithm to image retrieval system. Combining the low-level visual features and high-level concepts, the proposed approach fully explores the similarities among images in database, using such clustering algorithm and optimizes the relevance results from traditional image retrieval system by firstly clustering the similar images in the images database to improve the efficiency of images retrieval system. The results of experiments on the testing images show that the proposed approach can greatly improve the efficiency and performances of image retrieval, as well as the convergence to user's retrieval concept.

A thousand top Croatian companies were analyzed regarding two indicators: revenue per employee and profit per employee. Using K-means clustering method enterprises were grouped into three clusters. It was found that with a rise in employment level enterprises tend to get less productive and vice versa. Hence, the observed relationship is found to be reversely proportional. Cluster analysis results were corroborated using discriminant analysis. Dummy variable regression models were also formed to give answers about the strength and magnitude of the relationship of interest, it was confirmed that small Croatian top enterprises have significantly higher revenue per employee and profit per employee then large corporations.

First, the boundary of the breast tumor was manually delineated. Second, five contour features and two gray level features of the tumors were extracted from the B-mode ultrasonic images. Third, an optimal feature vector was created using K-means cluster algorithm. Then a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) was used to classify breast tumors as benign, malignant or uncertain. Finally, the blood flow feature was extracted from the color Doppler flow image, which was used to classify the uncertain as benign or malignant. Experiments on 500 cases show that the proposed system yields the accuracy of 100% for the malignant and 80.8% for the benign. According to the result, our system can be used to reduce unnecessary biopsies.

Essentially that is to cluster those pixels in the nerve slice image which represent the fascicular groups. Because those pixels are distributed discretely and the fascicular groups often split and converge quickly while extending, this paper designs the aim function in order to get the optimum fascicular groups number, which is the sum of the inner-class mean distances and the mean distances among classes. Then the k-means method is employed to cluster those pixels which represent the fascicular groups and the fascicular groups' number is enumerated from 5 to 30 and corresponding aim function values are calculated. Subsequently the minimum aim function is obtained after being compared, which is corresponding to the optimum fascicular groups' number. The experiments show that the right positioning center and optimum number of fascicular groups from the slice image can not only be obtained automatically but also calculated very quickly through the above mentioned method, which is the important basic of 3D visualization of nerves.

Genes exhibiting similar expression patterns provide useful clues for studying their possible functions. In this paper a novel bicluster detection method is proposed. Compared with the other approaches, biclusters are not detected directly with the whole given experiment data matrix, but are verified with the concatenation of small biclusters which are firstly detected using a conventional clustering method such as K-means and so on so is to making fully use of the rich and powerful existing data clustering methods. By this way, the affect of the high dimensionality of the data is greatly reduced. Since the data within a bicluster is highly correlated with each other, a principal component analysis based efficient verification method is applied to concatenate small biclusers into a larger one. Some experiment results on the simulated data are presented.

That is, assuming that the number of seed-points in the algorithm is set to be larger than the true number k' of clusters in the data set, the proposed algorithm can assign the k' seed-points to the actual clusters, respectively, with the extra seed-points corresponding to the empty clusters, i.e., having no winning points according to a newly defined distance. Via using the Mahalanobis distance, the proposed algorithm can be further extended to elliptical clustering analysis. It is demonstrated well by the experiments on simulated data set and the wine data that the proposed k'-means algorithm can find the correct number of clusters in the sample data with a good correct classification rate. Moreover, the algorithm is successfully applied to unsupervised color image segmentation.

This algorithm regards the whole image as a bag, and the low-level visual feature of the segmented regions as instances, in order to transform every bag to a single sample, RSTSVM-MIL first generates a collection of "visual-word" to construct projection space by K-means clustering method in the instance feature space, then a nonlinear mapping is defined using these "visual-word" and maps every bag to a point in the projection space, extracting all bags' projection feature, which converts MIL problem to a standard supervised learning problem. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of classifier training and to use a large amount of unlabeled image together with the labeled image to build better classifiers, we use RS (rough set) method to reduce the redundant information in projection feature firstly, then semi-supervised learning algorithm TSVM be used to train classifier. Experimental results on the SIVAL image set show that solving MIL problems using semi-supervised learning is feasible, and the RSTSVM-MIL is competitive with other state-of-the-art MIL algorithms in object-based image retrieval problem.

First, the local peaks of 3D color histogram within the neighborhood of 3 X 3 X 3 were located. The corresponding color values of local peaks were regarded as initial clustering centers, and the number of local peaks were taken as the number of clustering. In addition, taking into account of the color difference induced by local illumination, the feature vector was constructed including color and texture features. Finally, K-means clustering algorithm was applied to segment the color image. Experiment results show that the proposed method can segment the color image accurately, corresponding with the human visual. Clustering number was determined adaptively, and the problem of over-segmentation was solved effectively. The segmentation result was benefit for the following steps in the computer vision.

However, the existing methods are usually used for specific application and evaluated with fixed window size. In this literature, we propose an effort to combine multi-scale features for unsupervised texture classification. The local binary pattern (LBP) is used for detecting micro textured structures. As for large scale texture information, Haralick features extracted from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are adopted. In order to determine the optimal window size, each method is evaluated with different window sizes. By combining the information provided by multi-scale features for classification, the proposed method achieved higher classification rate than each single method evaluated over fixed window size. Experimental results confirmed the usefulness of this combination.

This paper proposes to represent the foreground objects in videos by the bag of words model. The foreground object is treated as a positive document which is a set of image patches, and the background region is a negative document. Initially the training image patches are sampled and represented by speeded up robust features (SURF) descriptor, and then the bag of words model is constructed by K-means clustering algorithm. Subsequently the document is represented as the histogram of the visual words which is the feature vector of the image. Finally, a naive Bayesian classifier is obtained by training these feature vectors. In the stage of foreground objects detection, the motion regions are detected firstly, and then classified by the naive Bayesian classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient with the processing speed up to eighteen frames per second on a standard PC.

However, most of the ECG analysis and diagnosis algorithms are based on processing of the original ECG signal. Therefore, compressed ECG data needs to be decompressed first before the existing algorithms and tools can be applied to detect cardiovascular abnormalities. Decompression will cause delay on the doctor's mobile device and in wireless nodes that have the responsibilities to detect and prioritize abnormal data for faster processing. This is undesirable in body sensor networks (BSNs) as high processing involved in decompression will waste valuable energy in the resource and power constrained sensor nodes. In this paper, in order to diagnose cardiac abnormality such as Ventricular tachycardia, we applied a novel system to analyse and classify compressed ECG signal by using a PCA for feature extraction and k-mean for clustering of normal and abnormal ECG signals.

The main idea is to identify the most similar time series to a given query without necessarily searching over the whole database. Our method is based on partitioning the search space by applying the K-means algorithm on the data. Then, similarity search is performed hierarchically starting from the cluster that lies most closely to the query. This procedure aims at reaching the most similar series without searching all clusters. In this work, we propose to reduce the intrinsically high dimensionality of time series prior to clustering by applying a well known dimensionality reduction technique, namely, the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, for its simplicity and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on twelve real-world and synthetic datasets covering a wide range of applications.

Neither of these two parts can make full use of all the information. Our method integrates both user rating and music content information using an expansion method of LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) called M-LSA. We use a text representation for music content information, which is obtained by K-means Clustering or HMM method. Experiments on the data of 300 popular songs show that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory results.

It mainly consists of both generation of individual member and fusion methods. In this paper, we study the cluster ensembles where individual members are obtained based on k-means clustering algorithm and fusion method of hierarchical clustering is used. Three consensus functions, which are single linkage, complete linkage and average linkage, respectively, is studied and discussed in hierarchical clustering fusion. For evaluating performance of cluster ensembles, adjusted rand index is considered. Experimental results show that performance of cluster ensembles with the average linkage is superior to one with single linkage and complete linkage. Moreover, we also study the relationship between accuracy and ensemble size of the three methods.

Several types of synthetic two dimensional scatter data were clustered using the typical k-means clustering method. The weighted GA-based clustering method was developed to address the problem of clustering data with differently scaled (heteroscaled) dimensions. Cluster analysis results obtained from using this method was compared to the results produced from the application of the traditional k-means clustering. By introducing weights in the fitness evaluation component of the meta-heuristic search method, a more efficient clustering of heteroscaled data was produced. In real applications, this method can be used in cluster analyses of scatter data with significantly different scales in dimensions, such as kurtosis versus fatigue damage relationship scatter data.

In this article, we introduce a new approach to organize sensor networks in clusters in order to reduce energy dissipation. Our contribution is an heuristic to define the number of clusters and also an efficient manner to choose cluster heads by minimizing the distance between cluster heads and its cluster nodes. Inspired from LEACH, a well-known TDMA cluster-based sensor network architecture, we introduce a new method for building and maintaining clusters using the paradigm of a soccer team. In this work, a new algorithm called OH-Kmeans, based on the K-means algorithm, is used to find dynamically the number of clusters and form them, guaranteeing direct transmission between cluster heads and cluster nodes.

The segmentation takes place by initially performing K-means clustering and then recombination. K-means algorithm uses RGB color values, diagonal busyness factor (sum of color differences among central and diagonal pixels) and epsilon spatiality factor (sum of Euclidian distances of pixels belonging to a particular cluster from their cluster center) as its clustering parameters in order to produce optionally compact or loose clusters representative Of inherent color and texture. In addition, three different distribution methods are introduced to initialize central points and therefore improve the clustering accuracy. The methods are evenly spaced values, random values and evenly spaced samples respectively. In evenly spaced values, clusters (central points) are evenly distributed along the range of RGB colors available with in the image so that each cluster may partially represent a sub range of the total range of colors available with in the image. In random values, the distribution of clusters (central points) is not even. To define a central point an RGB color is randomly selected from the range of RGB colors available with in the image. In evenly spaced samples the distribution of clusters (central points) is based on X and Y (width and height) coordinates rather than color. To obtain an even distribution, total number of image pixels are calculated and then divided by the number of clusters (central points). Recombination is performed by scanning the neighborhood of each pixel in eight connected directions and determining the class (cluster) to which majority of neighbors belong.

Proposed technique is a more powerful approach for X-Ray image based diagnosing diseases like lung cancer and tuberculosis. The IMC based segmentation approach was applied on lung X-Ray images and compared with some existing techniques such as K-Means and FCM based segmentation approaches. The performance of all these segmentation approaches is compared in terms of cluster entropy as a measure of information. The segments obtained from the methods have been verified visually.

There are various methodologies in the literature ranging from macroscopic numerical flow simulations to detailed, microscopic agent simulations. One key issue for all crowd simulations is scalability. Some methods address this issue through abstraction, describing global properties of homogeneous crowds. However, ideally a modeler should be able to simulate large heterogeneous crowds at fine levels of detail. We are attempting to :achieve scalability through the application of distributed simulation techniques to agent-based crowd simulation. Distributed simulation, however, introduces its own challenges, in particular how to efficiently partition the load between a number of machines. In this paper we introduce a method of partitioning agents onto machines using an adapted k-means clustering algorithm. We present, validate and use an analysis tool to compare the proposed clustered partitioning approach with a series of existing methods.

An alternative approachis to classify traffic by exploiting the distinctive characteristics of applications when they communicate on a network. We pursue this latter approach and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify groups of traffic that are similar using only transport layer statistics. Our work considers two unsupervised Clustering algorithms, namely K-Means and DBSCAN, that have previously not been used for network traffic classification. We evaluate these two algorithms, using empirical Internet traces. The experimental results show that both K-Means and DBSCAN work very well and much more quickly Our results indicate that although DBSCAN has lower accuracy compared to K-Meansand, DBSCAN produces better clusters.

The dimensionality of image descriptors used in image retrieval applications is quite high. Given a query image, our algorithm first makes use of manifold learning (LPP) for dimensionality reduction and manifold ranking algorithm to explore the relationship among all the data points in the feature space, and then measures relevance between the query and all the images in the database accordingly. Then we use the similarities among target images for improving the performance of the image retrieval systems by cluster-based retrieval of images by unsupervised learning. Our algorithm retrieves image clusters as retrieval results by applying K-means clustering algorithm to a collection of images collected by manifold ranking algorithm. Experimental results on a general-purpose image database show that our algorithm attains a significant improvement over existing systems.

We address the problem of cluster number selection by using a k-means approach that exploits local changes of internal validity indices to split or merge clusters. Our split and merge k-means issues criterion functions to select clusters to be split or merged and fitness assessments on cluster structure changes. Experiments on standard test data sets show that this approach selects an accurate number of clusters with reasonable runtime and accuracy.

This parallel with the classical inverse problem of denoising brings us to investigate a sparse representation based approach for background subtraction. A global trained dictionary is obtained using a k-means classifier and using the matching pursuit method a set of coefficients is estimated. By linear combination of dictionary vectors (atoms) and the set of coefficients a background estimate is computed for each frame to obtain the foreground-background segmentation. The global dictionary and the coefficients are propagated and updated along the sequence. The approach yields surprisingly preliminary results, encouraging for further investigations on the possible extensions of the algorithm.

The most significant line of defense against malware is anti-virus products which detects, removes, and characterizes these threats. The ability of these AV products to successfully characterize these threats greatly depends on the method for categorizing these profiles of malware into groups. Therefore, clustering malware into different families is one of the computer security topics that are of great interest. In this paper, resting on the analysis of the extracted instruction of malware samples, we propose a novel parameter-free hybrid clustering algorithm (PFHC) which combines the merits of hierarchical clustering and K-means algorithms for malware clustering. It can not only generate stable initial division, but also give the best K. PFHC first utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm as the frame, starting with N singleton clusters, each of which exactly includes one sample, then reuses the centroids of upper level in every level and merges the two nearest clusters, finally adopts K-means algorithm for iteration to achieve an approximate global optimal division. PFHC evaluates clustering validity of each iteration procedure and generates the best K by comparing the values. The promising studies on real daily data collection illustrate that, compared with popular existing K-means and hierarchical clustering approaches, our proposed PFHC algorithm always generates much higher quality clusters and it can be well used for malware categorization.

Resting on the analysis of function based instruction sequence, we develop an intelligent instruction sequence based malware categorization system (ISMCS) using a novel weighted subspace clustering method. ISMCS is an integrated system consisting of three major modules: feature exactor, malware categorizer using weighted subspace clustering method and malware signature generator. ISMCS can not only effectively categorize malwares to different families, but also automatically generate the unify signature for every family. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness of our ISMCS system outperform other existing malware categorization methods, such as K-Means and hierarchical clustering algorithms.

This method is proposed to divide data into clusters or regions. Different regions or clusters, which are used to calculate code words, have been designed by using the line of symmetry approach. This line of symmetry is rotated by a pre defined angle to divide the complete data set into small clusters. These code words are then used to represent the complete data set. The algorithm discussed is for lossy data compression.

Thus, a decision must be taken for choosing the clustering result that produces the best data partition for a given data collection. In order to support such a decision, indexes for measuring the quality of a data partitioning must be constructed. So far, several cluster validity indexes have been formulated in the literatures. Each of those indexes has strengths and drawbacks when compared with the others. In the present study, an alternative cluster validity index is formulated. The proposed validity index not only takes the contribution of each pattern into consideration, but also relies on information of intra-cluster and inter-cluster distance. The main advantage of the presented index is that is insensitive to noise by introducing the Gaussian kernel into the proposed validity index. An experimental design was devised in order to determine the comparative performance of the proposed cluster validity index against DB index previously formulated in the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed index is insensitive to noise and adaptive to produce good clustering solution.

The variation can be especially useful for a more efficient evolutionary implementation of rough clustering. Experimentation with the rough K-means algorithm has shown that it provides a reasonable set of lower and upper hounds for a given dataset. However, rough K-means algorithm has not been explicitly shown to provide optimal rough clustering. Recently, an evolutionary rough K-means algorithm was proposed that minimizes a rough within-group-error. The proposal combined the efficiency of rough K-means algorithm with the optimization ability of GAs. The medoid based variation proposed here is more efficient than the evolutionary rough K-means algorithm, as it uses a smaller and discrete search space. It will also make it possible to test a wider variety of optimization criteria due to built in restrictions on the solution space.

We used cluster analysis, namely an iterative method of clustering, the k-means algorithm. Using data results, we have made tests for the three classes of prediction using discriminant analysis. Fishers functions have helped us to make predictions on the affiliation of a new listed company on one of the 3 classes of risk. In this study, emphasis was placed on the liquidity of companies, but also on how efficient are used the raw materials, the basic elements in the current financial crisis. This should give us a clearer picture of companies that are ready to get over this difficult time.

Human posture is one of the key aspects of analyzing human behaviour. We investigated three clustering techniques to recognize human posture. The system is first trained to recognize a pair of posture and this is repeated for three pairs of human posture. Finally the system is trained to recognize five postures together. The clustering techniques used for the purpose of our investigation included K-Means, fuzzy C-Means and Self-Organizing Maps. The results showed that K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means performed well for the three pair of posture data. However these clustering techniques gave low accuracy when we scale up the dataset to five different postures. Self-Organizing. Maps produce better recognition accuracy when tested for five postures.

According to statistics about 10% of all vehicles were among the high polluters. However, some cause factors might not be from user's improper maintenance of vehicles. Poor quality control at assembly lines and quality of parts could be the cause car owners often become prime culprits in discharging pollutants. By seeking out the specific high pollution causing groups (brands) of vehicle, and requiring strict adherence to recall for repairs and vehicle inspection might help reduce air pollution and improve air quality. In this paper, inspection data of vehicles were collected between May 1st, 2007 and December 31st, 2007 at a licensed inspection center in central Taichung, Taiwan. The proposed method makes use of clustering algorithm on 50,000 records to study the correlation between the brands and pollution emitted from vehicles. Results showed that three types of vehicle brand revealed significantly higher pollution that is not inclusive of car age. The results can be used by the department for vehicle safety as a guide for requiring stricter recall of vehicles for repairs and inspection other than routine requirements.

Three kinds of specimen were tensioned under quasi-static load mode till fracture to generate dominant damage mechanism. Four AE parameters were selected as feature vectors to identify different damage mechanisms. K-means algorithms, with the help of fracture surface examination of SEM, were used to clustering the AE data. Result from this study revealed that AE technique is a viable and effective method for identifying damage modes of UHMWPE/LDPE laminate. AE characteristic of matrix damage is low amplitude, less counts, short rise time and short duration, while fiber fracture is high amplitude, more counts, long rise time and long duration. AE parameter of interface debonding is fall in between matrix damage and fiber fracture. These correlation can be used to monitor the failure process in the PE self reinforced composites.

In this paper, we propose to build an effective visual vocabulary by using Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture model instead of traditional clustering methods. In addition, Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is employed to explore semantic aspects of visual concepts and to discover topic clusters among documents and visual words so that every image is projected on to a lower dimensional topic space for more efficient and effective annotation. Experimental results obtained on TRECVID 2005 dataset demonstrate that the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture model can achieve better annotation performance than hierarchical k-means clustering even by using simple k-NN annotation scheme.

Typically, there are two types of cigarette packaging defects: (1) cigarette laying defects such as incorrect cigarette numbers and irregular layout; (2) tin paper handle defects such as folded paper handles. In this paper, an automated vision-based defect inspection system is designed for cigarettes packaged in tin containers. The first type of defects is inspected by counting the number of cigarettes in a tin container. First k-means clustering is performed to segment cigarette regions. After noise filtering, valid cigarette regions are identified by estimating individual cigarette area using linear regression. The k clustering centers and area estimation function are learned off-line on training images. The second kind of defect is detected by checking the segmented paper handle region. Experimental results on 500 test images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inspection system. The proposed method also contributes to the general detection and classification system such as identifying mitosis in early diagnosis of cervical cancer.

Firstly, the feature fusion method based on KCCA is established, then pseudo Zernike moments and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) are extracted as global features and local features. K-means algorithm is applied to normalize the local features to obtain the same form as global features. After the fusion of two features, one-against-all Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as classifier for the Multi-class target recognition. Theoretical analysis and experiments on aircraft images results show that KCCA features fusion representations significantly outperform CCA fusion method and single feature approach. Feature fusion of global features and local features based on target image for recognition are proved to be a promising strategy in object recognition field.

It firstly makes preprocess of texts, and filter the majority of noisy words by using unsupervised feature selection method. Then it used TGSOM to execute the first clustering to get the rough classification of texts, and to get the initial clustering number and each text's category. And then introduced LSA theory to improve the precision of clustering and reduce the dimension of feature vector. After that it used TGSOM to execute the second clustering to get the more precise clustering result, and used supervised feature selection method to select feature items. Finally, it used FKM to cluster the result set. In the experiment, it remained the same number of feature items. Experimental results indicate that TGSOM-FS-FKM clustering excels to other clustering method such as DSOM-FS-FCM, and the precision is better than DSOM-FCM, DFKCN and FDMFC clustering.

The methodology involves an extraction of texture features using bidimensional empirical mode decomposition and fractal dimension, then, is followed by a k-means based classifier which assigns each pixel to the class. In feature extraction, firstly, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which directly from image data by means of bidimensional empirical mode decomposition were obtained. Secondly, we calculate Differential Box-Counting of each intrinsic mode function as texture features. After feature extraction, K-means clustering is performed to the texture image. The main contribute of our approach is to using fractal dimension of each IMF as texture feature. Preliminary result, this scheme show high recognition accuracy in the classification of Brodatz texture images, and it can be also successfully applied to image segmentation.

According to the characteristics of the image, the feature vector of the pixel is properly chosen and the weight factors of the feature vector are adjusted, which enhances the segmentation precision. The selection of conventional genetic algorithm and the modification of mutation operations improve the speed of convergence.

This watermarking approach is based on image normalization, in which both watermark embedding and extraction are carried out with respect to an image normalized to meet a set of predefined moment criteria.We propose a new normalization procedure, which is invariant to affine transform attacks.The resulting watermarking scheme is suitable for public watermarking applications, where the original image is not available for watermark extraction., we employ watermarking scheme as a direct-sequence code division multiple access approach to embed multibit text information in DCT and DWT transform domain. In Biomedical images the watermark is embedded in the regions other than the area of interest so that the diagnosis is not affected. The area of interest of the biomedical image is found out using the K-means segmentation method. Performance of proposed watermarking scheme is robust against various types of attacks such as Affine transform, Gaussian noise, shearing, rotation, median filtering and JPEG compression. This proposed algorithm can be used in Hospital environment.	[Jayanthi, V. E.; Selvalakshmi, V.

This research presents a model for document Clustering that arranges unstructured documents into content-based homogeneous groups. ne overall paradigm is hybrid because it combines pattern-recognition grouping algorithms with semantic-driven processing. First, a semantic-based metric measures distances between documents, by combining a content-based with a behavioral analysis; the metric considers both lexical properties and the structure and styles that characterize the processed documents. Secondly, the model relies on a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel-based mapping for clustering. As a result, the major novelty aspect of the proposed approach is to exploit the implicit mapping of RBF kernel functions to tackle the crucial task of normalizing similarities while embedding semantic information in the whole mechanism.

First we are concerned with the representation of fuzzy shapes and introduce appropriate shape metrics and descriptors. Next, we discuss Procrustean methods for aligning shapes, finding mutual dissimilarities and estimating shape class centroid. In the case of multiple-contour crisp shapes, we can benefit from the Extended Orthogonal Procrustes method to find mutual distances between shape pairs and from the Generalized Orthogonal Procrustes technique to estimate the Procrustes mean shape of a collection of shapes. On the other hand, dealing with the case of fuzzy shapes needs more advanced Procrustean techniques to consider weighted distances between points placed on alpha - level contours with different membership degrees. This leads to solve a Weighted Orthogonal Procrustes problem, which typically needs to introduce a weighting matrix of residuals (distances). As an application, we suggest using such methods to cluster ultrasound images of lymph nodes, which typically appear as double-contour shapes.

The clustering was the process to obtain the best antibodies to catch the antigens by producing the antibodies and recognizing the antigens unceasingly. The distance concentration and the affinity, between antibody and antigen, and between antibody and antibody, were defined about the K-means clustering; the antibody reproduction function was proposed. The antibody cloning algorithm was presented. The experimental results show that the algorithm not only avoids the local optima and is robust to initialization, but also increases the convergence speed.

One of its distinguished features is its speed in practice. Its worst-case running-time, however, is exponential, leaving a gap between practical and theoretical performance. Arthur and Vassilvitskii [3] aimed at closing this gap, and they proved a bound of poly(n(k), sigma(-1)) on the smoothed running-time of the k-means method, where n is the number of data points and sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbation. This bound, though better than the worst-case bound, is still much larger than the running-time observed in practice. We improve the smoothed analysis of the k-means method by showing two upper bounds on the expected running-time of k-means. First, we prove that the expected running-time is bounded by a polynomial in n(root k) and sigma(-1). Second, we prove an upper bound of k(kd).poly(n, sigma(-1)), where d is the dimension of the data space. The polynomial is independent of k and d, and we obtain a polynomial bound for the expected running-time for k, d is an element of O(root log n/log log n). Finally, we show that k-means runs in smoothed polynomial time for one-dimensional instances.

This quest for better approximation algorithms is further fueled by the implicit hope that these better approximations also yield more accurate clusterings. E.g., for many problems such as clustering proteins by function, or clustering images by subject, there is some unknown correct "target" clustering and the implicit hope is that approximately optimizing these objective functions will in fact produce a clustering that is close pointwise to the truth. In this paper, we show that if we make this implicit assumption explicit-that is, if we assume that any c-approximation to the given clustering objective Phi is epsilon-close to the target-then we can produce clusterings that are O(epsilon)-close to the target, even for values c for which obtaining a c-approximation is NP-hard. In particular, for k-median and k-means objectives, we show that we can achieve this guarantee for any constant c > 1, and for the min-sum objective we can do this for any constant c > 2. Our results also highlight a surprising conceptual difference between assuming that the optimal solution to, say, the k-median objective is epsilon-close to the target, and assuming that any approximately optimal solution is epsilon-close to the target, even for approximation factor say c = 1.01. In the former case, the problem of finding a solution that is O(epsilon)-close to the target remains computationally hard, and yet for the latter we have an efficient algorithm.

Its main features are simplicity and speed in practice. Theoretically, however, the best known upper bound on its running time (i.e. O(n(kd))) is, in general, exponential in the number of points (when kd = Omega(n/log n)). Recently, Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2] showed a super-polynomial worst-case analysis, improving the best known lower bound from Omega(n) to 2(Omega(root n)) with a construction in d = Omega(root n) dimensions. In [2] they also conjectured the existence of super-polynomial lower bounds for any d >= 2. Our contribution is twofold: we prove this conjecture and we improve the lower bound, by presenting a simple construction in the plane that leads to the exponential lower bound 2(Omega(n)).

A new type of AMs have been developed recently, the so-called Geometric Associative Memories (GAMs), these make use of Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) operators and operations for their working. GAM's, at the beginning, were developed for supervised classification, getting good results. In this work an algorithm for unsupervised learning with GAMs will be introduced. This new idea, is a variation of the k-means algorithm that takes into account the patterns of the a specific cluster and the patterns of another clusters to generate a separation surface. Numerical examples are presented to show the functioning of the new algorithm.

In the past, a number of describing features have been proposed in literature for this goal. In this work a feature extraction and classification methodology for the retrieval of natural images is described. The proposal combines fixed and random extracted points for feature extraction. The describing features are the mean, the standard deviation and the homogeneity (form the co-occurrence) of a sub-image extracted from the three channels: H, S and I. A K-MEANS algorithm and a 1-NN classifier are used to build an indexed database of 300 images. One of the advantages of the proposal is that we do not need to manually label the images for their retrieval. After performing our experimental results, we have observed that in average image retrieval using images not belonging to the training set is of 80.71% of accuracy. A comparison with two similar works is also presented. We show that our proposal performs better in both cases.	[Serrano, J. F.; Sossa, J.

Sampling and Methods: A self-report test battery was completed by every consecutive new adolescent outpatient from a representative patient pool of 5 local child psychiatric centres in Western Hungary over an 18-month period (n = 644). The questionnaires used were the pilot version of the Columbia Depression Scale, the Hungarian standard versions of the Beck Depression Inventory, the Ways of Coping Questionnaire, the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale and the Junior High Life Experiences Survey. A total of 110 adolescent outpatients (88 females, 22 males, mean age = 16.21 years, SD = 1.38) suffering from SB were included in the study. All diagnoses including SB were confirmed by the MINI Plus Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. K means clustering was used to compare variances of 19 variables to decide which ones are the major criteria for assigning subjects to clusters, and principal component analysis was utilized to identify background SB dimensions in the patient sample. Results: The cluster analysis identified 3 homogenous clusters differentiating suicidal adolescents characteristically: 'stress-laden/medium depressive', 'low depressive/low achievement' and 'high depressive' cluster groups. While cluster analysis confirmed the role of the severity of depression only, principal component analysis explored the following 4 underlying profiles of SB: stress-laden, dysfunctional, maladaptive and depressive/risky factors. Conclusions: Although important coping qualities failed to register as major criteria in the development of separate groups of suicidal adolescent outpatients, distinct background profiles of SB among Hungarian adolescents were found covering the risk groups according to clinical experience. Future research is warranted to identify possible variation in the coping strategies among different adolescent suicidal samples. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Enhanced K-Means Clustering for Patient Reported Outcome	RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS (CEA 10)	Electrical and Computer Engineering Series		English	Proceedings Paper	4th WSEAS International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications	JAN 27-29, 2010	Cambridge, MA		Harvard Univ	Clustering Technique; K-Means Series Algorithms; Automatic K-Generation; Harmonic Series		Data Mining has become one of the most exciting and fastest growing fields in Information Technology. This is due to unprecedented growth-rate of data which is being collected, loaded and stored through World Wide Web and accessed electronically in almost all fields of Human Endeavour. But online retrieval or querying of useful information from these very large databases for Medical diagnosis in hospital information systems (HIS), Biomedical, DNA analysis etc is becoming an increasing scientific challenge. As a result there is an urgent need for sophisticated tools and techniques that can handle extremely large multiple databases. Even it is necessary to globalize Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) to process and extract useful knowledge's using fully automated techniques. In the field of medicine, as human cannot practically deal with such a huge amount of data, a growing attention has been paid for information processing. To resolve these, it is highly expected to enhance clustering techniques. In this paper we enhance K-means algorithm of Clustering technique by Automatic K generation and optimize the cluster.

Assessment of unsupervised classification techniques for intertidal sediments	REMOTE SENSING FOR A CHANGING EUROPE			English	Proceedings Paper	28th European-Association-of-Remote-Sensing-Laboratories (EARSeL) Symposium and Workshops on Remote Sensing for a Changing Europe	JUN 02-05, 2008	Istanbul, TURKEY	European Assoc Remote Sensing Labs	Istanbul Tech Univ, Remote Sensing Div, ITU Maslak Campus	intertidal sediments; unsupervised classification; imaging spectroscopy; clustering; artificial data	MODEL	The aim of this study is to explore three techniques for unsupervised classification of airborne hyperspectral imagery of intertidal flats. The unsupervised classification techniques considered are k-means (hard clustering), the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm (Fuzzy clustering), and the mixture of Gaussians model (probabilistic clustering). The behavior and suitability of these techniques is analyzed for sediment classification. Artificial data sets based on real airborne and field spectra are used for this purpose. The sensitivity of the techniques is investigated on two spectral aspects: the effect of within class (intra-class) variability and the effect of spectral dimensionality using feature selection. This sensitivity is expressed as classification accuracy in terms of the Kappa statistic (kappa) that indicates how better the classification is than chance agreement. The results show that the three techniques are suitable for sediment classification. When there is no feature selection involved, the mixture of Gaussians results in the best classification results. When feature selection is considered, sediment classification accuracy increases for all three techniques applied on the artificial imagery.

Lossada, La Canada de Urdaneta y Rosario de Perija Municipalities, 102 farms were selected by random sampling and K-mean algorithm to create the technological groups. Three technological groups (TGs) were identified: low (TG(1)), middle (TG(2)) and high (TG(3)). Later, the partial productivity means of different groups were compared by variance analysis and the Duncan test was utilized to evaluate the differences among the means. The TG3 showed high partial productivity in several indicators but only milk liters by total-cow and by labor productivity were statistically significant (P<0.05). Also, economical indicators such as income by total-cow, total income, profit and gross profit resulted statistically different from TG(2) and TG(1). These results allow concluding that TG(3) showed a higher herd and labor productivity and lower cost-income relationship due to differences in the farm management of TG(3) with respect to other groups. There is a straightforward relationship among technological levels and economical indicators. Profit and gross profit increases as the farm move into higher technological level.

We prove that if f is a holomorphic function in Q, then its Taylor series, with center at any xi is an element of Omega, is universal with respect to overconvergence if and only if its Ceshro (C, k)-means are universal for any real k > -1. This is an extension of the same result, proved recently by F. Bayart, for any integer k >= 0.

Motion capture and classification for real-time interaction with a bipedal robot using on-body, fully wireless, motion capture Specknets	RO-MAN 2009: THE 18TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ROBOT AND HUMAN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	SEP 27-OCT 02, 2009	Toyama, JAPAN	IEEE				This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of real-time human-robot interaction using motion capture (mocap) data obtained from fully wireless, on-body sensor networks. During the learning phase, data for motion such as waving of the hands, standing on a leg, performing sit-ups and squats is captured from a human strapped with the Orient motion capture specks. Key features are extracted from the captured motion data using unsupervised learning algorithms. During subsequent interactions with the robot, the motion of the operator, speckled with Orients, is classified and the robot selects to play the closest motion. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the robot operates a well defined vocabulary of motion, and the advantages are the real-time interaction and the rapidity (in a matter of minutes) in programming new behaviour compared to a heuristics-based approach. This paper compares the performances of three unsupervised learning algorithms: c-means, k-means and Expectation Maximisation (EM) for the four motion scenarios. Nine best candidates for the three learning algorithms for each of the four motion scenarios were selected in the Webots robot simulator and then transferred to the real robot. Metrics were defined for each motion scenario and their performances compared for the three learning algorithms. In all the cases the motions were able to be imitated; c-means was the best, followed closely by the k-means algorithms, and the reasons have been analysed.	[Arvind, D. K.; Bartosik, M.

In the public service area, the basic four human intentional actions, 'approach', 'depart', 'bypass', and 'stop' were investigated by the human's movement pattern. In order to recognize those four human intentional actions, the mobile robot measured 360 degree distance between a robot and a human by two IR-scanner sensors, and three problems were solved: l) human detection and tracking by improved K-means clustering method, 2) absolute human velocity estimation by Extended Kalman Filter, and 3) inferring intentional actions by HMM with position-dependent observation model. The result showed as quite good performance that inferred the probabilities of those four intentional actions.

During the learning phase for the robot, data for motion such as waving the hands, standing on a leg, performing sit-ups and squats is captured from a human operator strapped with the Orient specks. Key features are extracted from the captured motion data using unsupervised learning algorithms. During subsequent interactions with the robot, the motion of the human operator, speckled with Orients, is classified on-line and the robot selects to play the closest motion. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the robot operates a well defined vocabulary of motion, and the advantages are the speed with which new robot motion behaviour can be programmed in a matter of minutes (compared to a heuristics-based approach), and the mobility (compared to a camera-based method) that this mode of interaction affords.

Experimentation with the rough K-means algorithm has shown that it provides a reasonable set of lower and upper bounds for a given dataset. Evaluation of clustering obtained from rough K-means using various cluster validity measures has also been promising. However, rough K-means algorithm has not been explicitly shown to provide optimal rough clustering. This paper proposes an evolutionary rough K-means algorithm that minimizes a rough within-group-error. The proposal is different from previous Genetic Algorithms (GAs) based rough clustering, as it combines the efficiency of rough K-means algorithm with the optimization ability of GAs. The evolutionary rough K-means algorithm provides flexibility in terms of the optimization criterion. It can be used for optimizing rough clusters based on different criteria.

The choice of a good colour palette is crucial as it directly determines the quality of the resulting image. Colour quantisation can also be seen as a clustering problem where the task is to identify those clusters that best represent the colours in an image. In this paper, we use a rough c-means clustering algorithm for colour quantisation of images. Experimental results on a standard set of images show that this rough image quantisation approach performs significantly better than other, purpose built colour quantisation algorithms.

Proper data clustering reveals data structure and makes possible further data processing and analysis. In the application area, k-means clustering algorithms are most often exploited in almost all important branches of data processing and data exploration. During last decades, a great deal of new algorithmic techniques have been invented and implemented that extend basic k-means clustering methods. In this context, fuzzy and rough k-means clustering presents robust modifications of basic k-means clustering that are aimed at better apprehension of data structure that advantageously incorporate notions from fuzzy and rough set theories. In the paper, an extension of rough k-means clustering into rough entropy domain has been introduced. Experimental results suggest that proposed algorithm outperforms standard k-means clustering methods applied in the area of image segmentation.

The hand posture is decomposed Into relevant compositions which are learned for each hand posture class without supervision; no hand segmentations or localization during training is needed. To learn relevant composition prototypes, an entropy range maximization loop was introduced, by performing k-means clustering several times. Experimental results compare favorably with results of both image categorization and hand posture recognition reported in literature.

An efficient reliability computation of generalized multi-state k-out-of-n systems	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)/17th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Risk-Analysis-Europe (SRA-Europe)	SEP 22-25, 2008	Valencia, SPAIN	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc (ESRA), Soc Risk Anal Europe				The generalized multi-state k-out-of-n system model proposed recently provides more flexibility in describing practical systems. In this model, there are n components in the system where each component and the system can be in one of M + 1 possible states: 0, 1, ... , M. The system is in state j or above if there exists an integer value l (j <= l <= M) such that at least k(l) components are in state l or above. Although the model has several practical applications, existing methods for computing either the exact or approximate reliability of these systems are computationally inefficient and limited to very small systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the exact reliability of multi-state k-out-of-n systems. The method is based on conditional probabilities and is applicable for all cases of multi-state k-out-of-n systems: (1) constant, (2) decreasing, (3) increasing, and (4) non-monotone k values. The computational time complexity of the algorithm is O(knM), and the space complexity is O(n + M) where k = mean{k(i)}. Using this algorithm, the reliability of very large multi-state k-out-of-n systems can be computed in a short time. For example, the reliability of a system with 500 components with 200 possible states can be computed in less than one second. Several numerical examples, including the published examples, are considered to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. In addition to the detailed algorithm and theoretical background, we also provide the complete listing of the MATLAB code used in the calculations.

In this paper, the quality of the clustering has been raised and the initial value has been optimized through the improvements of the clustering algorithm by taking the K-means-algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The simulation results show that the rate of convergence is precise and fast after the clustering algorithm is improved and the PID control is better than the one without taking the new method.

First proposed by Besl and McKay, the algorithm is widely used in computational geometry, where it is known for its simplicity and its observed speed. The theoretical study of ICP was initiated by Ezra, Sharir, and Efrat, who showed that the worst-case running time to align two sets of n points in R-d is between Omega(n log n) and O(n(2) d)d. We substantially tighten this gap by improving the lower bound to Omega(n/d)(d+1). To help reconcile this bound with the algorithm's observed speed, we also show that the smoothed complexity of ICP is polynomial, independent of the dimensionality of the data. Using similar methods, we improve the best known smoothed upper bound for the popular k-means method to n(O(k)), once again independent of the dimension.

To this end, we obtain small coresets for k-median and k-means clustering in general metric spaces and in Euclidean spaces. In R(d), these coresets are of size with polynomial dependency on the dimension d. This leads to (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithms to the optimal k-median and k-means clustering in Rd, with running time O(ndk + 2((k/epsilon)O(1)) d(2) log(k+2) n), where n is the number of points. This improves over previous results. We use those coresets to maintain a (1 + epsilon)-approximate k-median and k-means clustering of a stream of points in R(d), using O(d(2)k(2)epsilon(-2) log(8) n) space. These are the first streaming algorithms, for those problems, that have space complexity with polynomial dependency on the dimension.

Color and 3D depth map are used to segment hand regions. The hand trajectory will determine in further step using Mean-shift algorithm and Kalman filter to generate 3D dynamic features. Furthermore, k-means clustering algorithm is employed for the HMMs codewords. To spot meaningful gestures accurately, a non-gesture model is proposed, which provides confidence limit for the calculated likelihood by other gesture models. The confidence measures are used as an adaptive threshold for spotting meaningful gestures. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully recognize isolated gestures with 98.33% and meaningful gestures with 94.35% reliability for numbers (0-9).

Stochastic change detection in uncertain nonlinear systems using reduced-order models: classification	SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; DAMPERS; THEOREM	A reliable structural health monitoring methodology (SHM) is proposed to detect relatively small changes in uncertain nonlinear systems. A total of 4000 physical tests were performed using a complex nonlinear magneto-rheological (MR) damper. With the effective (or 'genuine') changes and uncertainties in the system characteristics of the semi-active MR damper, which were precisely controlled with known means and standard deviation of the input current, the tested MR damper was identified with the restoring force method (RFM), a non-parametric system identification method involving two-dimensional orthogonal polynomials. Using the identified RFM coefficients, both supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition techniques (including support vector classification and k-means clustering) were employed to detect system changes in the MR damper. The classification results showed that the identified coefficients with orthogonal basis function can be used as reliable indicators for detecting (small) changes, interpreting the physical meaning of the detected changes without a priori knowledge of the monitored system and quantifying the uncertainty bounds of the detected changes. The classification errors were analyzed using the standard detection theory to evaluate the performance of the developed SHM methodology. An optimal classifier design procedure was also proposed and evaluated to minimize type II (or 'missed') errors.

Following Setodji and Cook (2004), we made use of the k-means algorithm to cluster the observed response vectors. Our method was designed to recover the intra-cluster information and outperformed previous method with respect to estimation accuracies on both the central subspace and its dimension.

Coresets have found use in a vast host of geometric settings. We forge a link between coresets, and differentially private sanitizations that can answer any number of queries Without compromising privacy. We define the notion of private coresets, which are simultaneously both coresets and differentially private, and show how they may be constructed. We first show that the existence of a small coreset with low generalized sensitivity (i.e., replacing a single point ill the original point set slightly affects the quality of the coreset) implies (in an inefficient manner) the existence of a private coreset for the same queries, This greatly extends the works of Blunt, Ligett, and Roth [STOC 2008] and McSherry and Talwar [FOCS 2007]. We also give an efficient algorithm to compute private coresets for k-median and k-mean queries in R-d, immediately implying efficient differentially private sanitizations for such queries. Following McSherry and Talwar, this construction also gives efficient coalition proof (approximately dominant strategy) mechanisms for location problems. Unlike coresets which only have a Multiplicative approximation factor, we prove that private coresets must exhibit additive error. We present a new technique for showing lower bounds oil this error.

J	Meshgi, A; Khalili, D				Meshgi, Ali; Khalili, Davar			Comprehensive evaluation of regional flood frequency analysis by L- and LH-moments. I. A re-visit to regional homogeneity	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Regional homogeneity; Frequency analysis; LH-moments	PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED MOMENTS; OF-FIT TESTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; STATISTICS	As part I of a sequence of two papers, previously developed L-moments by Hosking (J R Stat Soc Ser B Methodol 52(2):105-124, 1990), and the LH-moments by Wang (Water Resour Res 33(12):2841-2848, 1997) are re-visited. New relationships are developed for regional homogeneity analysis by the LH-moments, and further establishment of regional homogeneity is investigated. Previous works of Hosking (J R Stat Soc Ser B Methodol 52(2):105-124, 1990) and Wang (Water Resour Res 33(12):2841-2848, 1997) on L-moments and LH-moments for the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution are extended to the generalized Pareto (GPA) and the generalized logistic (GLO) distributions. The Karkhe watershed, located in western Iran is used as a case study area. Regional homogeneity was investigated by first assuming the entire study area as one regional cluster. Then the entire study area was designated "homogeneous" by the L-moments (L); and was designated "heterogeneous" by all four levels of the LH-moments (L-1 to L-4). The k-means method was used to investigate the case of two regional clusters. All levels of the L- and LH-moments designated the upper watershed (region A), "homogeneous", and the lower watershed (region B) "possibly-homogeneous". The L-3 level of the GPA and the L-4 level of the GLO were selected for regions A and B, respectively. Wang (Water Resour Res 33(12):2841-2848, 1997) identified a reversing trend in improved performance of the GEV distribution at the LH-moments level of L-3 (during the goodness-of-fit test). Similar results were also obtained in this research for the GEV distribution. However, for the case of the GPA distribution the reversing trend started at L-4 for region A; and at L-2 for region B. As for the case of the GLO, an improved performance was observed for all levels (moving from L to L-4); for both regions.

To analyze the load of the distribution line using the data collected by the AMR system, this study suggested a method of generating a typical load profile based on the clustering method using the load data of customers. Currently, typical load profiles are usually generated by calculating the average power consumption as recorded every 15 minutes based on the load profiles of customers with the same contract code. Even though they share the same contract code, however, the load analysis has low accuracy because it often shows different load profiles. This study suggested a means of performing customer clustering and generating the typical load profile of each group using the k-means method as one of the clustering methods and 15-minute AMR data of customers sharing the same contract code.

Besides using classical methods in a two-stage classification setup, the method employs detailed data analysis, selection, and manipulation before each stage of classification to yield nearly zero false negative classification rate. The integration of data analysis methods within the structure of hybrid classification approach is the main strength of the proposed method.	[Prasad, Dilip Kumar; Quek, Chai; Leung, Maylor K.

This paper proposes a data perturbation technique for privacy preservation in k-means clustering. Data objects that have been partitioned into clusters using k-means clustering are perturbed by performing geometric transformations on the clusters in such a way that the object membership of each cluster and orientation of objects within a cluster remain the same. This geometric transformation is achieved through cluster rotation, i.e., every cluster is rotated about its own centroid. The clusters are first displaced away from the mean of the entire dataset so that no two clusters overlap after the subsequent cluster rotation. We analyze the privacy measure offered by this data perturbation technique and prove that a dataset perturbed by this method cannot be easily reverse engineered, yet is still relevant for cluster analysis.

The CNN-DM algorithm, which employs the divergence measure as its distance measure, is used for clustering of Gaussian Probability Distribution Function (GPDF) data. In comparison with other conventional algorithms, the CNN-DM designed for probability data has the robustness advantages. Furthermore, since the feature vectors of compressed video data are modelled by Gaussian Probability Density Function (GPDF), the classification procedure is performed by considering divergence distance as the distance measure of the proposed classifier.

Hyperspectral images are made up of contiguous wavebands in a given spectral band. These images provide information on the chemical make-up profile of objects, thus allowing the differentiation of objects of the same colour but which possess make-up profile. Yet, whatever the application field, most of the methods devoted to HIS processing conduct data analysis without taking into account spatial information. Pixels are processed individually, as an array of spectral data without any spatial structure. Standard classification approaches are thus widely used (k-means, fuzzy-c-means hierarchical classification...). Linear modelling methods such as Partial Least Square analysis (PLS) or non linear approaches like support vector machine (SVM) are also used at different scales (remote sensing or laboratory applications). However, with the development of high resolution sensors, coupled exploitation of spectral and spatial information to process complex images, would appear to be a very relevant approach. However, few methods are proposed in the litterature. The most recent approaches can be broadly classified in two main categories. The first ones are related to a direct extension of individual pixel classification methods using just the spectral dimension (k-means, fuzzy-c-means or FCM, Support Vector Machine or SVM). Spatial dimension is integrated as an additionnal classification parameter (Markov fields with local homogeneity constrainst [5], Support Vector Machine or SVM with spectral and spatial kernels combination [2], geometrically guided fuzzy C-means [3]...). The second ones combine the two fields related to each dimension (spectral and spatial), namely chemometric and image analysis. Various strategies have been attempted. The first one is to rely on chemometrics methods (Principal Component Analysis or PCA, Independant Component Analysis or ICA, Curvilinear Component Analysis...) to reduce the spectral dimension and then to apply standard images processing technics on the resulting score images i.e. data projection on a subspace. Another approach is to extend the definition of basic image processing operators to this new dimensionality (morphological operators for example [1, 4]). However, the approaches mentioned above tend to favour only one description either directly or indirectly (spectral or spatial). The purpose of this paper is to propose a hyperspectral processing approach that strikes a better balance in the treatment of both kinds of information. To achieve this, a generic scheme is proposed to associate more closely the spectral and spatial aspects symmetrically and conjunctively. This method, called butterfly, aims to perform an iterative and a cross analysis of data in the spectral and the spatial domains lead to the segmentation of the hyperspectral image. The strategy is based on two steps - Extraction of a spatial structure (topology) incorporating a spectral structure, - Extraction of a spectral structure (latent variables) incorporating a spatial structure, These steps are processed in a successive, iterative and inter-dependent way. In this article, we will focus solely on specific notions of topology i.e. the notions of connectivity and adjacency. Thus, the first stage deals with the use of commonly used image processing tools (region segmentation algorithms) on a limited number of score images. This makes it relatively easy to process. To carry out the second step, we use chemometric tools to reveal a subspace (latent variables) enabling the characterization of heterogeneity of the obtained image partitions. However, the scheme can be applied on two different ways depending on the region segmentation strategy used i.e. top down approaches (splitting) or bottom-up approaches (merging). We have implemented this scheme by using a split and merge strategy based on the quadtree approach. Each phase is done over successive steps (iterations). At each iteration of the split phase, the data are projected on k(1) suitable latent variables. The split of each existing region (partition) into four disjoints quadrants is tested and the one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen. At each iteration of the merge phase, the data are projected on k(2) suitable latent variables and all the merging of two adjacent regions are tested. The one maximising the Wilks Lambda parameter is chosen. Lastly, we tested our approach on a simple synthetic image to show more precisely its characteristics and also on two real images at different scales (in field acquisition on crop, remote sensing image of urban zone). The results obtained on real images underline the benefit of the butterfly approach. However, further work will be undertaken to investigate the influence of various parameters. Moreover, other topology notions and image analysis algorithm could be also investigated.

J	Ragot, N; Fortune, J; M'Bongo, P; Vincent, N; Cardot, H				Ragot, Nicolas; Fortune, Julie; M'Bongo, Paul; Vincent, Nicole; Cardot, Hubert			Evaluation of automatic classification of handwritten signatures for online authentication	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						Biometrics; handwritten signature; online authentication; clustering; Dynamic Time Warping	VERIFICATION	In online handwritten signature verification systems [PLAMONDON 89, LECLERC 94, JAIN 02], adaptation to a specific user or a group of users is a key point since the parameters that determine the acceptation or the rejection of a user are quite sensible. Indeed, biometric data are behavioral and not physical which makes them more variable. Moreover, few learning data are available and the biometric profile of a user can only be determined from a limited number of signature acquisitions. This is why, in the same way as it is done in handwriting recognition, we wanted to study both how classes of handwritten signatures can be automatically determined and what is the impact of these classes on a verification system. The verification system, on which this study is based, is not new itself. It is a Coarse To Fine approach that uses the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW)[WIROTIUS 05a]. This is a ligth system that was specifically designed to be embedded on smartphones or PDAs. During the enrolment step, 5 reference signatures are acquired from the user. One should notice here that the system forces the user to provide 5 signatures that are roughly of the same style (with similar total length and total duration). This is coherent with the database we used for our experiments and with the classification methods employed in our study. After the preprocessing (normalization - translation, rotation and scale - and removal of the unnecessary points: only the points with minimal local speed are kept [WIROTIUS 05b]), these signatures represent the biometric profile of the user. The authentication itself is based on the Coarse To Fine approach. In the coarse step, signatures that are too dissimilar from the profile are rejected. This assessment is peformed from a simple comparison based on the total length and the total duration of the signatures. For the signatures that are not rejected at this first step, a finer comparison is performed using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. The final acceptation or rejection of a signature depends on a threshold mu that is learnt from an experimental database to reach the equal error rate (EER). The main drawback of the previous system, considering its parameters, is the threshold mu. This is the reason why we tried to find an automatic mechanism to determine classes of signatures and to adapt the system (mu) to these classes. In fact, we used clustering algorithms and we studied the impact on the performances of the system of: the number of classes; the clustering feature space; the algorithm used. The process to determine the classes consists in using a clustering algorithm on a learning dataset that contains the biometric profiles of several signers. Then, for each of the k classes obtained, we find a local threshold mu(k) that enables to obtain the EER on the class k. Next, during the enrolment of a new signer, the class to which the signer belongs is considered to be the one in which most of the signatures of his profile are (this is why it is better that all signatures of the profile should be of the same style). The threshold that will be used during the authentication step is the one corresponding to that class. The experiments were performed using the SVC database using the leave-one-out protocol to learn the thresholds and to test the system on different data. Without using the classes of signatures, the system can achieve 1.94% of EER on this dataset.(1) We next conducted several experiments. Firstly, we used the K-means algorithm with several values for K and several feature subspaces based on the global characteristics of the signatures (static and dynamic). The results show that the EER can be decreased to 1.84% for some small values of K. For most of the feature subspaces used, over K = 3, the results are not interesting (equal or worse to those obtained with the original system). Moreover, the results do not seem to be stable depending on the value of K. In fact, observing the result of the clustering, it seems that for too many signers, the different signatures in their profile end up in different classes, not in a unique one, which indicates that the clustering is not stable, despite our constraint on the signatures of the profile. The best results considering the compromise between the EER performance and the stability of the clustering, i.e. the standard deviation of FAR and FRR - are obtained using the two principal axes (using a principal component analysis) and 2 classes. The second experiment was equivalent but using the fuzzy C-means instead of the K-means. The results show a great improvement in terms of stability of the clustering and a general improvement of the EER for small values of K. The best result was obtained using two classes and again the two principal axis. In this case, the EER fall to 1.66% which represents an improvement of 14.4%. Nevertheless, deeper studies of the results of the clustering show that we are still unable to find a classification that is valid for all signers: there are still signatures of a same signer that belong to different classes. This phenomenom of course increases with higher values of K. Then our perspectives are either to consider that a signer could belong to several classes (even if he always signs with the same style) or to operate several classifications, using different feature spaces, and to choose for a signer the most pertinent classification.

We choose to work in the Italian central Apennine intermountain basins because much human activities could mask this kind of landforms and because the timing of alluvial deposition is tied to land surface instabilities caused by regional climate changes. The main aim of the research is to understand where they form and where they extent in an effort to develop a new approach using the backscatter roughness parameters and primary attributes (elevation and curvature) derived from the SRTM DEM. Moreover, this study helps to provide a benchmark against which future alluvial fans detection using roughness and fuzzy logic analysis can be evaluated, meaning that sophisticated coupling of geomorphic and remote sensing processes can be attempted, in order to test for feedbacks between geomorphic processes and topography.

The population density was estimated using the pellet count method and the occurrence of pellets was used to evaluate the habitat use. The morphology of pellets was utilized with the K mean Fuzzy Clustering method to obtain three categories: I) young, II) adult male and III) adult female. We recorded the abundance, diversity and architecture of woody plant and then analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA), in order to detect de main factor of habitat and the heterogeinity. To evaluate differences between age-sex classes we used functional discriminate analysis (FDA). Population density obtained was 2.12 +/- 1.6 ind/km(2), the classification showed that 40 % of pellets was detected as young, the 40 % as female and 20 % as male. The PCA showed that main variables were associated with shrubs vegetation and exist a large suitable habitat for deer and FDA detected significant differences in sites between young and adult use with high density vegetation of shrubs. In terms of conservation it is important to have data on population density because it allows comparisons in monitoring activities; also it is important for starting to document how species respond within Units for Conservation and Sustainable Use Management.

While many published works have shown that GPUs can be used to accelerate various general purpose applications with respectable performance gains, Few attempts have been made to tackle very large problems. Our goal here is to investigate if GPUs can be useful accelerators even with very large data sets that cannot fit into GPU's onboard memory. Using a popular clustering algorithm, K-Means, as all example. our results have been very positive. On a data set with a billion data points. Our GPU-accelerated implementation achieved an order of magnitude performance gain over a highly optimized CPU-only version running on 8 cores, and more than two orders of magnitude gain over a popular benchmark, MineBench, running on a single core.

There are no known exact algorithms for solving these high-dimensional problems that are faster than linear search. Approximate algorithms are known to provide large speedups with only minor loss in accuracy, but many such algorithms have been published with only minimal guidance on selecting an algorithm and its parameters for any given problem. In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question, "What is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?" Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets. After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available software and provides fully automated parameter selection.

For the segmentation, different unsupervised clustering techniques are employed to partition the Computed Tomography (CT) brain images into three regions, which are the abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and brain matters. The novel segmentation method proposed is a dual level segmentation approach. The first level segmentation, which purpose is to acquire abnormal regions, uses the combination of fuzzy c-means (FCM) and k-means clustering. The second level segmentation performs either the expectation-maximization (EM) technique or the modified FCM with population-diameter independent (PDI) to segment the remaining intracranial area into CSF and brain matters. The system automatically determines which algorithm to be utilized in order to produce optimum results. The retrieval of the medical images is based on keywords such as "no abnormal region", "abnormal region(s) adjacent to the skull" and "abnormal region(s) not adjacent to the skull". Medical data from collaborating hospital are experimented and promising results are observed.

It is essential as manual annotation is time consuming especially for large databases and there is no standard captioning procedure because it is based on human perception. This paper discusses implementation of automatic image annotation using K-means clustering algorithm to annotate the colors with the appropriate words by using predefined colors. Experiments are conducted to identify the number of centroids, distance measures and initialization mode for the best clustering results. A prototype of an automatic image annotation is developed and then tested using thirty-five beach scenery photographs. Results showed that annotating image using evenly-spaced initialization mode and 100 centroids measured using City-Block distance function managed to achieve a commendable 75% precision rate.

Predictive analytics is the area of data mining concerned with forecasting probabilities and trends. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerns itself with intelligent behaviour, i.e. the things that make us seem intelligent. Following this process of thinking, in this work the main goal is the assessment of the impact of using AI based tools for the development of intelligent predictive models, in particular those that may be used to establish the conditions in which the levels of manganese and turbidity in water supply are high. Indeed, one of the main problems that the water treatment plant at Monte Novo (in Evora, Portugal) uncovers is the appearance of high levels of manganese and turbidity in treated water, which sometimes exceed the parametric values established in Portuguese Law, respectively 50 mu g dm(-3) and 4 NTU. In this study we tried to find answers to the above problem by building predictive models. The models we developed shall enable the prediction of manganese and turbidity levels in treated water, in order to ensure that the water supply does not affect public health in a negative way and obeys the current legislation. The software used in this study was the Clementine 11.1. The C5.0 Algorithm was also used as a means of introducing Decision Trees and the K-Means Algorithm was used to construct clustering models. The data in the database was collected from 2005 to 2006 and includes reservoir water quality data, treated water data and volumes of water stored in the reservoir.

A Decomposition-Based Algorithm for Flexible Flow Shop Scheduling with Stochastic Processing Times	WCECS 2009: WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, VOLS I AND II	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science	OCT 20-22, 2009	San Francisco, CA	Int Assoc Engineers		back propagation network; decomposition; flexible flow shop; neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm; stochastic processing times	ENVIRONMENT; ROBUST; NUMBER	Since real manufacturing is dynamic and tends to suffer a wide range of uncertainties, research on production scheduling with uncertainty has received much more attention recently. Although various approaches have been investigated on the scheduling problem with uncertainty, this problem is still difficult to be solved optimally by any single approach, because of its inherent difficulties. This paper considers makespan optimization of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem with stochastic processing times. It proposes a novel decomposition-based algorithm (DBA) to decompose an FFS into several clusters which can be solved more easily by different approaches. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to firstly group the machines of an FFS into an appropriate number of clusters, based on weighted cluster validity indices. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either the shortest processing time (SPT) or the genetic algorithm (GA) to generate a sub-schedule for each cluster. If two neighbouring clusters are allocated with the same approach, they are subsequently merged. After machine grouping and approach assignment, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the sub-schedules of the clusters. Computation results reveal that the proposed approach is superior to SPT and GA alone for FFS scheduling with stochastic processing times.	[Wang, K.; Choi, S.

With largely unstructured documents and an unknown number of people with the same name the problem presents many difficulties and challenges. This chapter treats the task of pet-son name disambiguation as a document clustering problem, where it is assumed that the documents represent particular people. This leads to the person Cluster hypothesis, which states that similar documents tend to represent the same person. Single Pass Clustering, k-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis are employed and empirically evaluated in this context. On the SemEval 2007 Web People Search it is shown that the person Cluster hypothesis holds reasonably well and that the Single Pass Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering methods provide the best performance.

It makes words as samples to train classifier, which can lead to positive and negative samples of classifier imbalance. Meanwhile, there is data sparseness problem of this method when the corpus is small. This paper doesn't classify event using word as samples, but cluster event in judging event types. It adopts self-similarity to convergence the value of K in K-means algorithm by the guidance of event triggers, and optimizes clustering algorithm. Then, combining with named entity and its comparative position information, the new method further make sure the pinpoint type of event. The new method avoids depending on template of event in tradition methods, and its result of event detection can well be used in automatic text summarization, text retrieval, and topic detection and tracking.

It is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem. It is similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians in that they both attempt to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. Bayesian rule is a theorem in probability theory named for Thomas Bayesian. It is used for updating probabilities by finding conditional probabilities given new data. In this paper, K-mean clustering algorithm and Bayesian classification are combined to analysis the credit card. The analysis result can be used to improve the accuracy.

To avoid the shortcomings of simulated annealing such as long computation time and low efficiency, a new data structure named sequence list is given.

Software Fault Prediction of Unlabeled Program Modules	WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING 2009, VOLS I AND II	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering 2009	JUL 01-03, 2009	London, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Engineers	Imperial Coll London	Clustering; metrics thresholds; software fault prediction; X-means clustering	ORIENTED DESIGN METRICS	Software metrics and fault data belonging to a previous software version are used to build the software fault prediction model for the next release of the software. Until now, different classification algorithms have been used to build this kind of models. However, there are cases when previous fault data are not present; and hence, supervised learning approaches cannot be applied. In this study, we propose a fully automated technique which does not require an expert during the prediction process. In addition, it is not required to identify the number of clusters before the clustering phase, as required by K-means clustering method. Software metrics thresholds are used to remove the expert necessity. Our technique first applies X-means clustering method to cluster modules and identifies the best cluster number. After this step, the mean vector of each cluster is checked against the metrics thresholds vector. A cluster is predicted as fault-prone if at least one metric of the mean vector is higher than the threshold value of that metric. In addition to X-means clustering-based method, we made experiments with pure metrics thresholds method, fuzzy clustering, and K-means clustering-based methods. Experiments reveal that unsupervised software fault prediction can be fully automated and effective results can be produced using X-means clustering with software metrics thresholds.

Improving the Accuracy and Efficiency of the k-means Clustering Algorithm	WORLD CONGRESS ON ENGINEERING 2009, VOLS I AND II	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering	JUL 01-03, 2009	London, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Engineers	Imperial Coll London	Data Analysis; Clustering; k-means Algorithm; Enhanced k-means Algorithm		Emergence of modern techniques for scientific data collection has resulted in large scale accumulation of data pertaining to diverse fields. Conventional database querying methods are inadequate to extract useful information from huge data banks. Cluster analysis is one of the major data analysis methods and the k-means clustering algorithm is widely used for many practical applications. But the original k-means algorithm is computationally expensive and the quality of the resulting clusters heavily depends on the selection of initial centroids. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for improving the performance of the k-means clustering algorithm. This paper proposes a method for making the algorithm more effective and efficient, so as to get better clustering with reduced complexity.	[Nazeer, K. A. Abdul; Sebastian, M.

There are different applications of load curves clustering in regulated and deregulated environment such as system analysis, load and price forecasting, distributed resource selection, better tariff design, etc. In this paper we evaluate performances of two clustering methods (WFA (Weighted Fuzzy Aver-age) K-means and Modified Follow the Leader) for load curves classification. For evaluation and comparison we use two adequacy measures (Mean Index Adequacy and Clustering Dispersion Indicator) that show distinction and compactness of clusters, respectively. A novel feature of this paper is that we evaluate performances of clustering algorithms on the basis of different applications on power system.	[Mahmoudi-Kohan, N.; Moghaddam, M.

The use of these figures is an important subject. In this study, we developed a method to classify these biomedical figures into categories using a combination of a bag of keypoints approach and a bag of words approach for the legends. For bag of keypoints, the descriptors of detected interest points are quantized by k-means clustering and are converted into a feature vector element. The figure classification is carried out using a one-against-all multi-class support vector machine. When the Harris-affine and extended scale-invariant feature transform method are used for interest point detection and feature description, respectively, the classification accuracy of bag of keypoints is about 20% better than that of field-level image descriptors which are similar to descriptors used in previous studies. Further, when bag of words for legends is combined with this method, the prediction performance achieved 75.7% classification accuracy. Introducing bag of keypoints not only increases the classification performance but also enables the figures to be treated as text words. This method is expected to be useful for figure similarity search and information retrieval across figures and text.

Subtypes in data that includes patients and controls could be associated with patient/control could associate with patient/control groupings. Testing for subtypes provides a non-parametric investigation of group differences. Cortical thickness maps, generated from magnetic resonance images of 96 patients with schizophrenia and 106 controls, were co-registered and corrected for age-related thinning. At multiple map locations, the number of (sub)types best explaining cortical thickness in the patients, the controls, and both combined was determined. Grey matter volumes of selected regions were measured. Both patients and controls, considered independently, were predominantly homogeneous in cortical thickness. The few bimodal regions were similar in both groups. The combined subjects' cortical thickness was bimodal over 34% of the cortical mantle and otherwise unimodal. Further probing of these bimodal regions showed that subjects tending to belong to thinner modes were significantly more likely to be patients, and grey matter volumes of most bimodal regions were significantly smaller in patients. The study found no subtypes specific to patients. It suggested, however, that associations between abnormally thin cortex and schizophrenia are more widespread than shown by previously published results based on significance testing.

Regional frequency analysis of precipitation using large-scale atmospheric variables	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INDIAN MONSOON RAINFALL; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; WATERSHEDS; PATTERNS; SPAIN; TIME	Effective estimates of the magnitude and frequency of precipitation are necessary for hydrological designs. However, often the available data at target site are inadequate to arrive at reliable estimates. Practicing hydrometeorologists overcome this impediment by pooling information at target site with that from other locations depicting similar characteristics of precipitation. To facilitate pooling of information, hydrometeorologists use regionalization approaches for partitioning sites in the study region into groups having similar precipitation characteristics. The conventional approaches to regionalization are based on statistics computed from observed precipitation, rather than attributes affecting hydrometeorology in a region. Therefore independent validation of the delineated regions for homogeneity in precipitation was not possible. To address this issue, a new approach is proposed. Large-scale atmospheric variables affecting the precipitation in study region and location attributes are suggested as features for regionalization by K-means cluster analysis. This allows independent validation of the identified regions for homogeneity using statistics computed from the observed precipitation. The summer monsoon rainfall ( SMR) regions that are currently in use by India Meteorological Department ( IMD) are shown to be heterogeneous. Subsequently the effectiveness of the proposed approach to regionalization is illustrated through application to India for delineating new SMR regions. Frequency distributions are identified to fit rainfall in the regions using L-moment-based goodness-of-fit test. Error in rainfall quantile estimates for the new regions is found to be significantly less than that estimated for the IMD SMR regions. The results show that the proposed approach to regional frequency analysis of precipitation is promising.	[Satyanarayana, P.; Srinivas, V.

J	Liu, H; Weng, QH; Gaines, D				Liu, Hua; Weng, Qihao; Gaines, David			Spatio-temporal analysis of the relationship between WNV dissemination and environmental variables in Indianapolis, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							WEST-NILE-VIRUS; LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CULEX-PIPIENS DIPTERA; CULICIDAE; HEALTH	Background: This study developed a multi-temporal analysis on the relationship between West Nile Virus (WNV) dissemination and environmental variables by using an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS, and statistical techniques. WNV mosquito cases in seven months (April-October) of the six years (2002-2007) were collected in Indianapolis, USA. Epidemic curves were plotted to identify the temporal outbreaks of WNV. Spatial-temporal analysis and k-mean cluster analysis were further applied to determine the high-risk areas. Finally, the relationship between environmental variables and WNV outbreaks were examined by using Discriminant Analysis. Results: The results show that the WNV epidemic curve reached its peak in August for all years in the study area except in 2007, where the peak was reached in July. WNV dissemination started from the central longitudinal corridor of the city and spread out to the east and west. Different years and seasons had different high-risk areas, but the southwest and southeast corners show the highest risk for WNV infection due to their high percentages of agriculture and water sources. Conclusion: Major environmental factors contributing to the outbreak of WNV in Indianapolis were the percentages of agriculture and water, total length of streams, and total size of wetlands. This study provides important information for urban public health prevention and management. It also contributes to the optimization of mosquito control and arrangement of future sampling efforts.

Then the KPCA and KICA for multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) are improved. The drawbacks of original KPCA and KICA are as follows: The data mapped into feature space become redundant; linear data introduce errors while the kernel trick is used; computation time increases with the number of samples. To solve the above problems, the original KPCA and KICA for MSPM are improved: similarity factors of the observed data in the input and feature space are defined; similar characteristics are measured; similar data are removed according to the similarity measurements; and k-means clustering in feature space is used to isolate different classes. Specifically, the similarity concept of data in one group is first proposed. Applications of the proposed approach indicate that improved KPCA and KICA effectively capture the nonlinearities.

H.; Sherman, Stephanie L.; Feingold, Eleanor			Smarter clustering methods for SNP genotype calling	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENETIC ASSOCIATION; LARGE-SCALE; ALGORITHM; MICROARRAYS; ARRAYS; ERRORS; POWER	Motivation: Most genotyping technologies for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers use standard clustering methods to 'call' the SNP genotypes. These methods are not always optimal in distinguishing the genotype clusters of a SNP because they do not take advantage of specific features of the genotype calling problem. In particular, when family data are available, pedigree information is ignored. Furthermore, prior information about the distribution of the measurements for each cluster can be used to choose an appropriate model-based clustering method and can significantly improve the genotype calls. One special genotyping problem that has never been discussed in the literature is that of genotyping of trisomic individuals, such as individuals with Down syndrome. Calling trisomic genotypes is a more complicated problem, and the addition of external information becomes very important. Results: In this article, we discuss the impact of incorporating external information into clustering algorithms to call the genotypes for both disomic and trisomic data. We also propose two new methods to call genotypes using family data. One is a modi. cation of the K-means method and uses the pedigree information by updating all members of a family together. The other is a likelihood-based method that combines the Gaussian or beta-mixture model with pedigree information. We compare the performance of these two methods and some other existing methods using simulation studies. We also compare the performance of these methods on a real dataset generated by the Illumina platform (www.illumina.com).

J	French, S; Rosenberg, M; Knuiman, M				French, Sarah; Rosenberg, Michael; Knuiman, Matthew			The clustering of health risk behaviours in a Western Australian adult population	HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						Health behaviours; clustering	LIFE-STYLE FACTORS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PATTERNS; ADOLESCENT; INTERRELATIONSHIPS; ASSOCIATIONS	Issue Addressed: Human behaviours influence health. Most people partake in numerous behaviours that increase their risk of chronic disease. For years health promotion interventions have been changing behaviour to improve health. While it is known that most people exhibit more than one health risk behaviour, it is not clear if health behaviours occur in patterns within population subgroups. This paper aims to explore the clustering patterns of six health risk behaviours among Australian adults. Methods: Data collected from four (1992, 1994, 1998 and 2002) community-based surveys were used to explore the relationships between a variety of health risk behaviours. The behaviours included were smoking, unsafe alcohol consumption, low fruit consumption, low vegetable consumption, insufficient physical activity and poor sun protection practices. The sample comprised 8,668 West Australian residents aged 16-69 years. A k-means cluster analysis was used to determine groups of people with similar health behaviours. Results: Four health risk behaviour clusters were identified, one overall health promoting 'Safe', two 'Risky' and one 'Moderate' (mix of healthy and unhealthy behaviours). These health behaviour clusters were distinguishable by demographic characteristics, where by women aged 40 years and older on high incomes were most likely to be part of the 'Safe' cluster, younger people the risky smoker cluster and older men the risky drinker cluster. Conclusion: The results of this study support the idea that people exhibit on average three risky health behaviours and that these behaviours inter-relate. The results further suggest that sub-groups in the study population were differentiated by the type of risky health behaviours they exhibit.

As Pareto optimal front produces a set of optimal solutions, the trends of objective functions with design variables are predicted by hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The problem is defined by three non-dimensional geometric design variables composed of dimpled channel height, dimple print diameter, dimple spacing, and dimple depth, to maximize heat transfer rate compromising with pressure drop. Twenty designs generated by Latin hypercube sampling were evaluated by Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver and the evaluated objectives were used to construct Pareto optimal front through hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The optimum designs were grouped by k-means clustering technique and some of the clustered points were evaluated by flow analysis. With increase in dimple depth, heat transfer rate increases and at the same time pressure drop also increases, while opposite behavior is obtained for the dimple spacing. The heat transfer performance is related to the vertical motion of the flow and the reattachment length in the dimple.

J	Liu, HH				Liu, Honghai			A Fuzzy Qualitative Framework for Connecting Robot Qualitative and Quantitative Representations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy qualitative reasoning; fuzzy robotics; hybrid representation	KINEMATICS; RECOGNITION; NETWORK; SYSTEM	This paper proposes a novel framework for describing articulated robot kinematics motion with the goal of providing a unified representation by combining symbolic or qualitative functions and numerical sensing and control tasks in the context of intelligent robotics. First, fuzzy qualitative robot kinematics that provides theoretical preliminaries for the proposed robot motion representation is revisited. Second, a fuzzy qualitative framework based on clustering techniques is presented to connect numerical and symbolic robot representations. Built on the k - AGOP operator (an extension of the ordered weighted aggregation operators), k-means and Gaussian functions are adapted to model a multimodal density of fuzzy qualitative kinematics parameters of a robot in both Cartesian and joint spaces; on the other hand, a mixture regressor and interpolation method are employed to convert Gaussian symbols into numerical values. Finally, simulation results in a PUMA 560 robot demonstrated that the proposed method effectively provides a two-way connection for robot representations used for both numerical and symbolic robotic tasks.

Time-Frequency Analysis for Efficient Fault Diagnosis and Failure Prognosis for Interior Permanent-Magnet AC Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Choi-Williams; intermittent fault detection; multiple discrimination analysis (MDA); permanent-magnet ac (PMAC) drives; short-time courier transform (STFT); undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT); Wigner distribution		The detection of noncatastrophic faults in conjunction with other factors can be used to determine the remaining life of an electric drive. As the frequency and severity of these faults increase, the working life of the drive decreases, leading to eventual failure. In this paper, four methods to identify developing electrical faults are presented and compared. They are based on the short-time Fourier transform, undecimated-wavelet analysis, and Wigner and Choi-Williams distributions of the field-oriented currents in permanent-magnet ac drives. The different fault types are classified using the linear-discriminant classifier and k-means classification. The comparison between the different methods is based on the number of correct classifications and Fisher's discriminant ratio. Multiple-class discrimination analysis is also introduced to remove redundant information and minimize storage requirements.

A potential application of the proposed microarray imaging is assay analysis of gene, protein, antigen, and antibody targets. This imaging is performed using a wide-field fluorescence microscope. We first describe our problem of interest and the pertinent measurement model by assuming additive Gaussian noise. We use a 3-D Gaussian point-spread-function (PSF) model to represent the blurring of the widefield microscope system. We employ parametric spheres to represent the light intensity profiles of the q-dot-encoded microparticles. We then develop the estimation algorithm for the single-sphere-object image assuming that the microscope PSF is totally unknown. The algorithm is tested numerically and compared with the analytical Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB). To apply our analysis to real data, we first segment a section of the blurred 3-D image of the multiple microparticles using a k-means clustering algorithm, obtaining 3-D images of single-sphere-objects. Then, we process each of these images using our proposed estimation technique. In the numerical examples, our method outperforms the blind deconvolution (BD) algorithms in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images. For the case of real data, our method and the BD-based methods perform similarly for the well-separated microparticle images.

Damage monitoring by acoustic emission: application of multiparameter analysis to the thermal shock of refractory material in industry-like surrounding	INDUSTRIAL CERAMICS			English	Article							COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; TIME	Acoustic Emission (AE) can be used to discriminate the different types of damage occurring in a constrained material. However, in industrial surrounding the main problem associated with data analysis is the discrimination between the noises and the acoustic emission signals. The goal of our paper was to differentiate between air flow and AE signals produced by the material during thermal shock of a refractory material in a pseudo-industrial surrounding with multiparameter analysis. The clustering of AE data corrupted by noise was successfully achieved by the k-means method.

Distribution learning for radio network planning tool simulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						distribution learning; network planning; independent component analysis; neural networks; clustering; measurements	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS	We propose a novel method that combines the simulation results Of a model-based prediction tool with the knowledge contained in measurement data. This mixture of the a priori information and the posteriori knowledge aims at enhancing the prediction results by increasing their precision and quality. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to learn the mapping between the distributions of the measurement data and the simulation data. To make the complexity of the MLP tractable, we propose the utilization Of independent component analysis (ICA). The ICA transformation makes the variables at the input of the MLP statistically independent so that it can perform its learning and generalization oil individual one-dimensional distributions. Other contributions consist of the application of the k-means clustering algorithm on the incoming data and the use of the training data world model to enhance the generalization capability of the MLP. The world model consists of the aggregation of all the available data in the learning space. The proposed method is applied to a third generation mobile network to enhance the predictions of uplink and downlink base station loads. After a training performed on a given network configuration, mechanical antenna tilts are modified and we show that the results obtained by the Supervised predictions are much closer to measurements than simulation results for cases that have not been encountered before.

J	Frahling, G; Sohler, C				Frahling, Gereon; Sohler, Christian			A FAST k-MEANS IMPLEMENTATION USING CORESETS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry	JUN 05-07, 2006	Sedona, AZ	ACM		Computational geometry; clustering algorithms; approximation algorithms; algorithm engineering	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM	In this paper we develop an efficient implementation for a k-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm is based on a combination of Lloyd's algorithm with random swapping of centers to avoid local minima. This approach was proposed by Mount (30). The novel feature of our algorithms is the use of coresets to speed up the algorithm. A coreset is a small weighted set of points that approximates the original point set with respect to the considered problem. We use a coreset construction described in (12). Our algorithm first computes a solution on a very small coreset. Then in each iteration the previous solution is used as a starting solution on a refined, i.e. larger, coreset. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm we compare it with algorithm KMHybrid (30) on typical 3D data sets for an image compression application and on artificially created instances. Our data sets consist of 300; 000 to 4.9 million points. Our algorithm outperforms KMHybrid on most of these input instances. Additionally, the quality of the solutions computed by our algorithm deviates significantly less than that of KMHybrid. We conclude that the use of coresets has two effects. First, it can speed up algorithms significantly. Secondly, in variants of Lloyd's algorithm, it reduces the dependency on the starting solution and thus makes the algorithm more stable. Finally, we propose the use of coresets as a heuristic to approximate the average silhouette coefficient of clusterings. The average silhouette coefficient is a measure for the quality of a clustering that is independent of the number of clusters k. Hence, it can be used to compare the quality of clusterings for different sizes of k. To show the applicability of our approach we computed clusterings and approximate average silhouette coefficient for k = 1,...,100 for our input instances and discuss the performance of our algorithm in detail.

The set of feature vectors with mixed features is mapped to a set of feature vectors with only real valued components with the condition that the new set of vectors has the same proximity matrix as the original feature vectors.

J	Nettleton, D; Baeza-Yates, R				Nettleton, David; Baeza-Yates, Ricardo			Web Retrieval: Techniques for the Aggregation and Selection of Queries and Answers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							ALGORITHM	In this paper we present a set of techniques for grouping and aggregating queries and search results, in the context of an Internet "search engine." (1) In the case of the initial grouping of the queries. we consider the Fuzzy c-Means(1) and Kohonen SOM2 techniques. It is proposed that FCM may be more adequate than k-Means(3) for the grouping of certain data types. We evaluate how we can use FCM to calculate the fuzzy membership grades for a set of Web queries and their corresponding results. (2) In the case of the aggregation of data from different information sources (the clustering techniques), we will consider weighted ordered weighted averaging (WOWA).(4) WOWA is used to choose the most adequate cluster and to identify the historical query in that cluster, which is most similar to a new query. We will see that the WOWA operator offers a wide flexibility for data processing. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Huang, SG				Huang, Shuguang			Classification of Cell Subpopulations Using Multiple Cellular Parameters from High-Content Imaging Studies	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						high-content imaging; cell cycle; multivariate; classification; clustering	ASSAY	Cell samples from in vitro studies are almost never uniform; individual cells of a population may differ with respect to their developmental stage, phase in the cell cycle, state of transfection, or by natural variability. Therefore, a sample of cells is usually composed of several subcategories that depend on the experiment setting and research interest. A critical interest of much molecular research is to deconvolute the mixture population and quantitatively assess the subcategories by their proportions in the cell population. In this research, subpopulation classification analysis using the simultaneous analysis of multiple cellular parameters is proposed. In particular, an iterative K-means clustering algorithm is used to establish subpopulation fingerprints, which are then used to classify unknown cell samples by support vector machines. The analyses demonstrate that the multivariate subpopulation analysis is statistically powerful and biologically relevant.

J	Eitzen, ZA; Xu, KM; Wong, T				Eitzen, Zachary A.; Xu, Kuan-Man; Wong, Takmeng			Statistical Analyses of Satellite Cloud Object Data from CERES. Part V: Relationships between Physical Properties of Marine Boundary Layer Clouds	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							1998 EL-NINO; TROPICAL WESTERN PACIFIC; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; MICROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS; AEROSOL RETRIEVALS; MODEL SIMULATIONS; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; RADIATION; VALIDATION	Relationships between physical properties are studied for three types of marine boundary layer cloud objects identified with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) footprint data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite between 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N. Each cloud object is a contiguous region of CERES footprints that have cloud-top heights below 3 km, and cloud fractions of 99%-100% (overcast type), 40%-99% (stratocumulus type), or 10%-40% (shallow cumulus type). These cloud fractions represent the fraction of similar to 2 km x 2 km Visible/Infrared Scanner pixels that are cloudy within each similar to 10 km x 10 km footprint. The cloud objects have effective diameters that are greater than 300 km for the overcast and stratocumulus types, and greater than 150 km for the shallow cumulus type. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated between many microphysical/optical [effective radius (r(e)), cloud optical depth (tau), albedo, liquid water path, and shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SW CRF)] and macrophysical [outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), cloud fraction, cloud-top temperature, longwave cloud radiative forcing (LW CRF), and sea surface temperature (SST)] properties for each of the three cloud object types. When both physical properties are of the same category (microphysical/optical or macrophysical), the magnitude of the correlation tends to be higher than when they are from different categories. The magnitudes of the correlations also change with cloud object type, with the correlations for overcast and stratocumulus cloud objects tending to be higher than those for shallow cumulus cloud objects. Three pairs of physical properties are studied in detail, using a k-means cluster analysis: r(e) and tau, OLR and SST, and LW CRF and SW CRF. The cluster analysis of r(e) and tau reveals that for each of the cloud types, there is a cluster of cloud objects with negative slopes, a cluster with slopes near zero, and two clusters with positive slopes. The joint OLR and SST probability plots show that the OLR tends to decrease with SST in regions with boundary layer clouds for SSTs above approximately 298 K. When the cloud objects are split into "dry" and "moist" clusters based on the amount of precipitable water above 700 hPa, the associated OLRs increase with SST throughout the SST range for the dry clusters, but the OLRs are roughly constant with SST for the moist cluster. An analysis of the joint PDFs of LW CRF and SW CRF reveals that while the magnitudes of both LW and SW CRFs generally increase with cloud fraction, there is a cluster of overcast cloud objects that has low values of LW and SW CRF. These objects are generally located near the Sahara Desert, and may be contaminated with dust. Many of these overcast objects also appear in the re and tau cluster with negative slopes.

J	Xie, B				Xie Bin			Web mining based on chaotic social evolutionary programming algorithm	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article						web clustering; chaotic social evolutionary programming; K-means algorithm		With an aim to the fact that the K-means clustering algorithm usually ends in local optimization and is hard to harvest global optimization, a new web clustering method is presented based on the chaotic social evolutionary programming (CSEP) algorithm. This method brings up the manner of that a cognitive agent inherits a paradigm in clustering to enable the cognitive agent to acquire a chaotic mutation operator in the betrayal. As proven in the experiment, this method can not only effectively increase web clustering efficiency, but it can also practically improve the precision of web clustering.

Spatial and temporal distributions of water density, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon) and chlorophyll a are presented. Multivariate methods such as fuzzy k-means, self-organising maps and cluster analysis were used to identify the different water masses and to characterise the temporal and spatial variability of the main biogeochemical features present in the area. The results confirm that the Po River outflows and the meteorological forcing factors are the main components triggering the alternation of stratification and mixing of the water column and that strongly affect the trophic state of the basin. In general, oligotrophic conditions dominate, and were more pronounced offshore, but mesotrophy occurred episodically in May 2004 and July 2005, when phytoplankton blooms were observed concomitant with vertical stability of the water column. A marked interannual variability was also observed, supporting the importance of maintaining long-term observations of the basin.

In this work, a two-dimensional LF segmentation algorithm adapted to interstitial pneumonia (IP) patterns is presented. The algorithm employs k-means clustering followed by a filling operation to obtain an initial LF order estimate. The final LF border is obtained by an iterative support vector machine neighborhood labeling of border pixels based on gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics features. A second feature set based on gray level averaging and gradient features was also investigated to evaluate its effect on segmentation performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of 22 HRCT cases spanning a range of IP patterns such as ground glass, reticular, and honeycombing. The accuracy of the method is assessed using area overlap and shape differentiation metrics (d(mean), d(rms), and d(max)), by comparing automatically derived lung borders to manually traced ones, and further compared to a gray level thresholding-based (GLT-based) method. Accuracy of the methods evaluated is also compared to interobserver variability. The proposed method incorporating gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics demonstrated the highest segmentation accuracy, averaged over left and right LFs (overlap=0.954, d(mean)=1.080 mm, d(rms)=1.407 mm, and d(max)=4.944 mm), which is statistically significant (two-tailed student's t test for paired data, p < 0.0083) with respect to all metrics considered as compared to the proposed method incorporating gray level averaging and gradient features (overlap=0.918, d(mean)=2.354 mm, d(rms)=3.711 mm, and d(max)=14.412 mm) and the GLT-based method (overlap=0.897, d(mean)=3.618 mm, d(rms)=5.007 mm, and d(max)=16.893 mm). The performance of the three segmentation methods, although decreased as IP pattern severity level (mild, moderate, and severe) was increased, did not demonstrate statistically significant difference (two-tailed student's t test for unpaired data, p>0.0167 for all metrics considered). Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method, based on gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics ranges within interobserver variability.

J	Jenssen, R; Eltoft, T				Jenssen, Robert; Eltoft, Torbjorn			A new information theoretic analysis of sum-of-squared-error kernel clustering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Information theory; Renyi entropy; Sum-of-squared-error clustering; K-means; Mercer kernels; Parzen windowing		The contribution of this paper is to provide a new input space analysis of the properties of sum-of-squared-error K-means clustering performed in a Mercer kernel feature space. Such an analysis has been missing until now, even though kernel K-means has, been popular in the clustering literature. Our derivation extends the theory of traditional K-means from properties of mean vectors to information theoretic properties of Parzen window estimated probability density functions (pdfs). In particular, Euclidean distance-based kernel K-means is shown to maximize an integrated squared error divergence measure between cluster pdfs and the overall pdf of the data, while a cosine similarity-based approach maximizes a Cauchy-Schwarz divergence measure. Furthermore, the iterative rules which assign data points to clusters in order to maximize these criteria are shown to depend on the cluster pdfs evaluated at the data points, in addition to the Renyi entropies of the clusters. The Bayes rule is shown to be a special case. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The system consists of a constrained K-Means clustering algorithm and an image recognition neural network. For finding similarity between images we use a novel image similarity measure and introduce a new image cluster validity measure to determine the most probable number of clusters.

A granular-oriented development of functional radial basis function neural networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Functional neuron; Local models; Receptive fields; Fuzzy clustering; Context-based fuzzy clustering; Information granules	RBF NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE	In this study, we develop a design methodology for generalized radial basis function neural networks. In contrast with the plethora of existing approaches, here we promote a development strategy in which a topology of the network is predominantly based upon a collection of information granules formed on a basis of available experimental data. The output space is granulated making use of the K-means clustering while the input space is clustered with the aid of a so-called context-based fuzzy clustering. The number of information granules produced for each context is adjusted so that we satisfy a certain reconstructability criterion that helps us minimize an error between the original data and the ones resulting from their reconstruction involving prototypes of the clusters and the corresponding membership values. In contrast to "standard" radial basis function neural networks, the output neuron of the network exhibits a certain functional nature as its connections are realized its local linear or quadratic functions whose location is determined by the values of the context and the prototypes in the input space. The other parameters of these local functions are subject to further parametric optimization. Numeric examples involve sonic low-dimensional synthetic data and selected data coming from the Machine Learning repository. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On clustering tree structured data with categorical nature	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; (dis)similarity measures; data mining	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Clustering consists in partitioning a set of objects into disjoint and homogeneous clusters. For many years, clustering methods have been applied in a wide variety of disciplines and they also have been utilized in many scientific areas. Traditionally, clustering methods deal with numerical data, i.e. objects represented by a conjunction of numerical attribute Values. However, nowadays commercial or scientific databases Usually contain categorical data, i.e. objects represented by categorical attributes. In this paper we present a dissimilarity measure which is capable to deal with tree structured categorical data. Thus, it can be used for extending the various versions of the very popular k-means clustering algorithm to deal with Such data. We discuss how such an extension can be achieved. Moreover, we empirically prove that the proposed dissimilarity measure is accurate, compared to other well-known (dis)similarity measures for categorical data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lai, JZC; Liaw, YC				Lai, Jim Z. C.; Liaw, Yi-Ching			Improvement of the k-means clustering filtering algorithm	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						k-means clustering; nearest-neighbor search; knowledge discovery	VECTOR QUANTIZATION; CODEBOOK GENERATION	In this paper, we present a modified filtering algorithm (MFA) by making use of center variations to speed up clustering process. Our method first divides clusters into static and active groups. We use the information of cluster displacements to reject unlikely cluster centers for all nodes in the kd-tree. We reduce the computational complexity of filtering algorithm (FA) through finding candidates for each node mainly from the set of active cluster centers. Two conditions for determining the set of candidate cluster centers for each node from active clusters are developed. Our approach is different from the major available algorithm, which passes no information from one stage of iteration to the next. Theoretical analysis shows that our method can reduce the computational complexity, in terms of the number of distance calculations, of FA at each stage of iteration by a factor of FC/AC, where FC and AC are the numbers of total clusters and active clusters, respectively. Compared with the FA, our algorithm can effectively reduce the computing time and number of distance calculations. It is noted that our proposed algorithm can generate the same clusters as that produced by hard k-means clustering. The superiority of our method is more remarkable when a larger data set with higher dimension is used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A subsequent dynamic programming recursion is applied to optimally subdivide the object set subject to the order constraint. We show that although the usual K-means sum-of-squared-error criterion is not guaranteed to be minimal, a true underlying cluster structure may be more accurately recovered. Also, substantive interpretability seems generally improved when constrained solutions are considered. We illustrate the procedure with several data sets from the literature.

Quantification of Sexual Steroid Hormones in Faeces of Iberian Wolf (Canis lupus signatus): A Non-invasive Sex Typing Method	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							FECAL MARKING BEHAVIOR; WHITE-TAILED DEER; PROGESTERONE METABOLITES; SERUM PROGESTERONE; ADRENAL ACTIVITY; CERVUS-ELAPHUS; DNA ANALYSIS; EXCRETION; IDENTIFICATION; ESTRADIOL	The determination of gender in wild animals is essential for behavioural and ecological studies, and also for conservation. The objectives of this study were (i) the determination of gender in faecal samples of Iberian wolf based on the differential concentrations of sexual steroid hormones (SSH) and (ii) to analyse the profiles of SSH in males and females (considering the gender determination carried out previously) during the non-reproductive and reproductive periods. The quantification of androgens (testosterone, T), progestin (progesterone, P) and oestrogen (oestradiol, E) was conducted by means of enzyme immunoassay. The k-means conglomerate analysis showed that the 59 faecal samples grouped into three different conglomerates, considering SSH levels. Groups 1 and 2 showed higher levels of T than group 3. Therefore, the faecal samples included in groups 1 and 2 (17 samples) corresponded to males and those of group 3 (42 samples) to females. The levels of T + P + E and T/P were higher in the group of males than in the group of females. The results of this study also showed that levels of T in males were higher during the reproductive period than in the non-reproductive period. However, the concentrations of P and E turned out to be higher during the non-reproductive season. In females, the levels of the three hormones (T, P and E) were higher during the reproductive period.	[Silvan, G.; Illera, M. J.; Illera, J.

Altogether one hundred and six groundwater samples were collected from? twenty six karst springs emerging from Own R ani aquifer and three wells tapping Amman-Wadi As Sir aquifer and investigated for NO(3)(-) concentrations. Results showed that NO(3)(-) concentration in spring water ranged from 8 to 192 mg/L with an average of 33 mg/L Seventy seven percent of the samples collected from the springs had nitrate concentrations exceeding the threshold value of 20 mg/L of anthropogenic source, and eight percent of the samples collected had nitrate concentrations higher than 50 mg/L, the maximum acceptable nitrate concentration for drinking water: About eight); percent of the sampled springs had nitrate concentrations higher than 20 mg/L. The K-means cluster analysis performed on the collected samples revealed the presence of three major clusters. The data were processed for the possible presence of discordant outliers using the unpublished computer program UDASYS by Verma and Diaz-Gonzalez. There is a wide spatial variation in the nitrate concentration in spring water Monitoring the water quality of these springs showed that the lowest concentrations of nitrate were found in the wet season (January. February, and December), while the highest concentrations were found in the dry season (August, September). Nitrate concentration in Amman-Wadi As Sir aquifer ranges from <1 mg/L to 19.2 mg/L, with an average of 9.8 mg/L. Untreated domestic wastewater is most probably the major source of the nitrate in the spring water as the study area is not served with sewer system, and domestic wastewater is collected in cesspools dug it? the kartsed Umm R jam Formation. Moreover in the area under consideration there are no major industries or intensive agricultural activities. The results of this study, are useful to highlight one of the most important environmental problems, namely the degradation of the water quality, and may.), serve to alert and encourage local and national authorities to take substantial steps and actions to protect and manage water quality.

Automatic Detection of Perfusion Deficits with Bolus Harmonic Imaging	ULTRASCHALL IN DER MEDIZIN			German	Article						brain; ultrasound; contrast agents; ischemia/infarction; image manipulation/reconstruction	ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CEREBRAL PERFUSION; BRAIN PERFUSION; TECHNOLOGY	Purpose: The diagnosis of ischemic stroke relies increasingly on the usage of ultrasound-based methods. One of the recent methods is the transcranial, contrast agent-based Bolus Harmonic Imaging (BHI) method. The captured image sequence is manually examined by clinical experts thus resulting in a time-consuming procedure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate three different methods to analyze BHI image sequences automatically for the detection of ischemic brain tissue. Materials and Method: BHI captures an image sequence that provides information on the dynamic behavior of the ultrasound contrast agents. This image sequence is analyzed using three different procedures. First a system relying on expert knowledge is used to determine perfusion defects. This procedure requires parametric images, which are previously extracted from the image sequence. The parameter images are then categorized by an unsupervised classification method in well-perfused and ischemic tissue by regarding the parametric images as features describing the perfusion. Thirdly, the whole image sequence can be interpreted as a pixel-by-pixel behavior out of contrast agents. The dynamic curve of each pixel can be automatically classified as perfused and ischemic tissue by the K-Means method without extracting parametric images. In all three cases a closing step is necessary for the accurate interpretation of the results. Transcranial ultrasound imaging produces typical stripe artifacts that have to be detected and eliminated. A result image is then created and provides a conclusion about perfusion reduction in brain tissue. Results: All three methods have been validated on the basis of 26 patients by clinical experts. The segmentation on the contrast agent kinetics has proven to be most effective. According to our patient database, it provides the highest detection accuracy, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusion: The presented methods seem to be adequate for detecting ischemic brain tissue. The classification of contrast agent kinetics provides the best results and has further advantages. It is robust with respect to noise and the calculation is fast because the extraction of parametric images is omitted. The very high sensitivity and specificity Must be validated in a larger patient population. Reliable and automated detection of perfusion defects at the bedside seems to be possible.

J	Greybush, SJ; Haupt, SE; Young, GS				Greybush, Steven J.; Haupt, Sue Ellen; Young, George S.			The Regime Dependence of Optimally Weighted Ensemble Model Consensus Forecasts of Surface Temperature	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							MESOSCALE; WEATHER	Previous methods for creating consensus forecasts weight individual ensemble members based upon their relative performance over the previous N days, implicitly making a short-term persistence assumption about the underlying flow regime. A postprocessing scheme in which model performance is linked to underlying weather regimes could improve the skill of deterministic ensemble model consensus forecasts. Here, principal component analysis of several synoptic-and mesoscale fields from the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset provides an objective means for characterizing atmospheric regimes. Clustering techniques, including K-means and a genetic algorithm, are developed that use the resulting principal components to distinguish among the weather regimes. This pilot study creates a weighted consensus from 48-h surface temperature predictions produced by the University of Washington Mesoscale Ensemble, a varied-model (differing physics and parameterization schemes) multianalysis ensemble with eight members. Different optimal weights are generated for each weather regime. A second regime-dependent consensus technique uses linear regression to predict the relative performance of the ensemble members based upon the principal components. Consensus forecasts obtained by the regime-dependent schemes are compared using cross validation with traditional N-day ensemble consensus forecasts for four locations in the Pacific Northwest, and show improvement over methods that rely on the short-term persistence assumption.

Our goal is to enable many thousands of entities to be visualized meaningfully and with high performance. Results: We present a new visualization tool, Arena3D, which introduces a new concept of staggered layers in 3D space. Related data - such as proteins, chemicals, or pathways - can be grouped onto separate layers and arranged via layout algorithms, such as Fruchterman-Reingold, distance geometry, and a novel hierarchical layout. Data on a layer can be clustered via k-means, affinity propagation, Markov clustering, neighbor joining, tree clustering, or UPGMA ('unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean'). A simple input format defines the name and URL for each node, and defines connections or similarity scores between pairs of nodes. The use of Arena3D is illustrated with datasets related to Huntington's disease.

While bioinformaticians have proposed new clustering methods that take advantage of characteristics of the gene expression data, the medical community has a preference for using "classic" clustering methods. There have been no studies thus far performing a large-scale evaluation of different clustering methods in this context. Results/Conclusion: We present the first large-scale analysis of seven different clustering methods and four proximity measures for the analysis of 35 cancer gene expression data sets. Our results reveal that the finite mixture of Gaussians, followed closely by k-means, exhibited the best performance in terms of recovering the true structure of the data sets. These methods also exhibited, on average, the smallest difference between the actual number of classes in the data sets and the best number of clusters as indicated by our validation criteria. Furthermore, hierarchical methods, which have been widely used by the medical community, exhibited a poorer recovery performance than that of the other methods evaluated. Moreover, as a stable basis for the assessment and comparison of different clustering methods for cancer gene expression data, this study provides a common group of data sets (benchmark data sets) to be shared among researchers and used for comparisons with new methods. The data sets analyzed in this study are available at http://algorithmics.molgen.mpg.de/Supplements/CompCancer/.	[de Souto, Marcilio C. P.; Costa, Ivan G.; de Araujo, Daniel S.

J	Richards, AL; Holmans, P; O'Donovan, MC; Owen, MJ; Jones, L				Richards, Alexander L.; Holmans, Peter; O'Donovan, Michael C.; Owen, Michael J.; Jones, Lesley			A comparison of four clustering methods for brain expression microarray data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ASSOCIATION	Background: DNA microarrays, which determine the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes from a sample, are an important research tool. However, the volume of data they produce can be an obstacle to interpretation of the results. Clustering the genes on the basis of similarity of their expression profiles can simplify the data, and potentially provides an important source of biological inference, but these methods have not been tested systematically on datasets from complex human tissues. In this paper, four clustering methods, CRC, k-means, ISA and memISA, are used upon three brain expression datasets. The results are compared on speed, gene coverage and GO enrichment. The effects of combining the clusters produced by each method are also assessed. Results: k-means outperforms the other methods, with 100% gene coverage and GO enrichments only slightly exceeded by memISA and ISA. Those two methods produce greater GO enrichments on the datasets used, but at the cost of much lower gene coverage, fewer clusters produced, and speed. The clusters they find are largely different to those produced by k-means. Combining clusters produced by k-means and memISA or ISA leads to increased GO enrichment and number of clusters produced ( compared to k-means alone), without negatively impacting gene coverage. memISA can also find potentially disease-related clusters. In two independent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex datasets, it finds three overlapping clusters that are either enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia, genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia, or both. Two of these clusters are enriched for genes of the MAP kinase pathway, suggesting a possible role for this pathway in the aetiology of schizophrenia. Conclusion: Considered alone, k-means clustering is the most effective of the four methods on typical microarray brain expression datasets. However, memISA and ISA can add extra high-quality clusters to the set produced by k-means, so combining these three methods is the method of choice.

The goal of this technique is to find intuitive basis such that training examples can be faithfully reconstructed using linear combination of basis images which are restricted to non-negative values. Thus, NMF basis images can be understood as localized features that correspond better with intuitive notions of parts of images. However, there has been few systematic study to explore various methods for initialization of NMF algorithm, which is crucial for the performance of NMF algorithm in data analysis. In this paper, we discuss a structured NMF initialization scheme based on the clustering method. Comparing with the random initialization in common use, our method achieved faster convergence while maintaining the data structure and also obtained good result for the face recognition task. Furthermore, we also proposed to use a normalized AIC incorporated with our NMF initialization for rank selection of traditional NMF at the cost of much less computational load while obtaining a good performance in face recognition.

J	Tan, XB; Xi, HS				Tan, Xiaobin; Xi, Hongsheng			Hidden semi-Markov model for anomaly detection	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Intelligent Computing	AUG 21-24, 2007	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Natl Sci Fdn China		Intrusion detection; Anomaly detection; Hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM); Maximum entropy principle (MEP); Segmental K-means algorithm	HMM	In this paper, hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is introduced into intrusion detection. Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in intrusion detection systems several years, but it has a major weakness: the inherent duration probability density of a state in HMM is exponential, which may be inappropriate for the modeling of audit data of computer systems. We can handle this problem well by developing an HSMM for perfect normal processes of computer systems. Based on this HSMM, an algorithm of anomaly detection is presented in this paper, which computes the distance between the processes monitored by intrusion detection system and the perfect normal processes. In this algorithm, we use the average information entropy (AIE) of fixed-length observed sequence as the anomaly detection metric based on maximum entropy principle (MEP). To improve accuracy, the segmental K-means algorithm is applied as training algorithm for the HSMM. By comparing the accurate rate with the experimental results of previous research, it shows that our method can perform a more accurate detection. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GAKREM: A novel hybrid clustering algorithm	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Clustering; EM; K-means; Genetic algorithms; Logarithmic regression; GAKREM; Likelihood cross-validation	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; EM ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MODEL	We introduce a novel clustering algorithm named GAKREM (Genetic Algorithm K-means Logarithmic Regression Expectation Maximization) that combines the best characteristics of the K-means and EM algorithms but avoids their weaknesses such as the need to specify a priori the number of clusters, termination in local optima, and lengthy computations. To achieve these goals, genetic algorithms for estimating parameters and initializing starting points for the EM are used first. Second, the log-likelihood of each configuration of parameters and the number of clusters resulting from the EM is used as the fitness value for each chromosome in the population. The novelty of GAKREM is that in each evolving generation it efficiently approximates the log-likelihood for each chromosome using logarithmic regression instead of running the conventional EM algorithm until its convergence. Another novelty is the use of K-means to initially assign data points to clusters. The algorithm is evaluated by comparing its performance with the conventional EM algorithm, the K-means algorithm, and the likelihood cross-validation technique on several datasets.

Density functional calculations have been carried out to obtain optimized geometries, energies, and selected molecular properties. These molecular descriptors take into account steric effects, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity. The use of statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and nonhierarchical cluster analysis (K-means), nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural networks(ANN) has enabled to classify the compounds into psychoactive, moderately psychoactive and psychoinactive groups in good agreement with experimental evidences.

After detecting the community structure of the network through the community detection algorithm which is based on k-means clustering, we find that there are three communities in the network, which correspond to the bubble flow, slug flow and chum flow respectively, and the nodes of the network that are connected tightly between two communities correspond to the transitional flow. In this paper, from a new perspective, we not only achieve good identification of flow patterns in gas/liquid two-phase flow based on complex network theory, but also find the characteristics of flow pattern complex network that are sensitive to the flow parameters, which provide reference to the study of dynamic properties of two-phase flow.
