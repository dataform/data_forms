The algorithm uses a digraph where the vertices represent the data to be clustered. The weight of the edge represents the acceptance rate between the two data connected by the edge. The pheromone on the edges is adaptively updated by the ants passing through it. Some edges with less pheromone are progressively removed under a list of thresholds in the process. Strong connected components of the final digraph are extracted as clusters. Experimental results on several real datasets and benchmarks indicate that the algorithm can find clusters more quickly and with better quality than K-means and LF. In addition, when the database is changed, the algorithm can dynamically modify the clusters accordingly to maintain its accuracy.

Thus a novel clustering approach, namely the genetic K-means algorithm, is proposed to detect fMRI activation. It is more likely to find a global optimal solution to the K-means clustering, and is independent of the initial assignments of the cluster centroids. The experimental results show that the proposed method recognizes fMRI activation regions with higher accuracy than ordinary K-means clustering.

This method can quickly obtain the global optimal clustering with a clonal operator which combines evolutionary search, global search, stochastic search and local search, then detect abnormal network behavioral patterns with a fuzzy detection algorithm. Simulation results on the data set KDD CUP99 show that this method can efficiently detect unknown intrusions with lower false positive rate and higher detection rate.

It simulates the process of the attraction and merging of objects due to their gravity force. The procedure is simplified by not considering velocity and multi-force attraction. The proposed hierarchical method does not depend on random initialization and the results can be used as better initial centers for K-means to achieve higher performance under the SSE (sum-squared-error) criterion. The experimental results on the recognition of handwritten Chinese characters show that the proposed approach can generate better prototypes than K-means and the results obtained by MCE training can be further improved when the proposed method is employed.

The simulation results demonstrate the validity of this method: The correlation coefficients between time courses of simulation sources and those of estimated sources are higher than 0.974 for random noise with NSR <= 0.2. The distances between the normalized locations of simulation sources and those of estimated sources are shorter than 0.108 for random noise with NSR <= 0.2. The proposed approach has also been applied to a human study related to spatial selective attention. The results of real VEPs data show that three correlative sources can be located and time courses of those can describe the attention cognitive process correctly.

The new algorithm can carry out the global search and the local search in many directions rather than one direction around the same antibody simultaneously, and obtain the global optimum quickly. The implementation of new algorithm composes of three main processes: firstly, selecting training samples and choosing clustering centers randomly. Secondly, training samples using CSA, and obtaining optimal clustering center based on three main clonal operations: cloning, clonal mutation and clonal selection. Finally, output the classification results according to clustering center obtained. To show the usefulness of this approach, experiment with simulated SAR image was considered. The classification results are evaluated by comparing with three well-known algorithms, UAIC, K-means, and fuzzy K-means. Accroding to the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, CSA has high classification precision and can be used in SAR images classification.

It is robust from the image variations such as illumination, glasses frame, and eyebrows. Image context of an image is any observable relevant attributes with other images. Image context analysis is carried out using the hybrid network of k-means and RBF. The proposed eye location employs context-driven adaptive Bayesian framework to relive the effect due to uneven face images. The appearance of eye patterns is represented by Haar wavelet. It also employs a merging and arbitration strategy in order to manage the variations in illumination and geometrical characteristics of ambient eye regions due to glasses frames, eye brows, and so on. The located eye candidates are merged or eliminated, and adaptive arbitration strategy is used based on a minimizing energy function by probabilistic forces and image forces. The adaptation is carried out by the analysis of image context. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve superior performance using various data sets to previously proposed methods.

However, this model suffers from degradation in recognition accuracy due to its Gaussian Probability Density Function (GPDF) clustering error. This paper proposes a, clustering algorithm called a Heterogeneous Centroid Neural Network (HCNN) for use in TMHMMs. The algorithm utilizes a Centroid Neural Network (CNN) to cluster acoustic feature vectors in the TMHMM. The HCNN uses a heterogeneous distance measure to allocate more code vectors in the heterogeneous areas where probability densities of different states overlap each other. When applied to an isolated Korean digit word recognition problem, the HCNN reduces the error rate by 9.39% over CNN clustering, and 14.63% over the traditional K-means clustering.

To make the results more comprehensive, the algorithm was tested on both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic PNNs. Normally, user have to define the number of clusters through trial and error method, which makes random initialization to be of stochastic nature. Global k-means was chosen as the initialization method because it can autonomously find the number of clusters using a selection criterion and can provide deterministic clustering results. The proposed algorithm was tested on benchmark datasets and real world data from the cooling water system in a power plant.

The kernel method adopted in this paper implicitly performs nonlinear mapping of the input data into a high-dimensional feature space. The proposed CBFCM(MK) algorithm is capable of dealing with nonlinear separation boundaries among clusters. Experiments on a synthetic data set and several real MPEG data sets show that the proposed algorithm gives better classification accuracies than both the conventional k-means algorithm and the GBFCM.

The images for classification are object images that can be divided into foreground and background areas. In the preprocessing step, we extract the object region and shape-based texture features extracted from wavelet-transformed images. We group the image classes into clusters that have similar texture features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means. The hierarchical classifier has five layers that combine the clusters. The hierarchical classifier consists of 59 neural network classifiers that were learned using the back-propagation algorithm. Of the various texture features, the diagonal moment was the most effective. A test showed classification rates of 81.5% correct with 1000 training images and of 75.1% correct with 1000 test images. The training and test sets each contained 10 images from each of 100 classes.

For lattice data space-time autoregressive modeling, to reduce influence of spatial fluctuation on prediction accuracy of neural networks, all regions are partitioned into several subareas by an improved k-means algorithm based on spatial contiguity relation. Some partition criteria are proposed to evaluate different partition schemes and the optimal scheme has the least spatial fluctuation and significant spatial dependent within each subarea. Each multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) network is modeled respectively for each subarea, and the output nodes are the prediction values at time t of an attribute for all regions in a subarea, and the input nodes are observations before time t of this subarea itself and neighboring regions. As a case study, all local models are tested and compared with a single global MLPs network by one-step-ahead predicting of an epidemic dataset, and the results indicate that local NN model has better prediction performance than the global NN model.

The implicit surface is reconstructed based on radial basis functions network from range scattered data. For the property of locality of radial basis function, the method is fast and robust with respect to large data. Furthermore, an adapted K-Means algorithm is used to reduce RBF centers for reconstruction. Experiment results show that the presented approach is helpful in speed improvement and is a good solution for large data reconstruction.

Our basic approach is based on k-means. By changing the order of determining object labels, and exploiting the high computational power and pipeline of graphics processing units (GPUs) for distance computing and comparison, we speed up the k-means algorithm substantially. We introduce two strategies for retrieving data from the GPU, taking into account the low bandwidth from the GPU back to the main memory. We also extend our GPU-based approach to data stream clustering. We implement our algorithms in a PC with a Pentium IV 3.4G CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT graphics card. Our comprehensive performance study shows that the common GPU in desktop computers could be an efficient co-processor of CPU in traditional and data stream clustering.

Our approach is to compare genomes according to typical genomic distributions of a mathematical function that reflects a certain biological function. In this study we used comprehensive genome analysis of DNA curvature distributions before starts and after ends of prokaryotic genes to evaluate the assistance of mathematical and statistical procedures. Due to an extensive amount of data we were able to define the factors influencing the curvature distribution in promoter and terminator regions. Two clustering methods, K-means and PAM were applied and produced very similar clusterings that reflect genomic attributes and environmental conditions of species' habitat.

We use a flexible representation of XML documents that allows taking into account the structure only or both the structure and content. Our approach consists of representing XML documents by a set of their subpaths, defined according to some criteria (length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words, we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering methods such as k-means. We use an implementation of the clustering algorithm known as dynamic clouds that can work with distinct groups of independent modalities put in separate variables. This is useful in our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing independant paths. Experiments with the INEX collections show good results for the structure-only collections, but our approach could not scale well for large structure-and-content collections.

In this paper, an automatic content-based image classification model using Centroid Neural Networks (CNN) with a Divergence Measure called Divergence-based Centroid Neural Network (DCNN) is proposed. The DCNN algorithm, which employs the divergence measure as its distance measure, is used for clustering of Gaussian Probability Distribution Function (GPDF) data. In comparison with other conventional algorithms, the DCNN designed for probability data has the robustness advantages of utilizing a localized image representation method in which each image is represented by a Gaussian distribution feature vector. Experiments and results show that the proposed classification model yields accuracy improvements of 5.77% and 6.97% over models employing the conventional Divergence-based k-means (Dk-means) and Divergence-based Self Organizing Map (DSOM) algorithms, respectively.

In contrast, the hyperspectral imaging case when "looking up" at small or distant satellites creates new and unforeseen problems. Usually one pixel or one fraction of a pixel contains the imaging target, and spectra tend to be time-series data of a single object collected over some time period under possibly varying weather conditions; there is little spatial information available. Often, the number of collected traces is less than the number of wavelength bins, and a materials database with imperfect representative spectra must be used in the subpixel classification and uninixing process. A procedure is formulated for generating a "good" set of classes from experimentally collected spectra by assuming a Gaussian distribution in the angle-space of the spectra. Specifically, Kernel K-means, a suboptimal ML-estimator, is used to generate a set of classes. Covariance information from the resulting classes and weighted least squares methods are then applied to solve the linear unmixing problem. We show with cross-validation that Kernel K-means separation of laboratory material classes into "smaller" virtual classes before unmixing improves the performance of weighted least squares methods.

The method is based on the chemometric analysis of the damping factor (tan delta) as a function of temperature. In this study four polymer groups, namely, polypropylene, low density polyethylene, polystyrene and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, each characterised by different grades, were studied. The aim is to distinguish polymer groups from each other. The polymers were studied over a temperature range of -50 degrees C until the minimum stiffness was reached, tan delta values were recorded approximately every 1.5 degrees. Principal components analysis was performed to visualise groupings and also for feature reduction prior to classification and clustering. Several clustering and classification methods were compared including k-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbours, and class distances using both Euclidean and Mahalanobis measures. It is demonstrated that thermal analysis together with chemometrics provides excellent discrimination, representing a new approach for characterisation of polymers.

The main advantage of black-box optimisation algorithms is that they do not require any domain specific knowledge yet are able to provide a near optimal solution. To further improve the performance of the algorithm we combine the SA technique with a standard k-means clustering technique. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with several specialised colour quantisation algorithms. The results obtained show that our hybrid SA algorithm clearly outperforms standard quantisation algorithms and provides images with superior image quality.

J	Roy, N; Ganguli, R				Roy, N; Ganguli, R			Filter design using radial basis function neural network and genetic algorithm for improved operational health monitoring	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						health monitoring; neural networks; genetic algorithm; signal processing	SYSTEM; DIAGNOSIS; NOISE	The problem of denoising damage indicator signals for improved operational health monitoring of systems is addressed by applying soft computing methods to design filters. Since measured data in operational settings is contaminated with noise and outliers, pattern recognition algorithms for fault detection and isolation can give false alarms. A direct approach to improving the fault detection and isolation is to remove noise and outliers from time series of measured data or damage indicators before performing fault detection and isolation. Many popular signal-processing approaches do not work well with damage indicator signals, which can contain sudden changes due to abrupt faults and non-Gaussian outliers. Signal-processing algorithms based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network and weighted recursive median (WRM) filters are explored for denoising simulated time series. The RBF neural network filter is developed using a K-means clustering algorithm and is much less computationally expensive to develop than feedforward neural networks trained using backpropagation. The nonlinear multimodal integer-programming problem of selecting optimal integer weights of the WRM filter is solved using genetic algorithm. Numerical results are obtained for helicopter rotor structural damage indicators based on simulated frequencies. Test signals consider low order polynomial growth of damage indicators with time to simulate gradual or incipient faults and step changes in the signal to simulate abrupt faults. Noise and outliers are added to the test signals. The WRM and RBF filters result in a noise reduction of 54 - 71 and 59 - 73% for the test signals considered in this study, respectively. Their performance is much better than the moving average FIR filter, which causes significant feature distortion and has poor outlier removal capabilities and shows the potential of soft computing methods for specific signal-processing applications.

High dimensional motion capture date are represented using a low dimensional representation by topology preserving network, which maps similar motion instances to the neighborhood points on the low dimensional motion manifold. Nonlinear manifold learning between a low dimensional manifold representation and high dimensional motion data provides a generative model to synthesize new motion sequence by controlling trajectory on the low dimensional motion manifold. We segment motion primitives by analyzing low dimensional representation of body poses through motion from motion captured data. Clustering techniques like k-means algorithms are used to find motion primitives after dimensionality reduction. Motion dynamics in training sequences can be described by transition characteristics of motion primitives.

A discrete event system (DES) or a fuzzy discrete event system (FDES) approach with a fuzzy rule-base may resolve the ambiguity in a fault diagnosis problem especially in the case of multiple faults. In this study, an FDES approach with a fuzzy rule-base is used as a means of indicating the degree and priority of faults, especially in the case of multiple faults. The fuzzy rule-base is constructed using event-fault relations. Fuzzy events occurring any time with different membership degrees are obtained using k-means clustering algorithm. The fuzzy sub-event sequences are used to construct super events. The study is concluded by giving some examples about the distinguishability of fault types (parameter, actuator) in an unmanned small helicopter.

The proposed method is based on metaphors derived from artificial immune systems, clonal and negative selection paradigms. A novel clonal selection algorithm - Immune K-Means, is proposed. The proposed system is able to perform feature selection and model identification tasks by evolving specialized subpopulations of T- and B-lymphocytes. Multilevel evolution and real-valued coding enable for further extending of the proposed model and interpreting the subpopulations of lymphocytes as sets of evolving fuzzy rules.

Data clustering algorithms have been developed in recent years. K-means is fast, easily implemented and finds most local optima. IDBSCAN is more efficient than DBSCAN. IDBSCAN can also find arbitrary shapes and detect noisy points for data clustering. This investigation presents a new technique based on the concept of IDBSCAN, in which K-means is used to find the high-density center points and then IDBSCAN is used to expand clusters from these high-density center points. IDBSCAN has a lower execution time because it reduces the execution time by selecting representative points in seeds. The simulation indicates that the proposed KIDBSCAN yields more accurate clustering results. Additionally, this new approach reduces the I/O cost. KIDBSCAN outperforms DBSCAN and IDBSCAN.

The system is designed to detect, track and recognize the behavior of humans, using a single static camera. Background subtraction is applied to extract moving objects; these objects are tracked using linear approximation. Shadow regions are detected and removed using linear dependence and spatial connectivity properties of the shadow regions. Pattern matching and TDL (Two Dimensional Logarithmic) search approach are used to solve the problem of the occlusion of objects and depth reasoning. Behaviors of moving objects are detected by examining the sequence of shapes extracted from the scene. Shapes of moving objects are interpreted as characters of an alphabet. Each character represents a class of similar blob shapes classified using K-Means clustering. The model is used to recognize behaviors in an office with promising results.

KPCA can also be considered as a visualization tool; by looking at the scatter plot of the projected data, we can distinguish the different clusters within the original data. We propose to use visualization given by KPCA in order to decide the number of clusters. K-means clustering algorithm on both data and projected space is then applied using synthetic and real datasets. The number of clusters discovered by the user is compared to the Davies-Bouldin index originally used as a way of deciding the number of clusters.

Microarrrays provide large datasets that are currently primarily analyzed using crisp clustering techniques. Crisp clustering methods such as K-means or self organizing maps assign each gene to one cluster, thus omitting information concerning the multiple roles of genes. One of the major advantages of fuzzy clustering is that genes can belong to more than one group, revealing this way more profound information concerning the function and regulation of each gene. Additionally, recent studies have proven that integrating a small amount of information in purely unsupervised algorithms leads to much better performance. In this paper we propose a new semi-supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm which we apply in time series gene expression data. The clustering that was performed on simulated as well as experimental microarray data proved that the proposed method outperformed other clustering techniques.

Here we propose a batch version for supervised neural gas training which allows to efficiently learn a prototype-based classification, provided training data are given beforehand. The method relies on a simpler cost function than online supervised neural gas and leads to simpler update formulas. We prove convergence of the algorithm in a general framework, which also incorporates supervised k-means and supervised batch-SOM, and which opens the way towards metric adaptation as well as application to proximity data not embedded in a real-vector space.

The conserved regions have the potential to determine the conformation, function and activities of the proteins. The main purpose of this paper is trying to obtain protein sequence motifs which are universally conserved and across protein family boundaries. Therefore, unlike most popular motif discovering algorithms, our input dataset is extremely large. As a result, an efficient technique is demanded. In this article, short recurring segments of proteins are explored by utilizing a novel granular computing strategy. First, Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (FCM) is used to separate the whole dataset into several smaller informational granules and then succeeded by improved K-means clustering algorithm on each granule to obtain the final results. The structural similarity of the clusters discovered by our approach is studied to analyze how the recurring patterns correlate with its structure. Also, some biochemical references are included in our evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the granular computing concept as well as the DBI measure for evaluation is introduced to this dataset. Compare with the latest research results, our method requires only twenty percent of the execution time and obtains even higher quality information of protein sequence motifs. The efficient and satisfactory results in our experiment suggests that our granular computing model which combined FCM and improved K-means may have a high chance to be applied in some other bioinformatics research fields and yield stunning results.

By utilizing interval data for representing replicated microarray data, IntClust is able to take into account the scopes where replicate microarray data are distributed instead of simple data points. The software package offers several transformation models for interval data representations, supports different extended dissimilarity/distance measures for interval data analysis, provides some variations of modified K-means clustering, and presents three popular clustering quality evaluation measures. Our experiments show that IntClust improves the clustering performance of gene-expression microarray data over traditional approaches.

A small amount of background knowledge may also be used to guide the clustering process and aid in the interpretation of results. This type of knowledge-driven clustering is known as semi-supervised clustering. This knowledge may be represented by pairwise constraints, labelled cases or known data groupings. Pairwise constraints may be specified, for example, as 'MustLink' or 'CannotLink' associations between cases. This research proposes a semi-supervised clustering method that exploits pairwise constraints and similarity information extracted from constrained cases. This semi-supervised clustering algorithm was first evaluated on publicly-available biomedical datasets. It was then applied to a Type H diabetes dataset to assess coronary heart disease (CHD) complication. This dataset comprises laboratory and physiological information from diabetic patients at the Ulster Hospital (UH) in Northern Ireland The following methods were compared:traditional k-means, constraint-based k-means with pairwise constraints (CK method) and similarity-driven constraint-based k-means (SCK method). Results showed that the predictive quality, i.e. detection of relevant If partitions and significant clusters, on these datasets was improved with a small amount of supervision (i.e. pairwise constraints automatically generated from the predefined class labels). Furthermore, the results from the UH dataset suggest significant associations between clustering outcomes with CHD complication in Type 11 diabetes patients.

However, the results of hierarchical clustering are sensitive to outliers, and most relocation methods give results which are dependent on the initialization of the algorithm. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the significance of the results. We have developed a consensus clustering algorithm, where the final result is averaged over multiple clustering runs, giving a robust and reproducible clustering, capable of capturing small signal variations. The algorithm preserves valuable properties of hierarchical clustering, which is useful for visualization and interpretation of the results. Results: We show for the first time that one can take advantage of multiple clustering runs in DNA microarray analysis by collecting re-occurring clustering patterns in a co-occurrence matrix. The results show that consensus clustering obtained from clustering multiple times with Variational Bayes Mixtures of Gaussians or K-means significantly reduces the classification error rate for a simulated dataset. The method is flexible and it is possible to find consensus clusters from different clustering algorithms. Thus, the algorithm can be used as a framework to test in a quantitative manner the homogeneity of different clustering algorithms. We compare the method with a number of state-of-the-art clustering methods. It is shown that the method is robust and gives low classification error rates for a realistic, simulated dataset. The algorithm is also demonstrated for real datasets. It is shown that more biological meaningful transcriptional patterns can be found without conservative statistical or fold-change exclusion of data.

As essential tools within cluster analysis, cluster validation techniques have the potential to assess the quality of clustering results and performance of clustering algorithms, helpful to the interpretation of clustering results. In this work, the validation ability of Silhouette index, Dunn's index, Davies-Bouldin index and FOM in gene clustering was investigated with public gene expression datasets clustered by hierarchical single-linkage and average-linkage clustering, K-means and SOMs. It was made clear that Silhouette index and FOM can preferably validate the performance of clustering algorithms and the quality of clustering results, Dunn's index should not be used directly in gene clustering validation for its high susceptibility to outliers, while Davies-Bouldin index can afford better validation than Dunn's index, exception for its preference to hierarchical single-linkage clustering.

The objectives of this study are, first, to cluster pavement distress data into homogeneous groups depending on the extent of distress and, second, to identify and assess the influence of a variety of exogenous variables on the extent of pavement distress. To achieve these objectives, a two-step clustering and classification evolutionary modular neural network is developed with a large (more than 1,000 observations) and recent (1998) data set collected from in-service pavements in 15 European countries. The results indicate that the extent of the cracking distress (magnitude of cracking) can be separated into five homogeneous clusters (with Cluster 1 suggesting very low cracking and Cluster 5 very extensive cracking), with different explanatory variables affecting the extent of cracking in each of these clusters.

Our objective was to analyze the relationships between these indices for different dialysis modalities and schedules, using urea kinetic modeling. Methods: EKR and FSR were calculated for HD (three or six times per week), automatic nightly PD (ANPD) and CAPD using the following reference values of urea concentration and mass in the body: peak, peak average, time average and treatment time average. Results: The standard KTN approach is related to the treatment time average, whereas the standard EKR is related to the time average reference values. In spite of KT/V = 3.5 (K meaning dialyzer clearance or peritoneal diffusive mass transport coefficient), EKR and FSR were lower for ANPD and CAPD than for HD. The ratio of EKR to FSR was essentially the same for the different treatment modalities (range 3.48-4.07 ml/min). This could be explained by the theoretical analysis which predicts the value of EKR/FSR = V/Tc, independent of the treatment modality and schedules (V is a solute distribution volume, Tc is the time of the full dialysis cycle). Conclusion: Whereas the index KT/V in its standard form cannot be used to compare different dialysis regimens, EKR and FSR provide very similar evaluation of different dialysis modalities and schedules, and may be considered as equivalent measures for comparative studies of dialysis adequacy.

J	Datta, S; Datta, S				Datta, Susmita; Datta, Somnath			Evaluation of clustering algorithms for gene expression data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium of Computations in Bioinformatics and Bioscience in Conjunction with the International Multi-Symposium on Computer and Computational Sciences	JUN 20-24, 2006	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA				VALIDATION	Background: Cluster analysis is an integral part of high dimensional data analysis. In the context of large scale gene expression data, a filtered set of genes are grouped together according to their expression profiles using one of numerous clustering algorithms that exist in the statistics and machine learning literature. A closely related problem is that of selecting a clustering algorithm that is "optimal" in some sense from a rather impressive list of clustering algorithms that currently exist. Results: In this paper, we propose two validation measures each with two parts: one measuring the statistical consistency (stability) of the clusters produced and the other representing their biological functional congruence. Smaller values of these indices indicate better performance for a clustering algorithm. We illustrate this approach using two case studies with publicly available gene expression data sets: one involving a SAGE data of breast cancer patients and the other involving a time course cDNA microarray data on yeast. Six well known clustering algorithms UPGMA, K-Means, Diana, Fanny, Model-Based and SOM were evaluated. Conclusion: No single clustering algorithm may be best suited for clustering genes into functional groups via expression profiles for all data sets. The validation measures introduced in this paper can aid in the selection of an optimal algorithm, for a given data set, from a collection of available clustering algorithms.

So far, however, they have not superseded routine histopathology and staging criteria, partly because the few studies performed on molecular subtyping have had little validation and limited clinical characterization. Methods We obtained gene expression and clinical data for 412 breast cancers obtained from population-based cohorts of patients from Stockholm and Uppsala, Sweden. Using the intrinsic set of approximately 500 genes derived in the Norway/ Stanford breast cancer data, we validated the existence of five molecular subtypes - basal-like, ERBB2, luminal A/B and normal-like - and characterized these subtypes extensively with the use of conventional clinical variables. Results We found an overall 77.5% concordance between the centroid prediction of the Swedish cohort by using the Norway/ Stanford signature and the k-means clustering performed internally within the Swedish cohort. The highest rate of discordant assignments occurred between the luminal A and luminal B subtypes and between the luminal B and ERBB2 subtypes. The subtypes varied significantly in terms of grade ( p < 0.001), p53 mutation ( p < 0.001) and genomic instability ( p = 0.01), but surprisingly there was little difference in lymph-node metastasis ( p = 0.31). Furthermore, current users of hormone-replacement therapy were strikingly over-represented in the normal-like subgroup ( p < 0.001). Separate analyses of the patients who received endocrine therapy and those who did not receive any adjuvant therapy supported the previous hypothesis that the basal-like subtype responded to adjuvant treatment, whereas the ERBB2 and luminal B subtypes were poor responders. Conclusion We found that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer are broadly present in a diverse collection of patients from a population-based cohort in Sweden. The intrinsic gene set, originally selected to reveal stable tumor characteristics, was shown to have a strong correlation with progression-related properties such as grade, p53 mutation and genomic instability.

This paper proposes a computer aided diagnostic system for mammographic circumscribed mass detection. The propose method can distinguish between tumours and healthy tissue among various parenchymal tissue patterns. In the first stage the preprocessing and features extraction of the image is done. In this way image segmentation, filtering, contrast improvement and gray level thresholding techniques are applied for enhancing the whole image, and then the features are extracted from the resultant image. In the second part a k-means clustering algorithm is applied. The evaluation of the propose methodology is carried out on Mammography Image Analysis Society (ML4S) dataset.

New fast and robust stochastic algorithm of two stage vector quantization for joint source-channel speech coding for any transmission channel	CERMA2006: ELECTRONICS, ROBOTICS AND AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS CONFERENCE VOL 2, PROCEEDINGS	Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA)		English	Proceedings Paper	Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference	SEP 26-29, 2006	Cuernavaca, MEXICO	Univ Del Sol, Cent Nacl Investigac Desarrollo Tecnol, IEEE Student Branch Univ Del Sol, IEEE Student Branch CENIDET, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Electron Devices Soc, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc, Texas Instruments, Natl Instruments, Intel, ABB, Volkswagen, Honda, Gen Motors				A new algorithm of two stage vector quantization for joint source-channel speech coding for any transmission channels is presented. The computational complexity is only slightly higher than the most widely used Multi Stage Vector Quantization algorithm (MSVQ). This new algorithm improves the characteristics and the results of a sequential quantizer of two stages. The base of this algorithm is the modification of the well-known GS-RGSKA epsilon algorithm (Reduced complexity Generalized Stochastic K-means Algorithm -of- Great Speed) for a nonstationary channel. This new algorithm is optimal for the joint construction of two stages. The main features of the proposed algorithm are as follows: Due to its stochastic nature it avoids being trapped in poor local minimums. Initial codebooks are not needed; the codevectors move away from the gravity center of the training vectors towards their final position. Source coding and channel coding are jointly optimized to obtain robust codebooks for different levels of noise in transmission channels. The reduction of calculation time is based on geometric considerations and memory management. This algorithm allows to design the codebook orderly due to its advantageous convergence properties. The results showed that the algorithm needs only 8 to 16% of the number of mathematical operations in comparison with the operations required by others propositions for full search of MSQV, either stationary or non-stationary channels.

Total rainfall of a 10-day period during the rain season (July and August) is classified into two types (dry or wet) using the K-mean method. Meteorological indicators that influence rainfall are selected by the F-test method for rainfall type and rainfall class, and then used with a bi- or multi-discriminant method to establish prediction models. This procedure is applied to predict rainfall class with a three-day lead time for the Yuecheng basin in China. Results show that it is effective in medium-term rainfall prediction with relatively little data requirement.

The algorithm is flexible in the sense that it does not require the specification of a response variable. On the other hand, the algorithm requires that each observation follows one of the linear patterns in the data. However, it often occurs in practice that part of the data does not follow any of the linear patterns. Therefore, we introduce a robust linear grouping algorithm based on trimming that can still find the linear structures even if part of the data does not belong to any of the groups.

The correspondence between this clusters organization and the input proximity is called the topology preservation. The aim of this paper is to measure, reduce and understand variability of SOM. Considering the property of topology preservation, a local approach of variability (at an individual level) is preferred to a global one. A complementary visualising tool, called Map of Distances between Classes (MDC), is presented to complete this local approach relating variability to the complexity of the data's intrinsic structure. It basically allows the main information to be extracted from a very large matrix of distances between Self-Organizing Maps' classes. In the presence of a complex structure, it enlarges the information set, linking the variability of acceptable representations to the data structure complexity. To reduce variability, a stochastic method based on a bootstrap process aims to increase the reliability of the induced neighbourhood structure. The resulting (robust) map, called R-Map, is more robust relative to the sensitivities of the outputs to the sampling method and to some of the learning options of the SOM' algorithm (initialisation and order of data presentation). This method consists of selecting one map from a group of several solutions resulting from the same self-organizing map algorithm, but obtained with various inputs. The R-map can be perceived as the map, among the group of solutions, and corresponds to the most common interpretation of the data set structure. When an R-map can be perceived as the representative of a given SOM network, the relevance of the chosen network depends on R-map's ability to adjust the data structure. As an application, a criterion to validate the network size is proposed comparing its ability of adjustment with SOM outputs of a larger network.

In fact, the optimal solution is not pursued overwhelmingly in actual projects, but it needs to meet certain optimization efficiency. This paper reduces the problem's complexity based on the idea of "divide and rule". We use the method of K-Means cluster to divide the nearest neighbor quickly. Then, we employ parallel computing method to all divided areas by using combination of genetic algorithm and ant algorithm (GAAA). Finally, we globally link all the subsets using the method of K centers connect. The results of simulations show that its complexity has been greatly reduced and we can quickly obtain a satisfactory solution to the large-scale problem. It is one effective way to solve the large-scale complex problems.

These metrics contain the information of software and can be used to predict software quality in the early stage of software life cycle. Intelligent computing techniques such as data mining can be applied in the study of software quality by analyzing software metrics. Clustering analysis, which is one of data mining techniques, is adopted to build the software quality prediction models in early period of software testing. In this paper, three clustering methods, k-means, fuzzy c-means and Gaussian mixture model, are investigated for the analysis of two real-world software metric datasets. The experiment results show that the best method in predicting software quality is dependent on practical dataset, and clustering analysis technique has advantages in software quality prediction since it can be used in the case having little prior knowledge.

A serious problem in this task is the unsatisfactory annotation performance due to the semantic gap between the visual content and keywords. Targeting at this problem, we present a new approach that tries to incorporate lexical semantics into the image annotation process. In the phase of training, given a training set of images labeled with keywords, a basic visual vocabulary consisting of visual terms, extracted from the image to represent its content, and the associated keywords is generated at first, using K-means clustering combined with semantic constraints obtained from WordNet, then the statistical correlation between visual terms and keywords is modeled by a two-level hierarchical ensemble model composed of probabilistic SVM classifiers and a co-occurrence language model. In the phase of annotation, given an unlabeled image, the most likely associated keywords are predicted by the posterior probability of each keyword given each visual term at the first-level classifier ensemble, then the second-level language model is used to refine the annotation quality by word co-occurrence statistics derived from the annotated keywords in the training set of images. We carried out experiments on a medium-sized image collection from Corel Stock Photo CDs. The experimental results demonstrated that the annotation performance of this method outperforms some traditional annotation methods by about 7% in average precision, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

S	Liu, DX; He, YX; Ji, DH; Yang, H		Gelbukh, A		Liu, DX; He, YX; Ji, DH; Yang, H			Multi-document summarization based on BE-vector clustering	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS AND INTELLIGENT TEXT PROCESSING	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics	FEB 19-25, 2006	Mexico City, MEXICO					In this paper, we propose a novel multi-document summarization strategy based on Basic Element (BE) vector clustering. In this strategy, sentences are represented by BE vectors instead of word or term vectors before clustering. BE is a head-modifier-relation triple representation of sentence content, and it is more precise to use BE as semantic unit than to use word. The BE-vector clustering is realized by adopting the k-means clustering method, and a novel clustering analysis method is employed to automatically detect the number of clusters, K. The experimental results indicate a superiority of the proposed strategy over the traditional summarization strategy based on word vector clustering. The summaries generated by the proposed strategy achieve a ROUGE-1 score of 0.37291 that is better than those generated by traditional strategy (at 0.36936) on DUC04 task-2.

An improved quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for clustering gene expression data	Computational Methods, Pts 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Computational Methods (ICCM04)	DEC 15-17, 2004	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn		gene expression; clustering; quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm		Microarray technologies have made it straightforward to monitor simultaneously the expression pattern of thousands of genes. So an important task is to cluster gene expression data to identify groups of genes with similar patterns and hence similar functions. In this paper, an improved quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (IQEA) is first proposed for minimum sum-of-squares clustering. We have suggested a new representation form and added an additional mutation operation in IQEA. Experiment results show that IQEA appears to be much more robust in finding optimum or best-known solutions and be superior to conventional k-means and self-organizing maps clustering algorithms even with a small population.

Further to clustering it is important to evaluate the resulted clusters in order to choose the best clustering for a particular framework. This paper examines the usage of Kullback-Leibler divergence, an information theoretic distance, in conjuction with the k-means clustering algorithm. It compares KL-divergence with other well known distance measures (Euclidean, Standardized Euclidean and Manhattan) and evaluates clustering results using both objective function's value and Davies-Bouldin index. Since it is imperative to assess whether the results of a clustering process are susceptible to noise, especially in noisy environments such as Web environment, our approach takes the impact of noise into account. The clusters obtained with KL approach seem to be superior to those obtained with the other distance measures in case our data have been corrupted by noise.

Many different pattern clustering approaches based on the pattern membership model could be used to classify objects within various classes. Different models of Crisp, Hierarchical, Overlapping and Fuzzy clustering algorithms have been developed which serve different purposes. The main deficiency that most of the algorithms face is that the number of clusters for reaching the optimal arrangement is not automatically calculated and needs user intervention. In this paper we propose a fuzzy clustering technique (FACT) which determines the number of appropriate clusters based on the pattern essence. Different experiments for algorithm evaluation were performed which show a much better performance compared with the typical widely used K-means clustering algorithm.

The peculiarity of the proposed model is the capability to manage anomalous interval valued data by reducing the effects of such outliers in the clustering model. In the interval case, the concept of anomalous data involves both the center and the width (the radius) of an interval. In order to show how our model works the results of a simulation experiment and an application to real interval valued data are discussed.

This paper proposes a novel bottom-up hierarchical document clustering algorithm to merge several pairs of most similar clusters in each step. This is done via a concept of "kNN-connectedness", which measures the mutual connectedness of clusters in kNNs, and a kNN connection graph, which organizes given clusters into several sets of kNN-connected clusters. In such a graph, a connection between any two clusters only exists in the kNN-connected clusters of the same set. Moreover, a new kNN-based attraction function is proposed to measure the similarity between two clusters and indicates the potential probability of the two clusters being merged. The attraction function only considers the relative distribution of their nearest neighbors between two clusters in a vector space while other criteria, such as the well-known cluster-based cosine similarity function, measures the absolute distance between two clusters. This makes the attraction function effectively apply to the cases where different clusters may have very different distance variation. In each step, a kNN connection graph, consisting of several sets of kNN-connected clusters, is first constructed from the given clusters using a kNN algorithm and the concept of "kNN-connectedness". For each set of kNN-connected clusters, the attraction degree between any two clusters is calculated and several top connected cluster pairs will be merged. In this way, the iteration number can be largely reduced and the clustering process can be much speeded. Evaluation on a news document corpus shows that the kNN connection graph-based hierarchical document clustering algorithm can achieve better performance than the famous k-means clustering algorithm while reducing the iteration number sharply in comparison with normal hierarchical document clustering.

Unsupervised learning is utilized on a speech video corpus to find underlying manifold of facial configurations. K-means clustering is applied on the low dimensional space to find key speaking-related facial shapes. With a small set of laser scanner captured 3D models related to the clustering centroid, the facial animation in 2D videos is transferred onto 3D shapes. Especially by virtue of a weak perspective projection model, the underlying mandible rotation is recovered from videos and is utilized to drive 3D skull movements. The adaption of a generic skull onto facial models is guided by a 2D image, Tissue Map. With parsimonious data requirements, our system realizes the animation transferring and gains a realistic rendering effect with the underlying anatomical structure.

The main problem stems from the effect of noise on the shape interaction matrix, which looses its block-diagonal structure and as a result the assignment of elements to objects becomes difficult. The aim in this paper is to overcome this problem using graph-spectral embedding and the k-means algorithm. To this end we develop a representation based on the commute time between nodes on a graph. The commute time (i.e. the expected time taken for a random walk to travel between two nodes and return) can be computed from the Laplacian spectrum using the discrete Green's function, and is an important property of the random walk on a graph. The commute time is a more robust measure of the proximity of data than the raw proximity matrix. Our embedding procedure preserves commute time, and is closely akin to kernel PCA, the Laplacian eigenmap and the diffusion map. We illustrate the results both on the synthetic image sequences and real world video sequences, and compare our results with several alternative methods.

Pheromone that causes clumping or clustering behavior in a species and brings individuals into a closer proximity is called aggregation pheromone. This paper presents a novel method for image segmentation considering the aggregation behavior of ants. Image segmentation is viewed as a clustering problem which aims to partition a given set of pixels into a number of homogenous clusters/segments. At each location of data point representing a pixel an ant is placed; and the ants are allowed to move in the search space to find out the points with higher pheromone density. The movement of an ant is governed by the amount of pheromone deposited at different points of the search space. More the deposited pheromone, more is the aggregation of ants. This leads to the formation of homogenous groups of data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of images using different cluster validity measures. Results are compared with those obtained using average linkage and k-means clustering algorithms and are found to be better.

Thus, it aims to bridge the semantic gap between human perception and low-level features. Our approach works in two stages. Image segments, obtained from a subset of images in the database by an adaptive k-means clustering algorithm, are labelled manually during the training stage. The training information is used to label all the images in the database during the second stage. When a query is given, it is also segmented and each segment is labelled using the information available from the training stage. Similarity score between the query and a database image is based on the labels associated with the two images. Our results on two test databases show that region labelling helps in increasing the retrieval precision when compared to feature-based matching.

It evaluates the similarity of the signals shape by comparing their auto-correlation functions (ACFs), on the assumption that the same PD source can exhibit signals having similar ACFs. The new classification algorithm is based on a modified K-Mean Clustering (KMC) method. A laboratory test of the proposed algorithm is reported. The proposed classification method may constitute a step forward in the automatic signal separation.

An heuristic approach for mapping landslide hazard by integrating fuzzy logic with analytic hierarchy process	CONTROL AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						landslide; multiple criteria evaluation; analytic hierarchy process; weighted linear combination; ordered weighted averaging; modeling	K-MEANS; GIS; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	This study presents an integration of fuzzy sets theory with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to model landslide hazar. The approach involves developing expert knowledge from existing landslide datasets which are used for standardizing digital terrain attributes, a pairwise comparison method for the elicitation of attribute weights, and their subsequent aggregation through weighted linear combination (WLC) and ordered weighted average (OWA) function to generate landslide hazard maps. The approach enhances the methodology for modeling landslide hazard in roaded and road-less areas through the derivation of probabilistic maps. The maps can be used as a decision support tool in forest management and planning. A case study from the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho, USA, illustrates the application of the approach in a practical setting.

Our early research has resulted in a flock clustering algorithm that can achieve better performance than the K-means or the Ant clustering algorithms for data clustering. This algorithm generates a clustering of a given set of data through the embedding of the high-dimensional data items on a two-dimensional grid for efficient clustering result retrieval and visualization. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired clustering model, the Multiple Species Flocking clustering model (MSF), and present a distributed multi-agent MSF approach for document clustering.

Bagged K-means clustering of metabolome data	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						clustering; metabolomics; correlation; resampling; bootstrap aggregating; bagging; perturbing metabolome models; validation	ENZYME-KINETIC EQUATIONS; 2,3-BISPHOSPHOGLYCERATE METABOLISM; INTERPRETING CORRELATIONS; NETWORKS; MODEL	Clustering of metabolomics data can be hampered by noise originating from biological variation, physical sampling error and analytical error. Using data analysis methods which are not specially suited for dealing with noisy data will yield sub optimal solutions. Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is a resampling technique that can deal with noise and improves accuracy. This paper demonstrates the possibilities for bagged clustering applied to metabolomics data. The metabolomics data used in this paper is computer-generated with the human red blood cell model. Perturbing this model can be done in several ways. In this paper, inhibition experiments are mimicked inhibiting enzyme activity to 10% of its original value. Comparing bagged K-means clustering to ordinary K-means, the number of metabolites switching clusters under the influence of heteroscedastic noise is lower if bagging is used. This favors bagged K-means above ordinary K-means clustering when dealing with noisy metabolomics data. A special validation scheme, independent of the addition of noise, has been devised to demonstrate the positive effects of bagging on clustering.

This article present an image characterization method based on rate distortion analysis in the feature space. This space is coded using clustering as vector quantization (k-means). Since image information usually cannot be coded by single clusters, because there are image regions corresponding to groups of clusters, the rate and distortion are specifically defined. The rate distortion curve is analyzed, extracting specific features for implementing a database image classification system.

It compares a new self-controlled growing neural network with a recent growing k-means algorithm. A critical issue is the identification of the "right" number of clusters, which is externally validated by the JUMP-criterion. The empirical application counters several objections recently raised against the use of cluster analysis for market segmentation.

As a consequence we obtain consistency and qualitative resistance of the data based estimates. A simplified approximate computational method is also given.

K-means algorithm and its application for clustering companies listed in Zhejiang province	Data Mining VII: Data, Text and Web Mining and Their Business Applications	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Data, Text and Web Mining and Their Business Application and Management Information Engineering	JUL 11-13, 2006	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Wessex Inst Technol, Czech Tech Univ Prague, Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro, WIT Transact Informat & Commun Technol		K-means algorithm; clustering analysis; financial ratios; listed companies		There exist many problems in the credit market where we have data that needs to be classified into distinct groups. This paper will introduce a financial K-means algorithm, which based on the historical financial ratios, applies the cluster analysis technology to analyze the listed enterprises in Zhejiang province. We analyze indicators related to financial attributes and choose nine finance indicators. According to better valuation on the companies listed, we apply "trial and error" and choose four as the number of clustering. Testing shows that companies belong to cluster 2 and cluster 3 add up to 71 companies, including 87% in all. They are all companies worthy of making loans, which is inconsistent with the good economic situation of Zhejiang province. Category 4 has nine companies including 11% that are judged as high risk business. So banks should provide these customers for loans with a mortgage or guarantee.

This work is based on the Brazilian census geo-referenced data for the revenue and education level of 540 districts in a mid-size city. The data was analyzed by k-means clustering algorithms for determination of groups of similar behavior based only on the revenue and education level data. The groups were then plotted into the city map using geo-referenced information. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of groups of equivalent socio-economic levels, taking into account the uncertainty of the classification process. The results show that the model is able to represent the distribution of the social groups in an inter-related and continuous space.

The aim is not to predict a continuous variable (regression) or a categorical variable (classification) but to construct a hierarchy. The dendrogram of the hierarchy is easy to interpret and can be read as decision tree. An example of this new type of dendrogram is given on a small categorical dataset. DIVCLUS-T is then compared empirically with two polythetic clustering methods: the Ward ascendant hierarchical clustering method and the k-means partitional method. The three algorithms are applied and compared on six databases of the UCI Machine Learning repository.

The key of the approach is to construct document cluster models as semantic chunks capturing the core semantic relationships in the ontology-enriched scale-free graphical representation of documents. These document cluster models are used for both document clustering and text summarization by constructing Text Semantic Interaction Network (TSIN). Our extensive experimental results indicate our approach shows 45% cluster quality improvement and 72% clustering reliability improvement, in terms of misclassification index, over Bisecting K-means as a leading document clustering approach. In addition, our approach provides concise but rich text summary in key concepts and sentences. The primary contribution of this paper is we introduce a coherent biomedical literature clustering and summarization approach that takes advantage of ontology-enriched graphical representations. Our approach significantly improves the quality of document clusters and understandability of documents through summaries.

An efficient clustering algorithm based on Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization, called QPSO-clustering, is presented in this article. Three data sets are employed to test the performance of QPSO-clustering. Performance comparison among k-means Clustering, PSO-clustering and QPSO-clustering are also provided. The experimental results show that QPSO-clustering provides better performance than PSO-clustering as well as having less parameter to control than PSO-clustering.

The classical K-means algorithm required the k value to be pre-designated. However, it was difficult to designate precise k value in actual applications, which restricted the extensive application of K-means algorithm. An effective algorithm to solve optimal k value, using distance expense function based on Euclidean distance for verifying validity of optimal cluster number, was given in this paper. At the same time, the upper limit of k value was given and the experience rule was reasonably proved. Above all, computed the inside distance and outside distance of clustering, and computed respective distance expense with different k, and then the k value with minimum distance expense was the optimal cluster number. Finally, the algorithm is applied in practice.

The m-VRPTW is a variant of the VRPTW in which only a limited number of vehicles are available, whose feasible solution may include some un-served customers due to the limited vehicles. The primary objective of m-VRPTW is to maximize the number of customers served, while the second is to minimize the total travel distance. We present a new two-stage heuristic to solve m-VRPTW, we firstly introduced adaptive k-means to create initial solutions, with an Ejection Pool (EP) to hold temporarily un-served customers and an Adaptive Memory to keep good solutions. What's more, we proposed a new operator called Transfer to improve our initial solutions. Then, we minimized the total distance using an improved AMP algorithm(IAMP). The experimental results show consistently good performance of our algorithm when compared with other methods.

Distance-based clustering algorithms rarely have the means to autonomously come up with the correct number of clusters from the data. A recent approach to identifying the natural clusters is to compare the point densities in different parts of the sample space. In this paper we put forward an agglomerative clustering algorithm which accesses density information by constructing a Voronoi diagram for the input sample. The volumes of the point cells directly reflect the point density in the respective parts of the instance space. Scanning through the input points and their Voronoi cells once, we combine the densest parts of the instance space into clusters. Our empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm is able to come up with a high-accuracy clustering for many different types of data.

Cluster Analysis is an unsupervised learning technique that takes large collections of data points and attempts to identify clusters of similar points. More formally, it tries to create clusters to optimize various mathematical properties, such as minimizing the maximum spread of each cluster, or minimizing the sum of the spreads. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to create clusters from a data set, including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and expectation maximization. Association Rules have become one of the central tools in transactional data mining. They can also be applied as a way of looking for correlations and associations within epidemiological data. Support Vector Machines are a popular classification method which produce linear classifiers in the form of cutting hyperplanes, which divide the space into positive and negative examples. Through the so-called "kernel-trick" it can also produce non-linear rules by projecting the data into a different space. Statistical Techniques are a bedrock of epidemiological study, through sampling, hypothesis testing, experiment design, and inference techniques. An important suite of methods draw on Bayesian inference, giving more interpretable confidence bounds and simpler model fitting. Boosting is a very influential technique for "boosting" the quality of classifier-based methods by varying the emphasis put on examples to focus the classification method on the "harder examples". The output of a number of rules is then combined by taking a weighted majority vote. The method has been extended to a wide variety of settings, and applied to a large number of different scenarios. External Memory Algorithms are needed when the volume of data being processed exceeds the internal (fast) memory of the machine, and means that some data must reside on external (slow) memory, ie disks. Such methods give deep insights into the structure and properties of the underlying algorithms.

FileShare (R) is a commercial collaborative digital library offering facilities for sharing and accessing documents over a simple Internet browser (e.g. Microsoft (R) Internet Explorer (R), Netscape (R) or Opera (R)) within groups of people working on common projects. As the number of documents increases within a digital library, displaying these documents in this environment poses a huge challenge. This paper proposes a document clustering method that uses a modified version of the traditional K-Means algorithm to categorize documents by their themes using lexical chaining within the FileShare R repository. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised, and has shown very high accuracy in a typical experimental setup.

We separated port scans, ICMP scans, and vulnerability scans from the malicious activity. In the remaining attack data, over 78% (i.e., 3,677 attacks) targeted port 445, which was then statistically analyzed. The goal was to find the characteristics that most efficiently separate the attacks. First, we separated the attacks by analyzing their messages. Then we separated the attacks by clustering characteristics using the K-Means algorithm. The comparison between the analysis of the messages and the outcome of the K-Means algorithm showed that 1) the mean of the distributions of packets, bytes and message lengths over time are poor characteristics to separate attacks and 2) the number of bytes, the mean of the distribution of bytes and message lengths as a function of the number packets are the best characteristics for separating attacks.

This paper contributes to research on location problems by proposing a reactive multiagent approach. Particularly, we deal with the p-median problem, where the objective is to minimize the weighted distance between the demand points and the facilities. The proposed model relies on a set of agents (the facilities) situated in a common environment which interact and attempt to reach a global optimization goal: the distance minimization. The interactions between agents and their environment, which is based on the artificial potential fields approach, allow us to locally optimize the agent's location. The optimization of the whole system is then obtained from a self-organization of the agents. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by computational results based on a set of comparisons with the k-means clustering technique.

Objective technical measures of learning performance are difficult to develop, but are extremely important for both teachers and learners. Learning performance assessment using learning portfolios or web server log data is becoming an essential research issue in web-based learning, owing to the rapid growth of e-learning systems and real application in teaching scenes. The traditional summative evaluation by performing examinations or feedback forms is usually employed to evaluate the learning performance for both the traditional classroom learning and the web-based learning. However, summative evaluation only considers final learning outcomes without considering learning processes of learners. This study presents a learning performance assessment scheme by combining four computational intelligence theories, i. e., the proposed refined K-means algorithm, the neuro-fuzzy classifier, the proposed feature reduction scheme, and fuzzy inference, to identify the learning performance assessment rules using the web-based learning portfolios of an individual learner. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative assessment results of grade levels. In other words, this scheme can help teachers to assess individual learners precisely utilizing only the learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment. Additionally, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and designing courseware since they save a lot of time in evaluating learning. This idea can be beneficially applied to immediately examine the learning progress of learners, and to perform interactively control learning for e-learning systems. More significantly, teachers could understand the factors influencing learning performance in a web- based learning environment according to the obtained interpretable learning performance assessment rules.

Once we've established the presence of the cloud in the latter images, we determine the origin of the cloud in the earlier ones and track its propagation. Gas usually expands from point sources and it is difficult to know whether it is significant when it occupies merely a few pixels in the image. After the gas size expands, it is easier to analyze as an interesting anomalous feature. Our algorithm includes techniques such as the improved K-Means classification, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), match filter and tracking; in the paper we will show results based on real data taken by the "FIRST" camera (Field-portable Imaging Radiometric Spectrometer Technology).

J	Bryan, BA				Bryan, BA			Synergistic techniques for better understanding and classifying the environmental structure of landscapes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						landscape; GIS; ecological land classification; environmental gradients; cluster; multivariate analysis	ECOLOGICAL LAND CLASSIFICATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUZZY K-MEANS; RESERVE COVERAGE; SOUTH-CAROLINA; FOREST; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; TOOL; REPRESENTATIVENESS	The desire to capture natural regions in the landscape has been a goal of geographic and environmental classification and ecological land classification (ELC) for decades. Since the increased adoption of data-centric, multivariate, computational methods, the search for natural regions has become the search for the best classification that optimally trades off classification complexity for class homogeneity. In this study, three techniques are investigated for their ability to find the best classification of the physical environments of the Mt. Lofty Ranges in South Australia: AutoClass-C (a Bayesian classifier), a Kohonen Self-Organising Map neural network, and a k-means classifier with homogeneity analysis. AutoClass-C is specifically designed to find the classification that optimally trades off classification complexity for class homogeneity. However, AutoClass analysis was not found to be assumption-free because it was very sensitive to the user-specified level of relative error of input data. The AutoClass results suggest that there may be no way of finding the best classification without making critical assumptions as to the level of class heterogeneity acceptable in the classification when using continuous environmental data. Therefore, rather than relying on adjusting abstract parameters to arrive at a classification of suitable complexity, it is better to quantify and visualize the data structure and the relationship between classification complexity and class homogeneity. Individually and when integrated, the Self-Organizing Map and k-means classification with homogeneity analysis techniques also used in this study facilitate this and provide information upon which the decision of the scale of classification can be made. It is argued that instead of searching for the elusive classification of natural regions in the landscape, it is much better to understand and visualize the environmental structure of the landscape and to use this knowledge to select the best ELC at the required scale of analysis.

J	Herzberg, PY; Roth, M				Herzberg, PY; Roth, M			Beyond resilients, undercontrollers, and overcontrollers? An extension of personality prototype research	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY			English	Article							LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; AGE 26; VALIDATION; INVENTORY; NUMBER; REPLICABILITY; REPLICATION; CHILDHOOD; CHILDRENS	Prototypes of personality were investigated in two studies. In study I, clusters of Big-Five-based prototypes were examined using a general population sample of 1908 German adults. Convergent evidence suggested the appropriateness of a five-cluster solution, which corresponds to previously identified temperament based prototypes. In study II, the five-cluster solution was cross-validated in a sample of 256 prisoners. Moreover, it was shown that a population-based approach (using discriminant functions derived from study I) was superior over the traditional sample-based cluster approach (using Ward followed by k-means). The authors argue that future typological research can be sufficiently grounded on a five-prototype concepti. on rather than on a three-prototype conception, and suggest a new and flexible assignment procedure.

J	Chan, ZSH; Collins, L; Kasabov, N				Chan, ZSH; Collins, L; Kasabov, N			An efficient greedy K-means algorithm for global gene trajectory clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						K-means clustering; gene expression data; greedy elimination method	SYSTEM	Optimal clustering of co-regulated genes is critical for reliable inference of the underlying biological processes in gene expression analysis, for which the K-means algorithm have been widely employed for its efficiency. However, given that the solution space is large and multimodal, which is typical of gene expression data, K-means is prone to produce inconsistent and sub-optimal cluster solutions that may be unreliable and misleading for biological interpretation. This paper applies a novel global clustering method called the greedy elimination method (GEM) to alleviate these problems. GEM is simple to implement, yet very effective in improving the global optimality of the solutions. Experiments over two sets of gene expression data show that the GEM scores significantly lower clustering errors than the standard K-means and the greedy incremental method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A closely related problem is that of selecting a clustering algorithm that is optimal in some way from a rather impressive list of clustering algorithms that currently exist. In this paper, we propose two validation measures each with two parts: one measuring the statistical consistency (stability) of the clusters produced and the other representing their biological functional consistency, so that a good clustering algorithm should have a small value for these measures. We illustrate our methods using two sets of expression profiles obtained from a breast cancer data set. Six well known clustering algorithms UPGMA, K-Means, Diana, Fanny, Model-Based and SOM were evaluated. Whereas the exact ordering depends on the particular data set (expression profiles) used and the validation measure employed, overall UPGMA appears to be the optimal for this cancer data set that we considered.

Clustering algorithms are of crucial importance when there are no labels associated to textual information or documents. The aim of clustering algorithms, in the text mining domain, is to group documents concerning with the same topic into the same cluster, producing a flat or hierarchical structure of clusters. In this paper we present a Knowledge Discovery System for document processing and clustering. The clustering algorithm implemented in this system, called Induced Bisecting k-Means, outperforms the Standard Bisecting k-Means and is particularly suitable for on line applications when computational efficiency is a crucial aspect.

In this paper, optimal associative neighbor mining, using attributes, for the purpose of improving accuracy and performance in ubiquitous recommendation systems, is proposed. This optimal associative neighbor mining selects the associative users that have similar preferences by extracting the attributes that most affect preferences. The associative user pattern comprising 3-AUs (groups of associative users composed of 3-users), is grouped through the ARHP algorithm. The approach is empirically evaluated, for comparison with the nearest-neighbor model and k-means clustering, using the MovieLens datasets. This method can solve the large-scale dataset problem without deteriorating accuracy quality.

Conclusively, our results suggest that weight-based variable selection is more useful for market segmentation than full-based and SEM-based variable selection. Additionally, a two-level SOM is more accurate in classification than K-means and SOM. The critical segmentation variables and the characteristics of target customers were different among countries. Therefore, online game companies should develop diverse marketing strategies based on characteristics of their target customers using research framework we propose.

Our central claim is that the structure of the taxonomy encapsulates background knowledge that can be exploited to improve classification accuracy. Under our hierarchical Dirichlet generative model for the document corpus, we show that the unsupervised classification algorithm provides robust estimates of the classification parameters by performing regularization, and that our algorithm can be interpreted as a regularized EM algorithm. We also propose a technique for the automatic choice of the regularization parameter. In addition we propose a regularization scheme for K-means for hierarchies. We experimentally demonstrate that both our regularized clustering algorithms achieve a higher classification accuracy over simple models like minimum distance, Naive Bayes, EM and K-means.

Exploring structurally similar protein sequence motifs using relative-distance measures	Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Sensing and Information Processsing, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Intelligent Sensing and Information Processing	DEC 15-18, 2006	Bangalore, INDIA	Univ Melbourne, Inst Engineers, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PATTERNS	Protein sequence motifs are short conserved subsequences common to related protein sequences. Information about motifs is extremely important to the study of biologically significant conserved regions in protein families. These conserved regions can determine the functions and conformation of proteins. Conventionally, recurring patterns of proteins are explored using short protein segments and classification based on similarity measures between the segments. Two protein sequences are classified into the same class if they have high homology in terms of feature patterns extracted through sequence alignment algorithms. Such methodology focuses on finding position specific motifs only. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to explore protein sequences by studying subsequences with relative-positioning of amino acids followed by K-Means clustering of fixed-sized segments. The dataset used for our work is most updated among studies for sequence motifs. The various biochemical tests that are found in literature are used to test the significance of motifs and these tests show that motifs generated are of both structural and functional interest. The results suggest that this method may also be applied to closely-related area of finding DNA motifs.

Traditional distance measures fail to differentiate the furthest point from the nearest point in very high dimensional data space. To tackle the problem, we design minimal subspace distance which measures the similarity between two points in the subspace where they are nearest to each other. It can discover subspace clusters implicitly when measuring the similarities between points. We use the new similarity measure to improve traditional k-means algorithm for discovering clusters in subspaces. By clustering with low-dimensional minimal subspace distance first, the clusters in low-dimensional subspaces are detected. Then by gradually increasing the dimension of minimal subspace distance, the clusters get refined in higher dimensional subspaces. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and algorithm.

Supplier relationship management (SRM) is a business strategy to reduce logistic costs and improve business performance and competitiveness. Effective categorization of suppliers is an important step in supplier relationship management. In this paper, we present a data-driven method to categorize suppliers from the suppliers' business behaviors that are derived from a large number of business transactions between suppliers and the buyer. A supplier business behavior is described as the set of product items it has provided in a given time period, a mount of each item in each order, the frequencies of orders, as well as other attributes such as product quality, product arrival time, etc. Categorization of suppliers based on business behaviors is a problem of clustering high dimensional data. We used the k-means type subspace clustering algorithm FW-KMeans to solve this high dimensional, sparse data clustering problem. We have applied this algorithm to a real data set from a food retail company to categorize over 1000 suppliers based on 11 months transaction data. Our results have produced better groupings of suppliers which can enhance the company's SRM.

Use of k-means cluster analysis for dimensional reduction and maximum sensitivity for RIFE resulted in 64-gene models with fewer invariant and correlated features when compared with PCA and mimimum error. In conclusion, k-means cluster analysis and sensitivity may be better suited for classifying diseases for which gene expression is more strongly influenced by pathway heterogeneity.

The task is considered as the estimation of similarity transformations between the query pattern and target object. Two steps accounting for the scaling and rotation/translation parts are carried out, facilitated by applying EMD (earth mover's distance) to search the correspondence between focused point sets. In order to reduce the computation complexity involved in the second step, we use K-means algorithm to cluster the vertices of each model. We report our early experiments testing the efficiency of the proposed method on a small database as well as detailed discussions and the outline for the future work.			chenwei@cad.zju.edu.cn					COHEN S, 1999, STANCSTR991620; Funkhouser T, 2004, ACM T GRAPHIC, V23, P652, DOI 10.1145/1015706.1015775; MOTOFUMI T, 2003, P INT C MOD SIM MS20, P323; MOTOFUMI T, 2004, WORLD SCI ENG ACAD S, V3, P125; OSADA R, 2002, ACM T GRAPHIC, V21, P93; TAUBIN G, 1995, FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION, PROCEEDINGS, P902; UMEYAMA S, 1991, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V13, P376, DOI 10.1109/34.88573	7	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		3-540-45916-2	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2006	4223						438	447				10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BFD14	WOS:000241106000051

As it compares pixel by pixel, it takes a lot of execution time. This paper addresses a novel framework for head detection with minimum time and high accuracy. To detect head from motion pictures, motion segmentation algorithm is employed. The novelty of this paper carried out with the following steps: frame differencing, preprocessing, detecting edge lines and restoration, finding the head area and cutting the head candidate, Moreover, nested K-means algorithm is adopted to find head location and statistical modeling is employed to determine face or non-face class, while Bayesian Discriminating Features (BDF) method is employed to verify the faces. Finally, the proposed system is carried out with a lot of experiments and a recognizable success is notified.

The model consists of three components. First, it contains a process that deals with representation and preprocessing of imprecise load time series. Second, it adopts a similarity metric that uses interval semantic separation (Interval SS)-based measurement. Third, it applies the similarity metric together with the k-means clustering method to construct clusters. The model gives a unified way to solve imprecise time series clustering problem and it is applied in a real world application, to find similar consumption patterns in the electricity industry. Experimental results have demonstrated the applicability and correctness of the proposed model.

It takes advantage of multiple cascade face detector fusion by context. We propose the filtering classifier method for illumination face image. And then we constructed cascade classifier from applied different filtering method. The multiple cascade detectors made from six single context detectors. Six contexts are divided k-means algorithm, and classify illuminant. In this paper, we proposed the classifier fusion method by using correlation between face images. The proposed face detection achieves the capacity of the high level attentive process by taking advantage of the context-awareness using the information from illumination. We achieved very encouraging experimental results having varying illuminant.

This paper discusses the large-scale geomorphological characteristics of China based on numerical analysis of terrain parameters and develop a methodology for characterizing landforms from DEMs. The methodology is implemented as a two-step process. First, terrain variables are derived from a 1-km DEM in a given statistical unit including local relief, the earth's surface incision, elevation variance coefficient, roughness, mean slope and mean elevation. Second, every parameter regarded as a single-band image is combined into a multi-band image. Then ISODATA unsupervised classification and the Bayesian technique of Maximum Likelihood supervised classification are applied for landform classification. The resulting landforms are evaluated by the means of Stratified Sampling with respect to an existing map and the overall classification accuracy reaches to rather high value. It's shown that the derived parameters carry sufficient physiographic information and can be used for landform classification. Since the classification method integrates manifold terrain indexes, conquers the limitation of the subjective cognition, as well as a low cost, apparently it could represent an applied foreground in the classification of macroscopic relief forms. Furthermore, it exhibits significance in consummating the theory and the methodology of DEMs on digital terrain analysis.

This paper proposes a new integrated approach to road identification on high resolution multi-spectral imagery. The input images are first segmented using a traditional k-means clustering on normalized digital numbers. The road cluster is then automatically identified using a fuzzy logic classifier. A number of shape descriptors of angular texture signature are introduced for a road class refinement, i.e. to separate the roads from the buildings and parking lots that have been misclassified as roads. Intensive experiments have shown that the proposed methodology is effective in automating the separation of roads from buildings and parking lots on high resolution multi-spectral imagery.

However, no computational model has arisen that mimics human texture perception adequately. In 2000, Payne, Hepplewhite, and Stoneham and in 2005, Van Rikxoort, Van den Broek, and Schouten achieved mappings between humans and artificial classifiers of respectively around 29% and 50%. In the current research, the work of Van Rikxoort et al. was replicated, using the newly developed, online card sorting experimentation platform M-HinTS: http://eidetic.ai.ru.nl/M-HinTS/. In two separate experiments, color and gray scale versions of 180 textures, drawn from the OuTex and VisTex texture databases were clustered by 34 subjects. The mutual agreement among these subjects was 51% and 52% for, respectively, the experiments with color and gray scale textures. The average agreement between the k-means algorithm and the participants was 36%, where k-means approximated some participants up to 60%. Since last year's results were not replicated, an additional data analysis was developed, which uses the semantic labels available in the database. This analysis shows that semantics play an important role in human texture clustering and once more illustrate the complexity of texture recognition. The current findings, the introduction of M-HinTS, and the set of analyzes discussed, are the start of a next phase in unraveling human texture recognition.

The genetic algorithm is used to find the segmentation points for deriving appropriate patterns. In the fitness evaluation, the proposed algorithm first divides subsequences in a chromosome into k clusters by using the k-means clustering approach. The Euclidean distance is then used to calculate the distance of each subsequence and evaluate a chromosome. The discrete wavelet transformation is also used to adjust the length of the subsequences for comparing their similarity since their length may be different. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can get good effects in finding appropriate segmentation patterns in time series.

It is difficult to confirm accurately the value of k in reality. This paper proposes an improved genetic k-means algorithm (IGKM) and constructs a fitness function defined as a product of three factors, maximization of which ensures the formation of a small number of compact clusters with large separation between at least two clusters. At last, two artificial and three real-life data sets are considered for experiments that compare IGKM with k-means algorithm, GA-based method and genetic k-means algorithm (GKM) by inter-cluster distance (ITD), inner-cluster distance(IND) and rate of separation exactness. The experiments show that IGKM can automatically reach the optimal value of k with high accuracy.

A data object is represented by an uncertainty region over which a probability density function (pdf) is defined. One method to cluster uncertain objects of this sort is to apply the UK-means algorithm, which is based on the traditional K-means algorithm. In UK-means, an object is assigned to the cluster whose representative has the smallest expected distance to the object. For arbitrary pdf, calculating the expected distance between an object and a cluster representative requires expensive integration computation.

On the lower bound of local optimums in K-means algorithm	ICDM 2006: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering method used in many different fields of computer science, such as data mining, machine learning and information retrieval. However the k-means algorithm is very likely to converge to some local optimum which is much worse than the desired global optimal solution. To overcome this problem, current k-means algorithm and its variants usually run many times with different initial centers to avoid being trapped in local optimums that are of unacceptable quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to compute a lower bound on the cost of the local optimum from the current center set. After every k-means iteration, k-means algorithm can halt the procedure if the lower bound of the cost at the future local optimum is worse than the best solution that has already been computed so far Although such a lower bound computation incurs some extra time consumption in the iterations, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that this method can greatly prune the unnecessary iterations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm in most of the data sets, especially with high dimensionality and large k.

In our algorithm, natural language processing techniques and frequent itemset mining techniques are utilized to automatically generate meaningful generalized sentence patterns (GSPs) from subjects of emails. Then we put forward a novel unsupervised approach which treats GSPs as pseudo class labels and conduct email clustering in a supervised manner, although no human labeling is involved. Our proposed algorithm is not only expected to improve the clustering performance, it can also provide meaningful descriptions of the resulted clusters by the GSPs. Experimental results on open dataset (Enron email dataset) and a personal email dataset collected by ourselves demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-means algorithm in terms of the popular measurement Fl. Furthermore, the cluster naming readability is improved by square 8.5% on the personal email dataset.

Nowadays more studies are focusing on the quality issue but less on the scalability one. We introduce a genetic clustering algorithm to partition the source data, guaranteeing that the intra-similarity will be high but the inter-similarity will be low. The clustering process is off-line running. Our empirical results show that the is of genetic clustering based collaborative filtering recommender system outperforms the memory-based one in scalability, and outperforms the k-means clustering based one and the memory-based one in recommendation quality.

The algorithm employs two strategies. Firstly, a two-layer structure of a color image is established Then, an improved K-means with integer based lookup table implementation is applied to each layer. The clustering result on the upper layer (lower resolution) is used to guide the clustering in the lower layer (higher resolution). Experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than the original K-means algorithm while producing comparable segmentation results.

Firstly the CT image is segmented by the K-means clustering algorithm and Canny edge detection operator to obtain two images with clear regions and distinct edges respectively. Secondly these two images are synthesized to form a new one by the information fusion method based on features. The advantage of the method is that value K and the initial clustering centroids are determined automatically according to the image histogram and no need for the rectification of images before the images are fused. Experimental results show that the images are clearly segmented into multi-regions and the distinct image edges are preserved simultaneously as well.

In order to reduce the data dimensionality without losing much information, Principle Components Analysis was applied to the scaled spectral data prior to the classification. The influences of different scaling methods have been evaluated as well. The least classification error is achieved by the hierarchical clustering technique with the average linkage applied to the data set, in which each spectrum is scaled by its maximum amplitude.

The independent variables in this k-means cluster analysis model are skewness, kurtosis, asymmetry, and cross correlation following the phi - q - n PD patterns obtained from the fingerprint analysis which is a digital signal processing technique for PD measurement. The experiments were set to simulate all four PD patterns to obtain statistical parameters into 10 independent variables from the fingerprint analysis. This document recommends using 8 final clusters instead of using 4 final clusters to achieve the accuracy of using this k-means cluster approach to 100 percent.

In this paper, we propose two minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithms. The first algorithm produces a k-partition of a set of points for any given k. The algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree of the point set and removes edges that satisfy a predefined criterion. The process is repeated until k clusters are produced. The second algorithm partitions a point set into a group of clusters by maximizing the overall standard deviation reduction, without a given k value. We present our experimental results comparing our proposed algorithms to k-means and EM. We also apply our algorithms to image color clustering and compare our algorithms to the standard minimum spanning tree clustering algorithm.

We start this process by generating spin images on meshes. These local shape descriptors are then quantized via k-means clustering. The key contribution of this paper is to represent a global 3D shape as the spatial configuration of a set of specific local shapes. We achieve this goal by computing the distributions of the Euclidean distance of pairs of local shape clusters. Because of the spatial, sparse distribution of local shapes defined over a 3D model, an indexing data structure is adopted to reduce the space complexity of the proposed shape descriptor. The technical merits of our new approach are at least two-fold: (1) It is robust to non-trivial shape occlusions and deformations, since there are statistically a large number of chances that some local shape signatures and their spatial layouts are unchanged and users can easily identify those unchanged parts; (2) It is more discriminative than a simple collection of local shape signatures, since the spatial layouts of a global shape are explicitly computed.

Evaluation of different fitness functions integrated wit genetic algorithm on unsupervised classification of satellite images - art. no. 63650U	Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XII	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XII	SEP 13-14, 2006	Stockholm, SWEDEN	SPIE Europe		unsupervised classification; Genetic Algorithm; Davies-Bouldin's index; K-Means algorithm	VALIDITY	in traditional unsupervised classification method, the number of clusters usually needs to be assigned subjectively by analysts, but in fact, in most situations, the prior knowledge of the research subject is difficult to acquire, so the suitable and best cluster numbers are very difficult to define. Therefore, in this research, an effective heuristic unsupervised classification method-Genetic Algorithm (GA) is introduced and tested here, because it can be through the mathematical model and calculating procedure of optimization to determine the best cluster numbers and centers automatically. Furthermore, two well-known models--Davies-Bouldin's and the K-Means algorithm, which adopted by most research for the applications in pattern classification, are integrated with GA as the fitness functions. In a word, in this research, a heuristic method-Genetic Algorithm (GA), is adopted and integrated with two different indices as the fitness functions to automatically interpret the clusters of satellite images for unsupervised classification. The classification results were compared to conventional ISODATA results, and to ground truth information derived from a topographic map for the estimation of classification accuracy. All image-processing program is developed in MATLAB, and the GA unsupervised classifier is tested on several image examples.

Image Analysis is devoted to extrapolate, process and visualize image information. For this reason it has found application also in Microarray, where it is a crucial step of this technology (e.g. segmentation). In this paper we describe MISP (Microarray Image Segmentation Pipeline), a new segmentation pipeline for Microarray Image Analysis. The pipeline uses a recent segmentation algorithm based on statistical analysis coupled with K-Means algorithm. The Spot masks produced by MISP are used to determinate spots information and quality measures. A software prototype system has been developed; it includes visualization, segmentation, information and quality measure extraction. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline both in terms of visual accuracy and measured quality values. Comparisons with existing solutions (e.g. Scanalyze [1]) confirm the improvement with respect to previously published works.

A set of DCT coefficients as observation vectors obtained from original images by a window are clustered by K-means method using to be the feature of face images. These classified features are applied to train HMMs, so as to get the parameters of systems. Based on the proposed method, both Yale face database and ORL face database are tested. Compared to the other methods relevant to HMM methods reported so far on the two face databases, experimental results by proposed method have shown a better recognition rate and lower computational complexity cost.

As visual brain atrophy evaluation is difficult, an automated method for estimating intracranial volume from MR brain images is developed. The proposed method consists of three steps, specifically skull stripping, image segmentation and volume calculation. The present method uses a combination of morphological operations followed by connected component labeling for extracting the brain mask from the original axial brain slices. The skull stripped images are then segmented into the three tissues namely Gray matter, While matter and Cerebrospinal Fluid. We use an efficient clustering technique namely, Weighted K-means clustering algorithm, to segment the brain tissues. The volumes of the segmented tissues are calculated and compared using Trapezoidal Estimation method and Cavalieri's method and some sample results are presented.

Comparison experiments between KICA and two other methods, PCA and ICA, are per-formed. Three clustering algorithms, including weighted graph partitioning, k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and two similarity measures, including Euclidean and Pearson correlation, are also evaluated. The results indicate that KICA is an efficient feature extraction approach for gene expression data clustering. Our empirical study showed that clustering with the components instead of the original variables does improve cluster quality. In particular, the first few components by KICA capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with components has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would recommend KICA before clustering gene expression data.

Our method is based on a multiscale Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and relies on the assumption that in the neighborhood of some (unknown) scales and time-frequency points, only one source contributes to the mixture. Such time-frequency regions provide local estimates of the corresponding columns of the mixing matrix. Our main contribution is a new clustering algorithm called DEMIX to estimate the number of sources and the mixing matrix based on such local estimates. In contrast to DUET or other similar sparsity-based algorithms, which rely on a global scatter plot, our algorithm exploits a local confidence measure to weight the influence of each time-frequency point in the estimated matrix. Inspired by the work of Deville, the confidence measure relies on the time-frequency local persistence of the activity/inactivity of each source. Experiments are provided with stereophonic mixtures and show the improved performance of DEMIX compared to K-means or ELBG clustering algorithms.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper demonstrates several different data modeling techniques - decision trees, neural networks, market-basket analysis and K-means models. Decision trees build rule sets that can abet future decision making. Neural networks try to predict future outcomes by looking at the effects of historical inputs. Market-basket analysis shows the strength of the relationships between variables. K-means models weigh the impact of homogenous clusters on target variables. All of these models are demonstrated using real data gathered by the Department of Transportation from fatal accidents at red-light-signal controlled intersections in Maryland and Washington, DC from the year 2000 through 2003. Findings - The results of the DM analysis will show predictable relationships between the demographic data of drivers and fatal accidents; the type of collision and fatal accidents and between the time of day and fatal accidents. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of missing or incomplete data sets are addressed in this paper.

Speaker verification system - Based on the stochastic modeling	Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics I			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Informatics in Control Automation and Robotics (ICINCO 2004)	AUG 25-28, 2004	Setubal, PORTUGAL			speaker verification; vector quantization; Gaussian mixture models		In this paper we propose a new speaker verification system where the new training and classification algorithms for vector quantization and Gaussian mixture models-are introduced. The vector quantizer is used to model sub-word speech components. The code books are created for both training and test utterances. We propose new approaches to normalize distortion of the training and test code books. The test code book quantized over the training code book. The normalization technique includes assigning the equal distortion for training and test code books, distortion normalization and cluster weights. Also the LBG and K-means algorithms usually employed for vector quantization are implemented to train Gaussian mixture models. And finally, we use the information provided by two different models to increase verification performance. The performance of the proposed system has been tested on the Speaker Recognition database, which consists of telephone speech from 8 participants. The additional experiments has been performed on the subset of the NIST 1996 Speaker Recognition database which include.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one such algorithm based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of ants. Taking advantage of the ACO in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper proposes a novel document clustering approach based on ACO. Unlike other ACO-based clustering approaches which are based on the same scenario that ants move around in a 2D grid and carry or drop objects to perform categorization. Our proposed ant-based clustering approach does not rely on a 2D grid structure. In addition, it can also generate optimal number of clusters without incorporating any other algorithms such as K-means or AHC. Experimental results on the subsets of 20 Newsgroup data show that the ant-based clustering approach outperforms the classical document clustering methods such as K-means and Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering. It also achieves better results than those obtained using the Artificial Immune Network algorithm when tested in the same datasets.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most common methodology in such studies. In order to measure the volume of putamen in MR image, accurate segmentation method is highly desirable. In practice, the inhomogeneity effect in MR imaging process generates gradual changes in white-to-gray matter contrast in putamen area, which makes segmentation task rather difficult. In the present study, an adaptive fuzzy rule base (FRB) system is proposed and applied to both simulated and real MR images for putamen segmentation. Comparing to FSL (FMRIB Software Library)'s Automatic Segmentation Toolbox (FAST), K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed adaptive FRB system demonstrates better performance in putamen segmentation.

Combining two data mining methods for system identification	INTELLIGENT COMPUTING IN ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Workshop of the European-Group-for-Intelligent-Computing-in-Engineering	JUN 25-30, 2006	Ascona, SWITZERLAND	European Grp Intelligent Comp Engn			RECOGNITION	System identification is an abductive task which is affected by several kinds of modeling assumptions and measurement errors. Therefore, instead of optimizing values of parameters within one behavior model, system identification is supported by multi-model reasoning strategies. The objective of this work is to develop a data mining algorithm that combines principal component analysis and k-means to obtain better understandings of spaces of candidate models. One goal is to improve views of model-space topologies. The presence of clusters of models having the same characteristics, thereby defining model classes, is an example of useful topological information. Distance metrics add knowledge related to cluster dissimilarity. Engineers are thus better able to improve decision making for system identification and downstream tasks such as further measurement, preventative maintenance and structural replacement.

However, collaborative filtering does not use attributes of items at all. In this paper, associative neighborhood according to the representative attribute, for the purpose of improving accuracy and performance in collaborative filtering system, is proposed. This associative neighborhood selects the associative users that have similar preferences by extracting the representative attribute that most affect the preference. The approach is empirically evaluated, for comparison with the nearest-neighbor model and k-means clustering, using the EachMovie dataset. This method was found to significantly outperform the previous method.			kyjung@sangji.ac.kr					Connor M.O., 1999, P ACM SIGIR WORKSH R; Ding C, 2004, P INT C MACH LEARN I, P225, DOI 10.1145/1015330.1015408; Han E.H., 1997, P SIGMOD 97 WORKSH R, P9; Herlocker JL, 2004, ACM T INFORM SYST, V22, P5, DOI 10.1145/963770.963772; Jung KY, 2004, IEICE T INF SYST, VE87D, P2781; Karypis G., 2000, CSTR0046 U MINN COMP; Kim TH, 2005, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3809, P1150; KO SJ, 2002, LNCS, V2454, P212; Wang J, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3936, P37; Yu H., 2003, P C EMP METH NAT LAN	10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0170-8643		3-540-37255-5	LECT NOTES CONTR INF			2006	344						839	844				6	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science	BEZ62	WOS:000240383400106		
J	Korkmaz, EE; Du, J; Alhajj, R; Barker, K				Korkmaz, Emin Erkan; Du, Jun; Alhajj, Reda; Barker, Ken			Combining advantages of new chromosome representation scheme and multi-objective genetic algorithms for better clustering	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						clustering; genetic algorithms; linkage-encoding; k-means; multi-objective	K-MEANS ALGORITHM	Various methods have been proposed to utilize Genetic Algorithms (GA) in handling the clustering problem. GA work on encoded strings, namely chromosomes, and the representation of different clusters as a linear structure is an important issue about the usage of GA in this domain. In this paper, we present a novel encoding scheme that uses links to identify clusters in a partition. Particularly, we restrict the links so that objects to be clustered form a linear pseudo-graph. A one-to-one mapping is thus achieved between the genotype and phenotype spaces. The other feature of the proposed approach is the use of multiple objectives in the process. One of the two objectives we use is to minimize the Total Within Cluster Variation (TWCV), identical to the one used by other k-means clustering approaches. However, unlike other k-means methods, number of clusters is not required specified in advance. Combined with a second objective, minimizing the number of clusters in a partition, our approach obtains the optimal partitions for all the possible numbers of clusters in the Pareto Optimal set returned by a single GA run. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested using two well-known data sets, namely Iris Data and Ruspini Data. The obtained results are compared with the output of the classical Group Number Encoding and it has been observed that a clear improvement has been achieved with the new representation.

In the presented method, the dataset is firstly divided into several subsets and then K-means clustering is implemented in each subset. The clusters are classified by their group size. The centroids with small group size are eliminated and the rest centroids are used for SVR training. The relationships between the group sizes and the noisy clusters are discussed and simulations are also given. Results show that FDPP cleans most of the noises, preserves the useful statistical information and reduces the training samples. Most importantly, FDPP runs very fast and maintains the good regression performance of SVR.

The inadequacies in these algorithms leads us to investigate a family of performance functions which exhibit superior clustering on a variety of data sets over a number of different initial conditions. In each case, we derive a fixed point algorithm for convergence by finding the fixed point of the first derivative of the performance function. We give illustrative results on a variety of data sets. We show how one of the algorithms may be extended to create a new topology-preserving mapping.

Security tests are essential to identify vulnerabilities, but experts must analyze very large data and complex information. Unsupervised learning can help by clustering groups of devices with similar vulnerabilities. However an index to evaluate every solution should be calculated to demonstrate results validity. Also the value of the number of clusters should be tuned for every data set in order to find the best solution. This paper introduces SOM as a clustering method to evaluate complex and uncertain knowledge in Consensus, a distributed security system for vulnerability testing; it proposes new metrics to evaluate the cohesion of every cluster, and also the cohesion between clusters; it applies unsupervised algorithms and validity metrics to a security data set; and it presents a method to obtain the best number of clusters regarding these new cohesion metrics: Intracohesion and Intercohesion factors.

Therefore, in this paper, an algorithm that accelerates the global k-means with similarity functions algorithm without significantly affecting the quality of the solution is proposed. Our algorithm called fast global k-means with similarity functions algorithm is tested and compared against the k-means with similarity functions algorithm and the global k-means with similarity functions algorithm.

In this paper, we illustrate how to use background knowledge related to a domain more efficiently. For a given data, the number of classes is investigated by using the must-link constraints before clustering and these must-link data are assigned to the corresponding classes. When the clustering algorithm is applied, we make use of the cannot-link constraints for assignment. The proposed clustering approach improves the result of COP k-means by about 10%.

Although the weights obtained by variable weighting methods can be used for the purpose of variable selection (or, elimination), they alone hardly provide a clear guide on selecting variables for subsequent analysis. In addition, variable selection and variable weighting are highly interrelated with the choice on the number of clusters. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric data clustering method, based on the W-k-means type clustering, for an automated and joint decision on selecting variables, determining variable weights, and deciding the number of clusters. Conclusions are drawn from computational experiments with random data and real-life data.

In this paper, the 'High quality object image' means that the image of the object is in focus and not blurred, the S/N ratio is high enough, the size of the object in the image is kept unchanged, and the position the object appearing at the image center. To achieve our goal, we use K-means tracker algorithm for tracking object in image sequence which taken by the active cameras. We use the result of the K-means tracker to control the angular position and speed of each pan-tilt-zoom unit by employing PID control scheme. By using two cameras, binocular stereo vision algorithm can be used to obtain 3D position and velocity of the object. These results are used for adjust the focus and the zoom. Moreover, our system let two cameras fix its eyes on one point in 3D space. However, this system may be unstable, when time response loses by interfering in a mutual control loop too much, or by hard restriction of cameras action. In order to solve these problems, we introduced a concept of reliability into K-means tracker, and propose a method for controlling active cameras by using relative reliability. We produce the prototype system. Though extensive experiments we confirmed that we can obtain in focus and motion- blur-free images of a high-speed moving object at video rate.

First, we describe how we use the k-means clustering algorithm for off-line identification of learner groups with distinguishing interaction patterns who also show similar learning improvements with an ELE. We then discuss how a k-means on-line classifier, trained with the learner groups detected off-line, can be used for adaptive support in ELEs. We aim to show the value of a data-based approach for recognizing learners as an alternative to knowledge-based approaches that tend to be complex and time-consuming even for domain experts, especially in highly unstructured ELEs.

The K-means algorithm, a nonhierarchical clustering algorithm, has regained popularity among researchers in data mining and knowledge discovery, partly because of its low time complexity. The algorithm requires the number of clusters as an input parameter When the parameter value is not known a priori, a researcher often has to use a cluster validity index to search for a suitable parameter value. In this study, we use computational experiments to examine the performance of cluster validity indices with the K-means algorithm. Our analysis parallels the study performed by Milligan and Cooper on cluster validity indices; we use hierarchical clustering algorithms and present observations and conclusions resulting from the simulation study.

The enormity and diversity of the visual contents on the web images adds another dimension to this challenging task. Moreover, the retrieval of web images cannot be easily achieved with images of other than trivial collections, and therefore one needs to put more cognitive load on the users. Based on the groupings, effective indices can however be built for an image database. In this paper, we show how a specific high-level classification problem can be solved from relatively basic low-level visual features geared for the particular classes. We have developed a procedure to qualitatively measure the saliency of a feature towards a classification problem based on the discrimination power of the HSV color histograms, which capture the visual characteristics of each of the images were computed. We found that the HSV color histogram mainly the hue component, has the most discriminative power for the classification problem of our interest. A k-means classifier is used for the classification, which results in an accuracy of 90.5% when evaluated on an image database of 2,738 web images. The images are classified as full faces, natural sceneries, events and city images. Our final goal is to use this classification knowledge to enhance the performance of content-based image retrievals by filtering out images from irrelevant classes during the matching.

Design/methodology/approach-Questionnaire data from 51 buyers in automaker firms and 72 supplier firms were subjected to K-means cluster analyses to establish relationship groups in the two samples. Differences across the groups were tested using A-NOVA and Scheffe tests. Findings-Three relationship types (captive supplier, market exchange, and strategic partnership) were identified both in the buyer and supplier data. Significant differences were observed in terms of contextual (product and supplier characteristics), managerial (information exchange and cooperation), and social climate variables (mutual understanding, payoff equity, and satisfaction). Turkish buyers were found to strategically segment their suppliers based on product and supplier characteristics, whereas supplier groups were differentiated along social climate variables. Research limitations/implications-The Turkish results differ somewhat from the ones for developed countries, which suggests that more work should be conducted in emerging economies. Future research that uses matched pairs of buyers and suppliers may provide in-depth insights. Practical implications-The results demonstrated a perception (hence, communication) gap between buyers and suppliers in how they differentiated relationship types. Strategic partnership led to cooperation in both samples, and to satisfaction, mutual understanding, and equity in the supplier sample. Originality/value-This study used data from both parties, contrasted buyer-supplier relationships in an emerging market with those in developed markets, and highlighted the effects of the industry's historical evolution on the present state of buyer-supplier relationships.

In the last few years, calcitriol intravenously (IV) has been used with success in the treatment of the HPTH, secondary to chronic renal failure. However, the effects of calcitriol on the hematological parameters of these patients have never been well evaluated. This study included 11 elderly CHD patients (f = 6, m = 5; mean age = 73.6 years, mean time on CHD = 42.8 months) with HPTH under EPO therapy (TV). They were treated for 12 months with calcitriol IV (mean dose = 2.33 mcg/pt/week). Patients with iron deficiency anemia (ferritin < 200 ng/ml) were excluded. The patients were compared before and after 12 months of calcitriol treatment, with respect to several laboratory parameters and with respect to EPO dose. A paired t-test was used. After treatment, we found a decrease of PTH (634 vs. 418 pg/ml, P = 0.029); the serum calcium increased (8.8 vs. 9.9 mg/dl, P = 0.002); no differences were noted in the plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, phosphorous, BUN, creatinine, Na and K. Mean levels of Hb (10.2 vs. 11.4 g/dl, P = 0.004) and the Hct (30% vs. 34.3%, P = 0.004) increased after 12 months of calcitriol; the levels of serum iron (70 vs. 78 mu g/dl, P = ns) and ferritin (531 vs. 785 ng/ml, P = ns) and the EPO dose (105 vs. 100 U/kg/week, P = ns) were similar before and after treatment. Our data show that the treatment of HPTH in CHD elderly patients with calcitriol can increase Hb level without increasing EPO dose.

These methods were developed and successfully tested in the context of a large-scale commercially deployed system that takes in over ten million calls each month. Dialog sensitive language models are typically built by clustering dialog histories into groups that elicit similar responses. A key innovation in this paper is to use an EM clustering procedure in lieu of a k-means clustering procedure that is typically used. The EM procedure results in clusters with higher log-probability which we argue leads to better recognition performance. Additionally, we empirically observe that the EM approach has much better worst case behavior than the k-means approach as it pertains to local optima.

For the first, we use additional bigram features to approximate trigram and tetragram features. For the second, we first apply K-means clustering to identify non-Chinese characters. Then, we employ a two-tagger architecture: one for Chinese text and the other for non-Chinese text. Finally, we post-process our CWS output using automatically generated templates. Our results show that additional bigrams can effectively identify more unknown words. Secondly, using our two-tagger method, segmentation performance on sentences containing non-Chinese words is significantly improved when non-Chinese characters are sparse in the training corpus. Lastly, identification of long NEs and long words is also enhanced by template-based post-processing. Using corpora in closed task of SIGHAN CWS, our best system achieves F-scores of 0.956, 0.947, and 0.965 on the AS, HK, and MSR corpora respectively, compared to the best context scores of 0.952, 0.943, and 0.964 in SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005. In AS, this performance is comparable to the best result (F = 0.956) in the open task.	Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan	Tsai, RTH (reprint author), Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

In Phase I, the hybrid method uses the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to pre-cluster the aligned sequences, while in the second phase it takes the pre-clustering result as the initial partition for the profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based k-means partition clustering method. Such initial partitions (generated from Phase I), as against random initial partitions, are usually more reasonable and thus can avoid the inconsistency problem in the partition clustering methods due to the randomness in initial partitions. In addition, the inaccuracy of the hierarchical agglomerative clustering methods can be compensated by the profile HMM based k-means partition clustering since the latter is model-based and can better describe the dynamic properties of the data in a cluster. Experiments on a molecular sequence dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed hybrid clustering algorithm.

This paper presents some metaheuristic approaches as an alternative to the traditional clustering techniques, like K-Means or C-Means. They are based on some metaheuristic optimization algorithms as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony. The developed techniques have the advantage that they could escape more efficiently from local minima. Additionally, an application on Failure Detection in a Hydraulic System was developed and the obtained results are competitive with some well known techniques.

Our approach achieves this by exploiting the evolutionary computing and reinforcement learning techniques inherent to such systems. The purpose of the work is to develop an approach to learning rules which accurately describe clusters without prior assumptions as to their number within a given dataset. Favourable comparisons to the commonly used k-means algorithm are demonstrated on a number of datasets.

SimPoint uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically find repetitive (similar) patterns in a program's execution, and it chooses one sample to represent each unique repetitive behavior. Together these samples represent an accurate picture of the complete execution of the program. SimPoint is based on the k-means clustering algorithm: recent work proposed using a different clustering method based on multinomial models, but only provided a preliminary comparison and analysis. In this work we provide a detailed comparison of using k-means and multinomial clustering for SimPoint. We show that k-means performs better than the recently proposed multinomial clustering approach. We then propose two improvements to the prior multinomial clustering approach in the areas of feature reduction and the picking of simulation points which allow multinomial clustering to perform as well as k-means. We then conclude by examining how to potentially combine multinomial clustering with k-means.

Carmel	CROSS-TAXON CONGRUENCE; SPECIES-RICHNESS; RESERVE SELECTION; INDICATOR GROUPS; SOUTH-AFRICA; CONSERVATION STRATEGIES; PRIORITY AREAS; DIVERSITY; COMPLEMENTARITY; CLASSIFICATION	A recent debate concerns the relative merit of the two major types of surrogates for biodiversity, biological Surrogates and environmental surrogates. Evidence, in the form of direct comparison of these two surrogate types, is scarce. We conducted a direct comparison of the performance of a series of biological and environmental surrogates, at a local scale (300 km(2)), which is often the relevant scale for land planning and management. Performance was referred to as the degree Of Surrogate congruence with a spatial pattern of diversity of woody species, of geophytes, and of land snails. "Environmental domains", surrogates based on numerical classification of environmental variables (topography, soil, and vegetation cover), outperformed other environmental surrogates (qualitatively delineated vegetation units and physiographic land types). The environmental domains surrogates were robust to subjective decisions on a number of classes and on input variables that drove the classification. The best biological surrogate was the woody species diversity pattern, with performance similar to that of the environmental domains. Our results support the notion that environmental domains may be reliable and cost-effective surrogates for biodiversity at small scales, particularly in data-poor regions.

Seven days backward trajectories were calculated daily with HYSPLIT-4 model for Izana Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Observatory (28.3 degrees N 16.5 degrees W, 2367 m a.s.l.). These back-trajectories were classified by means of a k-means clustering strategy. The daily air masses have been coded using 16 variables to detect the aerosol load of each one of them. Four clusters were found: Cluster 1, representative of Atlantic oceanic middle troposphere air masses, (OMT), has an average frequency of occurrence of 50.6%. Cluster 2, which includes air masses originated in the African continent (AfD), has been recorded in a 19.8% of time. Cluster 3 represents a mixture at least of two of the next sources: Europe, Africa and Ocean, (EAM), with a frequency of 12.7%. Finally, Cluster 4 includes air masses with a high load of maritime aerosols, (MaA), and it has been detected in a 16.9%. An analysis of four aerosol components: NO3-, NH4+, non-sea-salt-SO42-, and mineral dust and its relation with the origin and transport of the air masses have been done. The highest quantities of mineral dust and nss-SO42- are linked with African air masses with a mean value of 86.5 and 1.9 mu g/m(3) respectively. Whereas the highest levels of NO3-, 1.0 mu g/m(3), and NH4+, 0.4 mu g/m(3), were obtained for AfD and EAM. The lowest levels were associated with OMT and MaA air masses types: 12.7, 0.6, 0.2, and 0.5 mu g/m(3) for dust, NO3-, NH4+, and nss-SO42- in average for the four studied years. However, it is remarkable that the values of the median for dust are 2.2 and 3.5 mu g/m(3) in clusters MaA and OMT respectively. Using non-parametric statistical tests the distributions of concentrations in each cluster by year have been compared in order to detect similarities. The results show that the aerosol loads of OMT and MaA air masses are quite similar and the same occurs for AfD and EAM air masses. However, the correlation analysis between the levels of anions and ammonium evidenced important differences among the air mass types. In AfD air masses is clear a low correlation between levels of nss-SO42- and NH4+ (r(2) = 0.08) suggesting that the sulfate speciation was dominated by sulfate species others than ammonium sulfate, such as calcium sulfate. CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O (gypsum) is mainly present in the coarse mode, where the radiative effects of sulfate are less important that in the accumulative mode. For OMT air masses is noticeable an important increasing on the correlation between the levels of anions and those of NH4+ for the two last years of the study period (1997-1998, r(2) = 0.61 -0.85%) with respect to the first ones (1995-1996, r(2) = 0.25-0.49%), coinciding with the second strongest ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event recorded. This behavior indicates a change in the speciation of the aerosol component.

J	Caballero, J; Fernandez, M				Caballero, J; Fernandez, M			Linear and nonlinear modeling of antifungal activity of some heterocyclic ring derivatives using multiple linear regression and Bayesian-regularized neural networks	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING			English	Article						QSAR analysis; neural network; Bayesian regularization; heterocyclic ring derivatives; antifungal activity	MOLECULAR DESCRIPTORS; SET; PREDICTION; SELECTION; REDUCTASE; SPECTRA; DRUGS; QSARS	Antifungal activity was modeled for a set of 96 heterocyclic ring derivatives (2,5,6-trisubstituted benzoxazoles, 2,5-disubstituted benzimidazoles, 2-substituted benzothiazoles and 2-substituted oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridines) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) techniques. Inhibitory activity against Candida albicans (log(1/C)) was correlated with 3D descriptors encoding the chemical structures of the heterocyclic compounds. Training and test sets were chosen by means of k-Means Clustering. The most appropriate variables for linear and nonlinear modeling were selected using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach. In addition to the MLR equation (MLR-GA), two nonlinear models were built, model BRANN employing the linear variable subset and an optimum model BRANN-GA obtained by a hybrid method that combined BRANN and GA approaches (BRANN-GA). The linear model fit the training set (n=80) with r(2)=0.746, while BRANN and BRANN-GA gave higher values of r(2)=0.889 and r(2)=0.937, respectively. Beyond the improvement of training set fitting, the BRANN-GA model was superior to the others by being able to describe 87% of test set (n=16) variance in comparison with 78 and 81% the MLR-GA and BRANN models, respectively. Our quantitative structure-activity relationship study suggests that the distributions of atomic mass, volume and polarizability have relevant relationships with the antifungal potency of the compounds studied. Furthermore, the ability of the six variables selected nonlinearly to differentiate the data was demonstrated when the total data set was well distributed in a Kohonen self-organizing neural network (KNN).

K-means cluster analysis revealed two distinct biphasic gene expression patterns that contained 44 genes (including 18 immediate early genes), involved in cell signaling and plasticity (i.e. MAP2K7, Sprouty2, Irs-2, Homer1, GPRC5B, Grasp). The first gene induction phase occurred at 0-3 h of reperfusion, and the second at 9-15 h, and was validated by in situ hybridization. Four gene clusters displayed a progressive increase in expression over time and included 50 genes linked to cell motility, lipid synthesis and trafficking (i.e. ApoD, NPC1, G3P-dehydrogenase1, and Choline kinase) or cell death-regulating genes such as mitochondrial CLIC. We conclude that a biphasic transcriptional up-regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways occurs in surviving tissue, concomitant with a progressive and persistent activation of cell proliferation signifying tissue regeneration, which provide the means for cell survival and postischemic brain plasticity.

Numerous optimal stresses are determined for each extracted subset of data, and the clusters of these stresses are thought to represent significant solutions. Hitherto, the clusters have had to be visually recognized on stereonets. This study computerized the identification of the clusters by using the kappa-means clustering technique. We tested the technique using artificial datasets with known solutions. As a result, it was found that the present method detected objectively the correct solutions. In addition, the spread of each cluster was evaluated to indicate the confidence levels of the identified stresses that were represented by the cluster centers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Saturated biomarkers (n-alkanes, isoprenoids, steranes and triterpanes) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Based on the distribution and abundance of these compounds, a large number of source and maturation parameters were calculated, particularly those most often used in correlation studies of oils. The examined samples were classified according to their origin and level of thermal maturity using factor, cluster and discriminant analyses. According to the source and maturation parameters, combined factor and cluster analyses using the Ward method enabled the categorization of the investigated oils into three groups. The cluster Ward analysis was shown to be of greater susceptibility and reliability. However, in addition to the two aforementioned methods, K-Means cluster analysis and discriminant analysis were shown to be necessary for a more precise and detailed categorization in the case of a large number of samples in one group. Consequently, it was concluded that factor and cluster K-Means and Ward analyses can generally be used for the interpretation of saturated biomarkers in correlation studies of oils, but the observed results have to be checked, i.e., confirmed by discriminant analysis.

The most remarkable advantage of SOM-based two-stage methods is in saving time without the considerable computations required by conventional clustering methods for large and complicated data sets. In this research, we propose and evaluate a two-stage clustering method, which combines an ant-based SOM and K-means. The ant-based SOM clustering model, ABSOM, embeds the exploitation and exploration rules of state transition into the conventional SOM algorithm to avoid falling into local minima. After application to four practical data sets, the ABSOM itself not only performs better than Kohonen's SOM but also it works very well in the two-stage clustering analysis when it is taken as the preprocessing technique for the ABSOM+K-means method.

To save their time and effort in searching the designs they want, the user-adapting recommendation system is required. In this paper, Automatic Classification for Grouping designs (ACG) in a Fashion Design Recommendation Agent System (FDRAS) is proposed. The ACG algorithm groups designs into clusters based on these classified designs. It is possible that if the design requires simultaneous regrouping in all other groups, the ACG algorithm can be used to improve efficiency of information retrieval and sorting, in the FDRAS datasets. The proposed method is evaluated on a large database, significantly outperforming the nearest-neighbor model and k-mean clustering in the prototype user-adapting FDRAS. This method can solve the large-scale dataset problem without deteriorating accuracy quality.			kyjung@sangji.ac.kr					ALSABTI K, 1998, P WORKSH HIGH PERF D; Herlocker JL, 2004, ACM T INFORM SYST, V22, P5, DOI 10.1145/963770.963772; Hwang JH, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3481, P966; Jung KY, 2004, IEICE T INF SYST, VE87D, P2781; Jung KY, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2736, P631; Ko SJ, 2001, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2113, P211; Kohrs A., 1999, Proceedings ACM Multimedia 99, DOI 10.1145/319463.319467; Torres R., 2004, Proceedings of the Fourth ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (IEEE Cat.

The approach adopts similarity analyses, which is based on Shannon Information Theory, to determine topic distribution among text documents without incorporating thesaurus information and other auxiliary knowledge bases. It first observes the documents in terms of consistency of distribution from the viewpoint of individual word and then constructs a number of segmentation proposals accordingly. Furthermore, it employs the K-means clustering technique to get a consensus from these proposals and finally partition text into a set of topic coherent paragraphs. Through extensive experimental studies based on real and synthetic data sources, the performance analysis illustrates the effectiveness of the approach in text segmentation.

The relationship between observed pixel intensities and distance between pixels are introduced to the traditional neighbourhood potential function, which described the probability of pixels being classified into one class. To perform an unsupervised segmentation, the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) is used to determine the class number. The K-means is employed to initialise the classification and calculate the mean values and variances of the classes. The segmentation is transformed to maximize a posteriori (MAP) procedure. Then, the Iterative Conditional Model (ICM) is employed to solve the MAP problem. In the experiments, the proposed method is adopted with K-means, traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) and MRF image segmentation techniques, for noisy image segmentation applying on synthetic and real images. The experiment results and the histogram of signal to noise ratio (SNR)-miss classification ratio (MCR) showed that the proposed algorithm is the better choice.

The binary part is transformed into the directional data (spherical representation) by a weight transformation which is induced from the consideration of the similarity between binary objects and of the natural definition of descriptive measures. At the same time, the spherical representation of the continuous part is given by the use of multidimensional scaling on the sphere. Combining the binary part and continuous part, like the latitude and longitude, we obtained a spherical representation of mixed data. Using the descriptive measures on a sphere, we obtain the clustering algorithm for mixed data based on k-means method. Finally, the performance of this clustering is evaluated by actual data.

The validity of the clustering algorithms can be quantified computing several performance indices. Each performance index enhances some statistical property of the obtained data partitions. Performance indices are not equivalent, and they can even lead to quite different conclusions from the same data partitions. To show this, we have applied two well known clustering algorithms (K-means, Fuzzy c-means) and some supervised classification algorithms to a well known multispectral image. We compare the ground truth partition with the ones found by the clustering and supervised algorithms The values of the diverse performance indices over the same partitions vary and can lead to quite different conclusions.

The proposed system is composed of face detection, eye detection and head nod and head shake detection. We use motion segmentation algorithm that makes use of differencing to detect moving people's faces. The novelty of this paper comes from the differencing in real time input images, preprocessing to remove noises (morphological operator and so on), detecting edge lines and restoration, finding the face area and cutting the head candidate. Moreover, we adopt K-means algorithm for finding head. Eye detection extracts the location of eyes from the detected face region. It is performed at the region close to a pair of eyes for real-time eye detecting. Head nod and shake can be detected by HMMs those are adapted by a directional vector. The HMMs vector can also be used to determine neutral as well as head nod and head shake. These techniques are implemented on a lot of images and a notable success is notified.

Understanding this mechanism is an important open problem in data mining. Our new theoretical approach (based on spectral clustering and translational symmetry) explains why the cluster centers of k-means naturally tend to form sinusoidal patterns.

How related is some web site to another is a question that depends on how we represent web sites. Traditionally, vectors and graphs have been two important structures to represent individuals in a population. Both representations can play an important role in the web area if hyperstructure is considered. By analyzing the way web sites are linked, we can build vectors or graphs to understand how a web site collection is partitioned. In this paper, we analyze these two models and four associated algorithms: k-means and self-organizing maps (SOM) with vectors, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms with graphs. For testing these ideas we clustered some web sites in the Central American web. We compare the results for clustering this web site collection using both models and show what kind of clusters each one produces.

Traditional spectral clustering algorithms first solve an eigenvalue decomposition problem to get the low-dimensional embedding of the data points, and then apply some heuristic methods such as k-means to get the desired clusters. However, eigenvalue decomposition is very time-consuming, making the overall complexity of spectral clustering very high, and thus preventing spectral clustering from being widely applied in large-scale problems. To tackle this problem, different from traditional algorithms, we propose a very fast and scalable spectral clustering algorithm called the sequential matrix compression (SMC) method. In this algorithm, we scale down the computational complexity of spectral clustering by sequentially reducing the dimension of the Laplacian matrix in the iteration steps with very little loss of accuracy. Experiments showed the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

The pups entered the water during their first week of life and their diving performance increase progressively with age. All pups spent most of their time at sea (55 to 74%), and their swimming activity was greater at nighttime compared with daytime. Dive performance in relation to pup age was poorer compared with other phocid seal species. Dive types were classified using a combination of hierarchical and k-mean clustering. We found 3 dive types: 1 V-shaped and 2 U-shaped. The most common type was U-1-dives, mainly used by older pups during 44 to 48% of their total dive time. These dives were relatively deep and long (mean depth = 11.6 +/- 9.5 m, mean duration = 149.1 +/- 80.6 s). They had long bottom times (100 +/- 67 s), suggesting that pups were foraging. Pups appeared to start feeding at the end of lactation.

Cardiac motion estimation by using high-dimensional features and K-Means clustering method	MEDICAL IMAGING 2006: IMAGE PROCESSING, PTS 1-3	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Medical Imaging 2006 Conference	FEB 12-14, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		K-means clustering method; non rigid registration; cardiac motion estimation; high dimensional features	MR IMAGE SEQUENCES; MYOCARDIAL MOTION; NONRIGID REGISTRATION; TRACKING; DEFORMATIONS; HEART	Tagged Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently the reference modality for myocardial motion and strain analysis. Mutual Information based non rigid registration has proven to be an accurate method to retrieve cardiac motion and overcome many drawbacks present on previous approaches. In a previous work,(1) we used Wavelet-based Attribute Vectors (WAVs) instead of pixel intensity to measure similarity between frames. Since the curse of dimensionality forbids the use of histograms to estimate MI of high dimensional features, k-Nearest Neighbors Graphs (kNNG) were applied to calculate alpha-MI. Results showed that cardiac motion estimation was feasible with that approach. In this paper, K-Means clustering method is applied to compute MI from the same set of WAVs. The proposed method was applied to four tagging MRI sequences, and the resulting displacements were compared with respect to manual measurements made by two observers. Results show that more accurate motion estimation is obtained with respect to the use of pixel intensity.

These studies indicate that women with high breast density have a four to six fold risk increase. An investigation of whether or not this relation is causal is important for, e.g., hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has been shown to actually increase the density. No gold standard for automatic assessment of mammographic density exists. Manual methods such as Wolfe patterns and BI-RADS are helpful for communication of diagnostic sensitivity., but they are both time consuming and crude. They mail be sufficient in certain cases and for single measurements, but for serial, temporal analysis it is necessary to be able to detect more subtle changes and, in addition, to be more reproducible. In this work an automated method for measuring the effect of HRT w.r.t. changes in biological density in the breast is presented. This measure is a novel measure, which provides structural information orthogonal to intensity-based methods. Hessian eigenvalues at different scales are used as features and a clustering of these is employed to divide a mammogram into four structurally different areas. Subsequently, based on the relative size of the areas, a density score is determined. In the experiments. two sets of mammograms of 50 patients from a double blind, placebo controlled HRT experiment were used. The change in density for the HRT group, measured with the new method, was significantly higher (p = 0.0002) than the change in the control group.

This poor distribution of gray levels reduces the overall contrast and the texture differences between individual organs, and poses a serious visualization problem since radiologists need clear visual representations of organs to produce proper diagnoses. In order to enhance the contrast within the soft tissues, the gray levels can be redistributed both linearly and nonlinearly using the gray level frequencies of the original CT scan. We propose a new nonlinear approach for contrast enhancement of soft tissues in CT images using both clipped binning and nonlinear binning based on a k-means clustering algorithm. The optimal number of bins, in particular the number of gray-levels, is chosen automatically using entropy and average distance between the histogram of the original gray-level distribution and the contrast enhancement function's curve. The contrast enhancement results were obtained and evaluated using 141 CT images of the chest and abdomen from two normal CT studies.

Most of the approaches adopt unsupervised color clustering. This works compares the most spread color clustering algorithms, namely median cut, k-means, fuzzy-c means and mean shift applied to a method for automatic border extraction, providing an evaluation of the upper bound in accuracy that can be reached with these approaches. Different tests have been performed to examine the influence of the choice of the parameter settings with respect to the performances of the algorithms. Then a new supervised learning phase is proposed to select the best number of clusters and to segment the lesion automatically. Examples have been carried out in a large database of medical images, manually segmented by dermatologists. From these experiments mean shift was resulted the best technique, in term of sensitivity and specificity. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of the goodness of segmentation has been validated by the human experts too, confirming the results of the quantitative comparison.

For each subject, 3 artifact-free ERPs were computed under each condition. A modified fuzzy k-mean clustering method based on shape similarity is applied to the grand mean ERPs and the statistical analysis is performed to define the significance of each segmentation map. In the results, positive and negative conditions showed different spatiotemporal patterns of ERP. The results were in accord with other emotional study by fMRI or PET.

J	Bednorz, E				Bednorz, Ewa			A white Christmas or a Christmas thaw? - Changes in snow cover depth in German-Polish lowlands during the last decade of December against daily circulation patterns	METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article								Snow cover occurrence in the German-Polish lowlands during the third decade of December in years 19712000 was investigated. Synoptic maps and anomaly composite maps for the days with snowfalls and for the thaw days have been constructed based on the daily sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential heights data. The decrease in the snow cover depth is related to lows over the east Atlantic and west Europe, causing southwesterly airflow. Three types of circulation favourable for snow cover formation have been distinguished, using the k-means cluster analysis. Two of them cause air advection from the north. The third type is characterized by high pressure gradient and a dynamic, deep low shifting from the west to central Europe.

Researches indicate that both the scale and quality of seeds set greatly restrict the performance of semi-supervised clustering. A novel semi-supervised clustering algorithm named DE-Tri-training semi-supervised K means is proposed. In new algorithm, prior to initializing cluster centroids, the training process of a semisupervised classification approach named Tri-training is used to label the unlabeled data and add them into initial seeds to enlarge the scale. Meanwhile, to improve the quality of enlarged seeds set, a Nearest Neighbor Rule based data editing technique named Depuration is introduced into the Tri-training process to eliminate and correct the noise and mislabeled data among the enlarged seeds. Experiments show that novel algorithm can effectively improve the initialization of cluster centroids and enhance clustering performance.

The set of "best extractors" are automatically selected among the Gabor filters, Co-occurrence matrix, Law's energies and intensity response. Noise-features elimination is performed by taking into account the magnitude and the granularity of each feature image, i.e. the compute image when a specific feature extractor is applied. Redundant features are merged by means of probabilistic rules that measure the similarity between a pair of image feature. Then, cascade applications of general purpose image segmentation algorithms (K-Means, Graph-Cut and EC-GMMF) are used for computing the final segmented image. Additionally, we propose an evolutive gradient descent scheme for training the method parameters for a benchmark image set. We demonstrate by experimental comparisons, with stat of the art methods, a superior performance of our technique.

First, we present a hybrid cluster-based estimator and show its potential to save energy while keep the estimation performance. Next the optimal tradeoff between the cluster size and the number of clusters is analyzed for a special network ring network. Then, we propose two greedy algorithms to cluster the general sensor networks to minimize the total energy cost of cluster-based estimation scheme by modelling the network as a directed or undirected graph. Simulation results not only show that the energy cost is reduced by cluster-based estimation scheme compared with the parallel estimation scheme while keeping the estimation performance, but also show that more energy is saved by our proposed clustering methods compared with the k-mean clustering method.

The archive of continuous recordings need to be segmented into manageable units so that they can be efficiently browsed and indexed by any video retrieval systems. Many researchers approach the problem in two-pass methods: segmenting the continuous recordings into chunks, followed by clustering chunks. In this paper we propose a novel one-pass algorithm to accomplish both tasks at the same time by imposing time constraints on the K-Means clustering algorithm. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on 62.5 hours of continuous recordings, and the experiment results show that time-constrained clustering algorithm substantially outperforms the unconstrained version.

In this paper, hidden Markov models (HMM) are utilized to recognize the nature of an event occurring in a scene. For this purpose, object trajectories, which are obtained through a successful track, are obtained as a sequence of flow vectors that contain instantaneous velocity and location information. These vectors are clustered by K-means algorithm to obtain a prototype representation. HMMs are trained with sequences obtained from usual motion patterns and abnormality is detected by measuring distances to these models. In order to specify the number of models automatically, a novel approach is proposed which utilizes the clues provided by centroid clustering. Preliminary experimental results are promising for detecting abnormal events.

Effects of group size and lack of sphericity on the recovery of clusters in K-means cluster analysis	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MIXTURE MODEL TESTS; CRITERIA; ALGORITHMS	K-means cluster analysis is known for its tendency to produce spherical and equally sized clusters. To assess the magnitude of these effects, a simulation study was conducted, in which populations were created with varying departures from sphericity and group sizes. An analysis of the recovery of clusters in the samples taken from these populations showed a significant effect of lack of sphericity and group size. This effect was, however, not as large as expected, with still a recovery index of more than 0.5 in the "worst case scenario." An interaction effect between the two data aspects was also found.

We expect that sampling over a large temporal and spatial scale, including environmental changes such as impoundments, will allow us to cover most of the diet plasticity. We also evaluate the efficacy of ordination method in discriminating trophic groups based on fish species diet. Data were obtained from 17 sampling stations sampled monthly from March/96 to February/99 in the Corumba river drainage, before and after the formation of the Corumba reservoir. Diet was determined analysing 9,177 stomach contents from 64 fish species. Trophic categories were discriminated by a non-hierarchic grouping analysis named k-means, applied to diet data. Most of the species presented great trophic plasticity, eating a great variety of food items. Resources availability, estimated from all fish stomach contents, was similar among environments, except in creeks, where it varied more with a large importance of terrestrial insects. K means present satisfactory results, identifying nine trophic groups (detritivores, herbivore-piscivores, insectivore-herbivores, omnivores, invertivores, aquatic insectivores, piscivore-insectivores, piscivores and herbivores).

J	Graf, ABA; Wichmann, FA; Bulthoff, HH; Scholkopf, B				Graf, ABA; Wichmann, FA; Bulthoff, HH; Scholkopf, B			Classification of faces in man and machine	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							OBJECT RECOGNITION; GENDER CLASSIFICATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SHAPE; CATEGORIZATION; REPRESENTATION; MECHANISMS; PERCEPTRON	We attempt to shed light on the algorithms humans use to classify images of human faces according to their gender. For this, a novel methodology combining human psychophysics and machine learning is introduced. We proceed as follows. First, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) on the pixel information of the face stimuli. We then obtain a data set composed of these PCA eigenvectors combined with the subjects' gender estimates of the corresponding stimuli. Second, we model the gender classification process on this data set using a separating hyperplane (SH) between both classes. This SH is computed using algorithms from machine learning: the support vector machine (SVM), the relevance vector machine, the prototype classifier, and the K-means classifier. The classification behavior of humans and machines is then analyzed in three steps. First, the classification errors of humans and machines are compared for the various classifiers, and we also assess how well machines can recreate the subjects' internal decision boundary by studying the training errors of the machines. Second, we study the correlations between the rank-order of the subjects' responses to each stimulus-the gender estimate with its reaction time and confidence rating-and the rank-order of the distance of these stimuli to the SH. Finally, we attempt to compare the metric of the representations used by humans and machines for classification by relating the subjects' gender estimate of each stimulus and the distance of this stimulus to the SH. While we show that the classification error alone is not a sufficient selection criterion between the different algorithms humans might use to classify face stimuli, the distance of these stimuli to the SH is shown to capture essentials of the internal decision space of humans. Furthermore, algorithms such as the prototype classifier using stimuli in the center of the classes are shown to be less adapted to model human classification behavior than algorithms such as the SVM based on stimuli close to the boundary between the classes.

Clustering is an important tool for diversely intelligent systems. So, many works have been researched in the machine learning algorithms. But, some problems are still shown in the clustering. One of them is to determine the optimal number of clusters. In K-means algorithm, the number of cluster K is determined by the art of researchers. Another problem is an over fitting of learning models. The majority of learning algorithms for clustering are not free from the problem. Therefore, we propose a competitive co-evolving support vector clustering. Using competitive co-evolutionary computing, we overcome the over fitting problem of support vector clustering which is a good learning model for clustering. The number of clusters is efficiently determined by our competitive co-evolving support vector clustering. To verify the improved performances of our research, we compare competitive co-evolving support vector clustering with established clustering methods using the data sets form UCI machine learning repository.

The classifier is based on the Dempster-Shafer rule of evidence in the form of Basic Belief Assignment (BBA). This theory combines the evidence obtained from the reference patterns to yield a new BBA. Global k-means is selected as the clustering algorithm as it can overcomes the limitation on k-means clustering algorithm whose performance depends heavily on initial starting conditions selected randomly and requires the number of clusters to be specified before using the algorithm. By testing the classifier on the medical diagnosis benchmark data, iris data and Westland vibration data, one can conclude classifier that uses global k-means clustering algorithm has higher accuracy when compared to the classifier that uses k-means clustering algorithm.

The FCMDK is based on the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm and thus exploits advantageous features of fuzzy clustering techniques. To further improve classification accuracies and deal with nonlinear data, the input data is projected into a feature space of a higher dimensionality. Consequently, nonlinear problems existing in the input space can be solved linearly in the feature space. The divergence-based kernel method adopted in the FCMDK employs a divergence measure between two probability distributions for its similarity measure. By adopting the divergence-based kernel method for probability data, the FCMDK can not only utilize advantageous features of the kernel method but also exploit the statistical nature of the input data. Experiments and results on several MPEG video traffic data sets demonstrate that the classification model employing the FCMDK for clustering GPDF data can archive improvements of 28.19% and 34.60% in terms of False Alarm Rate (FAR) over the models using the conventional k-means and SOM algorithms, respectively.			tnchung@mju.ac.kr; parkd@mju.ac.kr					Bezdek J.

This paper presented a de-interleaving/recognition system of radar pulses based on the combination of SVC and K-means clustering. Compared the conventional de-interleaving system, it can produce more complex and compact clustering boundaries according to the distribution characteristics of data set and has good generalization performance. The simulation experiment result shows that the system can sort efficiently radar signals in the high density and complex pulses environment.

To further enhance the accuracy of wafer lot output time prediction, the concept of input classification is applied to Chen's fuzzy back propagation network (FBPN) approach in this study by pre-classifying input examples with the k-means (kM) classifier before they are fed into the FBPN. Production simulation is also applied in this study to generate test examples. According to experimental results, the prediction accuracy of the intelligent neural system was significantly better than those of four existing approaches: BPN, case-based reasoning (CBR), FBPN without example classification, and evolving fuzzy rules (EFR), in most cases by achieving a 11%-46% (and an average of 31%) reduction in the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) over the comparison basis - BPN.

In some species, these cranial nerves are modified to accomplish additional specific functions. For example, the facial nerve innervated taste buds distributed over the body surface of catfish aid food search. Physiological studies indicate that this extra-oral taste pathway is more sensitive to amino acids than either the glossopharyngeal or vagal systems of the oral cavity. The current investigation seeks to determine if differences in taste cell subtypes might contribute to the observed differences in sensitivity. The distributions of five low molecular weight metabolites, L-alanine, L-aspartate, L-glutamate, GABA, taurine and the tripeptide glutathione, were examined in 2118 individual taste cells innervated by either the facial or vagal nerve of the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. The metabolite profiles of these cells were determined immunocytochemically and subjected to a k-means clustering algorithm. Fifteen cell classes with quantitatively different patterns of metabolite co-localization were identified. All but one small class of two cells were found in both facial and vagal nerve-innervated taste buds. Four classes (9% of the total cells) had high, two classes (17%) had intermediate and the remaining nine classes (74%) had low levels of GABA immunoreactivity. While the functional significance of differences in metabolite profile remains to be determined, taste cell classes were not uniformly distributed across vagal and facial nerve innervated taste buds and may provide an anatomical basis for previously reported differences in gustatory sensitivity.

Work reported is based on sonar data collected by the Volume Search Sonar (VSS), one of the five sonar systems in the AN/AQS-20. Our technique is based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), a time-frequency analysis tool which has become attractive in signal processing. Because FrFT uses linear chirps as basis functions, this approach is better suited for sonar applications. The magnitude of the bottom impulse response is given by the magnitude of the Fractional Fourier transform for optimal order applied to the bottom return signal. Joint time-frequency representations of the signal offer the possibility to determine the time-frequency configuration of the signal as its characteristic features for classification purposes. The classification is based on singular value decomposition of the Choi William distribution applied to the impulse response obtained using Fractional Fourier transform. The set of the singular values represents the desired feature vectors that describe the properties of the signal. The singular value spectrum has a high data reduction potential. It encodes the following signal features: time-bandwidth product, frequency versus time dependence, number of signal components and their spacing. The spectrum is invariant to shifts of the signal in time and frequency and is well suited for pattern recognition and classification tasks. The most relevant features (singular values) have been mapped in a reduced dimension space where an unsupervised classification has been employed for acoustic seabed sediment classification. The theoretical method is addressed and then tested on field sonar data. In our classification we used the central beams. Good agreement between the experimental results and the ground truth is shown. A performance comparison of our method to a k-means based technique is also given.

In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparison study of various document clustering approaches such as three hierarchical methods (single-link, complete-link, and complete link), Bisecting K-means, K-means, and Suffix Tree Clustering in terms of the efficiency, the effectiveness, and the scalability. In addition, we apply a domain ontology to document clustering to investigate if the ontology such as MeSH improves clustering qualify for MEDLINE articles. Because an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization for a domain of interest, the use of ontologies is a natural way to solve traditional information retrieval problems such as synonym/hypernym/ hyponym problems. We conducted fairly extensive experiments based on different evaluation metrics such as misclassification index, F-measure, cluster purity, and Entropy on very large article sets from MEDLINE, the largest biomedical digital library in biomedicine.

Most of the studies of auction assume participants attending the auction are homogeneous. However, this assumption is open to question. In fact, every participant has his own personality, risk attitude, behavior, and cost when attending online auctions. This study takes an empirical approach and uses four variables, time of entry, time of exit, number of bids, and number of jump bids, to find the heterogeneity among bidders. We first used k-means clustering method to identify the types of bidders of online auctions, and then used C5.0 decision tree learning algorithm to find the rules to differentiate bidders. A taxonomy of four types of bidders is proposed in the study, which include observers, adventurers, opportunists, and early players. The results also suggest pacing of the auctions is an important factor that will affect bidder's behavior in online auctions.

Kohonen vector quantization clustering technology is used in this research and is compared with K-means clustering. The data set consists of customer records obtained from a mobile telecommunications service provider. The customers are clustered using various attributes that are broadly grouped under usage, revenue, handset, and service. The clustering results are examined to see the relationships between different types of attributes. The analysis leads to the discovery of several interesting facts about customers that may be of use to mobile service providers.

The inherent speckle content in holographic data causes lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman and Burrows-Wheeler (BW), to perform poorly. Therefore, the combination of lossy quantisation followed by lossless compression is essential for effective compression of digital holograms. Our complex-valued digital holograms of 3D real-world objects were captured using phase-shift interferometry (PSI). Quantisation reduces the number of different real and imaginary values required to describe each hologram. Traditional data compression techniques can then be applied to the hologram to actually reduce its size. Since our data has a nonuniform distribution, the uniform quantisation technique does not perform optimally. We require nonuniform quantisation, since in a histogram representation our data is denser around the origin (low amplitudes), thus requiring more cluster centres, and sparser away from the origin (high amplitudes). By nonuniformly positioning the cluster centres to match the fact that there is a higher probability that the pixel will have a low amplitude value, the cluster centres can be used more efficiently. Nonuniform quantisation results in cluster centres that are adapted to the exact statistics of the input data. We analyse a number of iterative (k-means clustering, Kohonen competitive neural network, SOM, and annealed Hopfield neural network), and non-iterative (companding, histogram, and optimal) nonuniform quantisation techniques. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and highlight important factors that must be considered when choosing between iterative and non-iterative nonuniform quantisation. We measure the degradation due to lossy quantisation in the reconstruction domain, using the normalised rms (NRMS) metric.

This work shows that the objective function of Kernel PCA, i.e. the reconstruction error can be upper bounded by the distortion of K-means algorithm in the feature space. From this relation, we propose a simplification of Kernel PCA's training procedure by Kernel K-means algorithm. The application of preimage reconstruction algorithm allows further simplification and leads to a more computational economic solution.

We use motion segmentation algorithm that makes use of differencing to detect moving people's head. The novelty of this paper comes from adaptive frame differencing, detecting edge lines and restoration, finding the head area and cutting the head candidate. Moreover, we adopt nested K-means algorithm for finding head regions. Our system applies the statistical modeling of face and non - face classes and classifies multiple frontal face images with the Bayesian Discriminating Features (BDF) method to verify. Finally experimental results (using capture diverse image sources for 13 frames per second during 20 seconds and having 260 images per person) shows the feasibility of the differencing based head and Nested K-means Detection method.

This algorithm consists of three steps. First, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are applied to select some important training data. Then, k-mean clustering is used to assign the weight to each training instance. Finally, unseen examples are classified by kNN. Fourteen datasets from the UCI repository were used to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. SV-kNNC is compared with conventional kNN and kNN with two instance reduction techniques: CNN and ENN. The results show that our algorithm provides the best performance, both predictive accuracy and classification time.

The algorithm uses the Gradient-Based Fuzzy C-Means with a Mercer Kernel (GBFCM(MK)) to perform clustering of Gaussian Probability Density Function (GPDF) data of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The GBFCM(MK) algorithm incorporates a kernel method into the GBFCM to implicitly perform nonlinear mapping of the input data into a high-dimensional feature space. Experiments and results for several audio data sets have shown that the GBFCM(MK)-based classification algorithm has accuracy improvements of 3.14%-7.49% over classification algorithms employing the traditional k-means and the Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM), respectively.

The relationship between pixel intensities and distance between pixels are introduced to the traditional neighbourhood potential function To perform an unsupervised segmentation, the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) is used to determine the class number, the K-means is employed to initialise the classification and calculate the mean values and variances of the classes. The segmentation is transformed to maximize a posteriori(MAP) procedure. Then, the Iterative Conditional Model (ICM) is employed to solve the MAP problem. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with other segmentation techniques, for noisy image segmentation applying on synthetic and real images. The experiment results shows that the proposed algorithm is the better choice.

Based on the underlying dynamic mechanism of the sea clutter, to reconstruct the nonlinear model of dynamical phase space, correlation integral (also called C-C method) and Cao method are used to get time delay (tau) and embedding dimension (m) in this paper. Furthermore, an algorithm of Redial Basis Function (RBF) with k-mean clustering to adjust and modify the networks is also presented to predict the nonlinear characteristic sea clutter for the goal of detecting the weak target signals beneath the sea clutter. With the new algorithms, computation complexity can be deduced while its reliability can be greatly improved. It also can satisfy the real-time requirement in real application. More detailed calculates and test results are presented.

To tackle these problems, a hybrid PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and K-Means algorithm, named KPSO clustering, is presented with high performance and without the sensitiveness to the initial starting centers. And then, a KPSO-based Divisive luerarchical Clustering (KPSODHC) method is presented, which aims at an adaptive proper K by terminating the operations of splitting clusters into small ones according to the MinMaxCut threshold. The proposed algorithms are applied to real data-set in contrast to classical K-Means clustering, and the experimental results show that both are effective, and the latter has much potential for its robustness and reliability.

A new method for thermal paint image segmentation is proposed in this paper, which based on color and spatial information. First, PGF algorithm is selected to reduce image's noises and keep the edge feature of image. Furthermore, using K-Means cluster algorithm, colors in the image are quantized to several representing classes that can be used to differentiate regions in the image. Finally, a region growing and merge method is then used to segment the image. Experimental results demonstrate that good segmentation is obtained by our algorithm, and our algorithm is suitable for segmenting the thermal paint image.

The target environment includes,grid applications such as health-care arid financial services where the data is located primarily within the resources of a worldwide corporation. The approach is to build a discrete event simulation model for a representative work-flow grid. Five work-flow classes, found using a customized k-means clustering algorithm characterize the workload of the grid. Analyzing the gap between the simulation arid measurement data validates the model. The case study demonstrates that the simulation model can be used to predict the V a given a workload forecast. The,rid system performance model is also used to evaluate alternative scheduling strategies. The simulation model is flexible arid easily incorporates several system details.

In this work the applications of fuzzy kohonen neural network and other self-organizing map (SOM) algorithms to the clustering of chemical datasets are investigated. The self-organizing maps networks usually possess a number of parameters such as the learning rate and neighborhood size, which are heuristically selected; whilst in the fuzzy self-organizing map, an optimization technique which automatically selects the best parameters using the fuzzy membership functions has been used. The results of the fuzzy SOM neural network are evaluated in comparison with other SOM neural networks (namely kohonen, neural gas and enhanced neural gas), Wards and Group Average methods for the clustering of different biologically active chemical structures using topological descriptors. The results show that the performance of Fuzzy SOM method not only outperforms other SOM networks with the best heuristics,. but also give better results than the Wards and Group Average methods.

Differences were found in expenditures, income, socialization into trapping, and the use of institutional resources to learn about trapping. Principle components analysis reduced the 25 motivation responses from each of the three survey years to five components, which showed considerable consistency. These components were used in a subsequent K-means cluster analysis to develop a typology of Vermont trappers. The three types (i.e., Wildlife- oriented Lifestyle, Uncaptured Motivation, and Committed) were used in two-way MANOVA used to examine the effect of year (1994, 2000, and 2005) and trapper type on total days participating in trapping and total species of furbearers harvested. The analysis indicated a significant main effect of both year and type on the dependent variable.

In this paper we extract histogram features from the coefficients obtained by applying WaveSim Transform on Multi-Channel signals. WaveSim Transform is a reverse approach for generating Wavelet Transform like coefficients by using a conventional similarity measure between the function f(t) and the wavelet. We propose a method for histogram clustering based on AB distance measure which is based on the 'area' and 'behavior difference' components between the regression lines obtained from the histograms. The distance measure is used for k-means histogram clustering. WaveSim transform provides a means to analyze a temporal data at multiple resolutions and thus the clusters are obtained at multiple resolutions. The techniques have been tested on an EEG dataset recorded through 64 channels.

A novel sorting method is presented based on delaminating coupling and Support vector Clustering (SVC) in this paper. The 3-dimension feature information is composed of direction of arrival, radio frequency and pulse width in this method which sorts radar pulse sequences for the very first time by employing Support Vector Clustering and delaminating coupling. The experiment result shows that the method can sort efficiently radar signals in the complex pulses environment and the performance is superior to that of K-Means clustering sorting.

There are no doubt about that conformations of amino acids are combining with some preferences (Vlasov et al., 2005). At now there is sufficient material to analyze thoroughly structural state of tri- and tetrapeptides as a minimal symmetrical unit of regular structures of peptide backbone. It is tentative to reveal the pattern of the alternation of conformational states characterizing by different spiral symmetry. Results: We have performed clustering analysis, using standard clustering method "K-means", to determine for most part of amino-acid residues the frequency of distribution of sequences of dihedral angles (phi- and psi-angles), which are typical for protein helical conformations. It was found that the alternations amino-acid residues with different symmetry (3.6 in alpha-helix, 2 in beta-strand) occur quite rarely in comparison to the alternations with similar symmetry. Influence of electrostatic in respect of limitations onto secondary structure alternation is discussed.

And near Infrared (NIR) images can reveal concavo-convex effects of the Intaglio Printing of paper currency which can be used to differentiate true and counterfeit paper currency. In this paper, detail texture images of near infrared images are extracted by lifting scheme wavelet. Calculate co-occurrence matrixes of detail texture image which structure texture features such as correlation, energy, contrast, entropy and so on. Then near infrared images are classified by K-means clustering algorithm. All algorithms which are simple and efficient are compiled in VC++ 6.0. The experimental results show that exact digital image processing method can be applied in the field of differentiating paper currency instead of manual judging.

These data contain information on the sources and destinations of individual flows encoded as IP addresses. The cluster analysis of such data can reveal useful knowledge for web cache designing, user profiling, and network resource management. However, popular clustering algorithms such as k-means and DBSCAN are not directly applicable to datasets containing IP addresses. Moreover, such generic algorithms can yield results that are difficult to interpret. This paper presents the cluster analysis of network traffic flows using a hybrid clustering algorithm. The algorithm integrates the longest prefix matching concept of TCP/IP traffic routing and the nearest neighbor algorithm. The similarity between IP addresses is determined by the longest prefix match. Similar IP addresses are then grouped together by an adapted version of the nearest neighbor algorithm. The algorithm provides automatic clustering that does not require input parameters such as the desired number of clusters and similarity threshold value. Furthermore, the algorithm yields 'natural' clusters consistent with the characteristics and usage of IP addresses. The test results are verified using nslookup. About 90% of the clusters were correctly identified by the algorithm.

A human body often appears as a concave object or an object with apertures. In this case, many background areas are mixed into the tracking target which are difficult to be removed by modifying the shape of the search area during tracking. This algorithm realizes the robust tracking for such objects by classifying the pixels in the search area into "target" and "non-target" with K-means clustering algorithm that uses both the "positive" and "negative" samples. The contributions of this research are: 1) Using a 5 - D feature vector to describe both the geometric feature "(x,y)" and color feature "(Y,U,V)" of an object (or a pixel) uniformly. This description ensures our method to follow both the position and color changes simultaneously during tracking; 2) Using a variable ellipse model (a) to describe the shape of a non-rigid object (e.g. hand) approximately, (b) to restrict the search area, and (c) to model the surrounding non-target background. This guarantees the stable tracking of objects with various geometric transformations. Through extensive experiments in various environments and conditions, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is confirmed.

An important security concern in traditional recommendation systems is that users disclose information that may compromise their individual privacy when providing ratings. Randomized perturbation schemes have been proposed to disguise user ratings while still producing accurate recommendations. However, recent research has suggested that perturbation schemes might not be able to preserve privacy as much as has been believed. We propose two data reconstruction methods that derive original private information from disguised data in existing perturbation collaborative filtering schemes. One method is based on k-means clustering and the other uses singular value decomposition (SVD). We have conducted theoretical and experimental analysis on the difference between original data and reconstructed data. Our experiments show that both methods can derive a considerable amount of original information. This study helps to determine an empirical trade-off between recommendation accuracy and user privacy in perturbation schemes.

The network is not assumed to contain any special server nodes (a peer-to-peer network) and is not assumed to be stable either with respect to the topology or the data held by nodes. The algorithm requires only local communication and synchronization at each iteration: nodes communicate and synchronize only with their topologically neighboring nodes. Due to the growing prevalence of peer-to-peer and mobile/wireless sensor networks, data analysis in large, dynamic networks is likely to garner increasing importance in the near future. To our knowledge, our algorithm represents the first K-means algorithm (a common data analysis/mining technique) to be developed for a large dynamic network. We tested our algorithm in a simulated environment of up to 1000 nodes on synthetic data. We examine its behavior in a static environment (no data or network change) and a dynamic environment. Empirical results show the algorithm demonstrates good accuracy (in both the static and dynamic environment) in that the cluster labels produced are very similar to those produced by K-means run on centralized data.

Adapting K-Medians to Generate Normalized Cluster Centers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	6th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 20-22, 2006	Bethesda, MD	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc		K-medians; clustering; normalized data		Many applications of clustering require the use of normalized data, such as text or mass spectra mining. The spherical K-means algorithm [6], an adaptation of the traditional K-means algorithm, is highly useful for data of this kind because it produces normalized cluster centers. The K-medians clustering algorithm is also an important clustering tool because of its well-known resistance to outliers. K-medians, however, is not trivially adapted to produce normalized cluster centers. We introduce a new algorithm (called MN), inspired by spherical K-means, that integrates with K-medians clustering to produce locally optimal normalized cluster centers. We then show theoretically and experimentally that MN produces clusters of significantly higher quality than one would obtain via a simple scaling the cluster centers produced from traditional K-medians.

Many of the functions of the system, such as routing decisions, search strategies, data cleansing, and the assignment of mutual trust, depend on the global status. Therefore, it is essential that the system be able to detect, and react to, changes in its global status. Computing global predicates in such systems is usually very costly. Mainly because of their scale, and in some cases (e.g., sensor networks) also because of the high cost of communication. The cost further increases when the data changes rapidly (due to state changes, node failure, etc.) and computation has to follow these changes. In this paper we describe a two step approach for dealing with these costs. First, we describe a highly efficient local algorithm which detect when the L2 norm of the average data surpasses a threshold. Then, we use this algorithm as a feedback loop for the monitoring of complex predicates on the data such as the data's k-means clustering. The efficiency of the L2 algorithm guarantees that so long as the clustering results represent the data (i.e., the data is stationary) few resources are required. When the data undergoes an epoch change a change in the underlying distribution and the model no longer represents it, the feedback loop indicates this and the model is rebuilt. Furthermore, the existence of a feedback loop allows using approximate and "best-effort" methods for constructing the model; if an ill-fit model is built the feedback loop would indicate so, and the model would be rebuilt.			ranw@cs.umbc.edu; kanishk1@cs.umbc.edu; hillol@cs.umbc.edu					BANYOPADHYAY S, INFORM SCI IN PRESS; BAWA M, 2004, P SIGMOD; BOYD S, 2005, P IEEE INFOCOM 05; CHEUNG D, 1996, P ICDE; CLEMENTE J, 2003, P PDCS; Eugster PT, 2004, COMPUTER, V37, P60, DOI 10.1109/MC.2004.1297243; Hulten G., 2001, P SIGKDD; KARAVAR S, 2003, P WWW; Kempe D., 2003, P FOCS; KOWALCZYK W, 2003, P BNAIC; KRIVITSKI D, 2005, P DCOSS; Kullback S., 1968, INFORM THEORY STAT; KUTTEN S, 1995, P PODC; LINIAL N, 1992, SIAM J COMPUT, V21, P193, DOI 10.1137/0221015; MacQueen J., 1967, P 5 BERK S MATH STAT, P281, DOI DOI 10.1234/12345678; THOMAS S, 1997, P SIGKDD; WOLFF R, 2003, P ICDM	17	7	8	SIAM	PHILADELPHIA	3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA			978-0-89871-611-5	SIAM PROC S			2006							430	441				12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BUJ09	WOS:000289491100038

This reverses the roles of expectation and maximization in the classical EM algorithm. In the context of clustering, we argue that the hard assignments from the maximization phase open the door to very fast implementations based on data-structures such as kd-trees and conga-lines. The marginalization over parameters ensures that we retain the ability to select the model structure. As an important example we discuss a top-down "Bayesian k-means" algorithm and a bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm. In experiments we compare this algorithm against a number of alternative algorithms that have recently appeared in the literature.

Our experiments show that this algorithm produces cluster centers that are, on average, more accurate than the ones produced by the well known iterative k-means algorithm. We use our new algorithm as the basis for a communication-efficient privacy-preserving k-clustering protocol for databases that are horizontally partitioned between two parties. Unlike existing privacy-preserving protocols based on the k-means algorithm, this protocol does not reveal intermediate candidate cluster centers.

We use a generalization of L(2) loss, on which PCA and K-Means are based, to the Bregman family which, as a consequence widens the applicability of the proposed algorithms to cases where the data may be constrained to lie on sets of integers or sets of labels rather than R(d) as in PCA or K-means formulations. This makes it possible to handle different prediction tasks such as classification and regression in an unified way. Two tasks are formulated (i) Transductive Total Bregman Regression (ii) Transductive Bregman PCA.

Theoretical studies show that, in order for the approximate SVM to be similar to the exact SVM given by the original training data set, kernel k-means should be used to extract the representatives. As practical variations, we also propose two efficient implementations of the proposed algorithm, where approximations to kernel k-means are used. The proposed algorithms are compared against the standard training algorithm over real data sets.

This paper presents work on developing a software system for predicting crop yield, for example oil-palm yield, from climate and plantation data. At the core of our system is a method for unsupervised partitioning of data for finding spatio-temporal patterns in climate data using kernel methods which offer strength to deal with complex data. This work gets inspiration from the notion that a non-linear data transformation into some high dimensional feature space increases the possibility of linear separability of the patterns in the transformed space. Therefore, it simplifies exploration of the associated structure in the data. Kernel methods implicitly perform a non-linear mapping of the input data into a high dimensional feature space by replacing the inner products with an appropriate positive definite function. In this paper we present a robust weighted kernel k-means algorithm incorporating spatial constraints for clustering the data. The proposed algorithm can effectively handle noise, outliers and auto-correlation in the spatial data, for effective and efficient data analysis by exploring patterns and structures in the data, and thus can be used for predicting oil-palm yield by analyzing various factors affecting the yield.

In this paper, we proposed a novel method which heuristically converts categorical attributes to numerical values by exploiting such associated information. We conduct an experimental study with real-life categorical dataset. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Data visualization can reveal structure in data sets that is otherwise hard to detect from raw data alone. However, interpretation through visual inspection is prone to errors and can be very tedious. There are several techniques for the automatic detection of clusters of code vectors found by SOMs, but they generally do not take into account the distribution of code vectors; this may lead to unsatisfactory clustering and poor definition of cluster boundaries, particularly where the density of data points is low. In this paper, we propose the use of a generic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for finding cluster boundaries directly from the code vectors obtained from SOMs. The application of our method to unlabeled call data for a mobile phone operator demonstrates its feasibility. PSO algorithm utilizes U-matrix of SOMs to determine cluster boundaries; the results of this novel automatic method correspond well to boundary detection through visual inspection of code vectors and k-means algorithm.

The two spectrums are the Legendre Spectrum, determined by classical methods, and the Large Deviation Spectrum, determined by kernel density estimation. We propose a way for the fusion of these two spectrums to improve textured image segmentation results. An unsupervised k-means is used as clustering approach for the texture classification. The algorithm is applied on mosaic image built using IKONOS images and various natural. textures from the Brodatz album. The segmentation obtained with our approach gives better results than the application of each spectrum separately.

And the quaternion-Gabor filter extracted the input color image's color features and texture features at the same time. The proposed method was tested using different mosaic and natural images.

Nowadays, there is only one conceptual version of this algorithm, the conceptual k-means algorithm. One characteristic of this algorithm is the use of generalization lattices, which define relationships among the feature values. However, for many applications, it is difficult to determine the best generalization lattices; moreover there are not automatic methods to build the lattices, thus this task must be done by the specialist of the area in which we want to solve the problem. In addition, this algorithm does not work with missing data. For these reasons, in this paper, a new conceptual k-means algorithm that does not use generalization lattices to build the concepts and allows working with missing data is proposed. We use complex features for generating the concepts. The complex features are subsets of features with associated values that characterize objects of a cluster and at the same time not characterize objects from other clusters. Some experimental results obtained by our algorithm are shown and they are compared against the results obtained by the conceptual k-means algorithm.

In particular, our work focuses on the prediction of HIV protease resistance to drugs. We use a biologically motivated similarity function based on the contact energy of the amino acid and the position in the sequence. The performance measure was computed taking into account the clustering reliability and the classification validity. An SVM using 10-fold crossvalidation and the k-means algorithm were used for classification and clustering respectively. The best results were obtained by reducing an initial set of 99 features to a lower dimensional feature set of 36-66 features.

Effective missing value estimation methods are required since missing values affect downstream analysis such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering. Traditionally, two simple methods were used to solve this problem: replace all the missing values by zeros; replace missing values by row averages. These methods have their deficiencies, for they don't take advantage of the rich information provided by the expression patterns of other genes. Recently, some methods such as KNN or SVD were proposed to solve this problem. But few papers mentioned solving it by neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method using general regression neural network (GRNN) for missing value estimation. This method consists of 2 steps: (1) Selection of genes for estimation; Here L2-norm is used to obtain genes that used for estimation. (2) Recovering the missing data using GRNN. Chosen genes are used to train the GRNN. When the net is constructed, we use the existing data in the genes for recovering as inputs, and the missing values as outputs. In all the comparative studies of this method with traditional methods, it has the minimum Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). And this demonstrates the feasibility that using GRNN for missing value estimation.

Recently Lingras presented a rough k-means clustering algorithm which assigns the data objects to lower and upper approximations of clusters. In our paper we introduce a rough k-medoids clustering algorithm and apply it to four different data sets (synthetic, colon cancer, forest and control chart data). We compare the results of these experiments to Lingras rough k-means and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the rough k-medoids.

To further enhance the effectiveness of wafer lot output time prediction, a hybrid and intelligent system is constructed in this study. The system is composed of two major parts (a k-means classifier and a back-propagation-network regression) and has three intelligent features: incorporating the future release plan of the fab (look-ahead), example classification, and artificial neural networking. Production simulation is also applied in this study to generate test examples. According to experimental results, the prediction accuracy of the hybrid and intelligent system was significantly better than those of four existing approaches: BPN, case-based reasoning (CBR), FBPN, kM-BPN, by achieving a 9%-44% (and an average of 25%) reduction in the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) over the comparison basis - BPN.

Its creation was inspired by hierarchical image understanding, which requires unsupervised training to build the hierarchy of visual features. Existing clustering algorithms are not well-suited for this task, since they usually split natural groups of patterns into several parts (like k-means) or give crisp clustering. Neurons comprising NSC may be viewed as a society of autonomous individuals, proceeding along the same simple algorithm, based on four principles: of locality, greediness, balance and competition. The same principles govern large groups of entities in economy, sociology, biology and physics. Advantages of NSC are demonstrated in experiment with visual data. The paper presents also a new method for objective and quantitative comparison of clustering algorithms, based on the notions of entropy and mutual information.

The pipelined data mining approach introduced in [1] using two clustering algorithms in combination with rough sets and extended with genetic programming, is investigated with the purpose of discovering important subsets of attributes in high dimensional data. Their classification ability is described in terms of both collections of rules and analytic functions obtained by genetic programming (gene expression programming). The Leader and several k-means algorithms are used as procedures for attribute set simplification of the information systems later presented to rough sets algorithms. Visual data raining techniques including virtual reality were used for inspecting results. The data mining process is setup using high throughput distributed computing techniques. This approach was applied to Breast Cancer microarray data and it led to subsets of genes with high discrimination power with respect to the decision classes.

It has a good performance on the data with compact super-sphere distributions, but tends to fail in the data organized in more complex and unknown shapes. In this paper, we analyze in detail the characteristic property of data clustering and propose a novel dissimilarity measure, named density-sensitive distance metric, which can describe the distribution characteristic of data clustering. By using this dissimilarity measure, a density-sensitive K-Means clustering algorithm is given, which has the ability to identify complex non-convex clusters compared with the original K-Means algorithm. The experimental results on both artificial data sets and real-world problems assess the validity of the algorithm.

Due to the coherent imaging of SAR, it is always with the drawback of speckle. In order to further use SAR image for applications, the speckle reduction is an essential task. Lee Filter is a very famous filter to reduce speckle in a SAR image. The particular characteristic of Lee Filter is that it employs eight different direction non-square windows to preserve the edge sharpness of SAR image. However, it is still insufficient to preserve the edge sharpness in the area whose land-cover has irregular shape. This study is trying to combine the K-means clustering, Hopkins index to construct filtering window that has more exact shape to approach the land-cover for better preserving the edge sharpness after speckle reducing. The pilot results show that the filtering scheme mentioned above can perform better edge-sharpness preserving. But the filter efficiency and the parameters decision need further study to find out the optimal setting.

Hyperspectral colon tissue classification using morphological analysis	Second International Conference on Emerging Technologies 2006, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Emerging Technologies	NOV 13-14, 2006	Peshawar, PAKISTAN	IEEE, ICET, NWFP Univ Engn & Technol				Diagnosis and cure of colon cancer can be improved by efficiently classifying the colon tissue cells into normal and malignant classes. This paper presents the classification of hyperspectral colon tissue cells using morphological analysis of gland nuclei cells. The application of hyperspectral imaging technique in medical image analysis is a new domain for researchers. The main advantage in using hyperspectral imaging is the increased spectral resolution and detailed subpixel information. Biopsy slides with several microdots, where each microdot is from a distinct patient, are illuminated with a tuned light light source and magnification is performed upto 400X. The proposed classification algorithm combines the hyperspectral imaging technique with linear discriminant analysis. Dimensionality reduction and cellular segmentation is achieved by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering. Morphological features, which describe the shape, orientation and other geometrical attributes, are next to be extracted. For classification, LDA is employed to discriminate tissue cells into normal and malignant classes. Implementation of LDA is simpler than other approaches; it saves the computational cost, while maintaining the performance. The algorithm is tested on a number of samples and its applicability is demonstrated with the help of measures such as classification accuracy rate and the area under the convex hull of ROC curves.

This paper makes three contributions regarding shared k-means clustering algorithms. First, a new notion called shared-additive-inverse (SAI) protocols - a building block for efficient implementation of shared k-means clustering protocols within the arbitrarily partitioned database model, is introduced and formalized. Second, a generic implementation of SAI protocols from shared-scalar-product (SSP) protocols is proposed which is provably secure in the semi-honest model assuming that any underlying SSP protocol is privacy-preserving. Finally, we propose an immediate application of SAI protocols for privacy-preserving computation of shared cluster means - a crucial step in the shared k-means clustering algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of shared k-means clustering algorithms with provable security from SAI protocols which in turn are derived from SSP protocols.

Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (data items or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). Clustering algorithms usually employ a similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the same partition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its learning mechanism is integrated with the K-means approach to solve image classification problems. Our simulation results show that the proposed method makes K-Means less dependent on the initial parameters such as randomly chosen initial cluster centers. Selected results from experiments of the proposed method using two different image databases are presented.

Centroidal Voronoi tessellations may also be defined in more abstract and more general settings. Due to the natural optimization properties enjoyed by CVTs, they have many applications in diverse fields. The Lloyd algorithm is one of the most popular iterative schemes for computing the CVTs but its theoretical analysis is far from complete. In this paper, some new analytical results on the local and global convergence of the Lloyd algorithm are presented. These results are derived through careful utilization of the optimization properties shared by CVTs. Numerical experiments are also provided to substantiate the theoretical analysis.

J	Burkardt, J; Gunzburger, M; Lee, HC				Burkardt, John; Gunzburger, Max; Lee, Hyung-Chun			Centroidal Voronoi tessellation-based reduced-order modeling of complex systems	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						reduced-order modeling; Voronoi diagrams; incompressible flows; clustering	PROPER ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION; BURGERS-EQUATION; REDUCTION; FLOWS; DYNAMICS	A reduced-order modeling methodology based on centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) is introduced. CVTs are special Voronoi tessellations for which the generators of the Voronoi diagram are also the centers of mass (means) of the corresponding Voronoi cells. For discrete data sets, CVTs are closely related to the h-means and k-means clustering techniques. A discussion of reduced-order modeling for complex systems such as fluid flows is given to provide a context for the application of reduced-order bases. Then, detailed descriptions of CVT-based reduced-order bases and how they can be constructed from snapshot sets and how they can be applied to the low-cost simulation of complex systems are given. Subsequently, some concrete incompressible flow examples are used to illustrate the construction and use of CVT-based reduced-order bases. The CVT-based reduced- order modeling methodology is shown to be effective for these examples.

The study in this paper proposes a hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (HyEDA) to optimize the design of a cellular system configuration. HyEDA is a two-stage hybrid approach built on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), coupled with a K-means clustering method and a simple local search algorithm. Compared with the simulated annealing method on some test instances, HyEDA has demonstrated its superiority in terms of both the overall performance in optimisation and the number of fitness evaluations required.

Cluster analysis of the dermal permeability and stratum corneum/solvent partitioning of ten chemicals in twenty-four chemical mixtures in porcine skin	SKIN PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hierarchical clustering; K-means clustering; skin permeability; stratum corneum partitioning	PERCUTANEOUS-ABSORPTION; PROPYLENE-GLYCOL; RAT SKIN; ETHANOL; PERMEATION; WATER; MEMBRANE; INVITRO; SYSTEMS; CORNEUM	Assumptions based on absorption from single solvent systems may be inappropriate for risk assessment when chemical mixtures are involved. We used K-means and hierarchical cluster analyses to identify clusters in stratum corneum partitioning and porcine skin permeability datasets that are distinct from each other based on mathematical indices of similarity and dissimilarity. Twenty-four solvent systems consisting of combinations of water, ethanol, propylene glycol, methyl nicotinate and sodium lauryl sulfate were used with 10 solutes, including phenol, p-nitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, methyl parathion, ethyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, simazine, atrazine and propazine. Identifying the relationships between solvent systems that have similar effects on dermal absorption formed the bases for hypotheses generation. The determining influence of solvent polarity on the partitioning data structure supported the hypothesis that solvent polarity drives the partitioning of non-polar solutes. Solvent polarity could not be used to predict permeability because solvent effects on diffusivity masked the effects of partitioning on permeability. The consistent influence of the inclusion of propylene glycol in the solvent system supports the hypothesis that over-saturation due to solvent evaporation has a marked effect on permeability. These results demonstrated the potential of using cluster analysis of large datasets to identify consistent solvent and chemical mixture effects. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

We propose a new algorithm for computing the median of a set of graphs. The concept of median allows the extension of conventional algorithms such as the k-means to graph clustering, helping to bridge the gap between statistical and structural approaches to pattern recognition. Experimental results show the efficiency of the new median graph algorithm compared to the (only) existing algorithm in the literature. We also show its effective use in clustering a set of random graphs and in a content-based synthetic image retrieval system.

We assessed management practices and landscape variability effects on seed cotton yield in a 9-ha, Alabama field (Typic and Aquic Palendults) during 2001-2003. We hypothesize that landscapes have major effects on cotton productivity, but these effects vary based on management and climate. Treatments were established in replicated strips traversing the landscape in a corn (Zea mays L.)-cotton rotation. Treatments included a conventional system with or without 10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) dairy manure (CTmanure or CT), and a conservation system with and without manure (NTmanure or NT). Conventional systems consisted of chisel plowing/disking + in-row subsoiling without cover crops. Conservation systems combined no surface tillage with in-row subsoiling and winter cover crops. A soil survey, topographic survey, and interpolated surfaces of soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and surface soil texture were used to delineate five zones using fuzzy k-means clustering. Overall (2001-2003), conservation systems improved cotton yield compared with conventional systems (2710 vs. 2380 kg ha(-1)); neither manure nor treatment X year interactions were significant. The conservation system was more productive than the conventional system in 87% of the cluster X year combinations. Slope, EC, SOC, and clay content were correlated with yield in all treatments. Soil and terrain attributes explained 16 to 64% of yield variation, however, their significance fluctuated between years and treatments. In dry years, factor analyses suggested variables related with soil quality and field-scale water dynamics had greater impacts on CT yields than NT yields. Our results indicate that management zones developed using relatively static soil-landscape data are relatively more suitable for conservation systems, and these zones are affected by soil management. In addition, the impact of NT on yields is most apparent on degraded soils in dry years.

Otherwise, it may lead to a poor clustering performance. The Rival Penalized Competitive Learning algorithm (RPCL) can automatically select the correct cluster number, but it is sensitive to the learning rate and the de-learning rate [2], [4], especially the deleaning rate. This paper presents an improved RPCL algorithm, which is based on the evaluation of competition ability between the winner and the rival, the improved RPCL algorithm could determining clustering number without the selecting of delearning rate. Our experiments have shown that this improved algorithm can find out the correct clustering number more quickly and convenient than RPCL algorithm.

Today mobile communications technologies offer an opportunity for vast additional value for consumers' banking actions due to their always-on functionality and the option to bank virtually any time and anywhere. However, consumer value differs between individuals. It was measured in the context with five items namely privacy, accuracy, convenience, control and efficiency. An Internet questionnaire was developed and 82 usable responses from the users of mobile bill paying were collected. K-Means Clustering was used and five different value segments were identified. The results indicate that privacy and efficiency are the most valued items in mobile bill paying in general while individuals differing in their valuations. The study provides academics and bank managers with better understanding to consumer value in mobile banking and offers indications for value-based consumer segmentation.

S	Lang, LX; Coifman, B			TRB	Lang, Lixin; Coifman, Benjamin			Identifying lane-mapping errors at freeway detector stations	TRAFFIC AND URBAN DATA	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				With several loop detectors, numerous junctions, and site-specific configuration files, many opportunities exist for errors at a freeway detector station in mapping from a loop detector input to its physical location and lane in the freeway. If these configuration errors are not caught, they propagate to the station's data and any control decisions based on those data. Great care is necessary to prevent such errors, yet they persist in the field even with the added expense of trying to prevent them. This paper develops and tests two algorithms to identify such errors without using a priori knowledge about the detector station configuration. By correlating events between two loop detectors, the first algorithm tests all active detectors to match pairs from dual-loop detectors and to identify any single-loop detectors at the station. The second algorithm uses a hypothesis-test-based K-means method to group lanes from common directions based on time series velocity. Both algorithms exhibited good performance; they were tested over many days and detector stations. Although the analysis focuses on loop detectors, the methodology should also apply to emerging technologies that mimic loop detectors, such as wayside-mounted microwave radar.

Besides offering valuable insight into traffic stream flows, such relationships are widely used in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) systems. In this research, an alternative paradigm for traffic dynamics models, appropriate for traffic simulation models and based on machine-learning approaches such as k-means clustering, k-nearest-neighborhood classification, and locally weighted regression is proposed. Although these models may not provide as much insight into traffic flow theory as speed-density relationships do, they allow for easy incorporation of additional information to speed estimation and hence may be more appropriate for use in DTA models, especially simulation-based models. This paper (with data from a network in Irvine, California) demonstrates that such machine-learning methods can considerably improve the accuracy of speed estimation.

J	Cyterski, M; Barber, C				Cyterski, M; Barber, C			Identification and prediction of fish assemblages in streams of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands, USA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY			English	Article							COMMUNITIES	Management of aquatic resources requires meaningful assessment endpoints on which to base decisions. In freshwater streams, assessment endpoints are often defined as fish communities. Given the limited resources available for environmental monitoring, having a means of predicting fish assemblages in streams where no sampling has yet occurred would be useful. Such a tool could be used for regional screening-level analyses of fish communities and could be input into local-scale model applications for evaluating management scenarios of stream degradation or restoration. In this study, a set of fish assemblages (a list of fish species and their corresponding relative abundances) representative of different stream types in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the United States was defined by use of a k-means cluster analysis performed on relative abundance estimates. The cluster analysis produced 18 fish assemblages, and the following 14 species had the greatest relative abundance in at least one of the 18 assemblages: eastern blacknose dace Rhinichthys atratulus, bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum, creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, fantail darter Etheostoma flabellare, mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii, mountain redbelly dace Phoxinus oreas, redbreast sunfish Lepomis auritus, rosyside dace Clinostomus funduloides, slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, striped shiner Luxilus chrysocephalus, and white sucker Catostomus commersonii. A discriminant analysis was then used to predict a stream's potential fish assemblage based on stream and watershed characteristics. The discriminant function had a 42% success rate using the following predictors: latitude, longitude, mean stream depth, percent urban area of the watershed, and percent fine gravel on the stream bottom. The discriminant function was validated with an independent data set from a regional data collection effort in West Virginia, resulting in 44% success when classifying observed stream fish communities.

Software faults modeling with limited defect occurrence knowledge	Twelfth ISSAT International Conference Reliability and Quality in Design, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	12th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design	AUG 03-05, 2006	Chicago, IL	Int Soc Sci & Appl Technologies		software faults; semi-supervised learning; software metrics; clustering; EM algorithm		A practical problem in knowledge-based software engineering is addressed in this paper. The reliability and quality of software is often improved by applying a software faults prediction model prior to system deployment. A faults prediction model is typically built using a training dataset consisting of software measurements and known defect occurrence knowledge of a previously developed similar software project. However, practical issues during software development often limit the availability of the number of defects associated with all modules in the training data. We present a semi-supervised learning method for software faults modeling when there is limited defect occurrence knowledge of the training program modules. The approach uses the popular EM algorithm for estimating missing data values and employs k-means clustering to facilitate augmentation of the training dataset with program modules without known defect data. An empirical case study of real-world software measurement and faults data is used to evaluate the semi-supervised learning methodology. The software faults prediction of an independent test data is shown to improve with the proposed modeling approach.

This proposed classification has three characteristics, namely, probability features space instead of Gray intensity features space, Bimodal Gaussian discriminator (noise tolerant discriminator), and single class cluster center based classification (only road class). Based on these components, the classification ability and classification timecost are better than in generic classification method; K-Mean, Fuzzy K-Mean, Contiguity K-Mean, K-Mean applied on the texture features obtained from GMRF and from Gabor filter bank. The core of the proposed classification is a discriminator (prior density), and it is obtained from the mean of the distances of Local Difference Probabilities (LDPs) in the randomly selected road area. The road area is randomly selected in front of ego vehicle, and the initial class cluster center is employed inside the sampled road area. The road features are classified from around single cluster center to the entire image space.

Given the silhouette of a hand, we compute its convex hull and extract the deficits of convexity corresponding to the differences between the hull and the silhouette. The deficits of convexity are normalized by rotating them around the edges shared with the hull. To learn a gesture, the deficits from a number of examples are extracted and normalized. The deficits are grouped by similarity which is measured by the relative overlap using k-means clustering. Each cluster is assigned a symbol and represented by a template. Gestures are represented by string of symbols corresponding to the nearest neighbors of the deficits. Distinct sequences of symbols corresponding to a given gesture are stored in a dictionary. Given an unknown gesture, its deficits of convexity are extracted and assigned the corresponding sequence of symbols. This sequence is compared with the dictionary of known gestures and assigned to the class to which the best matching string belongs. We used our method to design a gesture interface to control a web browser. We tested our method on five different subjects and achieved a recognition rate of 92% - 99%.

Nevertheless, these systems have the disadvantage of not representing the desirable bare terrain, but the visible surface including vegetation and buildings. To generate high quality bare terrain using LIDAR data, the most important and difficult step is filtering, where non-terrain 3D objects such as buildings and trees are eliminated while keeping terrain points for quality digital main goal of this paper is to investigate and compare the potential of procedures for clustering of LIDAR data for 3D object extraction. The study aims at a comparison of K-Means clustering, SOM and Fuzzy C-Means clustering applied on range laser images. For evaluating the potential of each technique, the confusion matrix concept is employed and the accuracy evaluation is done qualitatively and quantitatively.

A reliable correlation equation for the parameter k (mean volume ratio of wakes to bubbles) was also established, which is of help in estimating liquid hold up of fluidized beds. The experimental expansion ratio of three-phase fluidized beds (EGLS) was approximately 18% higher than that of two-phase fluidized beds (ELS); whereas the experimental bed-pressure gradient of the former [(-Delta P/H)(GLS)] was approximately 9.3% lower than that of the latter [(-Delta P/H)(LS)]. Both the experimental and modeling results indicated that a higher superficial gas velocity (u(g)) gave a higher E-GLS and a higher E-GLS to E-LS ratio as well as a lower (-Delta P/H)(GLS) and a lower (-Delta P/H)(GLS) to (-Delta P/H)(LS) ratio. As for the operation stability of the AFBR, the sensitivity of ug to expansion height (H-GLS) and (-Delta P/H)(GLS) is between the sensitivity of superficial liquid velocity and biofilm. thickness. The model predictions of EGLS, (-Delta P)(GLS), and (-Delta P/H)(GLS) agreed well the experimental measurements. Accordingly, the predictive models accounting for internal biogas production described fairly well the hydrodynamic behavior of the AFBR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The standard hierarchical clustering methods provide no solution for this problem due to their computational inefficiency. The k-means based methods are promising for their efficiency in processing large data sets. However, their use is often limited to numeric data. But mixed data with numeric data and categorical data are extensive used. K-prototypes algorithm is based on the k-means paradigm but removes the numeric data limitation whilst preserving its efficiency. This paper researched the k-prototype algorithm and simulated it with mixed data The simulation result express k-prototype algorithm is effective for clustering large data sets because it's time cost is linear increase by degrees.

However, it is very difficult to determine them manually without any prior domain knowledge. To solve this problem, a novel similarity based clustering algorithm was presented. It aimed at avoiding instructional parameters to be determined by hand, and at the same time, improving the efficiency of clustering. By introducing fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) to pre-train the similarity criterion, the instructional parameter was determined dynamically. The new clustering algorithm was analyzed and applied later to cluster the product data. A comparison with K-means shows that this algorithm produced clusters with higher quality and in less time. Validity analysis to the clustering results confirms applicaliflity of this algorithm.

But the main drawback of EM is that its solution can highly depend on its initial values, and consequently produce sub-optical maximum likelihood estimates. Thus a genetic initialization algorithm(GIA) is proposed to overcome this limitation. K-mean, FCM, and GIA is compared based on several experiments on synthetic and real data sets. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed GIA achieve the highest likelihood.

Model-based fault diagnosis method depends heavily on the accuracy of mathematical model. An accuracy mathematical model of the process, however, is difficult to avail because of the nonlinearity and ripple coupling in actual hydraulic servo system. Therefore, Robustness of fault diagnosis method based on approximate linear model is worse. A failure observer based on RBF neural network is developed to realize failure detection. The Gaussian function is used for hidden node function, whose centers are adjusted by improved K-means clustering algorithm presented. The weights of output layer are obtained based on improved LS (least square) presented. The trained RBF observer, working concurrently with the,, actual system, accepts the input voltage signal to the servo valve and the measurements of the ram displacements, then rebuilds the system states. The output of the system is accurately estimated. By comparing the estimated output with the actual measurements, residual signal is generated and then analyzed to report the occurrence of faults. The experimental results demonstrate that the failure observer based on RBF neural network is effective in detecting the failure of the hydraulic position servo system.

Considering that the multiplicity of the operation stage is an inherent nature of many batch processes, a stage-based model was developed by the clustering algorithm based on the process correlation characteristic. However, misclassification may occur at the beginning and end of each stage, because the k-means clustering algorithm is a hard-partition method in dealing with patterns between two neighboring clusters. To resolve the above matters flexibly, multiple PCA modeling based on the soft partition algorithm was introduced. It reduces the false alarm and missing alarm for batch process in on-line monitoring due to batch variation. The application to three-tank plant experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.

However, with the deficiency of global search ability it is not satisfactory. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the evolutionary computation techniques based on swarm intelligence, which has high global search ability. So K-means algorithm based on PSO (PSO-KM) is proposed in this paper. Experiment over network connection records from KDD CUP 1999 data set was implemented to evaluate the proposed method. A Bayesian classifier was trained to select some fields in the data set. The experimental results clearly showed the outstanding performance of the proposed method.

K-means algorithm is a widely used partition method in clustering. As the dataset's scale increases rapidly, it is difficult to use K-means to deal with massive amount of data. A parallel strategy is incorporated into clustering method and a parallel K-means algorithm is proposed. For enhancing the efficiency of parallel K-means, dynamic load balance is introduced. Data parallel strategy and Master/Slave model are adopted. The experiments demonstrate that the parallel K-means has higher efficiency and universal use.

The clustering problem is first converted to a multimodal function optimization with Genetic Niching. The peaks of multimodal function, which constitute the initial cluster centers for K-means, are identified by probabilistic crowding. The stability analysis proves that the algorithm can reliably converge to cluster centers. Improved K-means algorithm is presented and used for refinement of clustering centers and final clustering. Therefore it is unnecessary to predefine initial clustering centers and the number of clusters. The experimental results showed that the clustering algorithm could not only increase the convergence speed remarkably, but also was robust to the presence of noise. As a result, the proposed algorithm is superior to traditional Genetic K-means Algorithm in clustering results.

This algorithm is more effective and less sensitive to initial medoids sets than k-means or k-medoids based on analysis of the discrepancy of searching policy and simulation experiment results, when clustering those data-point sets with some similar-sized clusters. The experimental figures, which illustrates the relationship between the final average value of the clustering objective function and the number of the clusters, shows as an experimental rule that the optimal number of clusters often locates at a corner position where the quickly degressive segment of the final average value of the clustering objective function turns to the slowly degressive segment with the step-by-step increasing of the number of the clusters. Obviously, this experimental rule is more encouraging and intuitive to understand.

The method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection engine. Additionally, good features can provide excellent class separability. However, in the past researches on feature selection, the criteria and way about how to select the features in the raw data are seldom referred to. This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental results. In comparison to various type of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-Means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means. With the usage of the statistics of network traffic, the better evaluation index e.g. detection rate and false positive rate, are achieved than any other type of features. Finally, the paper provides the evaluation results of feature selection and we can regard them as knowledge for our future implementation.

Then the eigenmodes are defined by the leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices. For each eigenmode, we compute the vectors of spectral properties, which include the eigenmode perimeter, eigenmode volume, Cheeger number, inter-mode adjacency matrix and inter-mode edge distance. Then these vectors are embedded into a pattern space by multidimensional scaling on the L2 norm for pairs of pattern vectors. Meanwhile, the performances of different embedding methods are compared. Finally, the clustering results by k-means method are shown.

The rationale behind the method learning center parameters of RBF by means of SCA is that, for SCA, number of data points and calculation is irrelevant to the dimension of the clustered information and face images are high-dimensional. The algorithm can effectively improve training speed and accuracy. Experiments on face recognition using ORL database show feasibility of the method. Results present that RBF neural networks classifier using proposed algorithm is more precise and faster than corresponding one using general K-means clustering algorithm.

This method involves the use of K-Means clustering, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The K-Means block divides the whole learning space into subspaces to ensure a better generalization of the ANN. The ICA block, being the main contribution of this work, makes the input variables of the ANN statistically independent so that the ANN can operate on one-dimensional distributions without losing information on joint statistics. The proposed method is applied to a prediction tool of a third generation (3G) cellular radio network. Results show that the differences observed between simulations and measurements can be considerably diminished. We can then predict with enhanced accuracy 'unobserved' configurations as long they are not very different from 'learned' configurations.

This model is used to let the time-serial, season-serial or regular data have the dynamic trend concepts by Grey prediction, then, select the data sets with trend value through rough set screening system. It mainly is applied for a portfolio prediction in the stock market. Our study first predicts each listed company's attributes of condition and decision-making by Grey Prediction, secondly groups their attributes by K-means grouping tools, then filters and categorizes the groups with the classified capacity of Rough Set for uncertain and non-sufficient information and selects the stock portfolio. And then we evaluate the company shares from the portfolio according to their past EPS and ROE and elect the better ones again. Finally, the selected companies are arranged in order with Grey Relation and determine the weight of each share in the portfolio according to it. The experimental result in Taiwan: During five years (2000-2004), the average annual rate of return was 38.1%. The portfolio determined by the model overran the market dramatically.

The color-code tag used in this paper consists of the code area which contains concentric, multiple circular rings on the white background. To generate the test images, we used two cameras of different brands, that is, a Canon and a Nikon. The images were taken outdoor in daylight, and the resolution was 2544 x 1696 (= 4M pixels). The images of figures were taken as waist shots. In the detection, we used the relative characteristics of white color in RGB color space and in the Saturation domain of HSI color space. In the recognition, we used k-means clustering algorithm in the a*b* plane of L*a*b* color space to segment rings of different colors, and used Hue values to determine their colors. The total number of images used was 144. The detection rate was around 993% and the recognition accuracy for the detected codes was around 97.8%.

Our method is based on clustering of parameters of such curves. Results: We have developed a new method to analyze gene expression time series data. As a result of our clustering procedure for each cluster we obtain a smooth centroid curve and a set of curve mean parameters and standard deviations.

This is also the case of spam filtering techniques where the similarities between the known and incoming messages are the fundaments of making the spam/not spam decision. We present a novel approach to filtering based solely on layout, whose goal is not only to correctly identify spam, but also warn about major emerging threats. We propose a mathematical formulation of the email message layout and based on it we elaborate an algorithm to separate different types of emails and find the new, numerically relevant spam types.

Fuzzy classification is applied to delineate vegetation patterns from remote sensing data. The confusion index distinguishes subareas with high uncertainty due to class overlapping from those with low uncertainty. These subareas govern allocation of sample points. A simulated annealing approach minimizes the mean of shortest distances between samples. Optimization was done by prioritizing the survey to areas with high uncertainty. The methodology is tested on a site located in the Amazonian region of Peru. It resulted into an almost equilateral triangular scheme at those parts of the area where uncertainty was highest. The study shows that optimal sampling can be successfully combined with fuzzy classification, using an appropriate weight function. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Salgado, JC; Rapaport, I; Asenjo, JA				Salgado, JC; Rapaport, I; Asenjo, JA			Prediction of retention times of proteins in hydrophobic interaction chromatography using only their amino acid composition	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article						mathematical modelling; hydrophobic interaction clrromatography; hydrophobicity; retention time prediction; proteins; amino acid composition	PRESSURE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; STRUCTURAL CLASS PREDICTION; GLOBULAR-PROTEINS; SECONDARY-STRUCTURE; SIDE-CHAINS; ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS; MONOMERIC PROTEINS; RESIDUES; SURFACE; SEQUENCES	This paper focuses on the prediction of the dimensionless retention time of proteins (DRT) in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) by means of mathematical models based, essentially, only on aminoacidic composition. The results show that such prediction is indeed possible. Our main contribution was the design of models that predict the DRT using the minimal information concerning a protein: its aminoacidic composition. The performance is similar to that observed in models that use much more sophisticated information such as the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Three models that, in addition to the amino acid composition, use different assumptions about the amino acids tendency to be exposed to the solvent, were evaluated in 12 proteins with known experimental DRT. In all the cases analyzed, the model that obtained the best results was the one based on a linear estimation of the aminoacidic surface composition. The models were adjusted using a collection of 74 vectors of aminoacidic properties plus a set of 6388 vectors derived from these using two mathematical tools: k-means and self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithms. The best vector was generated by the SOM algorithm and was interpreted as a hydrophobicity scale based partly on the tendency of the amino acids to be hidden in proteins. The prediction error (MSEJK) obtained by this model was almost 35% smaller than that obtained by the model that supposes that all the amino acids are completely exposed and 40% smaller than that obtained by the model that uses a simple correction factor considering the general tendency of each amino acid to be exposed to the solvent. In fact, the performance of the best model based on the aminoacidic composition was 5% better than that observed in the model based on the three-dimensional structure of proteins.

Despite the widespread use of artificial intelligence techniques in bioinformatics and, more generally, data analysis, there are very few clustering algorithms based on the genetic paradigm, yet that paradigm has great potential in finding good heuristic solutions to a difficult optimization problem such as clustering. Results: GenClust is a new genetic algorithm for clustering gene expression data. It has two key features: (a) a novel coding of the search space that is simple, compact and easy to update; (b) it can be used naturally in conjunction with data driven internal validation methods. We have experimented with the FOM methodology, specifically conceived for validating clusters of gene expression data. The validity of GenClust has been assessed experimentally on real data sets, both with the use of validation measures and in comparison with other algorithms, i.e., Average Link, Cast, Click and K-means. Conclusion: Experiments show that none of the algorithms we have used is markedly superior to the others across data sets and validation measures; i.e., in many cases the observed differences between the worst and best performing algorithm may be statistically insignificant and they could be considered equivalent. However, there are cases in which an algorithm may be better than others and therefore worthwhile. In particular, experiments for GenClust show that, although simple in its data representation, it converges very rapidly to a local optimum and that its ability to identify meaningful clusters is comparable, and sometimes superior, to that of more sophisticated algorithms. In addition, it is well suited for use in conjunction with data driven internal validation measures and, in particular, the FOM methodology.

J	To, CH; Petri, M				To, CH; Petri, M			Is antibody clustering predictive of clinical subsets and damage in systemic lupus erythematosus?	ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM			English	Article							ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES; LONG-TERM; STRANDED-DNA; AUTOANTIBODY PROFILE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DISEASE DURATION; FOLLOW-UP; ASSOCIATION; CRITERIA; COHORT	Objective. To examine autoantibody clusters and their associations with clinical features and organ damage accrual in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. The study group comprised 1,357 consecutive patients with SLE who were recruited to participate in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. In the cohort, 92.6% of the patients were women, the mean +/- SD age of the patients was 41.3 +/- 12.7 years, 55.9% were Caucasian, 39.1% were African American, and 5% were Asian. Seven autoantibodies (anti-double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA], anti-Sm, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-RNP, lupus anticoagulant (LAC), and anticardiolipin antibody [aCL]) were selected for cluster analysis using the K-means cluster analysis procedure. Results. Three distinct autoantibody clusters were identified: cluster 1 (anti-Sm and anti-RNP), cluster 2 (anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro, and anti-La), and cluster 3 (anti-dsDNA, LAC, and aCL). Patients in cluster 1 (n = 451), when compared with patients in clusters 2 (n = 470) and 3 (n = 436), had the lowest incidence of proteinuria (39.7%), anemia (52.8%), lymphopenia (33.9%), and thrombocytopenia (13.7%). The incidence of nephrotic syndrome and leukopenia was also lower in cluster 1 than in cluster 2. Cluster 2 had the highest female-to-male ratio (22:1) and the greatest proportion of Asian patients. Among the 3 clusters, cluster 2 had significantly more patients presenting with secondary Sjogren's syndrome (15.7%). Cluster 3, when compared with the other 2 clusters, consisted of more Caucasian and fewer African American patients and was characterized by the highest incidence of arterial thrombosis (17.4%), venous thrombosis (25.7%), and livedo reticularis (31.4%). By using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index, the greatest frequency of nephrotic syndrome (8.9%) was observed in patients in cluster 2, whereas cluster 3 patients had the highest percentage of damage due to cerebrovascular accident (12.8%) and venous thrombosis (7.8%). Osteoporotic fracture (11.9%) was also more common in cluster 3 than in cluster 2. Conclusion. Autoantibody clustering is a valuable tool to differentiate between various subsets of SLE, allowing prediction of subsequent clinical course and organ damage.

Fluorescence spectroscopy is a promising technology for the detection of cervical squamous intraepithelial precancers and cancers. To date, many investigators have focused on point spectroscopy as an adjunct to diagnostic colposcopy. A device that visualizes the whole field of the cervix is needed for screening. To that end, we have developed a multispectral digital colposcope that works through the colposcope to image with white light, UV excitation at 345 nm, and blue light at 440 run excitation. Here. we report the pilot study that precedes a Phase I trial. Methods. The MDC system is composed of a light source, a colposcope, and a video rate color CCD camera with a frame grabber and takes approximately less than 1 min to make images of the cervix. Patients were measured at baseline and after acetic acid placement with white light, 345 nm excitation, and 440 nm excitation from the xenon arc lamp. The white light is in the visible spectrum, 345 nm excitation is in the UV spectrum and is not visible, and 440 nm excitation is blue light in the spectrum, White light generates a pink image of the cervix. 345 nm excitation, the UV light, excites fluorophores to emit a blue image. 440 run excitation. the blue light, 9 excites fluorophores to emit a green image. The patients underwent a loop excision procedure and the histopathology was inked and cut into 12 sections by the study pathologists. The histopathologic slides were scanned and the images were then reconstructed into maps. A diagnostic algorithm was calculated. The data were preprocessed, transformed, and analyzed by the K-means clustering method. Disease maps were generated using the algorithm and classifier and compared to white light colposcopy and the blue and green images obtained at 345 and 440 nm. Results. Forty-six patients were measured at four clinical sites. Images were made of the cervix with white light, 345 run excitation, and 440 nm excitation and are presented in the figures. As the Study went on, images improved with improvements in the instrument. The white light and fluorescence images are presented with crudely constructed histopathologic maps and algorithmic maps. At 345 nm excitation, the UV light, histologically confirmed CIN appears darker blue; while at 440 run excitation, the blue light.. histologically confirmed CIN appears lighter green. Conclusions. This pilot study shows that MDC images can be matched to both histopathologic and algorithmic maps. The device and the algorithm are evolving but show promise. A Phase I trial is planned.

J	Sarma, DK; Konwar, M; Das, J; Pal, S; Sharma, S				Sarma, DK; Konwar, M; Das, J; Pal, S; Sharma, S			A soft computing approach for rainfall retrieval from the TRMM microwave imager	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						backpropagation; clustering; feature selection; microwave brightness temperature; modeling; neural networks; satellite rainfall estimation	NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; PRECIPITATION RADAR; INFORMATION	A neural network model for rainfall retrieval over ocean from remotely sensed microwave (MW) brightness temperature (BT) is proposed. BT data are obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The BT values from different channels of TMI over the Pacific Ocean (163 degrees tto 177 degrees W and 18 degrees to 34 degrees S) are the input features. The near-surface rainfall rate from the Precipitation Radar (PR) are considered as a target. The proposed model consists of a neural network with online feature selection (FS) and clustering techniques. A K-means clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the selected features. Different networks have been trained to give an instantaneous rainfall rate with all input features as well as with selected features obtained by applying the FS algorithm. It is found that the hybrid network utilizing FS and clustering techniques performs better. The developed network is also validated with two independent datasets on March 14, 2000 over the Atlantic Ocean having stratiform rain and on March 21, 2000 over the Pacific Ocean having both stratiform and convective rain. In both cases, the hybrid network performs well with correlation coefficient improving to 0.78 and 0.81, respectively, in contrast to 0.71) and 0.75 for the network with all features. The rainfall rate retrieved from the hybrid network is also compared with the TMI surface rain rate, and a correlation of 0.84 and 0.75 is found for the two events. The proposed hybrid model is validated with a Doppler Weather Radar, and correlation of 0.52 is observed.

J	Charalampidis, D				Charalampidis, D			A modified K-means algorithm for circular invariant clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; algorithms; similarity measures	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; FEATURES; MODELS	Several important pattern recognition applications are based on feature vector extraction and vector clustering. Directional patterns are commonly represented by rotation-variant vectors F-d formed from features uniformly extracted in M directions. It is often desirable that pattern recognition algorithms are invariant under pattern rotation. This paper introduces a distance measure and a K-means-based algorithm, namely, Circular K-means (CK-means) to cluster vectors containing directional information, such as F-d, in a circular-shift invariant manner. A circular shift of F-d corresponds to pattern rotation, thus, the algorithm is rotation invariant. An efficient Fourier domain representation of the proposed measure is presented to reduce computational complexity. A split and merge approach (SMCK-means), suited to the proposed CK-means technique, is proposed to reduce the possibility of converging at local minima and to estimate the correct number of clusters. Experiments performed for textural images illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm for clustering directional vectors F-d, compared to the alternative approach that uses the original K-means and rotation-invariant feature vectors transformed from F-d.

J	Sheng, WG; Swift, S; Zhang, LS; Liu, XH				Sheng, WG; Swift, S; Zhang, LS; Liu, XH			A weighted sum validity function for clustering with a Hybrid Niching Genetic Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						cluster validity; clustering; evolutionary computation; genetic algorithms; niching methods	COMPUTER VISION; FUZZY	Clustering is inherently a difficult problem, both with respect to the construction of adequate objective functions as well as to the optimization of the objective functions. In this paper, we suggest an objective function called the Weighted Sum Validity Function (WSVF), which is a weighted sum of the several normalized cluster validity functions. Further, we propose a Hybrid Niching Genetic Algorithm (HNGA), which can be used for the optimization of the WSVF to automatically evolve the proper number of clusters as well as appropriate partitioning of the data set. Within the HNGA, a niching method is developed to preserve both the diversity of the population with respect to the number of clusters encoded in the individuals and the diversity of the subpopulation with the same number of clusters during the search. In addition, we hybridize the niching method with the k-means algorithm. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of both the HNGA and the WSVF. In comparison with other related genetic clustering algorithms, the HNGA can consistently and efficiently converge to the best known optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result.

J Appl Physiol 99: 2406-2415, 2005. First published August 4, 2005; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00545.2005.-Skeletal muscle undergoes adaptation following repetitive bouts of exercise. We hypothesize that transcriptional reprogramming and cellular remodeling start in the early phase of long-term training and play an important role in skeletal muscle adaptation. The aim of this study was to define the global mRNA expression in mouse plantaris muscle during (run for 3 and 12 h) and after (3, 6, 12, and 24 h postexercise) a single bout of voluntary running and compare it with that after long-term training (4 wk of running). Among 15,832 gene elements surveyed in a high-density cDNA microarray analysis, 900 showed more than twofold changes at one or more time points. K-means clustering and cumulative hypergeometric probability distribution analyses revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in defense, cell cycle, cell adhesion and motility, signal transduction, and apoptosis, with induced expression patterns sharing similar patterns with that of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor A. We focused on the finding of a delayed (at 24 h postexercise) induction of mRNA expression of cell cycle genes origin recognition complex 1, cyclin A2, and cell division 2 homolog A (Schizoccharomyces pombe) and confirmed increased cell proliferation by in vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling following voluntary running. X-ray irradiation of the hindlimb significantly diminished exercise-induced 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. These findings suggest that a single bout of voluntary running activates the transcriptional network and promotes adaptive processes in skeletal muscle, including cell proliferation.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can provide compact signal description, which is more accurate than time-domain data. A procedure for the proper choice of transform parameters is proposed. Both time-domain and wavelet features of these waveforms are visualized using principal components analysis. Separability of feature spaces is compared using k-means clustering algorithm. The results suggest that PERG waveforms are better separable when represented by DWT coefficients of full time-domain signal, than in traditional peak-based feature space.

In this paper the performances of hybrid two-stage methods combining self-organising map (SOM) and traditional clustering algorithms are presented and evaluated with the goal of identifying the techniques leading to the best clustering quality. The SOM-based two-stage methods are also compared to single-stage approaches applying traditional hierarchical and partitioning algorithms. These comparisons are initially based on the analysis of two reference data sets ( Iris and Abalone) which shows how the use of SOM improves clustering quality while reducing computational time. In order to further evaluate the proposed two-stage method, the comparison is extended to two industrial applications. The first one concerns the group technology problem and the second is related to the classification of purchased components. The obtained results show that SOM + K-means can achieve a satisfying clustering assignment quality while reducing the computational time.

Methods: 121 patients admitted consecutively were assessed. A questionnaire containing items on the patient characteristics and psychometric scales to assess the suicidal intent and lethality were used. A cluster analysis was performed using the K-means method. Results: Three groups were identified: 1) 43 subjects (mostly female) characterized by self-poisoning with medication and low suicidal intent, with highly impulsive suicide attempts; 2) 53 subjects (mostly males) who ingested pesticides and presented both moderate degrees of lethality and suicidal intent; 3) 17 subjects (predominantly males) who used more violent methods and presented high levels of lethality and suicidal intent. Conclusions: Grouped data of these inpatients could be misleading for follow-up research purposes as our findings indicate that there are relatively distinct clinical profiles among suicide attempters admitted to a general hospital.

However, the interactions between processes underlying the cell activity suggest that the complexity of the microarray data structure may not be fully represented with discrete clustering methods. Results: A newly developed software tool called MILVA (microarray latent visualization and analysis) is presented here to investigate microarray data without separating gene expression profiles into discrete classes. The underpinning of the MILVA software is the two-dimensional topographic representation of multidimensional microarray data. On this basis, the interactive MILVA functions allow a continuous exploration of microarray data driven by the direct supervision of the biologist in detecting activity patterns of co-regulated genes.

A data set of 153 organic chemicals, 62 with antitrypanosomal activity and 91 having other clinical uses, was processed by a k-means cluster analysis to design training and predicting data sets. Afterwards, a linear classification function was derived allowing the discrimination between active and inactive compounds. The model classifies correctly more than 93% of chemicals in both training and external prediction groups. The predictability of this discriminant function was also assessed by a leave-group-out experiment, in which 10% of the compounds were removed at random at each time and their activity predicted a posteriori. In addition, a comparison with models generated using four well-known families of 21) molecular descriptors was carried out. As an experiment of virtual lead generation, the present TOMOCOMD approach was finally satisfactorily applied on the virtual evaluation of 10 already synthesized compounds. The in vitro antitrypanosomal activity of this series against epimastigotes forms of Trypanosomal cruzi was assayed. The model was able to predict correctly the behaviour of these compounds in 90% of the cases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results were compared to those obtained by MLR modeling in a single model with the whole data set as well as in submodels based on K-means clustering analysis. It has been clearly shown that electronic descriptors and spatial descriptors play the important roles in the compounds' affinity to BzR. In addition, the molecular density, the Y component of the principal moment of inertia, the magnitude and the Y component of the dipole moment of the molecules can detrimentally affect PQ analogue BzR affinity, while the X component of the dipole moment of the molecules can favorably affect compounds' affinity.

J	Abdalmogith, SS; Harrison, RM				Abdalmogith, SS; Harrison, RM			The use of trajectory cluster analysis to examine the long-range transport of secondary inorganic aerosol in the UK	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						back trajectory; clustering; sulphate; nitrate; chloride	ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT; SULFATE; SITES; AIR; NITRATE; MODEL; PM10	The influence of synoptic-scale atmospheric transport patterns on observed levels of sulphate, nitrate and PM10 at Belfast (urban) and Harwell (rural) has been examined. Three-day 6-hourly back trajectories for January 2002 to December 2003, arriving at the two sampling locations at 1200 GMT and 900 hPa were calculated. A K-means clustering algorithm is used to group these trajectories into 10 clusters depending on their direction and speed. Nonparametric statistics were used to test for significant differences in mean aerosol concentration across clusters. Significant inter-cluster differences were observed with highest nitrate and sulphate levels associated with south-easterly and easterly trajectory clusters at Belfast and Harwell respectively, and highest chloride concentrations associated with fast moving maritime trajectory categories at both sites. Easterly trajectory clusters show lower sulphate/nitrate ratios compared to other clusters, especially for air travelling from the near continent. Nitrate shows greater episodicity than 3 sulphate with implications for achievement of the daily PM10 limit value of 50 mu g m(-3).

J	Torrente, A; Kapushesky, M; Brazma, A				Torrente, A; Kapushesky, M; Brazma, A			A new algorithm for comparing and visualizing relationships between hierarchical and flat gene expression data clusterings	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Clustering is one of the most widely used methods in unsupervised gene expression data analysis. The use of different clustering algorithms or different parameters often produces rather different results on the same data. Biological interpretation of multiple clustering results requires understanding how different clusters relate to each other. It is particularly non-trivial to compare the results of a hierarchical and a flat, e. g. k-means, clustering. Results: We present a new method for comparing and visualizing relationships between different clustering results, either flat versus flat, or flat versus hierarchical. When comparing a flat clustering to a hierarchical clustering, the algorithm cuts different branches in the hierarchical tree at different levels to optimize the correspondence between the clusters. The optimization function is based on graph layout aesthetics or on mutual information. The clusters are displayed using a bipartite graph where the edges are weighted proportionally to the number of common elements in the respective clusters and the weighted number of crossings is minimized. The performance of the algorithm is tested using simulated and real gene expression data. The algorithm is implemented in the online gene expression data analysis tool Expression Profiler.

The soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) was measured by electromagnetic induction using an EM38DD. At 116 locations, soil samples were taken according to a clustered sampling design, three times during one winter, and analyzed for the NO3-- N content in the topsoil ( 0 - 60 cm). Management zones were delineated using a fuzzy k-means classification of the interpolated ECa measurements. Two ECa zones were found, reflecting mainly differences in soil texture. Since the mean NO3-- N content was different for the two ECa zones ( 24 and 65 kg/ha in November 2002), the residuals were interpolated using stratified simple kriging. This allowed evaluating the NO3- dynamics during the winter in both zones; one ECa zone showed a higher risk for NO3- losses than the other calling for a site- specific N management. As a validation, NO3- - N was interpolated using orinary kriging without stratification. This resulted in similar zones confirming the usefulness of the ECa measurements to assess N-specific management zones, even within small fields.

AK algorithm modifies the K-means as locating the objects in a cluster with the probability, which is updated by the pheromone, while the rule of updating pheromone is according to total within cluster variance (TWCV). The computational results showed that it is better than the other two methods, self-organizing feature map (SOM) followed by K-means method and SOM followed by genetic K-means algorithm via 243 data sets generated by Monte Carlo simulation. To further testify this novel method, the questionnaire survey data for the plasma television market segmentation is employed. The results also indicated that the proposed method is the best among these three methods based on TWCV. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular events that accompany these changes were investigated in brain microvessels extracted using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a 20 min transient global cerebral ischemia followed by 1, 6, or 24 h reperfusion. Proteins extracted from similar to 300 LCM captured microvessels (20-100 mu m) were ICAT-labeled and analyzed by nanoLC-MS. In-house software was used to identify paired ICAT peaks, which were then sequenced by nanoLC-MS/MS. Pattern analyses using k-means clustering method classified 57 differentially expressed proteins in 7 distinct dynamic patterns. Protein function was assigned using Panther Classification system. Early reperfusion ( 1 h) was characterized by down-regulation of ion pumps, nutrient transporters, and cell structure/motility proteins, and up-regulation of transcription factors, signal transduction molecules and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and proteins involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling and anti-oxidative defense was observed in late reperfusion (6-24 h). The up-regulation of IL-1 beta and TGF-1 beta in ischemic brain vessels was confirmed by ELISA, quantitative PCR, and/or immunohistochemistry. A biphasic postischemic ( 1 and 24 h) BBB opening for H-3-sucrose was evident in the same model. Differentially expressed proteins identified in brain vessels during reperfusion are likely involved in orchestrating functional vascular responses to ischemia, including the observed BBB disruption.

Earlier results show that the mean-squared distortion of an empirically optimal quantizer designed from n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) source samples converges uniformly to the optimum at a rate of O(1/root n), and that this rate is sharp in the minimax sense. We prove that for any fixed distribution supported on a given finite set the convergence rate is O(1/n) (faster than the minimax lower bound), where the corresponding constant depends on the source distribution. For more general source distributions we provide conditions implying a little bit worse O(log n/n) rate of convergence. Although these conditions, in general, are hard to verify, we show that sources with continuous densities satisfying certain regularity properties (similar to the ones of Pollard that were used to prove a central limit theorem for the code points of the empirically optimal quantizers) are included in the scope of this result. In particular, scalar distributions with strictly log-concave densities with bounded support (such as the truncated Gaussian distribution) satisfy these conditions.

In this correspondence, a much simpler construction and proof for this are given with much better constants. There are similar bounds for the training distortion of the empirically optimal vector quantizer with three or more levels. These rates, however, do not hold for a one-level quantizer. Here, the two-level quantizer case is clarified, showing that it already shares the behavior of the general case. Given that the minimax bounds are proved using a construction that involves discrete distributions, one suspects that for the class of distributions with uniformly bounded continuous densities, the expected distortion redundancy might decrease as o(1/root n) uniformly. It is shown as well that this is not so, proving that the lower bound for the expected test distortion remains true for these subclasses.

Our first study (N = 74) involved an analysis of students' navigation patterns to group them into clusters, using a k-means clustering technique. Based on this analysis, navigation patterns were grouped into four clusters, enabling us to understand the kinds of support that students needed. This formed the basis of our next study, in which we designed and implemented metanavigation support to help students navigate and learn science content. Support in the form of prompts was provided to one group (N = 58) while a second group (N = 58) with no support served as the comparison group. Our results suggest that students in the support group performed better on a concept-mapping task. Based on the results we provide suggestions for providing metacognitive support in hypertext systems.

J	Hung, MC; Wu, JP; Chang, JH; Yang, DL				Hung, MC; Wu, JP; Chang, JH; Yang, DL			An efficient k-means clustering algorithm using simple partitioning	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						clustering; k-means algorithm; centroid; k-d tree; data mining	SEGMENTATION; SEARCH; TREES	The k-means algorithm is one of the most widely used methods to partition a dataset into groups of patterns. However, most k-means methods require expensive distance calculations of centroids to achieve convergence. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to implement a k-means clustering that produces Clusters comparable to slower methods. In our algorithm, we partition the original dataset into blocks; each block unit, called a unit block (UB), contains at least one pattern. We can locate the centroid of a unit block (CUB) by using a simple calculation. All the computed CUBs form a reduced dataset that represents the original dataset. The reduced dataset is then used to compute the final centroid of the original dataset. We only need to examine each UB on the boundary of candidate clusters to find the closest final centroid for every pattern in the UB. In this way, we can dramatically reduce the time for calculating final converged centroids.

J	Rhee, H; Holditch-Davis, D; Miles, MS				Rhee, H; Holditch-Davis, D; Miles, MS			Patterns of physical symptoms and relationships with psychosocial factors in adolescents	PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE			English	Article						multiple symptoms; clusters; psychological adjustment; interpersonal relationships; stability	SOMATIC COMPLAINTS; PRIMARY-CARE; CHILDREN; SOMATIZATION; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; STABILITY; PAIN; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ASSOCIATION	Objectives: Physical symptoms are common in otherwise healthy adolescents. This study sought to identify meaningful patterns of multiple physical symptoms and to examine relationships between the patterns and psychosocial factors. One-year stability of symptom patterns and factors contributing to stability were also examined. Methods: This secondary data analysis used longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 (n = 9,141) who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health during 1994 to 1996. Ten selected physical symptoms (i.e., headache, stomachaches, fatigue) were used to construct clusters. Each cluster was compared in regard to demographic factors, psychological adjustment and interpersonal relationships. Results: K-means in combination with Ward method clustered the sample into 4 groups according to the overall patterns of the 10 symptoms: nonsymptom (41%), moderate symptom (38%), high symptom (19%) and extreme symptom (2%). Adolescents in higher symptom clusters were more likely to be girls, nonwhites, or from families on welfare and reported high depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and poor perceptions of parental affection and friendship quality. About 16% in clusters with lower symptom patterns develop somatizing patterns in Wave 11; new onset was predicted by gender, younger age, and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Symptom patterns characterized by overall high frequencies of multiple symptoms may indicate somatization. This study also suggests that adolescents with a somatizing tendency are more likely to experience psychological and interpersonal difficulties, and girls and younger adolescents are more vulnerable. Targeted prevention programs are needed for these vulnerable individuals by addressing their psychosocial functioning.

J	Crone, TM				Crone, TM			An alternative definition of economic regions in the United States based on similarities in state business cycles	REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Regional Economic Indicators	SEP 04-05, 2003	Philadelphia, PA	Fed Reserve Bank Phila			MONETARY-POLICY; FLUCTUATIONS; ALGORITHM; TIME	Since the 1950s the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has grouped the states into eight regions based primarily on cross-sectional similarities in their socioeconomic characteristics. This paper groups states into regions based on the similarities in their business cycles. We applied k-means cluster analysis to the cyclical components of Stock-Watson-type indices estimated at the state level to group the 48 contiguous states into eight regions with similar cycles. We then compare the cohesion of the regions so defined with the cohesion of the BEA regions. Finally, we examine how that definition affects the results of some recent regional business cycle analysis.

J	Chang, SC; Li, TF				Chang, SC; Li, TF			Estimation of component mean lifetimes of a masked system using unclassified system life data	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						classification; exponential distribution; maximum likelihood estimation; stochastic approximation		We consider a masked system, which consists of several components. Due to cost and diagnostic constraints, the component mean lifetimes might not be exactly known. We consider a system where if one of components fails, the whole system fails and suppose that the lifetimes of components have exponential distributions. Since the exponential distribution has a large variance, it is hard to find the component mean lifetimes. We propose an estimation method, which will generally find the component mean lifetimes. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study are presented to demonstrate the favorable estimation of the mean lifetimes of components using unclassified system life data. The estimation produced by our method is better than that produced by the K-means algorithm. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Shen, JD; Chang, SI; Lee, ES; Deng, YP; Brown, SJ				Shen, JD; Chang, SI; Lee, ES; Deng, YP; Brown, SJ			Determination of cluster number in clustering microarray data	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						clustering; microarray data; K-means algorithm; data mining; validity index; bio-informatics		The general purpose of clustering analysis of microarray data is to organize the data into meaningful groups based on their closeness. Although various algorithms have been proposed for the clustering of microarray data, the main difficulty remains to be the determination of the optimal number of clusters. To complicate the problem further, meaningful groups or closeness cannot be well defined due to the fuzziness nature of the data. This paper proposes a dynamic validity index to overcome this problem. The proposed index, in addition of the dynamic aspects, also takes care of both the intra- and the inter-distances of the clusters. An algorithm based on the proposed dynamic validity index and the traditional K-means method was developed. To make the proposed dynamic validity index more flexible, a modulating parameter gamma is introduced. This parameter can be used to take care of noisy data and balance the importance between compactness and separateness in the clusters. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, a numerical example by using the human serum data from the literature was solved and the sensitivity and robustness of the approach are examined.

A total of 78,93 1 fishes were captured, representing 13 families and 44 species. Species were classified as having low, moderate, or high salinity tolerances based on k-means Clustering of detrended correspondence scores. The proportion of species with high salinity tolerances was correlated positively (r = 0.74) with salinity, whereas the proportion of species with low (r = -0.69) or moderate (r = -0.36) tolerances was correlated strongly and negatively with salinity. Many of the low or moderate salinity tolerant species found in the 1950s were not collected in studies conducted 15 and 35 years later.

J	Ribeiro, MHL; Ribeiro, IAC				Ribeiro, MHL; Ribeiro, IAC			Recovery of erythromycin from fermentation broth by adsorption onto neutral and ion-exchange resins	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						erythromycin; fermentation; Saccharopolyspora erythraea; adsorption; neutral resins; ion-exchange resins	SELECTIVE ADSORPTION; BIOCONVERSION; SORBENT; SOLUTES	Erythromycin was produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea in batch mode. Selective adsorption was the method chosen to enable the recovery of erythromycin from growth media. The following sorbents were used: neutral resins (XAD-4, XAD-7 and XAD-16) and ion-exchange resins, Amberlite(TM) IRA-410 (anionic resin) and Amberlite(TM) IR-120 (cationic resin). A mathematical kinetic model for the adsorption of erythromycin, from fermentation media, versus time, on these resins was used. The maximum erythromycin adsorption from fermentation media, at 303 K, was attained with XAD-16 (0.38 mmol/g),IR-120 (0.35 mmol/g) and XAD-7 (0.28 mmol/g) resins and a removal higher than 70% (m/v) was achieved with low sorbent loads (less than 1%, m/v). In addition, XAD-7 resin showed a better performance when it was considered the adsorption per unit of surface area (1.22 x 10(-3) mmol/m(2)). For every solute/sorbent system tested, adsorption equilibrium was attained in less than 3 b contact. The adsorption data for the sorbents XAD-16 and IRA-120 resins are correlated with Freundlich and Langmuir models. The thermodynamic parameters such as Delta H-ads, Delta S-ads and Delta G(ads) were calculated to predict the nature of adsorption. The positive value of enthalpy (6 kJ/mol) suggest that the original salt in the resin is bound strongly, while the positive value of entropy (54 J/mol K) means that liberation of the salt into the solution is entropically favorable, and the favorable entropy drives the overall process, with a free energy of adsorption of -10 kJ/mol.

In order to collect data, several laboratory tests are performed on 120 undisturbed soil samples, which are obtained from Antalya region. Additionally, for the evaluation of the generalization ability of clustering analysis, 20 fine grained soil samples collected from the other regions of Turkey are also classified using the same clustering algorithms. Fuzzy c-means algorithm exhibited better clustering performance over hard k-means classifier. As expected, clustering analysis produced worse outcomes for soils collected from different regions than those of obtained from a specific region. In addition to its precise classification ability, fuzzy c-means approach is also capable of handling the uncertainty existing in soil parameters. As a result, fuzzy c-means clustering can be successfully applied to classify regional fine grained soils on the basis of shear strength and plasticity index parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the suitability of self-organizing maps (SOM, neural network) for patterning habitat invasion by exotic fish species at the regional scale (Southwest France), using a binary dataset of species occurrences. The SOM visualization can be used as an analytical tool to bring out relationships between sample locations and biological variables, but in addition the weight of each species in the output of the SOM can be interpreted as its occurrence probability in various geographic areas. After training the SOM with fish presence/absence data, the k-means algorithm helped to derive three major clusters of sites (headwater, montane, and plain areas). Each cluster was divided into two subsets of sites according to non-native fish, because assemblage compositions delineated different geological areas: Pyrenees Mountains, Massif Central Mountains, and alluvial plain. Occurrence probabilities of species within our study stream system were roughly influenced by river typology, with a higher occurrence probability for most species (i.e. a greater risk) in downstream sections. Conversely, headwater streams at the highest elevations in the study area showed the lowest risk of invasion. Efficient analytical tools such as SOM may thus help to yield explicit schemes that could influence the measures to be taken in the latter phase of conservation plans. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Variability of seasonal CASI image data products and potential application for management zone delineation for precision agriculture	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Earth Observation of Canadas Landmass held in honor of Josef Cihlar	SEP 30-OCT 01, 2004	Ottawa, CANADA	Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Nat Resources Canada			HYPERSPECTRAL VEGETATION INDEXES; REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS; SOIL PROPERTIES; GRAIN-YIELD; COLOR; CANOPIES; NITROGEN; CORN	The delineation of management zones is an important step to implementing site-specific crop management practices. Remote sensing is a cost-effective way to acquire information needed for delineating management zones, since it has been successfully used for mapping soil properties and monitoring crop growth conditions. Remotely sensed hyperspectral data are particularly effective in deriving crop biophysical parameters in agricultural fields; therefore, the potential of hyperspectral data to contribute to management zone delineation needs to be assessed. In this study, the spatial variability of soil and crops in two agricultural fields was studied using seasonal compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) hyperspectral images. Different spectral features including soil brightness and colouration indices, principal components of soil reflectance data, and crop descriptors (leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content) were derived from CASI data and used to partition the fields into homogeneous zones using the fuzzy k means unsupervised classification method. The reduction of variances of soil electrical conductivity, LAI, leaf chlorophyll content, and yield was inspected to determine the appropriate number of zones for each field. The zones obtained were interpreted according to the soil survey map and field practices. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the delineation. The study shows that the spatial patterns of the resulting soil zones faithfully represent the soil classes described by the soil survey maps, and the spatial patterns of the resulting crop classes discriminated the different crop growth conditions well. These results show that hyperspectral data provide important information on field variability for management zone delineation in precision agriculture.

J	Sabharwal, Y; Sen, S				Sabharwal, Y; Sen, S			A linear time algorithm for approximate 2-means clustering	COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						k-means; randomization		Matousek [Discrete Comput. Geom. 24 (1) (2000) 61-84] designed an 0(nlogn) deterministic algorithm for the approximate 2-means clustering problem for points in fixed dimensional Euclidean space which had left open the possibility of a linear time algorithm. In this paper, we present a simple randomized algorithm to determine an approximate 2-means clustering of a given set of points in fixed dimensional Euclidean space, with constant probability, in linear time. We first approximate the mean of the larger cluster using random sampling. We then show that the problem can be reduced to a set of lines, on which it can be solved by carefully pruning away points of the larger cluster and randomly sampling on the remaining points to obtain an approximate to the mean of the smaller cluster.

J	Won, KS; Ray, T				Won, KS; Ray, T			A framework for design optimization using surrogates	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						kriging; cokriging; radial basis function		Design optimization is a computationally expensive process as it requires the assessment of numerous designs and each of such assessments may be based on expensive analyses ( e.g . computational fluid dynamics method or finite element based method). One way to contain the computational time within affordable limits is to use computationally cheaper approximations (surrogates) in lieu of the actual analyses during the course of optimization. This article introduces a framework for design optimization using surrogates. The framework is built upon a stochastic, zero-order, population-based optimization algorithm, which is embedded with a modified elitism scheme, to ensure convergence in the actual function space. The accuracy of the surrogate model is maintained via periodic retraining and the number of data points required to create the surrogate model is identified by a k -means clustering algorithm. A comparison is provided between different surrogate models (Kriging, radial basis functions (Exact and Fixed) and Cokriging) using a number of mathematical test functions and engineering design optimization problems. The results clearly indicate that for a given fixed number of actual function evaluations, the surrogate assisted optimization model consistently performs better than a pure optimization model using actual function evaluations.

Terron is a whole entity integrating soil properties (pedon) with topographic soil-forming factors (represented here by landform attributes)-which can be assimilated to terroir. For terron mapping, landform is not only an interpolation support as it is in existing models, but also a taxonomic variable. Data from French databases are used to illustrate this concept. Terron mapping consists of four stages. First is the classification of n area-representative soil types with landform attributes by fuzzy k-means with extragrades into n terron classes. Second is the establishment of terron-landform rules using a multi-linear regression. Third is the interpolation of the terron-landform rules using regression-kriging. Fourth is validation with a second sample dataset. The results are compared with a soil map created with a regression-kriging model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first principal component of each subgroup is employed for image visualization. The proposed approach is general, with the number of bands in each subgroup being application dependent. Nevertheless, the paper focuses on partitions with three subgroups suitable for RGB representation. One of them employs matched-filtering based on the spectral characteristics of various materials and is very promising for classification purposes. The information content of the hyperspectral bands as well as the quality of the obtained RGB images are quantitatively assessed using measures such as the correlation coefficient, the entropy, and the maximum energy-minimum correlation index. The classification performance of the proposed partitioning approaches is tested using the K-means algorithm.

J	Hariharakrishnan, K; Schonfeld, D				Hariharakrishnan, K; Schonfeld, D			Fast object tracking using adaptive block matching	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						adaptive motion estimation; K-means clustering; segmentation; visual tracking	VIDEO; REPRESENTATION; MESH	We propose a fast object tracking algorithm that predicts the object contour using motion vector information. The segmentation step common in region-based tracking methods is avoided, except for the initialization of the object. Tracking is achieved by predicting the object boundary using block motion vectors followed by updating the contour using occlusions/disocclusion detection. An adaptive block-based approach has been used for estimating motion between frames. An efficient modulation scheme is used to control the gap between frames used for motion estimation. The algorithm for detecting disocclusion proceeds in two steps. First, uncovered regions are estimated from the displaced frame difference. These uncovered regions are classified into actual disocclusions and false alarms by observing the motion characteristics of uncovered regions. Occlusion and disocclusion are considered as dual events and this relationship is explained in detail. The algorithm for detecting occlusion is developed by modifying the disocclusion detection algorithm in accordance with the duality principle. The overall tracking algorithm is computationally superior to existing region-based methods for object tracking. The immediate applications of the proposed tracking algorithm are video compression using MPEG-4 and content retrieval based on standards like H.264. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Most of the text-clustering methods were grounded in the term-based measurement of distance or similarity, ignoring the structure of the documents. In this paper, we present a novel method named structured cosine similarity (SCS) that furnishes document clustering with a new way of modeling on document summarization, considering the structure of the documents so as to improve the performance of document clustering in terms of quality, stability, and efficiency. This study was motivated by the problem of clustering speech documents (of no rich document features) attained from the wireless experience oral sharing conducted by mobile workforce of enterprises, fulfilling audio-based knowledge management. In other words, this problem aims to facilitate knowledge acquisition and sharing by speech. The evaluations also show fairly promising results on our method of structured. cosine similarity.

J	Wasti, SA				Wasti, SA			Commitment profiles: Combinations of organizational commitment forms and job outcomes	JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						organizational commitment; commitment profiles; cluster analysis	1991 3-COMPONENT MODEL; NORMATIVE COMMITMENT; CONTINUANCE; MEYER; ANTECEDENTS; WITHDRAWAL; EXTENSION; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR	Although the three-component model of organizational commitment by Meyer and Allen (1991) posits that an employee can experience the three components concurrently, previous research has been largely variable-centered, looking at the antecedents and outcomes of each component separately. Two studies explored how the three components combine to create distinct "profiles" of commitment and the implications of different profiles. In Study 1, six clusters were identified using k-means cluster analysis. These were labeled as the Highly committed, Non-committed, Neutral, Affective dominant, Continuance dominant and the Affective-Normative dominant profiles. Analysis of variance results indicated that the Highly committed, Affective-Normative dominant and the Affective dominant profiles demonstrated the most desirable job behaviors. The Non-committed profile showed the least desirable outcomes, followed by the Continuance dominant profile. Study 2 largely replicated these findings. The results suggest that affective commitment is the primary driver of positive outcomes, especially when combined with low levels of continuance commitment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A questionnaire for evaluation of Chinese handwriting was developed and then administered to 165 children with handwriting deficits. Factor analysis indicated that the questionnaire has six major dimensions, including construction of characters, accuracy, developmental delay, pencil grip, gross movement, and emotional reaction. These six dimensions were utilized to search for Subtypes of handwriting deficits. By further sampling,mother 209 children were administered the handwriting evaluation questionnaire to classify their handwriting deficits. According to the severity of deficits on different dimensions of the questionnaire, K-means clustering was utilized to classify the children into four subtypes of mild, severe, motor-originated, and academic learning dysfunction Subtypes, The classification by subtype might be helpful in planning interventions for children with handwriting deficits.

Therefore, a set of 130 camelina accessions from a world collection was evaluated for oil content, protein content and 1000-seed weight in field experiments grown in three macro-environments in Austria. Based on phenotypic data, accessions were categorized into four groups with different seed characteristics using k-means cluster analysis or principal component extraction. Subsequently, a representative set of 41 accessions was subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Of 24 primers, 15 were polymorphic producing a total of 30 marker loci. Genetic distance estimates between the 41 accessions were calculated, based both on RAPD polymorphism and on seed quality characteristics, and dendrograms were generated for comparison. Similarities were found between the two different clustering approaches, and grouping was partly in agreement with pedigree information or geographic origin. However, as the two estimates of diversity sampled different segments of the genome, i.e. regions coding for seed characteristics or phenotypically neutral genomic regions highlighted by discrete markers, the correlation between the two distance matrices was low.

Experimental Design: We determined the mRNA expression of p1(INK4A), P14(ARF) CDK4, RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 by quantitative reverse transcription- PCR in 38 cases of GISTs and correlated the findings with clinicopathologic factors, including mutation analysis of K/T and PDGFRA. Results: The k-means cluster analysis yielded three prognostic subgroups of GISTs with distinct mRNA expression patterns of the CDKN2A pathway. GISTs with low mRNA expression of the CDKN2A transcripts p161(INK4A) and p14(ARF) but high mRNA expression of CDK4, RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 were associated with aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis, whereas GISTs with a low mRNA expression of CDK4,RB1, MDM2, TP53, and E2F1 were not. GISTs with a moderate to high mRNA expression of all examined genes also seemed to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Regarding mutation analysis, we found significant differences in the KIT/PDGFRA genotype among the three clusters. Univariate analysis revealed high expression of E2F1 to be associated with mitotic count, proliferation rate, KIT mutation, and aggressive clinical behavior. These findings on mRNA.level could be confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: Our findings implicate differential regulation schemes of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor pathway converging to up-regulation of E2F1 as the critical link to increased cell proliferation and adverse prognosis of GIS.

Mechanical ventilation can lead to clinical deterioration due to augmented lung injury in certain patients, suggesting the potential existence of genetic susceptibility to mechanical stretch ( 6, 48), the nature of which remains unclear. To identify genes affected by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), we utilized a bioinformatic-intense candidate gene approach and examined gene expression profiles from rodent VILI models ( mouse and rat) using the oligonucleotide microarray platform. To increase statistical power of gene expression analysis, 2,769 mouse/rat orthologous genes identified on RG_U34A and MG_U74Av2 arrays were simultaneously analyzed by significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). This combined ortholog/SAM approach identified 41 up- and 7 downregulated VILI-related candidate genes, results validated by comparable expression levels obtained by either real-time or relative RT-PCR for 15 randomly selected genes. K-mean clustering of 48 VILI-related genes clustered several well-known VILI-associated genes (IL-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, CCL-2, cyclooxygenase-2) with a number of stress-related genes (Myc, Cyr61, Socs3). The only unannotated member of this cluster (n = 14) was RIKEN_1300002F13 EST, an ortholog of the stress-related Gene33/Mig-6 gene. The further evaluation of this candidate strongly suggested its involvement in development of VILI. We speculate that the ortholog-SAM approach is a useful, time- and resource-efficient tool for identification of candidate genes in a variety of complex disease models such as VILI.

J	Dvorkin, D; Fadok, V; Cios, K				Dvorkin, D; Fadok, V; Cios, K			SiMCAL 1 algorithm for analysis of gene expression data related to the phosphatidylserine receptor	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						clustering; Jarris-Patrick; inflammation; microarray; nearest neighbor; nonparametric; phosphatidytserine; PSR; SiMCAL; TGF-beta		Objective: SiMCAL 1 (simple multilevel clustering and linking, version 1) is a novel clustering algorithm for time-series microarray data, presented here with an application to a specific data set. The purpose of the algorithm is to present a complete feature set not found in either Jarvis-Patrick clustering, from which it is derived, or in other popular clustering methods such as hierarchical and k-means. The data concern the activity of the phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) which is believed to be a crucial molecular switch in the mediation of inflammatory response in apoptosis and lysis. By analyzing the behavior of PSR-related genes in mouse macrophages, we hope to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this important biological process. Methods and materials: SiMCAL 1 is implemented in the Python programming Language using the Numerical Python extensions, and the data are stored using the MySQL database management system. The data are derived from exposures of multiple Affymetrix mouse gene microarray chips to elevated levels of PSR antibody and control conditions. Code and data are available at http://www.dvorkin.com/daniel/ Simcal1.zip (accessed: 17 January 2005). Results: The algorithm meets its objectives: it is simple, in that it is computationally inexpensive; it is multilevel, in that it provides a small number of clearly defined hierarchical levels of clusters; and it offers linking between clusters at the same Level in each hierarchy. Clustering and linking results indicate previously unknown coregulation for genes expressing PGH synthase (COX2) and PGE2, appear to confirm increased production of proteins for clearance of apoptotic cetts in the presence of PSR antibody, and correspond to other findings regarding the temporal relationship between PGE2 production and B cell proliferation and differentiation. These results are promising but should be taken as highly preliminary. Conclusion: Both the algorithm and its application to this problem show great potential for future development. We plan to improve and extend the SiMCAL family of algorithms, and to obtain new data so that the algorithm(s) may be further applied to this and other problems of interest.(c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Genome-wide analyses using DNA microarrays make a great contribution to the exploration of the dynamic state of genetic networks, and further lead to the development of new disease diagnosis technologies. An important step in the analysis of gene expression data is to classify genes with similar expression patterns into the same groups. To this end, hierarchical clustering algorithms have been widely used. Major advantages of hierarchical clustering algorithms are that investigators do not need to specify the number of clusters in advance and results are presented visually in the form of a dendrogram. However, since traditional hierarchical clustering methods simply provide results on the statistical characteristics of expression data, biological interpretations of the resulting clusters are not easy, and it requires laborious tasks to unveil hidden biological processes regulated by members in the clusters. Therefore, it has been a very difficult routine for experts. Objective: Here, we propose a novel algorithm in which cluster boundaries are determined by referring to functional annotations stored in genome databases. Materials and methods: The algorithm first performs hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles. Then, the cluster boundaries are determined by the Variance Inflation Factor among the Gene Function Vectors, which represents distributions of gene functions in each cluster. Our algorithm automatically specifies a cutoff that leads to functionally independent agglomerations of genes on the dendrogram derived from similarities among gene expression patterns. Finally, each cluster is annotated according to dominant gene functions within the respective cluster. Results and conclusions: In this paper, we apply our algorithm to two gene expression datasets related to cell cycle and cold stress response in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, we show that the algorithm enables us to recognize cluster boundaries characterizing fundamental biological processes such as the Early G1, Late G1, S, G2 and M phases in cell cycles, and also provides novel annotation information that has not been obtained by traditional hierarchical clustering methods. In addition, using format cluster validity indices, high validity of our algorithm is verified by the comparison through other popular clustering algorithms, K-means, self-organizing map and AutoClass.

After proper normalization of the data, genes are often classified into co-expressed classes (clusters) to identify subgroups of genes that share common regulatory elements, a common function or a common cellular origin. With most methods, e.g. k-means, the number of clusters needs to be specified in advance; results depend strongly on this choice. Even with likelihood-based methods, estimation of this number is difficult. Furthermore, missing values often cause problems and lead to the loss of data. Results: We propose a fully probabilistic Bayesian model to cluster gene-expression profiles. The number of classes does not need to be specified in advance; instead it is adjusted dynamically using a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. Imputation of missing values is integrated into the model. With simulations, we determined the speed of convergence of the sampler as well as the accuracy of the inferred variables. Results were compared with the widely used k-means algorithm. With our method, biologically related co-expressed genes could be identified in a yeast transcriptome dataset, even when some values were missing.

Here, we describe an approach for fine-resolution mapping of land-cover types using aerial photography and ancillary GIs and ground data in a large (100 x 35 km) subtropical estuarine system (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). We have developed and implemented a classification scheme representing 24 coastal (subtidal, intertidal. mangrove, supratidal and terrestrial) cover types relevant to the ecology of estuarine animals, nekton and shorebirds. The accuracy of classifications of the intertidal and subtidal cover types, as indicated by the agreement between the mapped (predicted) and reference (ground) data, was 77-88%, depending on the zone and level of generalization required. The variability and spatial distribution of habitat mosaics (landscape types) across the mapped environment were assessed using K-means clustering and validated with Classification and Regression Tree models. Seven broad landscape types could be distinguished and ways of incorporating the information on landscape composition into site-specific conservation and field research are discussed. This research illustrates the importance and potential applications of fine-resolution mapping for conservation and management of estuarine habitats and their terrestrial and aquatic wildlife.

J	Sanders, AE; Spencer, AJ; Stewart, JF				Sanders, AE; Spencer, AJ; Stewart, JF			Clustering of risk behaviours for oral and general health	COMMUNITY DENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						adults; cluster analysis; epidemiology; oral health; risk behaviour	LIFE-STYLE; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; SMOKING; DETERMINANTS; PATTERNS	While it is recognised that risk behaviours for general health tend to cluster among individuals, it is less clear whether risk behaviours for oral health co-occur among these same individuals. Objectives To describe the distribution of health-relevant behaviours in a population sample, to examine whether oral and general risk behaviours cluster among individuals and to identify population groups with a shared risk profile. Methods Self-reported data were obtained from a stratified random sample of adults aged 18+ who participated in the 2002 National Dental Telephone Interview Survey and completed a subsequent mailed questionnaire (n=3.132). Data were weighted to represent a simple random sample of Australian adults and analysis was limited to dentate adults. Results Four oral health behaviours (toothbrushing frequency, interdental cleaning, exposure to non-milk extrinsic sugars, usual reason for a dental visit) and four general health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, Body Mass Index) were dichotomised. K-means cluster analysis identified two readily interpretable groups that differed significantly on each behaviour apart from alcohol consumption (ANOVA; p=0.77). A significant relationship emerged between cluster memberships and sociodemographic characteristics. Over-represented in the risk behaviour group (40.7% of the sample) were males, Young adults, Australian born, those who did not live in a major city, adults who rented their housing and those adults with lower levels of education and household income (Chi square; p<0.05).

The creation and maintenance of such organized repositories of information requires a great deal of human intervention. The machine learning community has partially addressed this problem by developing hierarchical supervised classifiers that help people categorize new resources within given hierarchies. The worst problem of hierarchical supervised classifiers, however, is their high demand in terms of labeled examples. The number of examples required is related to the number of topics in the taxonomy. Bootstrapping a huge hierarchy with a proper set of labeled examples is therefore a critical issue. This paper proposes some solutions for the bootstrapping problem, that implicitly or explicitly use taxonomy definition: a baseline approach that classifies documents according to the class terms, and two clustering approaches, whose training is constrained by the a priori knowledge encoded in the taxonomy structure, which consists of both terminological and relational aspects. In particular, we propose the Tax-SOM model, that clusters a set of documents in a predefined hierarchy of classes, directly exploiting the knowledge of both their topological organization and their lexical description. Experimental evaluation was performed on a set of taxonomies taken from the Google (TM) and LookSmart (TM) web directories, obtaining good results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Modi, PK; Singh, SP; Sharma, JD				Modi, PK; Singh, SP; Sharma, JD			Loadability margin calculation of power system with SVC using artificial neural network	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						voltage stability; neural networks; static var compensator	PARALLEL	Voltage stability has become a major concern among the utilities over the past decade. With the development of FACTS devices, there is a growing interest in using these devices to improve the stability. In this paper a method using parallel self-organizing hierarchical neural network (PSHNN) is proposed to estimate the loadability margin of the power system with static var compensator (SVC). Limits on reactive generations are considered. Real and reactive power injections along with firing angle of SVC and bus voltage at which SVC is connected, are taken as input features. To improve the performance of network, K-means clustering is employed to form the clusters of patterns having similar loadability margin. To reduce the number of input features in each cluster, system entropy information gain method is used and only those real and reactive power injections, which affect the loadability margin most, are selected. Separate PSHNN is trained for each cluster. The proposed method is implemented on IEEE-30 bus and IEEE-118 bus system. Once trained, the network produces the output, with accuracy and speed. The computation time is also independent of the system size and the load pattern. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhong, W; Altun, G; Harrison, R; Tai, PC; Pan, Y				Zhong, W; Altun, G; Harrison, R; Tai, PC; Pan, Y			Improved K-means clustering algorithm for exploring local protein sequence motifs representing common structural property	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						K-means clustering algorithm; protein structure; sequence motif	SECONDARY STRUCTURE; DATABASE; HELIX; ALIGNMENT; PATTERNS; CHAINS	Information about local protein sequence motifs is very important to the analysis of biologically significant conserved regions of protein sequences. These conserved regions can potentially determine the diverse conformation and activities of proteins. In this work, recurring sequence motifs of proteins are explored with an improved K-means clustering algorithm on a new dataset. The structural similarity of these recurring sequence clusters to produce sequence motifs is studied in order to evaluate the relationship between sequence motifs and their structures. To the best of our knowledge, the dataset used by our research is the most updated dataset among similar studies for sequence motifs. A new greedy initialization method for the K-means algorithm is proposed to improve traditional K-means clustering techniques. The new initialization method tries to choose suitable initial points, which are well separated and have the potential to form high-quality clusters. Our experiments indicate that the improved K-means algorithm satisfactorily increases the percentage of sequence segments belonging to clusters with high structural similarity. Careful comparison of sequence motifs obtained by the improved and traditional algorithms also suggests that the improved K-means clustering algorithm may discover some relatively weak and subtle sequence motifs, which are undetectable by the traditional K-means algorithms. Many biochemical tests reported in the literature show that these sequence motifs are biologically meaningful. Experimental results also indicate that the improved K-means algorithm generates more detailed sequence motifs representing common structures than previous research. Furthermore, these motifs are universally conserved sequence patterns across protein families, overcoming some weak points of other popular sequence motifs. The satisfactory result of the experiment suggests that this new K-means algorithm may be applied to other areas of bioinformatics research in order to explore the underlying relationships between data samples more effectively.

J	Chung, RHY; Yung, NHC; Cheung, PYS				Chung, RHY; Yung, NHC; Cheung, PYS			An efficient parameterless quadrilateral-based image segmentation method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						approximate methods; object representations; region growing; quadrilateral-based segmentation	TRACKING; VIDEO; CURVES; DESIGN	This paper proposes a general quadrilateral-based framework for image segmentation, in which quadrilaterals are first constructed from an edge map, where neighboring quadrilaterals with similar features of interest are then merged together to form regions. Under the proposed framework, the quadrilaterals enable the elimination of local variations and unnecessary details for merging from which each segmented region is accurately and completely described by a set of quadrilaterals. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we derived an efficient and high-performance parameterless quadrilateral-based segmentation algorithm from the framework. The proposed algorithm shows that the regions obtained under the framework are segmented into multiple levels of quadrilaterals that accurately represent the regions without severely over or undersegmenting them. When evaluated objectively and subjectively, the proposed algorithm performs better than three other segmentation techniques, namely, seeded region growing, K-means clustering and constrained gravitational clustering, and offers an efficient description of the segmented objects conducive to content-based applications.

For optimal performance, it accepts samples coming from the class used for training and rejects all samples from other classes. We evaluate six OC classifiers: the Gaussian model, Parzen windows, support vector data description (with two types of kernels: inner product and Gaussian), nearest neighbor data description, K-means, and PCA on three gene-expression profile data sets, those being an SRBCT data set, a Colon data set, and a Leukemia data set. Providing there is a good splitting of training and test samples and feature selection, most OC classifiers can produce high quality results. Parzen windows and support vector data description are "over-strict" in most cases, while nearest neighbor data description is "over-loose". Other classifiers are intermediate between these two extremes. The main difficulty for the OC classifier is it is difficult to obtain an optimum decision threshold if there are a limited number of training samples.

JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						computed tomography; perfusion imaging; brain infarction; cluster analysis	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; VALIDATION; ACCURACY	CT perfusion imaging constitutes an important contribution to the early diagnosis of acute stroke. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time-to-peak (TTP) maps are used to estimate the severity of cerebral damage after acute ischemia. We introduce functional cluster analysis as a new tool to evaluate CT perfusion in order to identify normal brain, ischemic tissue and large vessels. CBF, CBV and TTP maps represent the basis for cluster analysis applying a partitioning (k-means) and density-based (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, DBSCAN) paradigm. In patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke, cluster analysis identified brain areas with distinct hemodynamic properties (gray and white matter) and segmented territorial ischemia. CBF, CBV and TTP values of each detected cluster were displayed. Our preliminary results indicate that functional cluster analysis of CT perfusion maps may become a helpful tool for the interpretation of perfusion maps and provide a rapid means for the segmentation of ischemic tissue.

The change of RNA profiles was monitored on a macroarray containing SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) clones. The number of differentially expressed genes (SCMV infected vs. non-infected) in individual lines was 177, 163, 165, 62, 47, 37, and 93, for FAP1360A, D21, D32, Pa405, F7, D145, and D408, respectively. All inbreds were divided into two groups by hierarchical cluster analysis: D32, D21, FAP1360A and D408 formed one; Pa405, D145, and F7 another group. Due to the genetic structure among the seven inbreds, genetic background and resistance response are confounded. With or without the resistant U.S. inbred line Pa405, 22 and 112 genes were identified by t tests between resistant (D21, D32, and FAP1360A) and susceptible (D145, D408, and F7) inbred lines, respectively. The 112 candidate genes were divided into three clusters by K-means clustering and analyzed in more detail, e.g., five genes were in silico mapped surrounding Scmv2 QTLs. These candidate genes provide a better understanding of signal transduction pathway for SCMV resistance and have the potential to develop functional markers to distinguish resistant and susceptible genotypes.

At the molecular level, not much is known of their terminal differentiation apart from activation of adult-type globin gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression during the terminal differentiation of these cells using microarray-based technology. We identified 180 genes whose expression changed significantly during differentiation. The microarray data were analyzed by hierarchical and k-means clustering and confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We identified several genes including H1f0, Bnip3, Mgl2, ST7L, and Cbll1 that could be useful markers for erythropoiesis. These genetic markers should be a valuable resource both as potential regulators in functional studies of erythroid differentiation, and as straightforward cell type markers.

The cells were imaged in three dimensions and the morphologies of a series of 219 cells were analyzed quantitatively. A total of 26 parameters were studied and automated cluster analysis was carried out using the k-means methods. An effective clustering, judged by silhouette analysis, was achieved using three parameters: level of stratification, extent of the dendritic field, and density of branching. An 11-cluster solution is illustrated. The cells within each cluster are visibly similar along morphological dimensions other than those used statistically to form the clusters. They could often be matched to ganglion cell types defined by previous studies. For reasons that are discussed, however, this classification must remain provisional. Some steps toward more definitive methods of unsupervised classification are pointed out. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Morgan, FW; Stewart, JA; Smith, AN; Tarnuzzer, RW				Morgan, FW; Stewart, JA; Smith, AN; Tarnuzzer, RW			Differential expression of stress response genes in the H-Tx rat model of congenital hydrocephalus	MOLECULAR BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						H-Tx; rat model; congenital hydrocephalus; embryonic brain; stress response gene; cDNA microarray; OneStep (TM) Multiplex RT-PCR	HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; INHERITED HYDROCEPHALUS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; INFANTILE HYDROCEPHALUS; DISEASE; MICROARRAYS; BRAIN; CYCLE	cDNA rat stress microarrays were used to test the general hypothesis that atypical gene expression patterns exist in the brains of Hydrocephalic-Texas (H-Tx) compared to normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats on embryonic day 18. Sixty-two percent of the 216 target transcripts were detected in at least 2 of 3 replicates, with maximum mean fold change (MFC) ratios (H-Tx:SD) in Bcl-2-related ovarian killer protein (BOK, 3.07) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, 0.04). Five (3.73%) of the 134 detected transcripts were elevated and 20 (17.2%) were suppressed more than twofold in H-Tx. MFC ratios for stress response, cytoskeleton-motility, and intracellular transducer-effector-modulator functional classifications were elevated, while MFC ratios for transcription and apoptosis groups were suppressed in H-Tx. K-means clustering revealed several patterns of gene expression with potential biological relevance in apoptosis, intracellular transducer-effector-modulator, metabolism, cell cycle, and stress response transcripts. Multiplex RT-PCR methodology, used to corroborate the cDNA data, captured four distinct temporal expression patterns on embryonic days 16-20 (E16-E20) for HSP27, DnaJ2, HSP47, HSP60, HSP70, HIP, HSP90A, and HSP90p. The discovery of unique chaperone/heat shock expression profiles in the embryonic brains of H-Tx and SD rats is a powerful step towards the development of novel mechanistic hypotheses in the study of hydrocephalus disorders. This is the first study to associate early stress responses with the differential expression of chaperones/heat shock protein-related genes using the H-Tx model of congenital hydrocephalus.

J	Marzouk, YM; Ghoniem, AF				Marzouk, YM; Ghoniem, AF			K-means clustering for optimal partitioning and dynamic load balancing of parallel hierarchical N-body simulations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						k-means clustering; treecode; N-body problems; hierarchical methods; parallel processing; load balancing; particle methods; vortex methods; three-dimensional flow; transverse jet	ADAPTIVE MULTIPOLE ALGORITHM; VORTEX METHODS; PARTICLE METHOD; 3 DIMENSIONS; TREE-CODE; DIFFUSION-EQUATIONS; SHEAR LAYERS; BARNES-HUT; CONVERGENCE; PROGRAM	A number of complex physical problems can be approached through N-body simulation, from fluid flow at high Reynolds number to gravitational astrophysics and molecular dynamics. In all these applications, direct summation is prohibitively expensive for large N and thus hierarchical methods are employed for fast summation. This work introduces new algorithms, based on k-means clustering, for partitioning parallel hierarchical N-body interactions. We demonstrate that the number of particle-cluster interactions and the order at which they are performed are directly affected by partition geometry. Weighted k-means partitions minimize the sum of clusters' second moments and create well-localized domains, and thus reduce the computational cost of N-body approximations by enabling the use of lowerolder approximations and fewer cells. We also introduce compatible techniques for dynamic load balancing, including adaptive scaling of cluster volumes and adaptive redistribution of cluster centroids. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms by constructing a parallel treecode for vortex particle simulations, based oil the serial variable-order Cartesian code developed by Lindsay and Krasny [Journal of Computational Physics 172 (2) (2001) 879-907]. The method is applied to vortex simulations of a transverse jet. Results show outstanding parallel efficiencies even at high concurrencies, with velocity evaluation errors maintained at or below their serial values; on a realistic distribution of 1.2 million vortex particles, we observe a parallel efficiency of 98% on 1024 processors. Excellent load balance is achieved even in the face of several obstacles, such as an irregular, time-evolving particle distribution containing a range of length scales and the continual introduction of new vortex particles throughout the domain. Moreover, results suggest that k-means yields a more efficient partition of the domain than a global oct-tree. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A total of 474 sites were classified according to the seven variables using the Self-Organizing Map (neural network), and three clusters were detected (k-means algorithm). The frequency of the various fish co-occurrence patterns was calculated for each cluster, and general linear modeling was used to specify the conditions that predict the occurrence of each species. Piedmont streams were more likely to support coexisting gudgeon and minnow populations because of higher probabilities of occurrence for both species. The higher co-occurrence frequency for the three species together in headwater streams resulted from lower occurrence frequencies in gudgeon and minnow. Focusing on areas that favor the co-occurrence of species may enhance the effectiveness of conservation projects.

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of high- resolution MRI in evaluation of the quantity and pattern of mineral deposition in carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) specimens, with quantitative micro- CT as the gold standard. Methods and Results - High- resolution MRI and CT were compared in 20 CEA specimens. Linear regression comparing mineral volumes generated from CT ( V-CT) and MRI ( V-MRI) data demonstrated good correlation using simple thresholding ( V-MRI = - 0.01 + 0.98V(CT); R-2 = 0.90; threshold = 4 x noise) and k- means clustering methods ( V-MRI = - 0.005 + 1.38V(CT); R-2 = 0.93). Bone mineral density ( BMD) and bone mineral content ( BMC [ mineral mass]) were calculated for CT data and BMC verified with ash weight. Patterns of mineralization like particles, granules, and sheets were more clearly depicted on CT. Conclusions - Mineral volumes generated from MRI or CT data were highly correlated. CT provided a more detailed depiction of mineralization patterns and provided BMD and BMC in addition to mineral volume. The extent of mineralization as well as the morphology may ultimately be useful in assessing plaque stability.

J	Kuo, RJ; Liao, JL; Tu, C				Kuo, RJ; Liao, JL; Tu, C			Integration of ART2 neural network and genetic K-means algorithm for analyzing Web browsing paths in electronic commerce	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering analysis; data mining; ART2; genetic K-means algorithm; recommendation agent system	MARKET-SEGMENTATION; CLUSTERS	Neural networks and genetic algorithms are useful for clustering analysis in data mining. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) have been applied in many areas with very promising results. Thus, this study uses adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) neural network to determine an initial solution, and then applies genetic K-means algorithm (GKA) to find the final solution for analyzing Web browsing paths in electronic commerce (EC). The proposed method is compared with ART2 followed by K-means. In order to verify the proposed method, data from a Monte Carlo Simulation are used. The simulation results show that the ART2 + GKA is significantly better than the ART2 + K-means, both for mean within cluster variations and misclassification rate. A real-world problem, a recommendation agent system for a Web PDA company, is investigated. In this system, the browsing paths are used for clustering in order to analyze the browsing preferences of customers. These results also show that, based on the mean within-cluster variations, ART2 + GKA is much more effective. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These parameters-the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the ammonia NH4-characterize the organic matter and nitrogen removal biological process carried out at the Saint Cyprien WWTP (France). Their knowledge make it possible to estimate the process quality and efficiency. First, the data are treated by K-Means clustering then by principal components analysis (PCA) in order to optimize the multi-level perceptron (MLP) learning phase. K-Means clustering makes it possible to highlight different operations within the Saint Cyprien treatment plant. The PCA is used to eliminate redundancies and synthesizes the information expressed by a data set.

A dense scallop bed was surveyed in 2002, with a QTC VIEW Series IV acoustic ground-discrimination system (AGDS) connected to a 38 kHz, 7 degrees split-beam SIMRAD EK60 scientific echosounder. In 2003, a 50 kHz, 42 degrees single-beam SUZUKI ES-2025 echosounder was connected to a QTC VIEW Series V AGDS. The QTC VIEW data were analysed with QTC IMPACT following the standard procedures and classified into acoustic classes. Several approaches were tested: unsupervised and supervised survey strategies directed to specific benthic communities. The SIMRAD EK60 seabed volume-backscattering strength (S-v) was submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA), before and after removal of a depth trend, and the scores on the first 10 principal components were classed by a K-means cluster analysis. The same seabed Sv data were submitted to stepwise discriminant analysis whose training data sets were defined with the ground-truth photographs using different groupings: biotope types, community types, and finally scallop-density classes. All the QTC AGDS approaches failed to reveal the scallop bed, community structures, or biotopes. The QTC classifications mimicked the bathymetry with a strong correlation of the acoustic classes with depth. The seabed S, PCA + K-means approach presented similar depth-dependence, but, the PCA + K-means on the S,. residuals revealed the scallop bed. The discriminant analysis was the best solution for the scallop density with a general classification success rate of 75% and up to 91% for the highest density class. The Sv signature of the scallop bed is presented, and the most discriminant part of the acoustic signal is identified.

J	Singhal, A; Seborg, DE				Singhal, A; Seborg, DE			Clustering multivariate time-series data	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS			English	Article						clustering; similarity factor; fault diagnosis; process monitoring	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION; NUMBER; PLANTS; MODEL; PCA	A new methodology for clustering multivariate time-series data is proposed. The new methodology is based on calculating the degree of similarity between multivariate time-series datasets using two similarity factors. One similarity factor is based on principal component analysis and the angles between the principal component subspaces while the other is based on the Mahalanobis distance between the datasets. The standard K-means clustering algorithm is modified to cluster multivariate time-series datasets using similarity factors. Simulation data from two nonlinear dynamic systems: a batch fermentation and a continuous exothermic chemical reactor, are clustered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Comparisons with existing clustering methods show several advantages of the proposed method. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A two-stage K-means clustering method was designed to analyse chemical data in the form of percentages of major ions (Na, Mg, Ca, Cl, HCO(3) and SO(4)); the first stage of clustering produced 347 groups, which were then re-clustered to generate the final nine water types. The analysis enabled the definition of provinces of water composition and highlighted natural processes influencing the surface water chemistry. On a statewide basis, sodium is the dominant cation and around 50% at all stream flows, while proportions of calcium and magnesium are about equal. Chloride and bicarbonate constitute the bulk of anions present, while sulfate occurs occasionally and tends to be localised. On a global basis, Queensland surface waters are relatively high in sodium, chloride and magnesium, and low in calcium and sulfate. It was also found that the geographical location has a greater impact on major ion ratios than does the stage of stream flow. The regional chemical trends are consistent with geology and climate. Streams in northeast Queensland, with short, steep catchments and high rainfall, yield low salinity, sodium-dominated water; this is also the case for sandy southern coastal catchments. Both also reflect an oceanic influence. The proportions of sodium and chloride decrease westward; streams draining the western side of the Great Dividing Range or flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria have low salinity but relatively hard water. Streams in western Queensland are higher in calcium and bicarbonate. In the large catchments flowing from Queensland into central Australia, the water composition is highly variable, commonly with elevated sulfate. Also in Queensland, there are several other clearly definable water provinces such as the high magnesium waters of basaltic areas. The findings of this study confirm that the application of such analytical methods can provide a useful assessment of controls over water composition and support management at regional level; the approach used is shown and are applicable to large, disparate datasets.

However, the mechanism of MPP+-induced neurotoxicity is still unclear In this study, the dose response and time-course of MPP'-induced DA depletion and decreased cell viability were determined in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells. The alteration of transcription factors (TFs) induced by MPP+ from a selected dose level and time point was then evaluated using protein/DNA-binding arrays. K-means clustering analysis identified four pattems of protein/DNA-binding changes. Three of the 28 TFs identified in PC12 cells increased by 100% (p53, PRE, Smad SBE) and 2 decreased by 50% (HSE, RXR(DR1)) of control with MPP+ treatment. In addition, three TFs decreased within the range of 33-50% (TFIID, E2F1, CREB) and two TFs increased within the range of 50-100% (PAX-5, Stat4). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to confirm the changes of p53 and HSE. The observed changes in TFs correlated with the alterations of DA and cell viability. The data indicates that selective transcription factors are involved in MPP'-induced neurotoxicity and it provides mechanistic information that may be applicable to animal studies with MPTP and clinical studies of Parkinson's disease.

We have used an energy function for the protein-protein interaction that consists of electrostatic interaction, van der Waals interaction, and solvation energy terms represented by the occupancy desolvation method. The parameters of the AMBER94 all-atom empirical force field are used. Each energy term is calculated by precalculated grid potentials and B-spline method approximation. The ligand protein is placed inside a sphere of 50 A radius centered at an appropriate location, and the CSA rigid docking studies are carried out to find stable complexes. Up to 10 complexes are selected using the K-mean clustering method and biological information when available. These complexes are energy-minimized for further refinement by considering the flexibility of interacting proteins.

J	Kim, P; Ding, Y				Kim, P; Ding, Y			Optimal engineering system design guided by data-mining methods	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						classification and regression tree; fixture layout optimization; K-means clustering; kriging model; multistation assembly processes; uniform design		An optimal engineering design problem is challenging because nonlinear objective functions usually need to be evaluated in a high-dimensional design space. This article presents a data-mining-aided optimal design method, that is able to find a competitive design solution with a relatively low computational cost. The method consists of four components: (1) a uniform-coverage selection method, that chooses design representatives from among a large number of original design alternatives for a nonrectangular design space; (2) feature functions, of which evaluation is computationally economical as the surrogate for the design objective function; (3) a clustering method, that generates a design library based on the evaluation of feature functions instead of an objective function; and (4) a classification method to create the design selection rules, eventually leading us to a competitive design. Those components are implemented to facilitate the optimal fixture layout design in a multistation panel assembly process. The benefit of the data-mining-aided optimal design is clearly demonstrated by comparison with both local optimization methods (e.g., simplex search) and random search-based optimizations (e.g., simulated annealing).

J	Maruyama, T; Kawachi, T; Singh, VP				Maruyama, T; Kawachi, T; Singh, VP			Entropy-based assessment and clustering of potential water resources availability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						entropy; rainfall; uncertainty; clustering; potential water resources availability		The potential water resources availability (PWRA) in an area is assessed in terms of disorder in intensity and over-a-year apportionment of monthly rainfall. The disorder is treasured by two different entropies. intensity entropy (IE) and apportionment entropy (AE), which are defined using Shannon's informational entropy theory. These entropies are standardized and pairs of standardized IE and AE for different locations of raingauges tire plotted. Then. simple clustering and K-means clustering are considered for delineating PWRA distributed over tin area of interest and classifying regional attributes of PWRA. Monthly rainfall data recorded at 11,260 raingauges are analyzed, and different classifications of PWRA are comparatively mapped. An example application of the proposed methodology to the worldwide PWRA assessment is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society	OCT 07-09, 2004	Little Rock, AR	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc			GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; CANCER; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS	Motivation: In cluster analysis, the validity of specific solutions, algorithms, and procedures present significant challenges because there is no null hypothesis to test and no 'right answer'. It has been noted that a replicable classification is not necessarily a useful one, but a useful one that characterizes some aspect of the population must be replicable. By replicable we mean reproducible across multiple samplings from the same population. Methodologists have suggested that the validity of clustering methods should be based on classifications that yield reproducible findings beyond chance levels. We used this approach to determine the performance of commonly used clustering algorithms and the degree of replicability achieved using several microarray datasets. Methods: We considered four commonly used iterative partitioning algorithms ( Self Organizing Maps (SOM), K-means, Clutsering LARge Applications (CLARA), and Fuzzy C-means) and evaluated their performances on 37 microarray datasets, with sample sizes ranging from 12 to 172. We assessed reproducibility of the clustering algorithm by measuring the strength of relationship between clustering outputs of subsamples of 37 datasets. Cluster stability was quantified using Cramer's v(2) from a kXk table. Cramer's v(2) is equivalent to the squared canonical correlation coefficient between two sets of nominal variables. Potential scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting perfect reproducibility. Results: All four clustering routines show increased stability with larger sample sizes. K-means and SOM showed a gradual increase in stability with increasing sample size. CLARA and Fuzzy C-means, however, yielded low stability scores until sample sizes approached 30 and then gradually increased thereafter. Average stability never exceeded 0.55 for the four clustering routines, even at a sample size of 50. These findings suggest several plausible scenarios: ( 1) microarray datasets lack natural clustering structure thereby producing low stability scores on all four methods; ( 2) the algorithms studied do not produce reliable results and/or ( 3) sample sizes typically used in microarray research may be too small to support derivation of reliable clustering results. Further research should be directed towards evaluating stability performances of more clustering algorithms on more datasets specially having larger sample sizes with larger numbers of clusters considered.

Such a tool is used, for example with Kohonen maps, to measure the quality of the quantification preserving the neighborhood relationships.

In addition, we show that the Minimum entropy principle leads to the objective function of the k-means clustering, and the maximum within-cluster association is closed related to the spectral clustering which is an eigen-decomposition-based method.

Methods: The present paper addresses the question of searching a pattern of amino acids (not necessarily completely specified) by means of the cross-correlation of complex sequences, obtained after suitable coding of the original amino acid sequence. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm provides a flexible strategy in setting the border between the accepted and rejected ORFs, by means of the k-means clustering of the candidate ORFs. The search for the class of proteins specified by the pattern is carried out from the most basic level, i.e. the DNA sequence, without sifting through an ensemble of previously determined ORFs. Thus, an exhaustive examination of all the occurrences of the pattern in the genome is performed. Results: The application of the method to the search of surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria witnesses its efficacy, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. The comparison with the usual (and somewhat arbitrary) choice of setting a fixed value for the threshold length of the putative ORF confirms the validity of the proposed approach.

A total of 146 genes were identified as differentially expressed; the affected functions including metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycling, RNA splicing, Wnt signaling, reactive oxygen species-induced stress, and fibro/cirrhogenesis. The genes were found to fit into four distinct expression patterns after classification by hierarchical and k-means clustering procedures. Notably, genes within the same functional category tended to be found within the same cluster, thus gene functions appeared to be related to their expression patterns. For example, genes encoding receptors (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.01) and cytokines (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05) were both enriched in a cluster characterized by low expression in HCC compared to their surrounding tissues. While some of the receptors in this cluster had cell-proliferative potential, others are known to be growth-suppressive. It was noted, however, that four of the 10 receptor genes encode G-protein-coupled receptors, for which growth-suppressive potential has been reported. The seven growth factors in the same cluster included two fibroblast growth factors. The current findings suggest the possibility that genes differentially expressed in this multistep carcinogenic model may be classified into relatively few clusters according to their expression patterns, and that these clusters may be associated with gene functional categories.

The fractal dimension could be used to quantify the texture information. In this study, the differences of gray value of neighboring pixels are used to estimate the fractal dimension of an ultrasound image of breast lesion by using the fractal Brownian motion. Furthermore, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the fractal analysis is proposed to classify the breast lesions into two classes: benign and malignant. To improve the classification performances, the ultrasound images are preprocessed by using morphology operations and histogram equalization. Finally, the k-means classification method is used to classify benign tumors from malignant ones. The US breast image databases include only histologically confirmed cases: 110 malignant and 140 benign tumors, which were recorded. All the digital images were obtained prior to biopsy using by an ATL HDI 3000 system. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area index A(Z) is 0.9218, which represents the diagnostic performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Giani, U; Romano, A; Bruzzese, D				Giani, U; Romano, A; Bruzzese, D			An epidemiological model of knowledge diffusion in virtual learning networks: An application to learning statistics in medicine	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							MEMES; SIMULATION	Some authors claim that the genetic metaphor can be used for describing intergenerational cultural transmission. In analogy with genes, memes can be conceived as cultural units that can be transmitted from one generation to another. A variant of this metaphor conceives cultural transmission as a sort of contagion within a social network of individuals. In this respect, distance learning networks provide a valuable tool for analyzing the spreading of information in virtual communities. In this article, the time evolution of the student's applications to an interactive distance learning platform was analysed. The platform DVLN was developed at the University of Naples and allows tracking all the students' interactions with the system. The diffusion of the innovation among the students of the Course of Medical Statistics was modelled by means of a system of differential equations where the diffusion of the innovation adoption depends on the contact rate between two types of students: the innovators and the potential imitators. Furthermore, by means of k-means cluster analysis of the interactions of the students with the system, three learning styles, i.e. lurkers, socializers, utilitarists, were found. An attempt to explain the macroscopic spreading of innovation adoption on the basis of individual microscopic decisions to accept or refute the innovation was carried out. The authors claim that the representation of the learning process as a temporal dynamics of a network of cognitive agents opens new perspectives to the scientific analysis of the learning process in human groups.

CBR systems have been successfully used in several domains of artificial intelligence. In order to enhance efficiency and capability of CBR systems, we connected the SOM method to deal with cluster problems of CBR systems, SOM/CBR for short. Case base is acquired from a book selling data of a wholesaler in Taiwan, and it is applied by SOM/CBR to forecast sales of new released books. We found the SOM/CBR method has excellent performance. The result of the prediction of SOM/CBR was compared with the results of K/CBR, which is divided by K-mean, and traditional CBR. We find out that the SOM/CBR is more accurate and efficient when being applied to the forecast of the data than K/CBR or traditional CBR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, HT; Chen, SC; Peng, PC				Yang, HT; Chen, SC; Peng, PC			Genetic k-means-algorithm-based classification of direct load-control curves	IEE PROCEEDINGS-GENERATION TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								To improve the load factors of a power system, direct load control (DLC) of air conditioners is one effective approach adopted by utilities. However, the performance of a DLC programme should be evaluated periodically to validate the preferential tariff provided to the customers involved. Prior to evaluating the performance, the DLC curves recorded should be categorised properly. The only further factor evaluated is the category of the DLC curves that comply with the required control pattern. Therefore, developing efficient approaches for classifying DLC curves is needed. In the paper, with the aim of reducing the number of variables for classification and enhancing the classification effectiveness, autoregression moving-averaging (ARMA) modelling techniques are employed to extract the features of the DLC curves. To ensure the adequacy of the ARMA models used for the DLC curves, the Akaike information criterion is assessed. Based on the features extracted, the genetic k-means algorithm is then adopted for classification owing to its ability to partition given global data optimally into a specified number of clusters. Through the proposed approaches, categories are derived of the DLC curves complying and noncomplying with the control pattern. The results obtained from the comparisons with the artificial-neural-network approach show that the clusters divided using the proposed approach exhibit very high classification rates for the practical data on Taiwan Power Company DLC programmes.

The fused feature set utilizes both the Gabor filter's capability of accurately capturing lower and mid-frequency texture information and the GLCP's capability in texture information relevant to higher frequency components. Evaluation methods include comparing feature space separability and comparing image segmentation classification rates. The fused feature sets are demonstrated to produce higher feature space separations, as well as higher segmentation accuracies relative to the individual feature sets. Fused feature sets also outperform individual feature sets for noisy images, across different noise magnitudes. The curse of dimensionality is demonstrated not to affect segmentation using the proposed the 48-dimensional fused feature set. Gabor magnitude responses produce higher segmentation accuracies than linearly normalized Gabor magnitude responses. Feature reduction using principal component analysis is acceptable for maintaining the segmentation performance, but feature reduction using the feature contrast method dramatically reduced the segmentation accuracy. Overall, the designed fused feature set is advocated as a means for improving texture segmentation performance.

J	Wang, MH; Ho, CY				Wang, MH; Ho, CY			Application of extension theory to PD pattern recognition in high-voltage current transformers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						current transformers (CTs); extension theory; matter-element model; partial discharge (PD)	PARTIAL DISCHARGES; DIAGNOSIS; BEHAVIOR	This paper presents a novel partial-discharge (PD) recognition method based on the extension theory for high-voltage cast-resin current transformers (CRCTs). First, a commercial PD detector is used to measure the three-dimensional (3-D) PD patterns of the high-voltage CRCTs, then three data preprocessing schemes that extract relevant features from the raw 3-D-PD patterns are presented for the proposed PD recognition method. Second, the matter-element models of the PD defect types are built according to PD patterns derived from practical experimental results. Then, the PD defect in a CRCT can be directly identified by degrees of correlation between the tested pattern and the matter-element models which have been built up. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparative studies using a multilayer neural network and k-means algorithm are conducted on 150 sets of field-test PD patterns of 23-kV CRCTs with rather encouraging results.

In the previous work, we proposed the multiple linear regression of the log spectra (MRLS) for estimating the log spectra of speech at a close-talking microphone. In this paper, the concept is extended to nonlinear regressions. Regressions in the cepstrum domain are also investigated. An effective algorithm is developed to adapt the regression weights automatically to different noise environments. Compared to the nearest distant microphone and adaptive beamformer (Generalized Sidelobe Canceller), the proposed adaptive nonlinear regression approach shows an advantage in the average relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 58.5% and 10.3%, respectively, for isolated word recognition under 15 real car environments.

Given a set of documents, the set of associations among frequently co-occurring terms in documents forms naturally a simplicial complex. Our general thesis is each connected component of this simplicial complex represents a concept in the collection. Based on these concepts, documents can be clustered into meaningful classes. However, in this paper, we attack a softer notion, instead of connected components, we use maximal simplexes of highest dimension as representative of connected components, the concept so defined is called maximal primitive concepts. Experiments with three different data sets from Web pages and medical literature have shown that the proposed unsupervised clustering approach performs significantly better than traditional clustering algorithms, such as k-means, AutoClass and Hierarchical Clustering (HAG). This abstract geometric model seems have captured the latent semantic structure of documents. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

By analyzing results with unsupervised (hierarchical and K-means clustering) algorithms, three distinct immunophenotypic groups (I, II, and III) were identified, group I (51/123) with longer survivals, as compared to the group II (36/123) and III (36/123). The immunophenotypic signatures of these groups, as determined by applying the nearest Shrunken centroids method as class predictor, were characterized by the coordinated and differential expression of 12 Surface markers, that is, group I: above-average expression of CD62L, CD54, CD49c, and C1325, below-average expression of CD38; group II: above-average expression of CD38, CD49d, CD29, and CD49e; and group III: below-average expression of the above markers, overexpression of CD23, CD20, SmIg, and CD79b. As opposed to groups II-III, group I B-CLLs lacked expression of ZAP-70 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase in the majority of cases, while more frequently had mutated IgV(H) genes and IgV(H) mutations consistent with antigen-driven selection. Our findings contribute to improve the immunophenotypical identification of disease subsets with different prognosis and suggest a set of surface antigens to be employed as prognosticators in routine diagnostic/prognostic procedures.

A distance threshold determined by plotting the sum of radii of leaf clusters was used as a termination criterion for the clustering process. Hierarchical trees were constructed that can be used to obtain an overview of the data distribution and inherent cluster structure. The approach is also applicable to Iigand-based virtual screening with the aim to generate preferred screening collections or focused compound libraries. Retrospective analysis of two activity classes was performed: inhibitors of caspase 1 [interleukin 1 (IL1) cleaving enzyme, ICE] and glucocorticoid receptor ligands. The MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) and Collection of Bioactive Reference Analogues (COBRA) databases served as the compound pool, for which binary trees were produced. Molecules were encoded by all Molecular Operating Environment 2D descriptors and topological pharmacophore atom types. Individual clusters were assessed for their purity and enrichment of actives belonging, to the two ligand classes. Si nificant enrichment was observed in individual branches of the cluster tree. After clustering a combined database of MDDR, COBRA, and the SPECS catalog, it was possible to retrieve MDDR ICE inhibitors with new scaffolds using COBRA ICE inhibitors as seeds. A Java implementation of the clustering method is available via the Internet (http://www.modlab.de).

It affects many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The increasing resistance of Plasmodium spp. to existing therapies has heightened alarms about malaria in the international health community. Nowadays, there is a pressing need for identifying and developing new drug-based antimalarial therapies. In an effort to overcome this problem, the main purpose of this study is to develop simple linear discriminant-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for the classification and prediction of antimalarial activity using some of the TOMOCOMD-CARDD (TOpological MOlecular COMputer Design-Computer Aided "Rational" Drug Design) fingerprints, so as to enable computational screening from virtual combinatorial datasets. In this sense, a database of 1562 organic chemicals having great structural variability, 597 of them antimalarial agents and 965 compounds having other clinical uses, was analyzed and presented as a helpful too], not only for theoretical chemists but also for other researchers in this area. This series of compounds was processed by a k-means cluster analysis in order to design training and predicting sets. Afterward, two linear classification functions were derived in order to discriminate between antimalarial and nonantimalarial compounds. The models (including nonstochastic and stochastic indices) correctly classify more than 93% of the compound set, in both training and external prediction datasets. They showed high Matthews' correlation coefficients, 0.889 and 0.866 for the training set and 0.855 and 0.857 for the test one. The models' predictivity was also assessed and validated by the random removal of 10% of the compounds to form a new test set, for which predictions were made using the models. The overall means of the correct classification for this process (leave group 10% full-out cross validation) using the equations with nonstochastic and stochastic atom-based quadratic fingerprints were 93.93% and 92.77%, respectively. The quadratic maps-based TOMOCOMD-CARDD approach implemented in this work was successfully compared with four of the most useful models for antimalarials selection reported to date. The developed models were then used in a simulation of a virtual search for Ras FTase (FTase = farnesyltransferase) inhibitors with antimalarial activity; 70% and 100% of the 10 inhibitors used in this virtual search were correctly classified, showing the ability of the models to identify new lead antimalarials. Finally, these two QSAR models were used in the identification of previously unknown antimalarials. In this sense, three synthetic intermediaries of quinolinic compounds were evaluated as active/inactive ones using the developed models. The synthesis and biological evaluation of these chemicals against two malaria strains, using chloroquine as a reference, was performed. An accuracy of 100% with the theoretical predictions was observed. Compound 3 showed antimalarial activity, being the first report of an arylaminomethylenemalonate having such behavior. This result opens a door to a virtual study considering a higher variability of the structural core already evaluated, as well as of other chemicals not included in this study. We conclude that the approach described here seems to be a promising QSAR tool for the molecular discovery of novel classes of antimalarial drugs, which may meet the dual challenges posed by drug-resistant parasites and the rapid progression of malaria illnesses.

Sixty-six samples were taken from the various mesohabitat types throughout a one-year period. Water depth, current velocity, substratum composition, and particulate organic matter were used to describe the mesohabitats within each sample unit. The species and abiotic data were computed separately with the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. Then, using the k-means algorithm, clusters were detected on the maps and the sampling units were classified separately for each variable and for species densities. Four clusters could be identified on the SOM according to nine environmental variables, and this classification was related to the morphodynamic conditions, chiefly with respect to substrate composition and current velocity. Similarly, three subsets were derived from the SOM according to gradients of species densities. The coincidence between 'abiotic' and 'mayfly' clusters showed that: (1) E. danica, Caenis sp. and S. ignita used similar mesohabitats, but E. danica was temporally segregated; (2) competition for space was likely to occur between Caenis sp. and S. ignita; and (3) R. semicolorata was spatially segregated from the three other mayflies. The method is discussed with reference to two alternative techniques: habitat preference curves, and multivariate analyses. The former implies a greater computation effort and is rather convenient under applied perspectives. The second approach faces the basic assumption that non-linear modelling methods should be preferred for dealing with ecological data which vary and covary in non-linear fashions. By combining ordering and clustering abilities (and other advantages such as gradient analysis and detection of outliers), SOM provides a visual and efficient way to bring out structures in the distribution of co-occurring species within multivariate microenvironments.

J	Xu, WH; Nandi, AK; Zhang, JH; Evans, KG				Xu, WH; Nandi, AK; Zhang, JH; Evans, KG			Novel vector quantiser design using reinforced learning as a pre-process	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						vector quantisation; GLA; FKM; FVQ; LVQ; reinforced learning; FRLVQ	MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION	This paper presents the development and evaluation of a new approach toward the design of optimised codebooks by vector quantisation (VQ). A strategy of reinforced learning (RL) is proposed which exploits the advantages offered by fuzzy clustering algorithms, competitive learning and knowledge of training vector and codevector configurations. RL is used as a pre-process before using a conventional VQ algorithm such as the generalised Lloyd algorithm (GLA) or the fuzzy k-means (FKM) algorithm. At each iteration of RL, codevectors move intelligently and intentionally toward an improved optimum codebook design. This is distinct from simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques in which a random variation is introduced in the movement of the codevectors. The new strategy reduces the possibility that, in the final design, codevectors will be overcrowded in the high density distribution regions of the training vector space, and also that too few codevectors will be settled in low density regions. Experiments demonstrate that this results in a more effective representation of the training vectors by the codevectors and that the final codebook is nearer to the optimal solution in applications such as image compression. It has been found that GLA and FKM yield improved quality of codebook design in this application when RL is used as a pre-process. The investigations have also indicated that RL is insensitive to the selection of both the initial codebook and a learning rate control parameter, which is the only additional parameter introduced by RL from the standard FKM.

J	Hand, DJ; Krzanowski, WJ				Hand, DJ; Krzanowski, WJ			Optimising k-means clustering results with standard software packages	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						cluster analysis; criterion optimisation; iterative refinement; starting values	ALGORITHM	The k-means method of clustering is a very popular technique available on most standard statistical software packages. it is an iterative algorithm that requires specification of a starting configuration, and many packages use a random start unless the user declares otherwise. Typically, users are encouraged to run the analysis from a number of random starts and to take the best resultant solution. Some packages, however, base the default starting option on a preliminary analysis such as hierarchical clustering. This does not allow users to produce different "replicate" solutions, so the temptation is to treat the final solution as a global rather than local optimum. The dangers of drawing this conclusion are highlighted, an iterative scheme that generally improves on the default solution is suggested, and this scheme is compared with the "best of 20 random starts" method favoured by many users.

This study was performed to investigate the perfusion characteristics in MS lesions using dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging (DSC-MRI) to better understand the hemodynamic changes in MS. METHODS: Seventeen patients with relapsing-remitting MS were studied with DSC-MRI. Perfusion measurements included cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT), were obtained in enhancing, non-enhancing lesions covered by DSC-MRI and contralateral normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients as well as normal white matter in seventeen control subjects. RESULTS: DSC-MRI data demonstrated reduced perfusion with significantly prolonged MTT (P < 0.001) in lesions and NAWM in patients compared with normal white matter in controls. Compared to contralateral NAWM, enhancing lesions demonstrate increased CBF (P = 0.007) and CBV (P < 0.0001), indicating inflammation-mediated vasodilatation. A K means cluster analysis was performed and identifies approximately 63.8% of non-enhancing lesions (Class 1) with significantly decreased perfusion (P :5 0.0001) when compared with contralateral NAWM. In contrast, the remainder 36.2% non-enhancing lesions (Class 2) show increased CBV (P = 0.02) in a similar fashion to enhancing lesions and can be observed on quantitative color-coded maps even without blood-brain barrier breakdown. CONCLUSION. DSC-MRI measurements demonstrate potential for investigating hemodynamic abnormalities that are associated with inflammatory activity, lesion reactivity and vascular compromise in MS lesions. Non-enhancing lesions showed both low and high perfusion suggesting microvascular abnormalities with hemodynamic impairment and inflammatory reactivity that cannot be seen on conventional MRI.

The features are extracted from dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) time-course data. Material: The DCE-MRI data of the female breast are obtained within the UK Multicenter Breast Screening Study. The group of patients imaged in this study is selected on the basis of an increased genetic risk for developing breast cancer. Methods: The k-means clustering and self-organizing maps (SOM) are applied to analyze the signal structure in terms of visualization. We employ k-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-nn), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees (DT) to classify features using a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) approach. Results: Regarding the unsupervised techniques, clustering according to features indicating benign and malignant characteristics is observed to a limited extend. The supervised approaches classified the data with 74% accuracy (DT) and providing an area under the receiver-operator-characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.88 (SVM). Conclusion: It was found that contour and wash-out type (WOT) features determined by the radiologists lead to the best SVM classification results. Although a fast signal uptake in early time-point measurements is an important feature for malignant/benign classification of tumours, our results indicate that the wash-out characteristics might be considered as important. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The qualitative classification is R.W. Finley's "Original Vegetation of Wisconsin" and relies on criteria determined by an expert individual. The classification accounts for descriptive information and expert knowledge, but is not easily reproducible due to locally subjective decisions of class delineations. The quantitative classifications rely on a numerical-objective algorithm that ensures classification reproducibility and tests for robustness, but do not account for local ecosystem knowledge or qualitative detail. For model development, a cell in the forest-landscape lattice is chosen according to three generic and stochastic rules. The uncorrelated" rule chooses a cell randomly, the "correlated" rule picks a cell within two distances of random length, and the raster" rule chooses randomly one of four immediate neighbors in the lattice. The so chosen cell is then replaced by a cell randomly identified within a circular neighborhood of radius r (1 < r < 10). Comparisons between model simulations and the empirical forest landscapes include temporal dynamics (cluster probability) and spatial patterns (fractal dimension, landscape diversity). Results suggest that the simulated landscape (1) exhibits self-organization for intermediate neighborhoods (r = 3), independent of the classification approach, three model-development rules, and two initial and boundary conditions; (2) achieves temporal (cluster probability) dynamics and spatial patterns (fractal dimension, landscape diversity) consistent with the empirical landscape. It is, therefore, concluded that a generic model calibrated independently from specific ecological processes may suffice to replicate major statistical characteristics of a complex landscape with simulations that are robust to various landscape-classification approaches.

J	Oh, C; Tok, A; Ritchie, SG				Oh, C; Tok, A; Ritchie, SG			Real-time freeway level of service using inductive-signature-based vehicle reidentification system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						inductive vehicle signature; level of service; vehicle reidentification		The Highway Capacity Manual provides a method for determining the level of service (LOS) on freeways to evaluate freeway performance. Apart from being essentially an off-line decision support tool for planning and design, it is also based on point measurements from loop detectors, which may not provide an accurate assessment of freeway section performance. In order to meet user requirements of advanced traffic management and information systems, new LOS criteria based on section measures are required for real-time freeway analysis. The main aim of this research was to demonstrate a technique for development of such LOS criteria. The study uses a new measure of effectiveness, called reidentified median section speed (RMSS), derived from analysis of inductive vehicle signatures and reidentification of vehicles traveling through a major section of freeway in the City of Irvine, CA. Two main issues regarding real-time LOS criteria were addressed. The first was how to determine the threshold values partitioning the LOS categories. To provide reliable real-time traffic information, the threshold values should be decided such that RMSSs within the same LOS category represent similar traffic conditions as much as possible. In addition, RMSSs in different LOS categories should represent dissimilar traffic conditions. The second issue concerned the aggregation interval to use for deriving LOS categories. Two clustering techniques were then employed to derive LOS categories, namely, k-means and fuzzy approaches. Wilk's Lambda analysis and LOS stability analysis were performed to design new LOS criteria. Six LOS categories defined in terms of RMSS over a fixed 240-s interval were identified as the best solution to meet two major considerations described above. The procedures used in this study are readily transferable to other similarly equipped freeway sections for the derivation of real-time LOS.

J	Fred, ALN; Jain, AK				Fred, ALN; Jain, AK			Combining multiple clusterings using evidence accumulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						cluster analysis; combining clustering partitions; cluster fusion; evidence accumulation; robust clustering; K-means algorithm; single-link method; cluster validity; mutual information	VALIDITY; MODEL; RETRIEVAL	We explore the idea of evidence accumulation (EAC) for combining the results of multiple clusterings. First, a clustering ensemble-a set of object partitions, is produced. Given a data set (n objects or patterns in d dimensions), different ways of producing data partitions are: 1) applying different clustering algorithms and 2) applying the same clustering algorithm with different values of parameters or initializations. Further, combinations of different data representations (feature spaces) and clustering algorithms can also provide a multitude of significantly different data partitionings. We propose a simple framework for extracting a consistent clustering, given the various partitions in a clustering ensemble. According to the EAC concept, each partition is viewed as an independent evidence of data organization, individual data partitions being combined, based on a voting mechanism, to generate a new n x n similarity matrix between the n patterns. The final data partition of the n patterns is obtained by applying a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on this matrix. We have developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of the proposed clustering combination strategy and its evaluation, based on the concept of mutual information between data partitions. Stability of the results is evaluated using bootstrapping techniques. A detailed discussion of an evidence accumulation-based clustering algorithm, using a split and merge strategy based on the K-means clustering algorithm, is presented. Experimental results of the proposed method on several synthetic and real data sets are compared with other combination strategies, and with individual clustering results produced by well-known clustering algorithms.

J	Sherali, HD; Desai, J				Sherali, HD; Desai, J			A global optimization RLT-based approach for solving the hard clustering problem	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						clustering problem; global optimization; hard clustering; k-means algorithm; Reformulation-Linearization Technique	ONE PROGRAMMING-PROBLEMS; CONVEX-HULL; OPTIMAL NUMBER; ALGORITHM; REPRESENTATIONS; RELAXATIONS; HIERARCHY	The field of cluster analysis is primarily concerned with the sorting of data points into different clusters so as to optimize a certain criterion. Rapid advances in technology have made it possible to address clustering problems via optimization theory. In this paper, we present a global optimization algorithm to solve the hard clustering problem, where each data point is to be assigned to exactly one cluster. The hard clustering problem is formulated as a nonlinear program, for which a tight linear programming relaxation is constructed via the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) in concert with additional valid inequalities that serve to defeat the inherent symmetry in the problem. This construct is embedded within a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem to global optimality. Pertinent implementation issues that can enhance the efficiency of the branch-and-bound algorithm are also discussed. Computational experience is reported using several standard data sets found in the literature as well as using synthetically generated larger problem instances. The results validate the robustness of the proposed algorithmic procedure and exhibit its dominance over the popular k-means clustering technique. Finally, a heuristic procedure to obtain a good quality solution at a relative ease of computational effort is also described.

The grouping of alleles into supertypes, on the basis of common structural and functional features, addresses this problem directly. In the present study we applied a combined bioinformatics approach, based on analysis of both protein sequence and structure, to identify similarities in the peptide binding sites of 2225 human class 11 MHC molecules, and thus define supertypes and supertype fingerprints. Two chemometric techniques were used: hierarchical clustering using three-dimensional Comparative Similarity Indices Analysis fields and nonhierarchical k-means clustering using sequence-based z-descriptors. An average consensus of 84% was achieved, i.e., 1872 of 2225 class II molecules were classified in the same supertype by both techniques. Twelve class II supertypes were defined: five DRs, three DQs, and four DPs. The HLA class II supertypes and their fingerprints given in parenthesis are DR1 (Trp(9 beta)), DR3 (Glu(9 beta), Gln(70 beta), and Gln/Arg(74 beta)), DR4 (Glu(9 beta), Gln/Arg(70 beta), and Glu/Ala(74 beta)), DR5 (Glu(9 beta), ASP(70 beta)), and DR9 (Lys/Gln(9 beta)); DQ1 (Ala/Gly(86 beta)), DQ2 (Glu(86 beta), Lys(71 beta)), and DQ3 (Glu(86 beta), Thr/ASP(71 beta)); DPw1 (Asp(84 beta) and Lys(69 beta)), DPw2 (Gly/Val(84 beta) and Glu(69 beta)), DPw4 (Gly/Val(84 beta) and Lys(69 beta)), and DPw6 (Asp(84 beta) and Glu(69 beta)). Apart from the good agreement between known binding motifs and our classification, several new supertypes, and corresponding thematic binding motifs, were also defined.

J	Scott, SL; James, GM; Sugar, CA				Scott, SL; James, GM; Sugar, CA			Hidden Markov models for longitudinal comparisons	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						health state model; hierarchical model; inhomogeneous hidden Markov model; k-means clustering; Markov chain Monte Carlo	MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD; MIXTURE-MODELS; HASTINGS; REGRESSION; OUTPUT	Medical researchers interested in temporal, multivariate measurements of complex diseases have recently begun developing health state models, which divide the space of patient characteristics into medically distinct clusters. The current state of the art in health services research uses k-means clustering to form the health states and a first-order Markov chain to describe transitions between the states. This fitting procedure ignores information from temporally adjacent observations and prevents uncertainty from parameter estimation and cluster assignments from being incorporated into the analysis. A natural way to address these issues is to combine clustering and longitudinal analyses using a hidden Markov model. We fit hidden Markov models to longitudinal data using Bayesian methods that account for all of the uncertainty in the parameters, conditional only on the underlying correctness of the model. Potential lack of time homogeneity in the Markov chain is accounted for by embedding transition probabilities into a hierarchical model that provides Bayesian shrinkage across time. We illustrate this approach by developing a hidden Markov health state model for comparing the effectiveness of clozapine and haloperidol, two antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. We find that clozapine outperforms haloperidol and identify the types of patients in whom clozapine's advantage is greatest and weakest. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hidden Markov models in comparison with the current methodology.

This study deals with the ability of a Kohonen's map to classify recorded AE signals collected during tensile tests on cross-ply glass/epoxy composites in order to monitor the chronology of the damaging process. An unsupervised clustering analysis shows that AE signals are distributed into three clusters. The proposed two-stage procedure is a combination of the Self-Organising Map (SOM) and the k-means methods. In the present work, Kohonen's map is applied as an unsupervised clustering method for the AE signals generated in cross-ply composite specimens during tensile tests. The input vectors of the signal descriptors used in the clustering procedure are calculated from the signal waveforms. The k-means method is then applied on the neurones of the map in order to delimit the clusters and to visualise the topology of the map. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhong, S				Zhong, S			Efficient streaming text clustering	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUL 31-AUG 04, 2005	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Networks Soc		text clustering; streaming clustering; spherical k-means; competitive learning	VECTOR QUANTIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Clustering data streams has been a new research topic, recently emerged from many real data mining applications, and has attracted a lot of research attention. However, there is little work on clustering high-dimensional streaming text data. This paper combines an efficient online spherical k-means (OSKM) algorithm with an existing scalable clustering strategy to achieve fast and adaptive clustering of text streams. The OSKM algorithm modifies the spherical k-means (SPKM) algorithm, using online update (for cluster centroids) based on the well-known Winner-Take-All competitive learning. It has been shown to be as efficient as SPKM, but much superior in clustering quality. The scalable clustering strategy was previously developed to deal with very large databases that cannot fit into a limited memory and that are too expensive to read/scan multiple times. Using the strategy, one keeps only sufficient statistics for history data to retain (part of) the contribution of history data and to accommodate the limited memory. To make the proposed clustering algorithm adaptive to data streams, we introduce a forgetting factor that applies exponential decay to the importance of history data. The older a set of text documents, the less weight they carry. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and reveal an intuitive and an interesting fact for clustering text streams-one needs to forget to be adaptive.

Method: The Empathic Tendency Scale and Attitudes Towards Communication in Medical Practice Questionnaire were used to collect data from 36 (55.3% of the total) students (65.7% female-, mean age: 18.3). Results: Students are clustered into two groups for both scales using K-means analysis, which was used to see whether the students were homogeneous regarding empathy and communication attitudes at the beginning of the teaching period. According to the Empathic Tendency Scale results 25% of students have a high empathic tendency (HET) and 75% have a low empathic tendency (LET) and the results of the Attitudes Towards Communication in Medical Practice Questionnaire indicated that 56% have positive and 44% have negative attitudes towards communication. However, the difference between the pre-and post-teaching results of either group seems to show a tendency towards change (p < 0.10). The change has a negative and a positive tendency in the HET and LET groups, respectively. Conclusion: Our results seem to verify the predicted differences among the students in their empathic tendencies and attitudes towards communication in medical practice. It seems that empathic tendency is more likely to be changed by an appropriate teaching technique when change within the groups is concerned.

In its simplest form, the data can be decomposed into two submatrices, each of which carries different aspects of pure component information. Typically, this means information about pure spectra and pure intensities are obtained from the solution. This is the well-known and well-characterized bilinear form that by itself cannot guarantee a unique solution due to the rotational ambiguity inherent in the mathematical solution. This problem has been addressed in a number of ways by different authors using novel constraints applied to the least-squares solution. This usually takes the form of natural constraints as suggested by Tauler as the standard methodology to improve the resolution of data during alternative least squares (ALS) iterative process. A second type of multivariate image analysis problem is proposed in this paper that is quite different from the tradition methods and in some ways potentially is more useful. This involves the solution as a class problem in which the relevant information is not necessarily contained in pure component information, but rather, in unique combinations of the pure components that are allowed to be spatially collocated. This discriminant image resolution (DIR) method theoretically can be treated as a more generalized solution to the problem because the distribution of components is allowed to freely mix in simplified combinations of solutions. The result is a constrained least-squares solution where the constraints are more limited and therefore less restrictive. The constraints in this case employ the results of probabilistic class partition information by applying Bayesian discriminant clustering to the intensity submatrix. This amounts to a spatial constraint because the probability of class association is used as a way of limiting the components that are allowed to appear in a given pixel. This is a unique modification of the original modified alternating least squares (MALS) concept and to the authors' knowledge, the first time this type of constraint has been combined with an ALS algorithm for analysis of multivariate or hyperspectral data. Modified alternating least squares (MALS) is used as the computational engine to drive good convergence while imposing the constraints in this modified ALS model. This kind of analysis produces single and simple multicomponent images and spectra based on classification from spectral information. The present constraint is most useful in resolving image data when the true images are not severely overlapped but it will also perform well under conditions of more severe collinearity.

J	Barakat, NAM; Jiang, JH; Yu, RQ				Barakat, NAM; Jiang, JH; Yu, RQ			Bubble agglomeration algorithm for unsupervised classification: a new clustering methodology without a priori information	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						bubble agglomeration; cluster analysis; unsupervised clustering; cluster core		The present paper introduces a new unsupervised clustering algorithm, named Bubble Agglomeration (BA). The algorithm deals with each data point as a centre of a bubble with a radius r. All the bubble have the same size, each set of contiguous bubbles forms a natural cluster or a core. The algorithm gradually increases the bubble radius and the number of adjacent bubbles. The number of cores of the expected clusters is consequently decreases. The sparse data points are distributed into the cores obtained according to their distances from different cores. The optimum bubble radius is determined via the reliability curve. Two simulated data sets and three real data sets are employed to validate the performance of the method. A comparison with the K-means cluster analysis shows satisfactory performance of the BA approach. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gordon, ND; Norris, JR; Weaver, CP; Klein, SA				Gordon, ND; Norris, JR; Weaver, CP; Klein, SA			Cluster analysis of cloud regimes and characteristic dynamics of midlatitude synoptic systems in observations and a model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							LARGE-SCALE MODELS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS; STRATIFORM CLOUDS; ATMOSPHERIC MODEL; FRONTAL CLOUDS; ECMWF MODEL; SCHEME; ISCCP	[1] Global climate models typically do not correctly simulate cloudiness associated with midlatitude synoptic systems because coarse grid spacing prevents them from resolving dynamics occurring at smaller scales and there exist no adequate parameterizations for the effects of these subgrid-scale dynamics. Comparison of modeled and observed cloud properties averaged over similar regimes ( e. g., compositing) aids the diagnosis of simulation errors and identification of meteorological forcing responsible for producing particular cloud conditions. This study uses a k-means clustering algorithm to objectively classify satellite cloud scenes into distinct regimes based on grid box mean cloud fraction, cloud reflectivity, and cloud top pressure. The spatial domain is the densely instrumented southern Great Plains site of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program, and the time period is the cool season months ( November - March) of 1999 - 2001. As a complement to the satellite retrievals of cloud properties, lidar and cloud radar data are analyzed to examine the vertical structure of the cloud layers. Meteorological data from the constraint variational analysis is averaged for each cluster to provide insight on the large-scale dynamics and advective tendencies coincident with specific cloud types. Meteorological conditions associated with high and low subgrid spatial variability are also investigated for each cluster. Cloud outputs from a single-column model version of the GFDL AM2 atmospheric model forced with meteorological boundary conditions derived from observations and a numerical weather prediction model were compared to observations for each cluster in order to determine the accuracy with which the model reproduces attributes of specific cloud regimes.

J	Tso, B; Olsen, RC				Tso, B; Olsen, RC			Combining spectral and spatial information into hidden Markov models for unsupervised image classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; RANDOM-FIELDS; CHAINS; ALGORITHM	Unsupervised classification methodology applied to remote sensing image processing can provide benefits in automatically converting the raw image data into useful information so long as higher classification accuracy is achieved. The traditional k-means clustering scheme using spectral data alone does not perform well in general as far as accuracy is concerned. This is partly due to the failure to take the spatial inter-pixels dependencies (i.e. the context) into account, resulting in a 'busy' visual appearance to the output imagery. To address this, the hidden Markov models (HMM) are introduced in this study as a fundamental framework to incorporate both the spectral and contextual information in analysis. This helps generate more patch-like output imagery and produces higher classification accuracy in an unsupervised scheme. The newly developed unsupervised classification approach is based on observation-sequence and observation-density adjustments, which have been proposed for incorporating 2D spatial information into the linear HMM. For the observation-sequence adjustment methods, there are a total of five neighbourhood systems being proposed. Two neighbourhood systems were incorporated into the observation-density methods for study. The classification accuracy is then evaluated by means of confusion matrices made by randomly chosen test samples. The classification obtained by k-means clustering and the HMM with commonly seen strip-like and Hilbert-Peano sequence fitting methods were also measured. Experimental results showed that the proposed approaches for combining both the spectral and spatial information into HMM unsupervised classification mechanism present improvements in both classification accuracy and visual qualities.

J	Moller-Levet, CS; Klawonn, F; Cho, KH; Yin, H; Wolkenhauer, O				Moller-Levet, CS; Klawonn, F; Cho, KH; Yin, H; Wolkenhauer, O			Clustering of unevenly sampled gene expression time-series data	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy clustering; unevenly sampled; short time series; gene expression	MICROARRAY EXPERIMENTS; SPLINES	Time course measurements are becoming a common type of experiment in the use of microarrays. The temporal order of the data and the varying length of sampling intervals are important and should be considered in clustering time-series. However, the shortness of gene expression time-series data limits the use of conventional statistical models and techniques for time-series analysis. To address this problem, this paper proposes the fuzzy short time-series (FSTS) clustering algorithm, which clusters profiles based on the similarity of their relative change of expression level and the corresponding temporal information. One of the major advantages of fuzzy clustering is that genes can belong to more than one group, revealing distinctive features of each gene's function and regulation. Several examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we present the validation of the algorithm by clustering the genes which define the model profiles in Chu et al. (Science, 282 (1998) 699). The fuzzy c-means, k-means, average linkage hierarchical algorithm and random clustering are compared to the proposed FSTS algorithm. The performance is evaluated with a well-established cluster validity measure proving that the FSTS algorithm has a better performance than the compared algorithms in clustering similar rates of change of expression in successive unevenly distributed time points. Moreover, the FSTS algorithm was able to cluster in a biologically meaningful way the genes defining the model profiles. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Proteomics studies can provide a wealth of information and rapidly generate large quantities of data from the analysis of biological specimens. The high dimensionality of data generated from these studies requires the development of improved bioinformatics tools for efficient and accurate data analyses. For proteome profiling of a particular system or organism, a number of specialized software tools are needed. Indeed, significant advances in the informatics and software tools necessary to support the analysis and management of these massive amounts of data are needed. Clustering algorithms based on probabilistic and Bayesian models provide an alternative to heuristic algorithms. The number of clusters (diseased and non-diseased groups) is reduced to the choice of the number of components of a mixture of underlying probability. The Bayesian approach is a tool for including information from the data to the analysis. It offers an estimation of the uncertainties of the data and the parameters involved. Results: We present novel algorithms that can organize, cluster and derive meaningful patterns of expression from large-scaled proteomics experiments. We processed raw data using a graphical-based algorithm by transforming it from a real space data-expression to a complex space data-expression using discrete Fourier transformation; then we used a thresholding approach to denoise and reduce the length of each spectrum. Bayesian clustering was applied to the reconstructed data. In comparison with several other algorithms used in this study including K-means, (Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), and linear discriminant analysis, the Bayesian-Fourier model-based approach displayed superior performances consistently, in selecting the correct model and the number of clusters, thus providing a novel approach for accurate diagnosis of the disease. Using this approach, we were able to successfully denoise proteomic spectra and reach up to a 99% total reduction of the number of peaks compared to the original data. In addition, the Bayesian-based approach generated a better classification rate in comparison with other classification algorithms. This new finding will allow us to apply the Fourier transformation for the selection of the protein profile for each sample, and to develop a novel bioinformatic strategy based on Bayesian clustering for biomarker discovery and optimal diagnosis.

Within the framework of the French project of farm animal genomics (AGENAE) we produced an original normalised trout testis cDNA library and obtained 1152 trout ESTs corresponding to 967 potential genes. To study the expression of those genes throughout first stages of spermatogenesis, we used nylon macroarray. Gonads in stage of immaturity (stage I), or at initiation of spermatogonial proliferation (stage II), meiosis (stage III) or spermiogenesis were selected by histological analysis. Total RNA was extracted and then used to produce complex targets labelled with II [P-33]dCTP and hybridised with cDNA arrays. After filtering and normalisation of hybridisation signals, genes presenting differential expression as revealed by ANOVA analysis were submitted to k-means clustering and hierarchical classification. Genes were separated into five Clusters which presented distinct profiles. One cluster overexpressed in stage I could be involved in the initial events of spermatogenesis as seminiferous tubule Organisation. The second Cluster displays a transient increase at the beginning of testicular recrudescence (stage II). Three other clusters group several genes involved in cell proliferation and protein synthesis and modification. One is particularly down-expressed during stage I, the two others show increased expression during stages III and IV and appear to be involved in spermatogonial and meiotic proliferation and in protein metabolism linked to cellular growth. This allows us to plan further experiments to better understand the functional implication of some of the genes that are found to be significantly regulated like CDC2, hematological and neurological expressed gene 1-like protein, HCDI protein, Mago Nashi, a BMP-like, and a steroid receptor binding protein. These data demonstrate the applicability of the array based technology using our trout cDNA arrays and highlight genes that are potential targets for the control of puberty and fertility in farmed fish. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Established techniques include k-means and k-median cluster analysis. However, these methods require the user to provide a priori estimations of the number of clusters and their approximate location in the parameter space. Often these estimations can be made based on some prior understanding about the nature of the data. Alternatively, the user makes these estimations based on visualization of the data. However, the latter is problematic in data sets with large numbers of dimensions. Presented here is an algorithm that can automatically provide these estimates without human intervention based on the inherent structure of the data set. The number of dimensions does not limit it. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A tele-immersion system acquires the 3D representation of a collaborator's environment remotely and sends it over the network where it is rendered in the user's environment. Acquisition, reconstruction, transmission, and rendering all have to be done in real-time to create a sense of presence. With added commodity hardware resources, parallelism can increase the acquisition volume and reconstruction data quality while maintaining real-time performance. However, this is not as easy for rendering since all of the data need to be combined into a single display. In this article, we present an algorithm to compress data from such 3D environments in real-time to solve this imbalance. We present a compression algorithm which scales comparably to the acquisition and reconstruction, reduces network transmission bandwidth, and reduces the rendering requirement for real-time performance. This is achieved by exploiting the coherence in the 3D environment data and removing them in real-time. We have tested the algorithm using a static office data set as well as a dynamic scene, the results of which are presented in the article.

J	Zarco-Tejada, PJ; Ustin, SL; Whiting, ML				Zarco-Tejada, PJ; Ustin, SL; Whiting, ML			Temporal and spatial relationships between within-field yield variability in cotton and high-spatial hyperspectral remote sensing imagery	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							AIRBORNE MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY; LEAF CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION; ADJUSTED VEGETATION INDEX; MODEL INVERSION METHODS; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; WATER-CONTENT; PRECISION AGRICULTURE; ABSORPTION FEATURES; LIGHT REFLECTANCE; IRON-DEFICIENCY	Traditional remote sensing methods for yield estimation rely on broadband vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI. Despite demonstrated relationships between such traditional indices and yield, NDVI saturates at larger leaf area index (LAI) values, and it is affected by soil background. We present results obtained with several new narrow-band hyperspectral indices calculated from the Airborne Visible and Near Infrared (AVNIR) hyperspectral sensor flown over a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field in California (USA) collected over an entire growing season at I-m spatial resolution. Within-field variability of yield monitor spatial data collected during harvest was correlated with hyperspectral indices related to crop growth and canopy structure, chlorophyll concentration, and water content. The time-series of indices calculated from the imagery were assessed to understand within-field yield variability in cotton at different growth stages. A K means clustering method was used to perform field segmentation on hyperspectral indices in classes of low, medium, and high yield, and confusion matrices were used to calculate the kappa (K) coefficient and overall accuracy. Structural indices related to LAI [Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Modified Triangular Vegetation Index (MTVI), and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI)] obtained the best relationships with yield and field segmentation at early growth stages. Hyperspectral indices related to crop physiological status [Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Index (MCARI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption Index (TCARI)] were superior at later growth stages, close to harvest. From confusion matrices and class analyses, the overall accuracy (and kappa) of RDVI at early stages was 61% (kappa = 0.39), dropping to 39% (kappa = 0.08) before harvest. The MCARI chlorophyll index remained sensitive to within-field yield variability at late preharvest stage, obtaining overall accuracy of 51% (kappa = 0.22).

The molecular pathways responsible for the variations in clinical severity of pHPT are unknown. We studied gene expression profiles in patients with SPAs and pHPT to determine associations between these changes and clinical parameters. Methods: We selected 10 patients with solitary SPAs and nonfamilial, non-MEN1 pHPT treated with surgery from 2001 to 2003. Pathologic and clinical data were reviewed. At operation, tissues from SPAs were frozen in liquid nitrogen; total RNA was obtained from sections, and the diagnosis was confirmed with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Control normal parathyroid RNA was age- and sex-matched. RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to a microarray of 22,272 human oligonucleotides. Cluster analysis of gene expression, analysis of expression ratios, and comparison of clinical parameters were performed. Results: All patients were cured; all specimens were consistent with SPAs. K means clustering divided the 10 patients into 2 distinct 5-patient gene expression groups by using uncentered correlation based on gene subgrouping. Of the clinical parameters, only the mean gland volume was significantly different between group 1 (390 &PLUSMN; 160 mm(3)) and group 2 (1080 &PLUSMN; 615 mm(3); P = .032 by Mann-Whitney test). Seventy-five genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated (with a ratio of <.33 or >3) compared with controls. These genes included the v-fos viral oncogene homolog and six calcium ion-binding signaling proteins. Conclusions: Differential expression of a few critical genes may contribute to differences in galnd volume in SPAs. A better understanding gland volume in SPAs. A better understanding of these pathways may help to define the pathophysiology of pHPT.

J	Lingras, PR; Huang, XD				Lingras, PR; Huang, XD			Statistical, evolutionary, and neurocomputing clustering techniques: Cluster-based vs object-based approaches	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						clustering; genetic algorithms; hierarchical grouping; highway sections; K-means; Kohonen neural networks; statistical techniques; supermarket customers		Modern day computers cannot provide optimal solution to the clustering problem. There are many clustering algorithms that attempt to provide an approximation of the optimal solution. These clustering techniques can be broadly classified into two categories. The techniques from first category directly assign objects to clusters and then analyze the resulting clusters. The methods from second category adjust representations of clusters and then determine the object assignments. In terms of disciplines, these techniques can be classified as statistical, genetic algorithms based, and neural network based. This paper reports the results of experiments comparing five different approaches: hierarchical grouping, object-based genetic algorithms, cluster-based genetic algorithms, Kohonen neural networks, and K-means method. The comparisons consist of the time requirements and within-group errors. The theoretical analyses were tested for clustering of highway sections and supermarket customers. All the techniques were applied to clustering of highway sections. The hierarchical grouping and genetic algorithms approaches were computationally infeasible for clustering a larger set of supermarket customers. Hence only Kohonen neural networks and K-means techniques were applied to the second set to confirm some of the results from previous experiments.

Many clustering methods have been proposed for clustering gene-expression data, including the hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering and self-organizing map (SOM). However, the conventional methods are limited to identify different shapes of clusters because they use a fixed distance norm when calculating the distance between genes. The fixed distance norm imposes a fixed geometrical shape on the clusters regardless of the actual data distribution. Thus, different distance norms are required for handling the different shapes of clusters. Results: We present the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering method for microarray gene-expression data. To detect clusters of different shapes in a dataset, we use an adaptive distance norm that is calculated by a fuzzy covariance matrix (F) of each cluster in which the eigenstructure of F is used as an indicator of the shape of the cluster. Moreover, the GK method is less prone to falling into local minima than the k-means and SOM because it makes decisions through the use of membership degrees of a gene to clusters. The algorithmic procedure is accomplished by the alternating optimization technique, which iteratively improves a sequence of sets of clusters until no further improvement is possible. To test the performance of the GK method, we applied the GK method and well-known conventional methods to three recently published yeast datasets, and compared the performance of each method using the Saccharomyces Genome Database annotations. The clustering results of the GK method are more significantly relevant to the biological annotations than those of the other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for clustering gene-expression data.

The clinical significance of coexpression of type 1 growth factor receptor (T1GFR) family members remains largely unknown. The objective of the current study was to determine the frequency and the possible prognostic effect of coexpression of HER-1, HER-2, HER-3, and HER-4 by breast carcinoma. METHODS. Tissue microarrays were constructed using clinically annotated formalin-fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor samples from 242 patients with invasive breast carcinomas with a median 15-year follow-up. The levels of T1GFR family members (HER-1-HER-4) were measured by immunohistochemistry. K-means clustering algorithm, as well as univariate (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox regression) survival analyses were applied to the data set. RESULTS. Using univariate analysis, expression of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-3, but not HER-4, was significantly associated with decreased patient disease-specific survival (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that coexpression of >= 2 of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-3 in any combination was associated with reduced patient disease-specific survival compared with single marker expression or no expression (35% vs. 65% vs. 78% 10-year survival rates, P = 0.001). Using multivariate analysis, expression of >= 2 of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-3 was independent of lymph node status and turner size. CONCLUSIONS. In a cohort of patients with breast carcinoma, the authors observed T1GFR family member coexpression (HER-1, HER-2, and HER-3) to have a negative synergistic effect on patient outcome, independent of tumor size or lymph node status. Thus, coexpression of T1GFR family members identified a subset of patients with a poor disease prognosis who may potentially benefit from therapy simultaneously targeting several T1GFR family members.

This study presents a hybrid mining approach in the design of an effective credit scoring model, based on clustering and neural network techniques. We used clustering techniques to preprocess the input samples with the objective of indicating unrepresentative samples into isolated and inconsistent clusters, and used neural networks to construct the credit scoring model. The clustering stage involved a class-wise classification process. A self-organizing map clustering algorithm was used to automatically determine the number of clusters and the starting points of each cluster. Then, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to generate clusters of samples belonging to new classes and eliminate the unrepresentative samples from each class. In the neural network stage, samples with new class labels were used in the design of the credit scoring model. The proposed method demonstrates by two real world credit data sets that the hybrid mining approach can be used to build effective credit scoring models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cluster analysis, primitive exploration with little or no prior knowledge, consists of research developed across a wide variety of communities. The diversity, on one hand, equips us with many tools. On the other hand, the profusion of options causes confusion. We survey clustering algorithms for data sets appearing in statistics, computer science, and machine learning, and illustrate their applications in some benchmark data sets, the traveling salesman problem, and bioinformatics, a new field attracting intensive efforts. Several tightly related topics, proximity measure, and cluster validation, are also discussed.

J	Huang, JZX; Ng, MK; Rong, HQ; Li, ZC				Huang, JZX; Ng, MK; Rong, HQ; Li, ZC			Automated variable weighting in k-means type clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; data mining; mining methods and algorithms; feature evaluation and selection	ALGORITHM; VALIDATION; SELECTION	This paper proposes a k-means type clustering algorithm that can automatically calculate variable weights. A new step is introduced to the k-means clustering process to iteratively update variable weights based on the current partition of data and a formula for weight calculation is proposed. The convergency theorem of the new clustering process is given. The variable weights produced by the algorithm measure the importance of variables in clustering and can be used in variable selection in data mining applications where large and complex real data are often involved. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data have shown that the new algorithm outperformed the standard k-means type algorithms in recovering clusters in data.

In this paper, we present a kernel method for clustering inspired by the classical K-Means algorithm in which each cluster is iteratively refined using a one-class Support Vector Machine.

These networks will be strongly service driven, and this approach differs significantly from the traditional speech dominated in the second generation (2G) approach. Compared to 2G, in 3G, the mobile cells interact and interfere with each other more, they have hundreds of adjustable parameters, and they monitor and record data related to several hundreds of different variables in each cell. This paper shows that a neural network algorithm called the self-organizing map, together with a conventional clustering method like the k-means, can effectively be used to simplify and focus network analysis. It is shown that these algorithms help in visualizing and grouping similarly behaving cells. Thus, it is easier for a human expert to discern different states of the network. This makes it possible to perform faster and more efficient troubleshooting and optimization of the parameters of the cells. The presented methods are applicable for different radio access network technologies.

J	Hember, RA; Lafleur, PM; Cogley, JG				Hember, RA; Lafleur, PM; Cogley, JG			Synoptic controls on summer evapotranspiration from a bog peatland in southern Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						downscaling; evapotranspiration; potential evapotranspiration; peatlands; Mer Bleue	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS; GREAT-LAKES BASIN; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BOREAL FOREST; UNITED-STATES; SURFACE; CLIMATOLOGY; ENERGY; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY	The relationship between surface hydrometeorological variables and mid-tropospheric circulation was used to describe and model the synoptic controls on daily and monthly evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) measured above a peat bog near Ottawa, Ontario. The four most dominant modes of variability in daily 500 hPa geopotential height over eastern North America were defined by S-mode principal component analysis and subjected to K-means clustering in order to produce discrete patterns of 500 hPa height. A total of 10 clusters were retained, based on a compromise between the number of legitimate patterns defined in a separate manual classification scheme and the proportion of variance grouped between clusters (61%) by the K-means algorithm. Height patterns defined by the 10-cluster scheme exhibited differences in their control over bog ET. Pre-high anticyclonic conditions were most efficient at drying the bog, whereas conditions prior to and during the passage of cyclonic systems were the least efficient at drying the bog. The remaining seven clusters exhibited insignificant control over ET on a seasonal basis. Variability in heights directly over the study site, associated with the second principal component, exhibited the closest relationship with hydrometeorological fluxes at the bog surface. However, attempts to model daily ET based, first, on multiple linear regression using principal components and, second, on cluster analogues of ET produced unsatisfactory skill. The inability to forecast daily ET was attributed to the influence of non-linear variation in the rate at which mid-tropospheric circulation controls propagated down to the surface and also to unresolved hydrological controls at the bog surface. Days following rainfall frequently resulted in amplified ET, regardless of cluster type, indicating that the control of ET by antecedent moisture conditions was a limiting factor in downscaling ET from large-scale atmospheric predictors. On a monthly time scale, however, the circulation indices explained 64% and 45% of the variation in monthly ET and PET respectively. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.

The algorithm finds the centroids of a user specified number of clusters, where each cluster groups together with similar image primitives. To illustrate its wide applicability, the proposed image classifier has been applied to synthetic, MRI and satellite images. Experimental results show that the PSO image classifier performs better than state-of-the-art image classifiers (namely, K-means, Fuzzy C-means, K-Harmonic means and Genetic Algorithms) in all measured criteria. The influence of different values of PSO control parameters on performance is also illustrated.

J	Bashar, MK; Ohnishi, N				Bashar, MK; Ohnishi, N			Wavelet-based salient energy points for unsupervised texture segmentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						intermittency index; texture segmentation; salient point density; salient point distribution nonuniformity; unsupervised learning	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; GABOR FILTERS; IMAGE; TRANSFORM; RETRIEVAL; FEATURES	Despite extensive research on image texture analysis, it is still problematic to characterize and segment texture images especially in the presence of complex patterns. Upon tremendous advancement of the internet and the digital technology, there is also a need for the development of simple but efficient algorithms, which can be adaptable to real-time systems. In this study, we propose such an approach based on multiresolution discrete wavelet transform (DWT). After the transform, we compute salient energy points from each directional sub-band (LH, HL, and HH) in the form of binary image by thresholding intermittency indices of wavelet coefficients. We then propose and extract two new texture features namely Salient Point Density (SPD) and Salient Point Distribution Nonuniformity (SPDN) based on the number and the distribution of salient pixels in the local neighborhood of every pixel of the multiscale binary images. We thus obtain a set of feature images, which are subsequently applied to the popular K-means algorithm for the unsupervised segmentation of texture images. Though the above representation appear simple and infrequent in the literature, it proves useful in the context of texture segmentation. Experimental results with the standard texture (Brodatz) and natural images demonstrate the robustness and potentiality of the proposed approach.

The NMR data were acquired using microtiter plate NMR (VAST) in protonated solvents. A sample data set which contained several clusters was used to optimize the protocol. The evaluation of the robustness was performed using three different clustering methods: tree clustering analysis, K-means clustering and multidimensional scaling. These methods were compared for consistency using the sample data set and the optimized methodology was applied to clustering of a set of spectra from partially purified biota extracts.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a framework of procedures for delineating potential management zones with data collected from 1-ha grids on an irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field in Texas from 1998 through 2000. Selected measurements included lint yield, soil pH, exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+, K saturation, sand and clay content, depth to free carbonate layer, depth to caliche, NO3--N, available P, elevation, and slope. Data were processed with k-means cluster analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and discriminant analysis. Cluster analysis allowed grouping lint yield and soil properties into high and low yielding classes by their data structure. Using the most significant linear combination in terms of distinguishing two yield classes from MANOVA, soil PH, extractable Ca2+ and Mg2+, K content, and saturation, clay content, and soil N to P ratio were identified as variables that were most related to cotton yield classification and resulted in two potential management zones. The lowest misclassification rate (27%) appeared in the two classes developed from the six influential variables and misclassification mostly located near the pivot boundary and. near high to low or low to high yield transition areas, possibly due to changes in soil properties coupled with differences in weather-year patterns in the 3 years. Combined with other information, the delineated high and low yield classes can serve as potential, management zones for making detailed management prescriptions for irrigated cotton on these soils.

METHODS: Biopsy samples at the gastric antrum were obtained from 62 patients with chronic gastritis. CD4 and CD8 cell infiltration was evaluated by immunohistochemical assays on frozen sections of the biopsy samples. Fifteen symptoms referring to digestion-related activity and non-digestion related activity were observed. The correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and each symptom or symptom assemblage was analyzed by logistic regression and K-mean cluster methods. RESULTS: CD4 cell infiltrations in gastric mucosa were much more in patients with H pylori infection, while CD8 cell infiltrations were similar in patients with or without H pylori infection. Logistic regression analysis showed that the symptoms including heavy feeling in head or body (t = 2.563), and thirst (t = 2.478) were significantly related with CD4 cell infiltration in gastric mucosa (P<0.05), and cool limbs with aversion to cold were related with CD8 cell infiltration (t = 2.872, P<0.05). Further analysis showed that non-digestive related symptom assemblage could increase the predicted percentage of CD4 and CD8 cell infiltration in gastric mucosa, including lower CD4 infiltration by 12.5%, higher CD8 infiltration by 33.3%, and also non-H pylori infection by 23.6%. K-means cluster analysis of all symptoms and CD4 and CD8 cell infiltration in gastric mucosa showed a similar tendency to increase the predicted percentage of CD4, CD8 cell infiltration and H pylori infection. CONCLUSION: Based on correlation between the gastric mucosa lymphocyte infiltration, H pylori infection and clinical symptoms, symptoms or symptomatic assemblages play an important role in making further classification of chronic gastritis, which might help find a more specific therapy for chronic gastritis.

However, in general, these methods do not take advantage of the fact that time is a continuous variable, and existing clustering methods often group biologically unrelated genes together. Results: We propose a quadratic regression method for identification of differentially expressed genes and classification of genes based on their temporal expression profiles for non-cyclic short time-course microarray data. This method treats time as a continuous variable, therefore preserves actual time information. We applied this method to a microarray time-course study of gene expression at short time intervals following deafferentation of olfactory receptor neurons. Nine regression patterns have been identified and shown to fit gene expression profiles better than k-means clusters. EASE analysis identified over-represented functional groups in each regression pattern and each k-means cluster, which further demonstrated that the regression method provided more biologically meaningful classifications of gene expression profiles than the k-means clustering method. Comparison with Peddada et al.' s order-restricted inference method showed that our method provides a different perspective on the temporal gene profiles. Reliability study indicates that regression patterns have the highest reliabilities. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the proposed quadratic regression method improves gene discovery and pattern recognition for non-cyclic short time-course microarray data. With a freely accessible Excel macro, investigators can readily apply this method to their microarray data.

J	Chen, ZM; Liu, L				Chen, ZM; Liu, L			RealSpot: software validating results from DNA microarray data analysis with spot images	PHYSIOLOGICAL GENOMICS			English	Article						spot quality; data normalization; data filtering	NORMALIZATION; INFORMATION; MIAME	The spot images from DNA microarray highly affect the discovery of biological knowledge from gene expression data. However, results from quality analysis, normalization, differential expression, and cluster analysis are rarely validated with spot images in current data analysis methods or software packages. We designed RealSpot, a software package, to validate the results by directly associating spot quality and data with spot images in a spreadsheet table. RealSpot splits hybridization images into individual spots stored in a spreadsheet table. It subsequently associates microarray data with spot images and performs data validation through the standard table operation such as sorting, searching, and editing. RealSpot has several built-in functions to facilitate data validation, including spot quality analysis, data organization, one-way ANOVA, gene ontology association, verification, import, and export. We used RealSpot to evaluate 77 slides ( 30,000 features each) from real hybridization experiments and to validate results from each step of data analysis. It took similar to 10 min to validate results of spot quality after initial evaluation and correct similar to 0.3% of falsely assigned qualities of 10,000 spots. We validated 1,641 of 2,110 differentially expressed genes identified by SAM analysis in similar to 1/2 h by comparing each gene with its respective spot image. Furthermore, we found that 6 of 48 genes in one cluster from k-mean clustering method showed inconsistent trends of spot images. RealSpot is efficient for validating microarray results and thus helpful for improving the reliability of the whole microarray experiment for experimentalists.

Trin. ex Steudel and Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb. were studied in semi steady-state hydroponic cultures. At a steady-state nitrogen availability of 34 mu M the growth rate of Phragmites was not affected by the N form (mean RGR = 35.4 mg g(-1) d(-1)), whereas the growth rate of Glyceria was 16% higher in NH4+-N cultures than in NO3--N cultures (mean= 66.7 and 57.4 mg g-1 d(-1) of NH4+ and NO3- treated plants, respectively). Phragmites and Glyceria had higher S/R ratio in NH4- cultures than in NO3- cultures, 123.5 and 129.7%, respectively. Species differed in the nitrogen utilisation. In Glyceria, the relative tissue N content was higher than in Phragmites and was increased in NH4+ treated plants by 16%. The tissue NH4+ concentration (mean = 1.6 mu mol g fresh wt(-1)) was not affected by N treatment, whereas NO3- contents were higher in NO3- (mean = 1.5 mu mol g fresh wt(-1)) than in NH4+ (mean = 0.4 mu mol g fresh wt(-1)) treated plants. In Phragmites, NH4+ (mean = 1.6 mu mol g fresh wt(-1)) and NO3- (mean = 0.2 mu mol g fresh wt(-1)) contents were not affected by the N regime. Species did not differ in NH4+ (mean = 56.5 mu mol g(-1) root dry wt h(-1)) and NO3- (mean = 34.5 mu mol g(-1) root dry wt h(-1)) maximum uptake rates (V-max), and V for NH4+ uptake was not affected by N treatment. The uptake rate of NO3- was low in NH4+ treated plants, and an induction phase for NO3- was observed in NH4+ treated Phragmites but not in Glyceria. Phragmites had low K (mean = 4.5 mu M) and high affinity (10.31 g(-1) root dry wt h(-1)) for both ions compared to Glyceria (K-m = 6.3 mu M, affinity = 8.01 g(-1)root dry wt h(-1)). The results showed different plasticity of Phragmites and Glyceria toward N source. The positive response to NH4+-N source may participates in the observed success of Glyceria at NH4+ rich sites, although other factors have to be considered. Higher plasticity of Phragmites toward low nutrient availability may favour this species at oligotrophic sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The problem can't be solved by traditional clustering algorithm, such as k-means or its variations. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic clustering algorithm based on the artificial immune network and tabu search (DCBIT). It optimizes the number and the location of the clusters at the same time. The algorithm includes two phases, it begins by running immune network algorithm to find a Clustering feasible solution (CFS), then it employs tabu search to get the optimum cluster number and cluster centers on the CFS. Also, the probabilities acquiring the CFS through immune network algorithm have been discussed in this paper. Some experimental results show that new algorithm has satisfied convergent probability and convergent speed.

Immunoreactivity of brain sections can be measured from digitized immunohistology slides so that quantitative assessment can be carried out by computer-assisted analysis. Conventional methods of analyzing immunohistology are based on image classification techniques applied to a specific anatomic location at high magnification. Such micro-scale localized image analysis limits one for further correlative studies with other imaging modalities on whole brain sections, which are of particular interest in experimental stroke research. This report presents a semi-automated image analysis method that performs convolution-based image classification on micro-scale images, extracts numerical data representing positive immunoreactivity from the processed micro-scale images and creates a corresponding quantitative macro-scale image. The present method utilizes several image-processing techniques to cope with variances in intensity distribution, as well as artifacts caused by tight scattering or heterogeneity of antigen expression, which are commonly encountered in immunohistotogy. Micro-scale images are composed by a tiling function in a mosaic manner. Image classification is accomplished by the K-means clustering method at the relatively low-magnification micro-scale level in order to increase computation efficiency. The quantitative macro-scale image is suitable for correlative analysis with other imaging modalities. This method was applied to different immunostaining antibodies, such as endothelial barrier antigen (EBA), lectin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), on histology slides from animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion by the intraluminal. suture method. Reliability tests show that the results obtained from immunostained images at high magnification and relatively low magnification are virtually the same. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We propose a new speech-enhancement approach based on optimizing regression of the log-spectra, which is used to estimate the log-spectra of speech at a close-talking microphone by using multiple spatially distributed microphones. The regression weights can be adapted automatically for different noise environments. Compared to the nearest distant microphone and adaptive beamformer generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC), the proposed approach shows an advantage in the average relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 58.5 and 10.3%, respectively, for isolated word recognition under 15 real-car environments.

The method uses three main components: adaptive/predefined image splitting, subimage level classification and class merging based on homogeneity checking conditions. In the first step, a preclassification in road and nonroad pixels is carried out, on the resized input image, using the decision tree method. As a result of this first step we obtain the road reference feature value, and the lane-markings positions in case of highways. For the rural ways image splitting we use a predefined division method, and for the highways we use an adaptive division method based on the detected lane-markings. The proposed classification is carried out on the subimages using the K-mean classifier on a composed gray and texture based feature vector. The gray feature vector is fixed in the preclassification phase, and the texture feature vector is only updated during the classification is performed. This way the convergence is much faster and the classification accuracy is better. The resulting road and nonroad classes of subimages are merged into a road and a nonroad class using a homogeneity criterion based on the road reference feature value. Next, a forward and backward method is used to detect borders of the road region. Finally, we use the Kalman filter and the Bresenhem line. drawing to connect the border pixels.

From the sequence of cloud images, different features such as mean, standard deviation, busyness, and entropy are extracted. Based on these features, clouds are segmented using the k-means clustering algorithm and considering the coldest cloud segment, potential regions for tracer clouds are identified. These regions are represented by a set of features. All such steps are repeated for images taken at three consecutive time instants. Then, simulated annealing is used to establish an association between cloud segments of successive image frames. In this way, several chains of associated cloud regions are found and are ranked using fuzzy reasoning. The method has been tested in several image sequences, and its results are validated by determining cloud motion vector from the associated chains of tracers.

J	Turnbull, D; Elkan, C				Turnbull, D; Elkan, C			Fast recognition of musical genres using RBF networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						radial basis function network; musical genre; initialization method; feature subset selection	CLASSIFICATION	This paper explores the automatic classification of audio tracks into musical genres. Our goal is to achieve human-level accuracy with fast training and classification. This goal is achieved with radial basis function (RBF) networks by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised initialization methods. These initialization methods yield classifiers that are as accurate as RBF networks trained with gradient descent ( which is hundreds of times slower). In addition, feature subset selection further reduces training and classification time while preserving classification accuracy. Combined, our methods succeed in creating an RBF network that matches the musical classification accuracy of humans. The general algorithmic contribution of this paper is to show experimentally that RBF networks initialized with a combination of methods can yield good classification performance without relying on gradient descent. The simplicity and computational efficiency of our initialization methods produce classifiers that are fast to train as well as fast to apply to novel data. We also present an improved method for initializing the k-means clustering algorithm which is useful for both unsupervised and supervised initialization methods.

Each level of the hierarchical map is modeled as a simple winner-take-all K-Map. One significant advantage of this multilevel hierarchical K-Map is its computational efficiency. Unlike other statistical anomaly detection methods such as nearest neighbor approach, K-means clustering or probabilistic analysis that employ distance computation in the feature space to identify the outliers, our approach does not involve costly point-to-point computation in organizing the data into clusters. Another advantage is the reduced network size. We use the classification capability of the K-Map on selected dimensions of data set in detecting anomalies. Randomly selected subsets. that contain both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1990 benchmark data are used to train the hierarchical net. We use a confidence measure to label the clusters. Then we use the test set from the same KDD Cup 1999 benchmark to test the hierarchical net. We show that a hierarchical K-Map in which each layer operates on a small subset of the feature space is superior to a single-layer K-Map operating on the whole feature space in detecting a variety of attacks in terms of detection rate as well as false positive rate.

The batch k-means and the incremental k-means are two well known versions of the classical k-means clustering algorithm (Duda et al. 2000). To benefit from the speed of the batch version and the accuracy of the incremental version we combine the two in a "ping-pong" fashion. We use a distance-like function that combines the squared Euclidean distance with relative entropy. In the extreme cases our algorithm recovers the classical k-means clustering algorithm and generalizes the Divisive Information Theoretic clustering algorithm recently reported independently by Berkhin and Becher (2002) and Dhillon1 et al. (2002). Results of numerical experiments that demonstrate the viability of our approach are reported.

J	Zhu, SC; Guo, CE; Wang, YZ; Xu, ZJ				Zhu, SC; Guo, CE; Wang, YZ; Xu, ZJ			What are textons?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION			English	Article						textons; motons; lightons; transformed component analysis; textures	CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; VISUAL-PATTERNS; INCOMPLETE DATA; ALGORITHM; CORTEX	Textons refer to fundamental micro-structures in natural images (and videos) and are considered as the atoms of pre-attentive human visual perception (Julesz, 1981). Unfortunately, the word "texton" remains a vague concept in the literature for lack of a good mathematical model. In this article, we first present a three-level generative image model for learning textons from texture images. In this model, an image is a superposition of a number of image bases selected from an over-complete dictionary including various Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian functions at various locations, scales, and orientations. These image bases are, in turn, generated by a smaller number of texton elements, selected from a dictionary of textons. By analogy to the waveform-phoneme-word hierarchy in speech, the pixel-base-texton hierarchy presents an increasingly abstract visual description and leads to dimension reduction and variable decoupling. By fitting the generative model to observed images, we can learn the texton dictionary as parameters of the generative model. Then the paper proceeds to study the geometric, dynamic, and photometric structures of the texton representation by further extending the generative model to account for motion and illumination variations. (1) For the geometric structures, a texton consists of a number of image bases with deformable spatial configurations. The geometric structures are learned from static texture images. (2) For the dynamic structures, the motion of a texton is characterized by a Markov chain model in time which sometimes can switch geometric configurations during the movement. We call the moving textons as "motons". The dynamic models are learned using the trajectories of the textons inferred from video sequence. (3) For photometric structures. a texton represents the set of images of a 3D surface element under varying illuminations and is called a 'lighton" in this paper. We adopt an illumination-cone representation where a lighton is a texton triplet. For a Given light source, a lighton image is generated as a linear sum of the three texton bases. We present a sequence of experiments for learning the geometric, dynamic, and photometric structures from images and videos, and we also present some comparison studies with K-mean clustering, sparse coding, independent component analysis, and transformed component analysis. We shall discuss how general textons can be learned from generic natural images.

J	Brusco, MJ; Cradit, JD				Brusco, MJ; Cradit, JD			ConPar: a method for identifying groups of concordant subject proximity matrices for subsequent multidimensional scaling analyses	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						concordance; multidimensional scaling; cluster analysis; pooling across subjects	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; BOUND ALGORITHM; VIEW ANALYSIS; MODEL; SIMILARITY; PARTITIONS; GOODNESS; DANGERS; POINTS	A common representation of data within the context of multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a collection of symmetric proximity (similarity or dissimilarity) matrices for each of M subjects. There are a number of possible alternatives for analyzing these data, which include: (a) conducting an MDS analysis on a single matrix obtained by pooling (averaging) the M subject matrices, (b) fitting a separate MDS structure for each of the M matrices, or (c) employing an individual differences MDS model. We discuss each of these approaches, and subsequently propose a straightforward new method (CONcordance PARtitioning-ConPar), which can be used to identify groups of individual-subject matrices with concordant proximity structures. This method collapses the three-way data into a subject x subject dissimilarity matrix, which is subsequently clustered using a branch-and-bound algorithm that minimizes partition diameter. Extensive Monte Carlo testing revealed that, when compared to K-means clustering of the proximity data, ConPar generally provided better recovery of the true subject cluster memberships. A demonstration using empirical three-way data is also provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method. 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sinka, MP; Corne, DW				Sinka, MP; Corne, DW			The BankSearch web document dataset: investigating unsupervised clustering and category similarity	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						benchmark dataset; clustering; text classification; unsupervised learning; stemming; stoplists	CATEGORIZATION	Targeting useful and relevant information on the internet is a highly complicated research area, which is served in part by research into document clustering. A foundational aspect of such research (proven over and over again in other research disciplines) is the use of standard datasets, against which different techniques can be properly benchmarked and assessed. We argue that, so far in this broad area of research, as many datasets have been used as research papers written, thus preventing confident reasoning about the relative performance of different techniques used in different publications. We describe a solution to this problem with the compilation of the BankSearch dataset, a proposed standard dataset suitable for a wide range of web-intelligence related research activities. At the time of writing, this dataset has already become a popular download in the Statlib archive, and is in use for benchmarking of a variety of document processing and web search techniques. Herein we also use the dataset in experiments to investigate certain issues in unsupervised web document clustering. Our main interest is how unsupervised clustering performance varies with the relative 'distance' between the categories inherent in the data, and how this is affected by the use of stemming and stoplists. These issues relate to, among other things, the design of useful search engines. We use simple k-means clustering, and find, unsurprisingly, that performance improves as categories become more distant. However, we also find that very close categories can be distinguished with fair accuracy, and there are interesting results concerning the use of stemming. Stop-word removal is confirmed as universally helpful, but stemming is not always to be recommended on 'distant' categories. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The visualisation technique uses parallel coordinates which visualise multidimensional data using two dimensional presentations and allow identification of clusters and outliers, therefore, can be used to detect abnormal events. The study is based on a database covering 527 days of operation of an industrial wastewater treatment plant. It was found that both the visualisation technique and MSPC based on T 2 chart captured the same 17 days as "clearly abnormal" and another eight days as "likely abnormal". Pattern recognition using K-means clustering was also applied to the same data in literature and was found to have identified 14 out of the 17 "clearly abnormal" days.

Expression comparison with in vivo tissues of trophoblast derivation was performed to investigate characteristics of the expression in BT-1. BT-1 is a cell line established without feeder cells using trophoblast cells that are separated from bovine blastocysts. The bovine in vivo tissues of the trophoblast derivation were collected on day 17 through 56 of gestation. Of 1,773 genes, 933 exhibited an expression difference exceeding two-fold between BT-1 and in vivo tissues. These genes were analyzed by the k-means clustering method and were distributed into six clusters. Some genes, such as placental lactogen, interferon-iota and pregnancy associated glycoproteins, all known as trophoblast-specific genes, were detected in BT-1 as well as in vivo tissues throughout the experiment period. These trophoblast-specific genes and octamer-binding transcription factor-4, known as a marker for undifferentiation of cells in mice, were detected by RTPCR in both BT-1 and in vivo trophoblast tissues. The overall gene expression profile in BT-1 suggests that this cell line contains trophoblast-specific characteristics and is similar to trophoblast cells around the implantation period.

Unfortunately, the use of different microarray platforms, protocols, and informatics often hinders the meaningful comparison of transcriptional profiling data across laboratories. One solution to this problem is to provide a low-cost and centralized resource that enables researchers to share toxicogenomic data that has been generated on a common platform. In an effort to create such a resource, we developed a standardized set of microarray reagents and reproducible protocols to simplify the analysis of liver gene expression in the mouse model. This resource, referred to as EDGE, was then used to generate a training set of 117 publicly accessible transcriptional profiles that can be accessed at http://edge.oncology.wisc.edu/. The Web-accessible database was also linked to an informatics suite that allows on-line clustering and K-means analyses as well as Boolean and sequence-based searches of the data. We propose that EDGE can serve as a prototype resource for the sharing of toxicogenomics information and be used to develop algorithms for efficient chemical classification and hazard prediction.

Kernel k-means algorithms have recently been shown to perform better than conventional k-means algorithms in unsupervised classification. However. few reports have examined the benefits of using a kernel function and the relative merits of the various kernel clustering algorithms with regard to the data distribution. In this study, we reformulated four representative clustering algorithms based on a kernel function and evaluated their performances for various data sets. The results indicate that each kernel clustering algorithm gives markedly better performance than its conventional counterpart for almost all data sets. Of the kernel clustering algorithms studied in the present work, the kernel average linkage algorithm gives the most accurate clustering results. (C) 2004 Pattern Recognition Society.

It also aimed to investigate which, if any, of the previous cluster structures (Goulding, 2004; Loughland & Williams, 1997) would be replicated. An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis and a subsequent k-means cluster analysis of the Unusual Experiences (UE), Cognitive Disorganisation (CD), and Introvertive Anhedonia (IA) sub-scales of the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE; Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995) were performed. Three separate clusters, labelled Introvertive Anhedonia (IA), Low Schizotypy (LS), and Cognitive Disorganisation (CD), were identified. An analysis of variance showed that the clusters did not differ with regard to paranormal beliefs and experiences, measured by the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale (ASGS; Thalbourne Delin, 1993); all clusters had high scores. Another analysis of variance showed that the LS cluster scored significantly higher on the health-related Sense of Coherence (SOC; Antonovsky, 1991) Scale than both the other clusters. The results of this study support the Loughland and Williams (1997) O-LIFE four-cluster solution and the notion of healthy schizotypy and therefore also the fully dimensional model of schizotypy.

Furthermore, viral resistance often develops, making one or more of the drugs ineffective. Identification of novel targets for therapy that may not develop resistance is sorely needed. Therefore, to identify cellular proteins that may be up-regulated in HIV infection and play a role in infection, we analyzed the effects of Tat on cellular gene expression during various phases of the cell cycle. Results: SOM and k-means clustering analyses revealed a dramatic alteration in transcriptional activity at the G1/S checkpoint. Tat regulates the expression of a variety of gene ontologies, including DNA-binding proteins, receptors, and membrane proteins. Using siRNA to knock down expression of several gene targets, we show that an Oct1/2 binding protein, an HIV Rev binding protein, cyclin A, and PPGB, a cathepsin that binds NA, are important for viral replication following induction from latency and de novo infection of PBMCs. Conclusion: Based on exhaustive and stringent data analysis, we have compiled a list of gene products that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Several genes have been established as important for HIV-1 infection and replication, including Pou2AF1 (OBF-1), complement factor H related 3, CD4 receptor, ICAM-1, NA, and cyclin A1. There were also several genes whose role in relation to HIV-1 infection have not been established and may also be novel and efficacious therapeutic targets and thus necessitate further study. Importantly, targeting certain cellular protein kinases, receptors, membrane proteins, and/or cytokines/ chemokines may result in adverse effects. If there is the presence of two or more proteins with similar functions, where only one protein is critical for HIV-1 transcription, and thus, targeted, we may decrease the chance of developing treatments with negative side effects.

J	Esteban, P; Jones, PD; Martin-Vide, J; Mases, M				Esteban, P; Jones, PD; Martin-Vide, J; Mases, M			Atmospheric circulation patterns related to heavy snowfall days in Andorra, Pyrenees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						heavy snowfall days; principal component analysis; clustering; atmospheric circulation patterns; Pyrenees; Andorra; avalanche forecasting	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGY; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; PRESSURE PATTERNS; RAINFALL; EVENTS; USA	Heavy snowfalls over mountain regions are often a direct cause of avalanches. Specific synoptic-scale atmospheric situations are responsible for these kinds of extreme snowfall event, and this is indeed the case for Andorra, a small country located in the Pyrenees, between France and Spain. Based on days with an intensity of at least 30 cm of snow in a 24 h period, the present study uses principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to characterize the synoptic circulation patterns for these days during the winter season. The area of analysis encompasses the region 30-60 degrees N by 30 degrees W-15 degrees E and the period covers the winter seasons from 1986-87 to 2000-01. The methodology proposed involves a preprocessing approach consisting of a spatial standardization of the data used for the PCA, an alternative approximation to decide the centroids and the number of groups for the K-means clustering, and the rejection of the iterations for this algorithm. This approach enables the synoptic classification of every heavy snowfall day, and composite maps were constructed for sea-level pressure, 500 hPa geopotential height, and 1000-500 m thickness (the 5270 m, 5400 m and 5520 m contour lines). The results show seven circulation patterns, most of them with an Atlantic component of the wind, and others with a clear Mediterranean advection that could be combined with cold continental air. The results, as weather charts, could be a useful tool to assist meteorological models in heavy snowfall forecasting, and the day's classification obtained opens up future possibilities for detailed meteorological and climatological analysis of the established types.

We developed LUMIER (for luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping), an automated high-throughput technology, to map protein-protein interaction networks systematically in mammalian cells and applied it to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) pathway. Analysis using self-organizing maps and k-means clustering identified links of the TGFbeta pathway to the p21 activated kinase (PAK) network, to the polarity complex, and to Occludin, a structural component of tight junctions. We show that Occludin regulates TGFbeta type I receptor localization for efficient TGFbeta-dependent dissolution of tight junctions during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.

J	Tseng, GC; Wong, WH				Tseng, GC; Wong, WH			Tight clustering: A resampling-based approach for identifying stable and tight patterns in data	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						microarray; resampling; scattered points; unsupervised learning.	GENE-EXPRESSION; CELL-CYCLE; MODEL; MIXTURE; GENOME	In this article, we propose a method for clustering that produces tight and stable clusters without forcing all points into clusters. The methodology is general but was initially motivated from cluster analysis of microarray experiments. Most current algorithms aim to assign all genes into clusters. For many biological studies, however, we are mainly interested in identifying the most informative, tight, and stable clusters of sizes, say, 20-60 genes for further investigation. W want to avoid the contamination of tightly regulated expression patterns of biologically relevant genes due to other genes whose expressions are only loosely compatible with these patterns. "Tight clustering" has been developed specifically to address this problem. It applies K-means clustering as an intermediate clustering engine. Early truncation of a hierarchical clustering tree is used to overcome the local minimum problem in K-means clustering. The tightest and most stable clusters are identified in a sequential manner through an analysis of the tendency of genes to be grouped together under repeated resampling. We validated this method in a simulated example and applied it to analyze a set of expression profiles in the study of embryonic stem cells.

In the present study, we investigated these possible preictal changes in long-term intracranial recordings of five patients by a measure of phase synchronization. In order to clearly distinguish preictal changes from all the other interictal states, we developed an automatic extraction of representative patterns of interictal synchronization activity. This reference library was used to classify the successive synchronization patterns of long-term recordings into groups of similar patterns. Altered states of brain synchronization were identified as deviating from patterns in the reference library and were evaluated relative to the times of seizure onset in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Methods: A phase-locking measure was estimated using a sliding window analysis on 15 frequency bands (2 Hz steps between 0 and 30 Hz), for all pairs of EEG channels in the epileptogenic temporal lobe (14-20 channels), over the entire data sets (total analyzed duration 305 h). The preictal identification encompasses three basic stages: (1) a preprocessing stage involving the determination of a reference library of characteristic interictal synchronization patterns using a K-means algorithm, and the identification of discriminant variables differentiating interictal from preictal states, (2) a classification stage of the synchronization pattern via a minimum Mahalanobis distance to the reference patterns, as well as detection of outliers, (3) an evaluation stage, of the sensitivity and specificity of the detection by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Results: In most of the cases (36 of 52 seizures, i.e. 70%), a specific state of brain synchronization can be observed several hours before the actual seizure. The changes involved both increases and decreases of the synchronization levels, occurring mostly within the 4-15 Hz frequency band, and were often localized near the primary epileptogenic zone. Conclusions: The analysis of phase synchronization offers a way to distinguish between a preictal state and normal interictal activity. These findings suggest that brain synchronizations are preictally altered in the epileptogenic temporal lobe, inducing a pathological state of higher susceptibility for seizure activity. Significance: Phase synchronization is capable of extracting information from the EEG that allow the definition of a preictal state. Although the proposed analysis does not constitute genuine seizure anticipation, these changes in neuronal synchronization may provide helpful information for prospective seizure warning.

A method widely used for providing spatial information is a combination of sampling strategies and geostatistics. However, geostatistical methods demand intensive sampling that is expensive and time-consuming. Geophysical methods, such as electromagnetic (EM) induction, offer an alternative, more robust, and less expensive approach to gather soil information. In this study, a methodology is outlined for mapping spatial distribution of bulk soil average clay content to a depth of 7 m using EM measurements. The study was conducted southeast of Trangie in the lower Macquarie valley of New South Wales, Australia. Two EM sensors were employed. To provide deep bulk soil EM measurements, an EM34 was used in the horizontal dipole mode at coil configurations of 10. 20, and 40 m (respectively, designated EM34-10, EM34-20, and EM34-40). For shallower bulk soil EM measurements, an EM38 was used in vertical and horizontal modes (EM38-v and EM38-h, respectively). A total of 755 locations were measured on a grid of approximately 0.5 km. In order to classify the EM34 data into broad physiographic and hydrogeological units, fuzzy k-means (FKM) classification was applied. By iterating fuzziness exponents (phi), input parameters, and evaluating various clustering performance indices, we found optimal classification when phi = 1.5 and number of classes (c) = 4. Fuzzy k-means with extragrade (FKMe) classification was subsequently undertaken to account for Extragrades (i.e., outliers in the data). A spatial response surface sampling (SRSS) design was invoked to select sampling sites within each of the four regular and one Extragrade class. From 40 calibration holes (i.e., 8 from each class), soil samples were taken at I m intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 7 m. Each sample was analyzed for clay content then averaged for a 0-7 m clay content (%clay) for each hole. In order to predict the %clay across the landscape, a hierarchical spatial regression model (HSR) was developed using a composite signal variable [i.e., ln(EM34-10) + ln(EM34-40) + ln(EM38-h)] and first-order trend surface components (i.e., Easting and Northing). The final map of %clay generally reflects the known surface clay content and provides information about the spatial distribution of subsurface %clay variability. We conclude that although the FKMe analysis did not result in an improved calibration within each class, the approach delineated similar clusters of signal readings that were useful in providing a framework to determine a soil sampling design that accounted for variations in physiography and hydrogeology.

After fractionation by column chromatography, 47 components were identified, representing 95.0% of the total amount of the oil. The main constituents were myrcene (53.5%) and aristolene (8.5%). The evolution of the chemical composition according to the stages of development of the plant was investigated as well as the composition of leaf, flower and peduncle oils. Forty individual samples of leaf oil were analyzed by GC-RI and C-13-NMR. The chemical data were submitted to partitioning program (K-means) which determined three groups, respectively dominated by myrcene, myrcene/aristolene and aristolene/myrcene.

In this research, in support of operational activities at the Canadian Ice Service, images containing visually separable classes of either ice and water or multiple ice classes are segmented. This paper uses image intensity to discriminate ice from water and uses texture features to identify distinct ice types. In order to seamlessly combine image spatial relationships with various image features, a novel Bayesian segmentation approach is developed and applied. This new approach uses a function-based parameter to weight the two components in a Markov random field (MRF) model. The devised model allows for automatic estimation of MRF model parameters to produce accurate unsupervised segmentation results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to successfully segment various SAR sea ice images and achieve improvement over existing published methods including the standard MRF-based method, finite Gamma mixture model, and K-means clustering.

J	Jeong, MJ; Dennis, BH; Yoshimura, S				Jeong, MJ; Dennis, BH; Yoshimura, S			Multidimensional clustering interpretation and its application to optimization of coolant passages of a turbine blade	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							K-MEANS ALGORITHM; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VISUALIZATION	A data-clustering method can be a useful tool for engineering design that is based on numerical optimization. The clustering method is an effective way of producing representative designs, or clusters, from a large set of potential designs. The results presented here focus on the application of clustering to single -objective optimization results. In the case of single-objective optimization, the method is used to determine the clusters in a set of quasi-optimal feasible solutions generated by an optimizer. A data-clustering procedure based on an evolutionary method is briefly described. The number of clusters is determined automatically and need not be known a priori. The method is demonstrated ky application to the results of a turbine blade coolant passage shape-optimization problem. The solutions are transformed to a lower-dimensional space,for better understanding of their variance and character Engineering information, such as the shapes and locations of the internal passages, is supported by the visualization of clustered solutions. The clustering, transformation, and visualization methods presented in this study might be applicable to the increasing interpretation demands of design optimization.

The aim of this study was to re-evaluate subtyping approach used in an earlier study (TI Suvinen, KR Hanes, JA Gerschman, PC Reade. J Orofac Pain 1997; 11: 200) and to compare perceived physical symptoms, psychological, coping and psychosocial variables between subtypes of patients who seek treatment for their temporomandibular pain and dysfunction. A total of 41 consecutive female patients were assessed multiaxially for physical symptoms, coping style and effectiveness and illness behaviour by a previously validated Temporomandibular Pain Dysfunction Questionnaire ( TI Suvinen, KR Hanes, JA Gerschman, PC Reade. J Orofac Pain 1997; 11: 200). Additional measures of psychosocial variables included the global scores of the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventory and Part I of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory. Subtypes were generated using an iterative partitioning method, k-means cluster analysis. Three clusters were identified and termed as Simple (22%), Intermediate (41%) and Complex (37%) temporomandibular disorders subtypes. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between clusters in psychological ( coping style and effectiveness, disease conviction and affective disturbance) and in psychosocial variables ( daily interference and social, work and family satisfaction), but not between physical variables. The results support previous studies that have shown differences in psychosocial variables in the presentation and subtyping of TMDs and the biopsychosocial orientation in assessment. The findings need to be reverified in a larger sample along specific physical diagnoses, but it is tentatively proposed how the three subtypes could be used in the classification of temporomandibular pain patients to guide management, based on the constellation of predominant psychological and psychosocial illness impact variables.

Our application is to defining viral subtypes of HIV on the basis of similarities; of V3 loop region amino acids of the envelope (env) gene. The techniques introduced here could apply with virtually no change to other HIV genes as well as to other problems and data not necessarily of viral origin. These, algorithms as they apply to quantitative data have found much application in engineering contexts to compressing images and speech. They are called vector quantization and involve a mapping from a large number of possible inputs into a much smaller number of outputs. Many implementations. in particular those that go by the name generalized Lloyd or k-means. exist for choosing sets of possible outputs and mappings. With each there is an attempt to maximize similarities among inputs that map to any single output, or, alternatively, to minimize some measure of distortion between input and output. Here, two standard types of vector quantization are brought to bear upon the cited problem of clustering V3 loop amino acid sequences. Results of this clustering are compared to those of the well known UPGMA algorithms, the unweighted pair group method in which arithmetic averages are employed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 249, 205-211] suggested that shortening concerned specific microstate classes. Sequence rules (microstate concatenations, syntax) conceivably might also be affected. In 27 patients of the above type and 27 controls, from three centers, multichannel resting EEG was analyzed into microstates using k-means clustering of momentary potential topographies into four microstate classes (A-D). In patients, microstates were shortened in classes B and D (from 80 to 70 ms and from 94 to 82 ms, respectively), occurred more frequently in classes A and C, and covered more time in A and less in B. Topography differed only in class B where LORETA tomography predominantly showed stronger left and anterior activity in patients. Microstate concatenation (syntax) generally were disturbed in patients; specifically, the class sequence A -> C -> D -> A predominated in controls, but was reversed in patients (A -> D -> C -> A). In schizophrenia, information processing in certain classes of mental operations might deviate because of precocious termination. The intermittent occurrence might account for Bleuler's "double bookkeeping." The disturbed microstate syntax opens a novel physiological comparison of mental operations between patients and controls. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	He, QP; Qin, SJ; Wang, J				He, QP; Qin, SJ; Wang, J			A new fault diagnosis method using fault directions in fisher discriminant analysis	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; process monitoring; principal component analysis; contribution plot; fisher discriminant analysis; preanalysis	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONTRIBUTION PLOTS; RECONSTRUCTION; IDENTIFICATION; ERRORS	Multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) have been widely applied to the statistical process monitoring (SPM) of chemical processes and their effectiveness for fault detection is well recognized. These methods make use of normal process data to define a tight normal operation region for monitoring. In practice, however, historical process data are often corrupted with faulty data. In this paper, a new process monitoring method is proposed that is composed of three parts: (1) a preanalysis step that first roughly identifies various clusters in a historical data set and then precisely isolates normal and abnormal data clusters by the k-means clustering method; (2) a fault visualization step that visualizes high-dimensional data in 2-D space by performing global Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), and (3) a new fault diagnosis method based on fault directions in pairwise FDA. A simulation example is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fault diagnosis method. An industrial film process is used to illustrate a realistic scenario for data preanalysis, fault visualization, and fault diagnosis. In both examples, the contribution plots method, based on fault directions in pairwise FDA, shows superior capability for fault diagnosis to the contribution plots method based on PCA.

We compute the ML-estimator with respect to a certain statistical model with n - r outliers for the parameters of the g populations it detects outliers and simultaneously partitions their complement into g clusters. It turns out that the estimator unites both the minimum-covariance-determinant rejection method and the well-known pooled determinant criterion of cluster analysis. We also propose an efficient algorithm for approximating this estimator and study its breakdown points for mean values and pooled SSP matrix.

Samples were obtained from the cauda epididymis of 11 Iberian red deer and cryopreserved following a standard protocol. Motility by CASA was analyzed just after sperm recovery, just before freezing, and after thawing, and eight motility descriptors for each individual spermatozoon were recorded. Sperm viability and acrosomal status were also assessed. Subpopulation analysis was performed in four sequential steps: principal component analysis using the eight motility descriptors; nonhierarchical clustering analysis (k-means) using the first two principal components; hierarchical clustering analysis (UPGMA); and selection of the final number of clusters. Three clusters were obtained for each motility analysis: slow and nonlinear; rapid and linear; and rapid, high ALH, nonlinear. We detected variations in the clusters between treatments (initial, prefreezing and postthawed). Indeed, motility increased and linearity decreased in the prefreezing analysis. A discriminant analysis isolated three descriptors that were used again in the same statistical analysis, giving four clusters that resembled the pattern found in the first classification. We also performed a clustering analysis of the males according to pre-freezing/postthawed variation of total motility, viability, and acrosomal status. The proportion of the linear subpopulations in the prefreezing treatment, in both clustering analyses, correlated positively with postthawed viability recovery. Our results show that clustering analysis of CASA data gives useful and practical information that is not obtained by conventional sperm analysis.

Previously, using a targeted pharmacologic approach, we identified germ-line polymorphisms in a single gene (thiopurine methyltransferase) associated with the risk of irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced secondary brain tumors in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To identify additional candidate genetic risk factors, in identically treated patients, we compared the gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts of those who did develop irradiation-associated brain tumors (n = 9) with the profiles from those who did not (n = 33). Weighted rank regression was used to identify 33 probe sets associated with the time-dependent development of brain tumors; k-means clustering (k = 2) identified 2 groups that differed significantly in cumulative incidence of brain tumors (P = 0.012). Permutation analysis was used to estimate the probability (P = 0.18) of obtaining 2 such clusters by chance. Linear discriminant analysis (time-independent categorization of outcome) was used to identify 70 probe sets whose expression differentiated between the 2 groups of patients. Permutation analyses (n = 1,000) was used to estimate the probability of selecting these probe sets by chance (P = 0.055). Five probe sets were in common between the time-independent and time-dependent methods. The distinguishing genes are involved in neural growth (FGFR 1) and in nuclear trafficking (HNRPL, KPNB1). These data suggest that gene expression profiling from accessible tissues may identify targets involved in therapy-related malignancies in unrelated tissues. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Preprocessing by principal component analysis (PCA) and a Mahalanobis distance metric provide segmentation based on distinct TAC shape rather than simply activity levels. Evaluations on simulation and clinical FDG brain positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrate that differing tissue types can be accurately demarcated with superior performance to k-means clustering approaches, and, in particular, the internal carotids and venous sinuses can be robustly segmented in clinical brain dynamic PET datasets, allowing for the fully automatic noninvasive estimation of the arterial input curve.

J	Morrell, K				Morrell, K			Towards a typology of nursing turnover: the role of shocks in nurses' decisions to leave	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						nurse turnover; retention; shocks; workforce planning; typology	VOLUNTARY TURNOVER; ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; EMPLOYEE TURNOVER; JOB-SATISFACTION; BRITISH NHS; PAY; PERFORMANCE; INTENTIONS; MODEL; DECENTRALIZATION	Aims. The paper reports a study to explore the decision process nurses go through before leaving, focusing on leaving decisions that are precipitated by a single, jarring event or shock. Background. Nursing turnover is a significant problem. Although a range of initiatives has been adopted to improve retention, recent insights from the academic literature on labour turnover have additional implications for how this problem might be managed. Method. A structured questionnaire, with some open-ended items, was used to collect data. For respondents who reported a shock ( n = 153), responses were cluster analysed ( hierarchical, agglomerative clustering generated a solution and k-means clustering enhanced the solution). Clusters were validated using responses to open items. Results. There were three broad clusters of nursing turnover: cluster 1 described nurses whose decision to leave was precipitated by a shock that was work-related, negative and unexpected; cluster 2 described those whose decision was precipitated by a shock that was personal, positive and expected; cluster 3 describes those whose decision unfolded more gradually. Cluster 3 described the conventional picture of how turnover occurs (i.e where there is no shock), whereas clusters 1 and 2 were evidence of different types, where a shock prompts the quitting. Conclusion. In many cases of nurse turnover, a single, jarring event, or shock, initiates thoughts of quitting. Understanding the role of shocks has implications for a range of management activities.

Using two limitations helped to distinguish between nutrient-specific changes in mRNA levels and common changes related to the growth rate. Both homeostatic and slow growth responses were amplified upon shifts. This made detection of these responses more reliable and increased the number of genes that were differentially expressed. We analyzed microarray data in several ways: by determining expression changes after use of a statistical normalization algorithm, by hierarchical and k-means clustering, and by visual inspection of aligned genome images. Using these tools, we confirmed known homeostatic responses to global S limitation, which are controlled by the activators CysB and Cbl, and found that S limitation propagated into methionine metabolism, synthesis of FeS clusters, and oxidative stress. In addition, we identified several open reading frames likely to respond specifically to S availability. As predicted from the fact that the ddp operon is activated by NtrC, synthesis of cross-links between diaminopimelate residues in the murein layer was increased under N-limiting conditions, as was the proportion of tripeptides. Both of these effects may allow increased scavenging of N from the dipeptide D-alanine-D-alanine, the substrate of the Ddp system.

To identify genes controlled by FNR, we used Affymetrix Antisense GeneChips to compare global gene expression profiles from isogenic MG1655 wild-type and Deltafnr strains grown in glucose minimal media under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. We found that 297 genes contained within 184 operons were regulated by FNR and/or by O-2 levels. The expression of many genes known to be involved in anaerobic respiration and fermentation was increased under anaerobic growth conditions, while that of genes involved in aerobic respiration and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were repressed as expected. The expression of nine operons associated with acid resistance was also increased under anaerobic growth conditions, which may reflect the production of acidic fermentation products. Ninety-one genes with no presently defined function were also altered in expression, including seven of the most highly anaerobically induced genes, six of which we found to be directly regulated by FNR. Classification of the 297 genes into eight groups by k-means clustering analysis indicated that genes with common gene expression patterns also had a strong functional relationship, providing clues for studying the function of unknown genes in each group. Six of the eight groups showed regulation by FNR; while some expression groups represent genes that are simply activated or repressed by FNR, others, such as those encoding functions for chemotaxis and motility, showed a more complex pattern of regulation. A computer search for FNR DNA binding sites within predicted promoter regions identified 63 new sites for 54 genes.

Findings indicated that greater endorsement of color-blind racial beliefs was related to the three dimensions of PFC investigated, including higher levels of (a) victim blame attributions of racial inequality, (b) internalized oppression, and (c) justification of social roles or social dominance orientation. K-means cluster analysis among all variables was used to identify racial ideology types. Results suggested that the three multivariate types uncovered-racialized egalitarian consciousness, structural psychological false consciousness, and psychological false consciousness-were differentially related to system blame attributions and out-group friendship preferences. Implications of the findings and future directions are discussed.

The algorithm implements the clustering of the data by a hierarchical clustering technique and a k-means algorithm. After clustering, the program analyzes all the clusters together using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test, by which common associations in the clusters are examined. To use the MH test, the number of subpopulations has to be determined. A method of cross-validation (CV) and the k-means algorithm are applied for estimating the number of subpopulations. The algorithm described was implemented in the computer program POPSTRUCT. In the simulation study, we found that when the two groups with different marker allele frequencies were combined, an inflation of the type I errors was observed. The inflation was more marked when the differences in the marker allele frequencies were larger, the difference in the minor allele frequencies at the disease locus was larger, and the genotype relative risk associated with the disease locus was higher. Our simulation study indicated that the MH test was efficient for decreasing type I errors and increasing the power compared with any test performed on each cluster. Then, we compared the results of STRUCTURE, a model-based method, and POPSTRUCT, a distance-based method. When two subgroups with different allele frequencies were mixed together at a high fixed ratio, POPSTRUCT was superior to STRUCTURE in classifying the combined population into the accurate clusters, each of which reflects one of the original groups.

In this work, an attempt is made to identify amplified genes that can be used to improve prognostication in breast cancer. A series of 52 node-negative tumours was screened for genomic gains at 57 loci by array CGH. A subset of these genes was identified that could divide the series into two divergent outcome groups of either long-term survivors or early disease-related deaths (P = 0.01) using a combination of k-means clustering and statistical analysis. The prognostic significance of amplification of four of the genes (EMS1, TOP2A, CCNE1, and ERBB2) was then evaluated, using fluorescent in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray, in a second larger 'validation' series of 232 tumours with a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Adverse disease-related outcome was associated with amplification of TOP2A (p = 0.004); ERBB2 (p = 0.002); and with the combined amplification of TOP2A, ERBB2, and ENIS1 (p = 0.01). EMS1 amplification was more common (26% of cases) than previously reported but, in isolation, had no prognostic significance. Amplification of CCNE1, seen in only 6% of cases, had no prognostic role. These results indicate that the complementary use of array-CGH and tissue microarrays has the potential to help in the identification and validation of molecular markers that can be used to classify breast cancers into different prognostic groups.

J	Schmeidler, J				Schmeidler, J			Improved algorithms for closed step-down procedures to test heterogeneity of all subsets of means	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						multiple comparisons; Newman-Keuls; step-down; studentized range	MULTIPLE COMPARISONS; RANGE	A common problem in analysis of variance is testing for heterogeneity of different subsets of the full set of k population means. A step-down procedure tests a given subset of p means only after rejecting homogeneity for all sets that contain it. The Peritz and Gabriel closed procedure rejects homogeneity for the subset if every partition of the k means that includes the subset includes some rejected set. The Begun and Gabriel closure algorithm reduces computations, but the number of tests still increases exponentially with respect to the number of complementary means, m = k - p. We propose a new algorithm that tests only the m -, I pairs of adjacent ordered complementary sample means. Our algorithm may be used with analyses of variance test statistics in balanced and unbalanced designs, and with Studentized ranges except in extremely unbalanced designs. Seaman, Levin, and Serlin proposed a more powerful closure criterion that cannot exploit the Begun and Gabriel algorithm. We propose a new algorithm in this case as well. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vassileva, J; Kosson, DS; Abramowitz, C; Conrod, P				Vassileva, J; Kosson, DS; Abramowitz, C; Conrod, P			Psychopathy versus psychopathies in classifying criminal offenders	LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; CLASSIFICATION; ALCOHOLISM; HYPOTHESIS; PSYCHOLOGY; DEPENDENCE; CHECKLIST	Purpose. Psychopathy has been shown to be related to the onset, frequency, and course of antisocial behaviour in criminal offenders. The purpose of the present study was to use cluster analysis to explore the existence of subtypes of criminal offenders in male inmates, based on the two empirically validated dimensions of psychopathy and several other dimensions previously proposed for differentiating offender groups. Methods. Two hundred male inmates participated in the study. Scores on the two dimensions of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (Hare, 1991), the Interpersonal Measure of Psychopathy (Kosson, Steuerwald, Forth, & Kirkhart, 1997), DSM-IV diagnoses for alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, and anxiety were standardized and were included in two different types of cluster analyses. Both Ward's hierarchical method and K-means non-hierarchical method revealed the presence of four subtypes of criminal offenders in the sample. The four-cluster solution was replicated when the sample was split in half and identical cluster analyses were performed on the two subsamples. Results. Two types of cluster analyses identified four subtypes of criminal offenders in two samples of jail inmates. Two of the clusters resembled primary and secondary psychopaths described in the literature, the third group exhibited some antisocial and psychopathic features, and the fourth group was non-psychopathic. Conclusions. Findings suggest that considering the individual contributions of the two dimensions of psychopathy in lieu of the construct as a whole may prove useful in identifying relatively homogeneous groups of criminal offenders.

J	Kim, Y; Street, WN; Russell, GJ; Menczer, F				Kim, Y; Street, WN; Russell, GJ; Menczer, F			Customer targeting: A neural network approach guided by genetic algorithms	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						database marketing; neural networks; genetic algorithms; customer relationship management	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; MARKET-SEGMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; MODELS	One of the key problems in database marketing is the identification and profiling of households that are most likely to be interested in a particular product or service. Principal component analysis (PCA) of customer background information followed by logistic regression analysis of response behavior is commonly used by database marketers. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) guided by genetic algorithms (GAs) to target households. We show that the resulting selection rule is more accurate and more parsimonious than the PCA/logit rule when the manager has a clear decision criterion. Under vague decision criteria, the new procedure loses its advantage in interpretability, but is still more accurate than PCA/logit in targeting households.

Such experiments can, for example, localize brain response to pharmacological stimuli, but frequently the spatiotemporal characteristics of the cerebral response are unknown a priori and variable, and thus difficult to evaluate using hypothesis-based methods alone. Here we used features in the temporal dimension to group voxels with similar time courses based on a nonparametric discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation of each time course. Applying the DWT to each voxel decomposes its temporal information into coefficients associated with both time and scale. Discarding scales in the DWT that are associated with high-frequency oscillations (noise) provided a straight-foward data reduction step and decreased the computational burden. Optimization-based clustering was then applied to the remaining wavelet coefficients in order to produce a finite number of voxel clusters. This wavelet-based cluster analysis (WCA) was evaluated using two representative classes of MRI neuroimaging experiments. In perfusion-weighted MRI, following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO), WCA differentiated healthy tissue and different regions within the ischemic hemisphere. Following an acute cocaine challenge, WCA localized subtle differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of the cerebral response. We conclude that WCA provides a robust method for blind analysis of time series image data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We determined the expression patterns of 3,068 ESTs, representing similar to2,000 unique gene transcripts using cDNA microarrays in adult female Anopheles gambiae at selected times during the first two days following blood ingestion, at 5 and 30 min during a 40 minute blood meal and at 0, 1, 3, 5, 12, 16, 24 and 48 hours after completion of the blood meal and compared their expression to transcript levels in mosquitoes with access only to a sugar solution. Results: In blood-fed mosquitoes, 413 unique transcripts, approximately 25% of the total, were expressed at least two-fold above or below their levels in the sugar-fed mosquitoes, at one or more time points. These differentially expressed gene products were clustered using k-means clustering into Early Genes, Middle Genes, and Late Genes, containing 144, 130, and 139 unique transcripts, respectively. Several genes from each group were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in order to validate the microarray results. Conclusion: The expression patterns and annotation of the genes in these three groups (Early, Middle, and Late genes) are discussed in the context of female mosquitoes' physiological responses to blood feeding, including blood digestion, peritrophic matrix formation, egg development, and immunity.

Through the application of pattern recognition and classification algorithms, such data have been shown to provide information for disease diagnosis as well as the effects of potential therapeutics. In this paper we describe a novel approach, using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), for rapidly identifying metabotically meaningful spectral patterns in H-1 MRS. We show that the intensities of these identified spectral patterns can be related to the onset of, and recovery from, toxicity in both a time-related and dose-related fashion. These patterns can be seen as a new type of biomarker for the biological effect under study. We demonstrate, using k-means clustering, that the recovered patterns can be used to characterize the metabolic status of the animal during the experiment.

Homomorphic filtering converts a non-linear combination of signals (multiplied in time domain) into a linear combination by applying logarithmic transformation. It involves the retrieval of the envelope, a(h) of the PCG signal by attenuating the contribution of fast varying component, f(n) using an appropriate low pass filter. K-means clustering is a non-hierarchical partitioning method, which helps to indicate single cardiac cycle in the PCG signal. Segmentation performance of 90.45% was achieved using the proposed algorithm. Feature vectors were formed after segmentation by using Daubechies-2 wavelet detail coefficients at the second decomposition level. Grow and Learn network was used for classification of the segmented PCG signals and a classification accuracy of 97.02% was achieved. It is concluded that Homomorphic filtering and GAL network could be used for segmentation and classification of PCG signals without using a reference signal.

The quantification is made using routine histopathologic sections of lymph nodes that have been dissected by pathologists from resection specimens. The hematoxylin and eosin stained sections on slides are imaged with a standard image scanner. Each obtained image can contain multiple slides. The first task is to detect the slides. Then, the lymph nodes are detected and their size is assessed using K-means clustering and morphological image processing. The results are found to correlate well with results that have been obtained manually. The method has proven useful for predicting survival in stage II colorectal cancer.

A new engineering approach is proposed that relies on representing multiple neural spike trains in a scale-space in which a spectral clustering algorithm is able to identify clusters of correlated firing within different behavioral contexts (temporal bin-width choices). The method constitutes a natural extension to the multiscale representation of the neural data obtained from the array-based multiresolution spike detection and sorting algorithms previously developed. The advantage of the proposed method is its ability to efficiently identify populations of recorded neurons with correlated activity independent of the temporal scale from which rate functions are typically estimated. Moreover, it relies on simultaneously maximizing cluster aggregation based on similarity as well as cluster segregation based on dissimilarity across any number of neuronal spike trains. We compare the performance to the classical k-means and the probabilistic (Bayesian) clustering algorithms on a complex synthesized data set to illustrate the substantial gain in clustering accuracy.

However, most of them have a difficulty in finding the initial position and size of a face automatically. In this paper, we present a fast and robust method for fully automatic multiview face detection and tracking. Using a small number of critical rectangle features selected and trained by Adaboost learning algorithm, we can detect (he initial position, size and view of a face correctly. Once a face is reliably detected, we can extract face and tipper body color distribution front the detected facial regions and upper body regions for building a robust color modeling respectively. Simultaneously, each color modeling is performed by using k-means clustering and multiple gaussian models. Then, fast and efficient multi-view face tracking is executed by using several critical features. Our proposed algorithm is robust to rotation, partial occlusions, and scale changes in front of dynamic, unstructured background. In addition, our proposed method is computationally efficient.

We tend to show that the CCA is really a non linear extension of the PCA and that the CCA optimization through the PCA (called CCAinitPCA) allows a reduction of the calculations, providing a result identical to that of CCA. We then estimate the pertinence of the information obtained from PCA, CCA and CCAinitPCA by the comparison of the results of segmentation of the images thus obtained.

The problem that we address in this paper is the discovery of recurring anomalies and relationships between problem reports that may indicate larger systemic problems. We will illustrate our techniques on data from discrepancy reports regarding software anomalies in the Space Shuttle. These free text reports are written by a number of different people, thus the emphasis and wording vary considerably. We test four automatic methods of anomaly detection in text that are popular in the current literature on text mining. The first method that we describe is k-means or Gaussian mixture model and its application to the term-document matrix. The second method is the Sammon nonlinear map, which projects high dimensional document vectors into two dimensions for visualization and clustering purposes. The third method is based on an analysis of the results of applying a new clustering method, Expectation Maximization on a mixture of von Mises Fisher distributions, that represents each document as a point on a high dimensional sphere. In this space, we perform clustering to obtain sets of similar documents. The results are derived from a new method known as spectral clustering, where vectors from the term-document matrix are embedded in a high dimensional space for clustering. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding the development of an operational text mining system for analysis of problem reports that arise from complex space systems. We also contrast such systems with general purpose text mining systems, illustrating the areas in which this system needs to be specified for the space domain.

We used a K-mean plus Nearest Neighbor classifier to validate our approach, mostly because it was simple to implement. It has proved effective but still too slow for real-time use. In this paper, we advocate instead the use of randomized trees as the classification technique. It is both fast enough for real-time performance and more robust. It also gives us a principled way not only to match keypoints but to select during a training phase those that are the most recognizable ones. This results in a real-time system able to detect and position in 3D planar, non-planar, and even deformable objects. It is robust to illuminations changes, scale changes and occlusions.

B	Wang, XD; Cottrell, W; Mu, SC			IEEE	Wang, XD; Cottrell, W; Mu, SC			Using K-means clustering to identify time-of-day break points for traffic signal timing plans	2005 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2005)	SEP 13-16, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE				The K-means method, a nonhierarchical clustering algorithm, is applied to traffic volume data to determine time-of-day (TOD) breakpoints for traffic signal timing plans. Other methods, including hierarchical clustering techniques, have been applied to traffic signal timings, but they are computationally intensive and require a substantial amount of data storage space. The procedure requires that the analyst specify the number of clusters prior to engaging the algorithm. The resultant allocations of volumes to clusters may be "noisy"; smoothing may be needed to avoid having an inoperable number of TOD breakpoints. The algorithm is applied to a small case study involving a two-intersection corridor and just under four hours of volume data. Three time intervals were identified, with a peak, two-hour period sandwiched by two offpeak segments. An expanded application of the algorithm on a longer corridor or network, over a longer time period, is recommended. Subsequent steps would be to develop the signal timing plans for the study intersections, evaluate the proposed plans, and assess the potential for their implementation. The K-means method can develop TOD breakpoints from traffic volumes, making it a potentially useful procedure where detectors supplying additional traffic information are either sparse or nonexistent.

The present paper proposes a statistical approach for predicting fastest paths on urban networks. The traffic data used for conducting the statistical analysis are the input flows, the arc states or the number of cars in the arcs and the different paths of the network. The statistical method proposed is called hybrid clustering and consists of four methods namely multiple correspondence analysis, k-means clustering, Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering and canonical correlation analysis. The results obtained from hybrid clustering on the traffic data are decision rules that yield the fastest path for a given set of arc states and input flows. These decision rules are stored in a huge database for performing predictive route guidance. Whenever a driver arrives at the entry point of the network, the current arc states and input flows of the network are searched in the database to extract the corresponding decision rule for finding the fastest path. When no rule is found in the database for a given set of input flow and arc states, the shortest path is predicted as the fastest path.

The states of EHMM correspond to acoustic units of a language and its state-transitions represent the bigram language model of unit sequences. We consider two alternatives to represent the state-observation densities of EHMM, namely the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and hidden Markov model (HMM). We present a segmental K-means algorithm for the training of both these types of EHMM (EHMM of GMMs and EHMM of HMMs) and compare their performances on a 6 language LID task in the OGI-TS database. EHMM of GMMs has a performance comparable to PSWR and superior than EHMM of HMMs; we provide reasons for the performance difference between EHMM(G) and EHMM(H), and identify ways of enhancing the performance of EHMM(H) which is a novel and powerful architecture, ideal for spoken language modeling.

Raman spectra are relatively weak signals whose features are inevitably affected by various types of noises during its calibration process. These noises must be eliminated to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic method has been widely used to solve uncertainty, imprecision and vague phenomena. As a result, fuzzy filtering is employed for noise filtering so as to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Any raw Raman spectrum has to be preprocessed and normalized prior to further analysis. The resulting intrinsic Raman spectra can be classified into different categories via fuzzy K-means clustering, which is applicable for decision making. A complete fuzzy logic approach is then formulated to characterize several biomedical samples. The long-term research objective is to create a realtime approach for sample analysis using a Raman spectrometer directly mounted at the end-effector of medical robots.

Because of the sensitivity of initial conditions, k-means clustering often suffers from low clustering performance. We present a procedure to refine initial conditions of k-means clustering by analyzing density distributions of a data set before estimating the number of clusters k necessary for the data set, as well as the positions of the initial centroids of the clusters. We demonstrate that this approach indeed improves the accuracy and performance of k-means clustering measured by average intra to inter-clustering error ratio. This method is applied to the virtual ecology project to design a virtual blue jay system.

These techniques revolutionize our understanding of biology by simultaneously probing thousands of biological entities at any given time. Unsupervised classification and clustering have emerged as important methods of analysis, which can be used to group samples with a similar molecular profile and/or molecules with a similar expression profile. However, techniques like hierarchical clustering, k-means, and self organizing maps (SOM) have been extensively used with little attention to the significance of their results. We propose a general method utilizing bootstrap technique to assign confidence levels to clustering results of high throughput biological data. We apply the proposed method to real genomics and proteomics data regarding Renal Cell Cancer (RCC), which is the most common malignancy of the adult kidney. We utilize protein profiles from IL-2 treatment responders and non-responders among metastatic RCC patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI TOF-MS). We also use gene expression data using Affymetrix HG-U133A chips for primary RCC tumors, inquiring the Union International Contre le Cancer's (UICC) TNM classification.

First, we explain the hardware of tele-operation system of the mobile robot, and the display system of the measured information of the robot. There are many supporting poles in the under floor, and the robot should estimate the self-location according to the layout of the surrounding poles. We apply a K-means algorithm and a steady-state genetic algorithm (SSGA) for extracting poles from an image. Next, We apply the proposed method for the control of a mobile robot used under an office automation floor. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to the human operator. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We propose a novel method for the recognition of hand gestures, used by air marshals for steering aircraft on the runway, using the Radon transform. Various aspects of the algorithm, including acquisition, segmentation, labeling and recognition using the parametric Radon transform are addressed in this paper. A binary skeleton representation of the human subject is computed. The Radon transform is used to generate maxima corresponding to specific orientations of the skeletal representation. Feature vectors are extracted from the transform space by computing the normatized cumulative projections of the Radon transform on the angle axis. K-means clustering is then applied to recognize static gestures from the extracted features. This technique has the potential to provide information about the exact orientation of gesture segments and can find use in ground control of unmanned air vehicles. Experiments with image data corresponding to the various ground air traffic control gestures used in directing aircrafts, highlight the potential application of this approach.

However, most of them have a difficulty in finding the initial position and size of a face automatically. In this paper, we present a fast and robust method for fully automatic multiview face detection and tracking. Using a small number of critical rectangle features selected and trained by Adaboost learning algorithm, we can detect the initial position, size and view of a face correctly. Once a face is reliably detected, we can extract face and upper body color distribution from the detected facial regions and upper body regions for building a robust color modeling respectively. Simultaneously, each color modeling is performed by using k-means clustering and multiple gaussian models. Then, fast and efficient multi-view face tracking is executed by using several critical features and a simple linear Kalman filter. Our proposed algorithm is robust to rotation, partial occlusions, and scale changes in front of dynamic, unstructured background. In addition, our proposed method is computationally efficient. Therefore, it can be executed in real-time.

Recent studies have shown that partitional clustering algorithms are more suitable for clustering large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm, the most commonly used partitional clustering algorithm, can only generate a local optimal solution. In this paper, we present a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) document clustering algorithm. Contrary to the localized searching of the K-means algorithm, the PSO clustering algorithm performs a globalized search in the entire solution space. In the experiments we conducted, we applied the PSO, K-means and hybrid PSO clustering algorithm on four different text document datasets. The number of documents in the datasets ranges from 204 to over 800, and the number of terms ranges from over 5000 to over 7000. The results illustrate that the hybrid PSO algorithm can generate more compact clustering results than the K-means algorithm.

IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	MAR 13-17, 2005	New Orleans, LA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc				Event broker grids that deploy the publish/subscribe communication paradigm extend the capabilities of seamless messaging in heterogeneous network environments. In order to support such mixed network environments, we integrate publish/subscribe semantics with multicast routing in mobile ad hoe networks. Dynamic construction of an event dissemination structure to route events from event publishers to subscribers is important, especially to support highly dynamic, self-organizing, mobile peer-to-peer systems. The proposed approach aggregates content-based subscriptions in a compact data format (Bloom filters), and ODMRP (On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol) is extended to use this context from the middleware-tier to construct an optimized dynamic dissemination mesh. Thus, dynamic multicast groups are created by aggregating subscriptions, applying K-means clustering and other methods. Cooperation between the middleware-tier and network components allows fine-grained subscriptions to be represented.

The system comprises the detailed analysis of the two more important bones in TW3: the radius and ulna wrist bones. First, a generalization of K-means algorithm is presented to semi-automatically segment the contour of the bones and thus extract up to 89 features describing shapes and textures from bones. Second, a well-founded feature selection criterion based on the statistical properties of data is used in order to properly choose the most relevant features. Third, bone age is estimated with the help of a Generalized Softmax Perceptron (GSP) Neural Network (NN) whose optimal complexity is estimated via the Posterior Probability Model Selection (PPMS) algorithm. We can then predict the different development stages in both radius and ulna, from which we are able to score and estimate the bone age of a patient in years and finally we compare the NN results with those from the pediatrician expert discrepancies.

DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) has previously been shown to achieve excellent source separation in real time in software. The current work is a move towards a hardware realization of DUET that will allow integration of the algorithm into consumer devices. Initial stages involve investigating the performance of DUET when implemented in fixed-point arithmetic and a consideration of algorithmic changes to make DUET more amenable to implementation on a DSP processor. Performance is compared for floating-point and fixed-point implementations. A Weighted K-means clustering algorithm is presented as an alternative to gradient descent methods for peak tracking and demonstrated to achieve excellent performance without adversely affecting computational load. Preliminary performance figures are given for an implementation on a TMS320VC5510 DSK.

This paper presents an ANN-based clustering analysis algorithm with Dynamic Data Window (DDW). Comparing with k-means algorithm merged in density-based and integrated clustering analysis algorithm, the new clustering analysis algorithm based on artificial neural networks and combining with DDW has more valuable in data mining. This algorithm can immensely avoid the effect on accumulation points from boundary points, and can automatically rind representative accumulation points in all kings of shapes. Furthermore its applications in GIS will be discussed in the paper. Some analysis results show the significant improvement to ship-routing design with the clustering analysis algorithm based on ANN and DDW in database of GIS.

This work gets inspiration from the notion that a non-linear data transformation into some high dimensional feature space increases the possibility of linear separability of the patterns in the transformed space. Therefore, it simplifies exploration of the associated structure in the data. Kernel methods implicitly perform a non-linear mapping of the input data into a high dimensional feature space by replacing the inner products with an appropriate positive definite function. In this paper we present a robust weighted kernel k-means algorithm incorporating spatial constraints for clustering climate data. The proposed algorithm can effectively handle noise, outliers and auto-correlation in the spatial data, for effective and efficient data analysis by exploring patterns and structures in the data.

Our method computes disjoint clusters automatically using a spherical k-means algorithm for all spam/non-spam mails and obtains centroid vectors of the clusters for extracting the cluster description. For each centroid vectors, the label('spam' or 'non-spam') is assigned by calculating the number of spam email in the cluster When new mail arrives, the cosine similarity between the new mail vector and centroid vector is calculated. Finally, the label of the most relevant cluster is assigned to the new mail. By using our method, we can extract many kinds of topics in spam/non-spam email and detect the spam email efficiently. In this paper, we describe the our spam detection system and show the result of our experiments using the Ling-Spam test collection.

In this paper, we address the problem of clustering the Poincare vectors. Three variants of the k-means algorithm and a competitive neural technique are tested and compared. The empirical performance of the different methods in terms of classification and segmentation accuracy is evaluated. The results obtained on real life passive polarimetric images demonstrate the usefulness of such approach for exploiting the polarimetric information.

The idea is first to segment the image; in order to obtain road candidates. Then we apply the k-means algorithm to cluster the pixels of the segmented image. The resulting clusters cover the road and the noise generated by the segmentation process. We introduce the concept of cluster coverage to remove noise and to approximate the optimal number of clusters that fit the shape of the road.

First raw trajectories are pre-processed and resampled at equal space intervals. Then spectral clustering is used to group trajectories with similar spatial patterns. Dominant paths and lanes can be distinguished as a result of two-layer hierarchical clustering. Detection of novel trajectories is also possible based on the clustering results. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of spectral clustering compared with conventional fuzzy K-means clustering and some results of anomaly detection are presented.

Our algorithm frees users from interactions required for colorizing grayscale image or transferring color between images. Different from existing algorithms, we cluster the source color image into regions using the GMM-EM method, and the target image using the K-means algorithm. We then impose chromatic mean values on corresponding source image regions in the target image. Experiments showed that our algorithm can give better results.
