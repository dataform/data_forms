An Experimental Evaluation of ZCS-DM for the Prediction of Urban Air Quality	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING	Environmental Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International ICSC Symposium on Information Technologies in Environmental Engineering	MAY 28-29, 2009	Thessaloniki, GREECE	ICSC			PATTERN-RECOGNITION; THESSALONIKI; GREECE	Understanding and forecasting urban Air Quality (AQ) is not only a multifaceted and computationally challenging problem for machine learning algorithms, but also a difficult task for human-decision makers: the strict regulatory framework, in combination with the public demand for better information services poses the need for robust, efficient and, more importantly, understandable forecasting models. Unlike neural network or regression-based techniques traditionally used in the domain of AQ, our current approach adopts ZCS-DM - Zeroth-level Classifier System for Data Mining - for the production of a set of AQ prediction rules in the urban domain. On this basis, the aim of our experimental investigation is twofold and includes (i) the handling of incomplete data matrices and (ii) the evaluation of ZCS-DM effectiveness against methods widely used in the target domain, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification trees (C4.5). Overall, the obtained results reveal the potential of ZCS-DM as a data mining tool to be used for AQ forecasting, and point to its insensitivity for missing values (cf. MLP, SVM, LDA) and the understandability of produced models as its greater advantages.

Mostly successful prediction of this future value can leads to significant profit. However, the possibility of predicting stock market is still questionable by some theories such as the random walk hypothesis [1]. In contrast, several studies [2, 3] indicate that the market is predictable to some point. Recent studies [4, 5, 6] show that neural network is one of the most promising prediction techniques for stock market. This back to the special characteristics exist in neural network which are very suitable to stock market nature. In this paper we aim to propose a new approach for stock market prediction and provide an answer for two interesting issues. First, is the market predictable and what factors are actually affecting the accuracy of this prediction. The second issue is what is the correct neural network structure that will provide the most accurate prediction, and how this network handles the market movement over short. The neural network approach proposed during this research can automatically adjust to minimize the error rate and to improve the prediction accuracy. To test our approach we use real stock market data collected from the Egyptian stock market and we apply several testing phases.			waleed_kablan@yahoo.com; melzeweidy1@yahoo.com					Azoff EM., 1994, NEURAL NETWORK TIME; HELSTROM T, 1998, PREDICTING STOCK MAR; HSIEH AD, 1991, J FINANC, V46, P1833; Maddala GS, 1992, INTRO ECONOMETRICS; MALKEI BG, 1999, RANDOM WALK WALL STR; Mitchell M., 1997, MACHINE LEARNING; PESARAN MH, 1994, J FORECASTING, V13, P335, DOI 10.1002/for.3980130402; SCHUMANN M, 1993, P 26 HAW INT C, V4, P597; TAN TZ, 2005, EV COMP 2005 2005 IE, V3, P2653; TSIBOURIS G, 1996, NEURAL NETWORKS CAPI, P127; WANG X, 2003, P INT JOINT C, V4, P2438; White H., 1993, NEURAL NETWORKS FINA, P315; YAMASHITA T, 2005, P IEEE INT JOINT C N, V4, P2544, DOI 10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556303; YOO PD, 2005, INT C INT C COMP INT, V2, P835, DOI 10.1109/CIMCA.2005.1631572	14	0	0	INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA	NORRISTOWN	34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA		978-0-9821489-0-7				2009							85	91				7	Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science	Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science	BPB66	WOS:000278458300012

Among all the available strategies. trying to predict the customer Is behavior and to anticipate his expectations is a solution. To achieve this goal, one has to design a model of customer Is behavior. usually by mining the tremendous amount of data stored on the company's computer. Inflict. the data mining process implicitly assumes the homogeneity of the context where data are collected But the cultural background is different when an Egyptian citizen buys with Amazon or when it is a Chinese citizen. We cannot suggest a Chinese citizen to buy a spoon after buying a bowl: stick would be more appropriate. In that context, the classical techniques of machine learning or data mining can he challenged. This is why we suggest investigating the use of analogical learning, which allows highlighting hidden correspondences between diverse contexts. Analogical learning is not new but we provide a set theoretic approach, very suitable for practical implementation. This way to model customer behavior could enhance the customer experience in a business environment.

The reason for this increase in research activity can be attributed to the huge annual financial losses incurred by card issuers due to fraudulent use of their card products. A successful strategy for dealing with fraud can quite literally mean millions of dollars in savings per year on operational costs. Artificial neural networks have come to the front as an at least partially successful method for fraud detection. The success of neural networks in this field is, however, limited by their underlying design - a feedforward neural network is simply a static mapping of input vectors to output vectors, and as such is incapable of adapting to changing shopping profiles of legitimate card holders. Thus, fraud detection systems in use today are plagued by misclassifications and their usefulness is hampered by high false positive rates. We address this problem by proposing the use of a dynamic machine learning method in an attempt to model the time series inherent in sequences of same card transactions. We believe that, instead of looking at individual transactions, it makes more sense to look at sequences of transactions as a whole; a technique that can model time in this context will be more robust to minor shifts in legitimate shopping behaviour. In order to form a clear basis for comparison, we did some investigative research on feature selection. preprocessing, and on the selection of performance measures; the latter will facilitate comparison of results obtained by applying machine learning methods to the biased data sets largely associated with fraud detection. We ran experiments on real world credit card transactional data using two innovative machine learning techniques: the support vector machine (SVM) and the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM).

The machine learning domain currently suffers frond a lack of classification techniques that are able to detect the occurrence of a change in the underlying data distribution. Ignoring possible changes in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, may degrade the performance of the classification model. Often these changes make the model inconsistent and regular updatings become necessary. Taking the temporal dimension into account during the analysis of Web usage data is a necessity, since the way a site is visited may indeed evolve due to modifications in the structure and content of the site, or even due to changes in the behavior of certain user groups. One solution to this problem, proposed in this article, is to update models using summaries obtained by means of all evolutionary approach based on an intelligent clustering approach. We carry out various clustering strategies that are applied oil tilde sub-periods. To validate our approach we apply two external evaluation criteria which compare different partitions from the same data set. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient to detect the occurrence of changes.

The results-conclusion section is the most important because it usually describes the main contribution of a paper. Unfortunately, not all biomedical journals follow this three-section format. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) based approach to automatically identify the results-conclusion section. The results-conclusion section identification problem is formulated as a sequence labeling task. Four feature sets, including Position, Named Entity, Tense, and Word Frequency, are employed with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as the underlying ML model. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can achieve F-measure, precision, and recall of 97.08%, 96.63% and 97.53%, respectively.

Machine Learning Framework for Classification in Medicine and Biology	INTEGRATION OF AI AND OR TECHNIQUES IN CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING FOR COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatial Optimization Problems	MAY 27-31, 2009	Pittsburgh, PA				CPG ISLAND METHYLATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MODELS	Systems modeling and quantitative analysis of large amounts of complex clinical and biological data, may help to identify discriminatory patterns that can uncover health risks, detect early disease formation, monitor treatment and prognosis, and predict treatment, outcome. Inn this talk, we describe a machine-learning framework for classification in medicine and biology. It consists of a pattern recognition module; a feature selection module, and a classification modeler anti solver. The pattern recognition module involves automatic image analysis, genomic pattern recognition, and spectrum pattern extractions. The feature selection module consists of a combinatorial selection algorithm where discriminatory patterns are extracted from among a large set of pattern attributes. These modules are wrapped around the classification modeler and solver into a machine learning framework. The classification modeler and solver consist of novel optimization-based predictive models that maximize the correct classification while constraining the inter-group mis-classifications. The classification/predictive models 1) have the ability to classify any number of distinct groups; 2) allow incorporation of heterogeneous, and continuous/time-dependent types of attributes as input;; 3) utilize a high-dimensional data transformation that minimizes noise and errors in biological and clinical data; 4) incorporate a reserved-judgement region that provides a safeguard against over-training; and 5) have successive multi-stage classification capability. Successful applications of our model to developing rules for gene silencing in cancer cells, predicting the immunity of vaccines, identifying the cognitive status of individuals, and predicting metabolite concentrations in humans will be discussed.

Pulendran and Ahmed (Emory Vaccine Center), Dr. Levey (Neurodegenerative Disease and Alzheimer's Disease); and Dr. Jones (Clinical Biomarkers, Emory).

To effectively identify, extract, and analyze risk-related statements in textual data, these processes need to be automated. We developed an annotation framework for firm-specific risk statements guided by previous economic, managerial, linguistic, and natural language processing research. A manual annotation study using news articles from the Wall Street Journal was conducted to verify the framework. We designed and constructed an automated risk identification system based on the annotation framework. The evaluation using manually annotated risk statements in news articles showed promising results for automated risk identification.

Our motivation is to alleviate the task of synthesizing a scene conforming to the particularities of certain morphological or other intuitive demands. We address the feasibility Of Such a framework, through the study and integration of methods for the acquisition of qualitative knowledge as well as for the guided generation of scenes. The proposed framework comprises a knowledge obtainment stage, where the machine learning mechanism acquires the qualitative implications of a series of examples and a scene generation stage, where the evolutionary mechanism conducts a partial exploration of the solution space of scenes, compliant with a given set of quantitative requirements as well as to the acquired qualitative knowledge. The paradigm domain is that of architectural design with the aid of declarative modeling by hierarchical decomposition.

Jaap			The ROC isometrics approach to construct reliable classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						ROC analysis; isometrics; abstaining classifiers; reliable classifiers; cost-sensitive classification	ABSTAINING CLASSIFIERS; REJECT RULE; CLASSIFICATION	We address the problem of applying machine-learning classifiers in domains where incorrect classifications have severe consequences. In these domains we propose to apply classifiers only when their performance can be defined by the domain expert prior to classification. The classifiers so obtained are called reliable classifiers. In the article we present three main contributions. First, we establish the effect on an ROC curve when ambiguous instances are left unclassified. Second, we propose the ROC isometrics approach to tune and transform a classifier in such a way that it becomes reliable. Third, we provide an empirical evaluation of the approach. From our analysis and experimental evaluation we may conclude that the ROC isometrics approach is an effective and efficient approach to construct reliable classifiers. In addition, a discussion about related work clearly shows the benefits of the approach when compared with existing approaches that also have the option to leave ambiguous instances unclassified.

J	Zhao, Z; Liu, H				Zhao, Zheng; Liu, Huan			Searching for interacting features in subset selection	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article	Workshop on Analytics for Noisy Unstructured Text Data held in Conjunction with the 20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA			Feature interaction; feature selection; search; data structure; classification		The evolving and adapting capabilities of robust intelligence are best manifested in its ability to learn. Machine learning enables computer systems to learn, and improve performance. Feature selection facilitates machine learning (e. g., classification) by aiming to remove irrelevant features. Feature (attribute) interaction presents a challenge to feature subset selection for classification. This is because a feature by itself might have little correlation with the target concept, but when it is combined with some other features, they can be strongly correlated with the target concept. Thus, the unintentional removal of these features may result in poor classification performance. It is computationally intractable to handle feature interactions in general. However, the presence of feature interaction in a wide range of real-world applications demands practical solutions that can reduce high-dimensional data while preserving feature interactions. In this paper, we take up the challenge to design a special data structure for feature quality evaluation, and to employ an information-theoretic feature ranking mechanism to efficiently handle feature interaction in subset selection. We conduct experiments to evaluate our approach by comparing with some representative methods, perform a lesion study to examine the critical components of the proposed algorithm to gain insights, and investigate related issues such as data structure, ranking, time complexity, and scalability in search of interacting features.

J	Bosnic, Z; Kononenko, I				Bosnic, Zoran; Kononenko, Igor			An overview of advances in reliability estimation of individual predictions in machine learning	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Predictions; reliability; prediction accuracy; data perturbation; unlabeled examples; supervised learning	REGRESSION PREDICTIONS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SELECTION; CLASSIFIERS	In Machine Learning, estimation of the predictive accuracy for a given model is most commonly approached by analyzing the average accuracy of the model. In general, the predictive models do not provide accuracy estimates for their individual predictions. The reliability estimates of individual predictions require the analysis of various model and instance properties. In the paper we make an overview of the approaches for estimation of individual prediction reliability. We start by summarizing three research fields, that provided ideas and motivation for our work: (a) approaches to perturbing learning data, (b) the usage of unlabeled data in supervised learning, and (c) the sensitivity analysis. The main part of the paper presents two classes of reliability estimation approaches and summarizes the relevant terminology, which is often used in this and related research fields.

There are several proposals in this area, but none of them consistently outperforms the others over it wide range of domains. In this paper(1) we present a set of measures to characterize the databases, as well as a new algorithm that uses these measures and, depending on the data characteristics, it applies the method or combination of methods expected to produce the best results. This approach was evaluated over 20 databases and with six different learning paradigms.

However, improving performance of the classifier is still attractive to cope with the high accuracy processing. A tolerant rough set is considered as a basis of the classification of data. The data classification is realized by applying the kNN with distance function. To improve the classification accuracy, a distance function with weights is considered. Then, weights of the function are optimized by the genetic algorithm. After the learning of training data, an unknown data is classified by the kNN with distance function. To improve further the performance of the kNN classifier, a relearning method is proposed. The proposed relearning method shows a higher generalization accuracy when compared to the basic kNN with distance function and other conventional learning algorithms. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

There are numerous models Currently available for performing classification. among which decision trees and artificial neural networks. In this article we describe the implementation of a new lazy classification model called similarity classifier. Given an out-of-sample instance, this model predicts its class by finding the training instances that are similar to it, and returning the most frequent class among these instances. The classifier was implemented using Weka's data mining API, and is available for download. Its performance. according to accuracy and speed metrics, compares relatively well with that of well-established classifiers such as nearest neighbor models or support vector machines. For this reason, the similarity classifier can become a useful instrument in a data mining practitioner's tool set.

Previous work has shown that it is advantageous to optimize general Euclidean distances (GED). In this paper, data transformations are optimized instead. This is equivalent to searching for GEDs, but can be applied to any learning algorithm, even if it does not use distances explicitly. Two optimization techniques have been used: a simple Local Search (LS) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES is an advanced evolutionary method for optimization in difficult continuous domains. Both diagonal and complete matrices have been considered. Results show that in general, complete matrices found by CMA-ES either outperform or match both Local Search, and the classifier working on the original untransformed data.

One of the most popular approaches to building sparse SVMs is to select a small subset of training samples and employ them as the support vectors. In this paper, we explain that selecting the support vectors is equivalent to selecting a number of columns from the kernel matrix, and is equivalent to selecting a subset of features in the feature selection domain. Hence, we propose to use an effective feature selection algorithm, namely the Minimum Redundancy - Maximum Relevance (MRMR) algorithm to solve the support vector selection problem. MRMR algorithm was then compared to two existing methods, namely back-fitting (BF) and pre-fitting (PF) algorithms. Preliminary results showed that MRMR generally outperformed BF algorithm while it was inferior to PF algorithm, in terms of generalization performance. However. the MRMR approach was extremely efficient and significantly faster than the two compared algorithms.

Such techniques provide more meaningful representations, useful for better understanding of a problem at hand, than by looking only at the data itself. Although abundant expert knowledge exists in many areas where unlabelled data is examined, such knowledge is rarely incorporated into automatic analysis. Incorporation of expert, knowledge is frequently a matter of combining multiple data sources front disparate hypothetical spaces. In cases where such spaces belong to different, data types, this task becomes even more challenging. In this paper we present a novel immune-inspired method that enables the fusion of such disparate types of data. for a specific set of problems. We show that our method provides a better visual understanding of only hypothetical space with the help of data from another hypothetical space. We believe that, our model has implications for the field of exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery.

Encryption and authentication are useless if an attacker has entered the system. Thus, a second line of defense known as Intrusion Detection Must be added in order to detect and eliminate attacks. In the recent past, various solutions for detecting intrusions have been proposed. Most of them are able to detect only a limited number of attacks. The solutions that deploy machine learning techniques exhibit higher level of flexibility and adaptability. Yet, these techniques consume significant power and computational resources. In this work we propose to implement unsupervised algorithms (genetic algorithm and self-organized maps) for detecting intrusions using the energy-efficient SORU architecture. Separate detectors are further organized in a distributed system using the idea of immune system organization. Our solution offers many benefits: ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability and energy efficiency. First testing results obtained in real environment demonstrate its high potential.

Thus they are much attractive to be used as dedicated hardware in many fields such as in machine learning. In particular, the implementation of neural networks (NNs) in GPUs can decrease enormously the long training times during the learning process. In this paper, we describe a parallel implementation of the Multiple Back-Propagation (MBP) algorithm and present, the results obtained when running the algorithm on two well-known benchmarks. We show that for both classification and regression problems our implementation reduces the computational cost when compared with the standalone CPU version.

In this paper we take a detailed look at the problem of modeling and optimization of network computing systems for parallel decision tree induction methods. Firstly, we present a comprehensive discussion Oil mentioned induction methods with a special focus on their parallel versions. Next, we propose a generic optimization model of a network computing system that can be used for distributed implementation of parallel decision trees. To illustrate our work we provide results of numerical experiments showing that the distributed approach enables significant improvement of the system throughput.

Thermal insulation standards are now contractual obligations in new buildings, although poor energy efficiency is often a defining characteristic of buildings built before the introduction of those standards. Lighting, Occupancy, set point temperature profiles, air conditioning and ventilation services all increase the complexity of measuring insulation efficiency. The identification of thermal insulation failure can help to reduce energy consumption in heating systems. Conventional methods can be greatly improved through the application of hybridized machine learning techniques to detect thermal insulation failures when a building is in operation. A three-step procedure is proposed in this paper that begins by considering the local building and heating system regulations as well as the specific features of the climate zone. Firstly, the dynamic thermal performance of different variables is specifically modelled, for each building type and climate zone. Secondly, Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning is used to extract the relevant features. Finally, neural projections and identification techniques are applied, in order to detect fluctuations in room temperatures and, in consequence, thermal insulation failures. The reliability of the proposed method is validated in three winter zone C cities in Spain. Although a great deal of further research remains to be done in this field, the proposed system is expected to Outperform conventional methods described in Spanish building codes that are used to calculate energetic profiles in domestic and residential buildings.

In spite of the advances achieved since then, the use of ubiquitous spaces is not yet widespread in home environments, due to the difficulty in using context information and artificial intelligence algorithms. This work combines ontologies and machine learning techniques to infer environmental user preferences automatically. These preferences will allow the development of context-aware applications for the home environment that will adjust it proactively, depending on user preferences. These kinds of applications will contribute to the development of the ambient-assisted living concept and therefore to the improvement of the quality of life.

Smart environments are termed "smart" due to pro-active user assistance: User behavior is anticipated by an "intention analysis" software employing machine learning algorithms. In this paper we present a tool that facilitates the development; of intention analysis by guiding the domain expert through the development process. Initially, the tool allows the user-centered design of HCl task models, without taking care of implementation details. Subsequently annotated task models are transformed into low level models, which are applied within the machine learning inference engine. We support; both evaluation at early and later development stages. At early stages we evaluate designed models with expert-generated scenarios to simulate artificial low level sensor data. At later stages we evaluate a physical environment on the basis of real sensor data. A comparison between observed behavior and defined expectation allows identifying usability issues. A close connection between development and evaluation should further ensure rapid software changes and reevaluation to access improvements.

In all these diseases, severe disturbances of gait and gait initiation are frequently reported. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning and statistical approaches to support the discrimination of these three diseases based on gait analysis. A total of three supervised classification methods, namely support vector machine, KStar and Random Forest, were evaluated on a publicly-available gait dataset. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to apply computational classification techniques in characterise these three diseases with the features extracted from gait cycles. Results obtained show that using selected 4 features based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy strategy can achieve reasonably high classification accuracy while 5 features can achieve the best performance. The continual increase of the number of features does not significantly improve classification performance.

Teaching Computers to Conduct Spoken Interviews: Breaking the Realtime Barrier with Learning	INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents	SEP 14-16, 2009	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Sci Res, SenterNoven, COST 2102, ESF Res Network, Non Verbal Commun, City Amsterdam		Dialogue; Realtime; Turntaking; Human-Computer Interaction; Natural Communication; Machine Learning; Prosody	TURN-TAKING; SMOOTH	Several challenges remain in the effort to build software capable of conducting realtime dialogue with people. Part of the problem has been a lack of realtime flexibility, especially with regards to turntaking. We have built a system that can adapt its turntaking behavior in natural dialogue, learning to minimize unwanted interruptions and "awkward silences". The system learns this dynamically during the interaction in less than 30 turns, without special training sessions. Here we describe the system and its performance when interacting with people in the role of an interviewer. A prior evaluation of the system included 10 interactions with a single artificial agent (a non-learning version of itself); the new data consists of 10 interaction sessions with 10 different humans. Results show performance to be close to a human's in natural, polite dialogue, with 20% of the turn transitions taking place in under 300 msecs and 60% under 500 msecs. The system works in real-world settings, achieving robust learning in spite of noisy data. The modularity of the architecture gives it significant potential for extensions beyond the interview scenario described here.

J	El-Halees, A				El-Halees, Alaa			Filtering Spam E-Mail from Mixed Arabic and English Messages: A Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Anti-spam filtering; machine learning techniques; text data mining		Spam is one of the main problems in emails communications. As the volume of non-english language spam increases, little work is done in this area. For example, in Arab world users receive spam written mostly in arabic, english or mixed Arabic and english. To filter this kind of messages, this research applied several machine learning techniques. Many researchers have used machine learning techniques to filter spam email messages. This study compared six supervised machine learning classifiers which are maximum entropy, decision trees, artificial neural nets, naive bayes, support system machines and k-nearest neighbor. The experiments suggested that words in Arabic messages should be stemmed before applying classifier. In addition, in most cases, experiments showed that classifiers using feature selection techniques can achieve comparable or better performance than filters do not used them.

Several techniques, which have been applied for static Security Assessment .A Decision Tree types comparison for the purpose of static security assessment classification is discussed and the comparison results from these methods on operating point are presented. Decision Tree examines whether the power system is secured under steady-state operating conditions.DT gauges the bus voltages and the line flow conditions. Using minimum number of cases from the available large number of contingencies in terms of their impact on the system security is the methodology that has been developed. Newton Raphson load flow analysis method is used for training and test data. The input variables to the network are loadings of the lines and the voltage magnitude of the load buses. The algorithms are initially tested on the 5 IEEE bus systems. The results obtained indicate that DT method is comparable in accuracy and computational time to the Newton Raphson load flow method	[Saeh, I.

A grasp of emotions in songs might be a great help for us to effectively discover music. In this paper, we aimed at automatically classifying moods of songs based on lyrics and metadata, and proposed several methods for supervised learning of classifiers. In future, we plan to use automatically identified moods of songs as metadata in our music search engine. Mood categories in a famous contest about Audio Music Mood Classification (MIREX 2007) are applied for our system. The training data is collected from a LiveJournal blog site in which each blog entry is tagged with a mood and a song. Then three kinds of machine learning algorithms are applied for training classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes and Graph-based methods.

In order to work efficiently, the location of mobile users needs to be predicted and properly exploited by mobile applications. We propose a spatial context model, which deals with the location prediction of mobile users. Such model is used for the classification of the users' trajectories through Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Predicting spatial context is treated through supervised learning. We evaluate our model in terms of prediction accuracy w.r.t. specific prediction parameters. The proposed model is also compared with other ML algorithms for location prediction. Our findings are very promising for the efficient operation of mobile context-aware applications.

This problem limited the applications of standard evolutionary computation methods in real-world engineering. A cooperative optimization algorithm (GP-PSO) based on Gaussian process (GP) machine learning and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented in this paper for solving computationally expensive optimization problem. Gaussian process is used to predict the most promising solutions before searching the global optimum solution using PSO during each iteration step. The study result indicates GP-PSO algorithm clearly outperforms standard PSO algorithm with much less fitness evaluations on benchmark functions. The result of application to a real-world engineering problem also suggests that the proposed optimization framework is capable of solving computationally expensive optimization problem effectively.

By simulating the mechanisms of biological immune system such as immune memory, clone selection and self-adaptation, AICSA achieves the dynamic control of evolution process, which realizes global optimal computing combined with the local searching. Compared with traditional evolutionary algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only has higher convergence rate and better searching ability, but also can avoid prematurity and degeneration phenomenon. The experimental results show that feature selection for machine learning is necessary, and AICSA can efficiently reduce the number of features while improving the performance of network fault diagnosis based on SVM.

Owing to tedious and intensive nature of optimal disassembly planning, expert systems which ease the decision making process are becoming much more prevalent. This paper discusses one such system where a machine learning approach based on a disassembly Petri net (DPN) and a hybrid Bayesian network (HBN) is used. In particular, this method models the disassembly process and predicts the outcome of each disassembly action by examining the probabilistic relationships between the different aspects of the disassembly process. An overall view of the disassembly process and a simple, specific case are provided to illustrate the operation of this expert system.	[Grochowski, D.

Especially, this paper completed a dual classified coordination between user attribute classification and SVM user classification using mapping matrix. In our SVM based user navigation, we first regard User interest Set as input, then apply the SVM classifier to sort out users on the basis of their interests or attributes, and what is more, combine the merit that user attributes classification promise better service being offered to users whose using frequency is not high, a dual-classified collaborating navigation between user attribute classification, and SVM user classification by using mapping matrix is being proposed. We use the mapping method to mix their advantages of common classification methods which lead them to collaborate and to provide the new and old custom with navigation. Using Classification T to statistic the latest and the most frequently used demands of each user type, then applying a mapping from user attribute class (A) to user interest class (T) with the purpose to judge what kind of user type in Classification T has the most possibility the user might belong, to and then to provide the user with the latest services according to their interests. From the experiments, the fitting degree of A and T classification and the true personality of users are derived by tracking the demand of 50 users. We can see that with the increase of frequency in use, the matching degree between Users Attribute Classification (A) and real types of user are essentially the same, and User Personalized Classification (T) is gradually reaching saturation. Regarding the certain point as a dividing line, after using classification mapping, the user's true extent of matching has a broader applicability. SVM have excellent generalization performance and minimum structural risk, which is a good machine learning method that elicits objective regulation from complex statistical dates. So we have improved the user model of active service navigation system and user navigation combined with User Attribute Classification A and SVM User Interest Classification T by mapping matrix. Classification A and T using mapping matrix to bounding them can satisfy the requirement of a different user. The records in the Classified Statistic Library can provide feedback date and research information for further study between a personalized user and user attribute.

The method utilises concept lattices in that certain formal concepts of the concept lattice associated to input data are used as nodes of the decision tree constructed from the data. The concept lattice provides global information about natural clusters in the input data, which we use for selection of splitting attributes. The usage of such global information is the main novelty of our approach. Experimental evaluation indicates good performance of our method.

Large knowledge bases such as DBpedia, OpenCyc, GovTrack, and others are emerging and are freely available as Linked Data and SPARQL endpoints. Exploring and analysing such knowledge bases is a significant hurdle for Semantic Web research and practice. As one possible direction for tackling this problem, the authors present an approach for obtaining complex class descriptions from objects in knowledge bases by using Machine Learning techniques. They describe in detail how we leverage existing techniques to achieve scalability on large knowledge bases available as SPARQL endpoints or Linked Data. Their algorithms are made available in the open source DL-Learner project and we present several real-life scenarios in which they can be used by Semantic Web applications.

A Chinese web textual mining system is developed to predict the daily stock price fluctuation, which aim to manage web-based financial bulletin news or report, and to integrate web mining, Chinese information processing, and support vector machines learning technology. The experimental result shows that this method can produce good precision when applied to Chinese stock market, which can lead to further study on financial market short-term behavior.

Finding a knowledge model may require to join all the data sources and to run a machine learning algorithm on the joint set. We present an alternative based on a Multi Agent System (MAS): an agent mines one data source in order to extract a local theory (knowledge model) and then merges it with the previous MAS theory using a knowledge fusion technique. This way, we obtain a global theory that summarizes the distributed knowledge without spending resources and time in joining data sources. New experiments have been executed including statistical significance analysis. The results show that, as a result of knowledge fusion, the accuracy of initial theories is significantly improved as well as the accuracy of the monolithic solution.

A positive definite matrix called kernel matrix is used to represent the similarities between examples. Positive definiteness assures that the examples are embedded in an Euclidean space. When a positive definite matrix is learned from data, one has to design an update rule that maintains the positive definiteness. Our update rule, called matrix exponentiated gradient update, is motivated by the quantum relative entropy. Notably, the relative entropy is an instance of Bregman divergences, which are asymmetric distance measures specifying theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. Using the calculus commonly used in quantum physics, we prove an upperbound of the generalization error of online learning.

(a) Learning of the Langevin phase model We estimated the parameters of the Langevin phase equation, i.e. , a phase response curve and the intensity of white noise from physiological data measured in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (b) Test of the estimated model. We verified whether a Fokker-Planck equation derived from the Langevin phase equation with the estimated parameters could capture the stochastic oscillatory behavior of the same neurons disturbed by periodic perturbations The estimated model could predict the neural behavior, so we can say that the Langevin phase equation is an efficient model for oscillating neurons	[Ota, Keisuke; Tsunoda, Takamasa; Aonishi, Toru] Tokyo Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227, Japan	Ota, K (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227, Japan.

This suggests that studying human cognition may be a good way to develop better learning algorithms, as well as providing basic insights into how the human mind works. However, in order for ideas to flow easily from cognitive science to computer science and vice versa, we need a common framework for describing human and machine learning. I will summarize recent work exploring the hypothesis that probabilistic models of cognition, which view learning as a form of statistical inference, provide such a framework, including results that illustrate how novel ideas from statistics can inform cognitive science. Specifically, I will talk about how probabilistic models can be used to identify the assumptions of learners, learn at different levels of abstraction, and link the inductive biases of individuals to cultural universals.

However the necessity of interaction makes experimental work into the simulation of infant speech acquisition difficult because of the technical complexity of building real-time embodied systems. In this paper we present KLAIR: a software toolkit for building simulations of spoken language acquisition through interactions with a virtual infant. The main part of KLAIR is a sensori-motor server that supplies a client machine learning application with a virtual infant on screen that can see, hear and speak. By encapsulating the real-time complexities of audio and video processing within a server that will run on a modern PC, we hope that KLAIR will encourage and facilitate more experimental research into spoken language acquisition through interaction.

Speech recognition has established that pauses affect vowel duration in preceding words. Based on the observation that complex vowels occur at rhythmic junctures in poetry, we run significance tests on a sample of transcribed, contemporary British English speech and find a statistically significant correlation between complex vowels and phrase breaks. The experiment depends on automatic text annotation via ProPOSEL, a prosody and part-of-speech English lexicon.

Experiments have shown that infants retain large amounts of very detailed episodic information about the speech they perceive (e.g. [1]). This weakly justifies the fact that some algorithms attempting to model the process of vocabulary acquisition computationally process large amounts of speech data in batch. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a technique that is particularly successful in data mining but can also be applied to vocabulary acquisition (e.g. [2]), is such an algorithm. In this paper, we will integrate an adaptive variant of NMF into a computational framework for vocabulary acquisition, foregoing the need for long term storage of speech inputs, and experimentally show its accuracy matches that of the original batch algorithm.

The utility of sub-turn features has been less explored, due to the complications introduced by associating a variable number of sub-turn units with a single turn-level classification. We present and evaluate several voting methods for using word-level pitch and energy features to classify turn-level user uncertainty in spoken dialogue data. Our results show that when linguistic knowledge regarding prosody and word position is introduced into a word-level voting model, classification accuracy is significantly improved compared to the use of both turn-level and uninformed word-level models.

Using the WEKA machine learning software [I], classifiers were trained to determine for each syllable in a speech database of a male speaker its pitch accent and its boundary tone. Pitch accents and boundaries are according to the GToBI(S) dialect, with slight modifications. Classification was based on 35 attributes involving PaIntE F0 parametrization [2] and normalized phone durations, but also some phonological information as well as higher-linguistic information. Several classification algorithms yield results of approx. 78% accuracy on the word level for pitch accents, and approx. 88% accuracy on the word level for phrase boundaries, which compare very well to results of other studies. The classifiers generalize to similar data of a female speaker in that they perform equally well as classifiers trained directly on the female data.

Low-Cost Call Type Classification for Contact Center Calls Using Partial Transcripts	INTERSPEECH 2009: 10TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION 2009, VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	10th INTERSPEECH 2009 Conference	SEP 06-10, 2009	Brighton, ENGLAND	Int Speech Commun Assoc		Call Type Classification; Contact Center Call Analysis; Speech Analytics; Machine Learning	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Call type classification and topic classification for contact center calls using automatically generated transcripts is not yet widely available mainly due to the high cost and low accuracy of call-center grade automatic speech transcription. To address these challenges, we examine if using only partial conversations yields accuracy comparable to using the entire customer-agent conversations. We exploit two interesting characteristics of call center calls. First, contact center calls are highly scripted following prescribed steps, and the customers problem or request (i.e., the determinant of the call type) is typically stated in the beginning of a call. Thus, using only the beginning of calls may be sufficient to determine the call type. Second, agents often more clearly repeat or rephrase what customers said, thus it may be sufficient to process only agents' speech. Our experiments with 1,677 customer calls show that two partial transcripts comprising only the agents utterances and the first 40 speaker turns actually produce slightly higher classification accuracy than a transcript set comprising the entire conversations. In addition, using partial conversations can significantly reduce the cost for speech transcription.

Generally, for the same expression, the shorter the rules are, the more effectively the system performances. Considering of this, this paper provides a new heuristic algorithm named "Short First Extraction(SFE)" based on the classical rough set theory, for rules generation. A standard named "All Attribute in Rules' Length(AARL)" to compare the rules' ability is also provided. Our experiments is based on the datasets provided by UCI machine learning repository, such as iris datasets, new-thyroid dataset and yellow-small(balloons) dataset. The experiments' results indicate that "SFE" always has better performance than JohnsonReducer, genetic reducer and Holte's 1R reducer: it always generates less rules and has lower "AARU' than its competitors. Our "SFE" algorithm also has another property which may be useful: the rules generated by "SFE" is a covering but not a partition of the information system, and it may lead us to a new direction of rules generating research.

NRDMA constructs suitable information granules (IGs) by fuzzy ART, and then hierarchical clustering analysis is employed to produce mapping rules from IGs to final classes. When new inputted data clustered to the IGs by continue on-line learning of fuzzy ART, the final class can soon be decided by the mapping rules.

Recently it is treated as a common solution for modeling language variability. Textual entailment captures a broad range of semantic oriented inferences needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (TE), text summarization and Machine Translation (NIT). Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as one of the fundamental problems in those natural language processing applications has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a new method for textual entailment measure which is based on lexical, shallow syntactic analysis combined with fuzzy set theory.

This situation can be mitigated if practical forms of sharing of existing datasets are enabled among the research community. In this paper we address two main problems. First, we propose a standard for the representation of smart space datasets, based on a careful examination of several existing data. The standard specification should allow researchers to effortlessly position their existing or future datasets for sharing. We briefly present the specifications. Second, to enable higher utility of shared datasets, we propose algorithms and tools that can extend a shared dataset into a similar set of a slightly customized pervasive space (e.g., an original space with additional sensors/actuators or behaviors). Specifically, we propose the use of machine learning algorithms to generate the additional patterns of events and to automatically integrate them into the original shared dataset.

A good Packet scheduling discipline allows to achieve QoS differentiation and to optimize the queuing delay. In a dynamically changing environment this discipline should be also adaptive to the new traffic conditions. We model this problem as a multi-agent system which consists of a whole of autonomous learning agents that interact with the environment. We define the learning problem as a decentralized process using a general mathematical framework, namely Markovian Decision Processes which are an effective tool in the modelling of the decision-making in uncertain dynamic environments. Coordination between agents occurs through communication governed by an ant colony model.

Nowadays port based and payload based classification methods have become inadequate as many applications use dynamically allocated port numbers, masquerade to be another application by using some standard port number or use encryption to avoid detection. Recent studies propose an alternative technique for network traffic classification utilizing statistical characteristics of network flows in classification. Most of these studies focus on classifying flows when flows have finished. This kind of classification is not sufficient for quality of service management purposes, therefore network flows have to be classified as early as possible. This paper introduces a two-phased classification method which is capable of classifying network flows early in the connection and providing a secondary classification phase to improve the classification accuracy. A simple K-Means clustering technique is utilized in both classification phases. The classifier was trained and evaluated using manually generated training and evaluation datasets. According to the results two-phased classifier classified 97.8 % of target applications correctly and was able to detect untrained application flows at high precision. Also individual classification phases produced high overall accuracies and precise detections of unknown traffic.

Although the Internet has a male-dominated history, more and more women have started to share their concerns and express opinions through online discussion boards and Web forums. This paper presents an automated approach to gender difference analysis of political Web forums. The approach uses rich textual feature representation and machine learning techniques to examine the online gender differences between female and male participants on political Web forums by analyzing writing styles and topics of interest. The results of gender difference analysis performed on a large and long-standing international Islamic women's political forum are presented, showing that female and male participants have significantly different topics of interest.

Most statistical machine learning techniques rely on the availability of a large labeled corpus for building robust models for prediction and classification. In this paper we present a Higher Order Collective Classifier (HOCC) based on Higher Order Learning, a statistical machine learning technique that leverages latent information present in co-occurrences of items across records. These techniques violate the IID assumption that underlies most statistical machine learning techniques and have in prior work outperformed first order techniques in the presence of very limited data. We present results of applying HOCC to two different network data sets, first for detection and classification of anomalies in a Border Gateway Protocol dataset and second for building models of users from Network File System calls to perform masquerade detection. The precision of our system has been shown to be 30% better than the standard Naive Bayes technique for masquerade detection. These results indicate that HOCC can successfully model a variety of network events and can be applied to solve difficult problems in security using the general framework proposed.

At most times, when a user is reading a news story, she would like to know "what happened before this?" or "how things progressed after this incident?" In this paper, we present a novel real-time yet simple method to detect and track new events related to violence and terrorism in news streams through their life over a time line. We do this by first extracting signature of the event, at microscopic level rather than topic or macroscopic level, and then tracking and linking this event with mentions of same event signature in other incoming news articles. There by forming a thread that links all the news articles that describe this specific event, with no training data used or machine learning algorithms employed. We also present our experimental evaluations conducted with Document Understand Conference (DUC) datasets that validate our observations and methodology.

It aims at developing behavioral models of groups and analyzing the impact of culture factors on group behavior using computational methods. Machine learning methods in particular classification, play a central role in such applications. In cultural modeling, it is expected that classifiers yield good performance. However, the performance of standard classifiers is often severely hindered in practice due to the imbalanced distribution of class in cultural data. In this paper, we identify class imbalance problem in cultural modeling domain. To handle the problem, we propose a user involved solution employing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for classification algorithms with sampling approaches.

However, many important application domains, including meshing, clustering, simulation, and machine learning, have very different algorithmic foundations: they require building, computing with, and modifying large sparse graphs. In the parallel programming literature, these types of applications are usually classified as irregular applications, and relatively little attention has been paid to them. To study and understand the patterns of parallelism and locality in sparse graph computations better, we are in the process of building the Lonestar benchmark suite. In this paper, we characterize the first five programs from this suite, which target domains like data mining, survey propagation, and design automation. We show that even such irregular applications often expose large amounts of parallelism in the form of amorphous data-parallelism. Our speedup numbers demonstrate that this new type of parallelism can successfully be exploited on modern multi-core machines.

Machine Learning Based Online Performance Prediction for Runtime Parallelization and Task Scheduling	ISPASS 2009: IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE	IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software-ISPASS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software	APR 26-28, 2009	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Performance Prediction; Artificial Neural Networks; Automatic Task Scheduling; Scripting Languages		With the emerging many-core paradigm, parallel programming must extend beyond its traditional realm of scientific applications. Converting existing sequential applications as well as developing next-generation software requires assistance from hardware, compilers and runtime systems to exploit parallelism transparently within applications. These systems must decompose applications into tasks that can be executed in parallel and then schedule those tasks to minimize load imbalance. However, many systems lack a priori knowledge about the execution time of all tasks to perform effective load balancing with low scheduling overhead. In this paper, we approach this fundamental problem using machine learning techniques first to generate performance models for all tasks and then applying those models to perform automatic performance prediction across program executions. We also extend an existing scheduling algorithm to use generated task cost estimates for online task partitioning and scheduling. We implement the above techniques in the pR framework, which transparently parallelizes scripts in the popular R language, and evaluate their performance and overhead with both a real-world application and a large number of synthetic representative test scripts. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly improves task partitioning and scheduling, with maximum improvements of 21.8%, 40.3% and 22.1% and average improvements of 15.9%, 16.9% and 4.2% for LMM (a real R application) and synthetic test cases with independent and dependent tasks, respectively.

The skills provide different ways of combining these sensory-motor functions to achieve the desired task. The specified skills are assumed to be complementary and to cover different situations.

Identifying the P2P traffic and understanding their behavior is an important field. Some port, payload and transport layer feature based methods were proposed. P2P traffic identification methods by examining user payload or well-defined port numbers no longer adapt to current P2P applications. In recent years, some scholars do researches on traffic classification by using Machine Learning. However, previous researches are almost on the flow level. In this paper, we develop a new method of P2P traffic identification based on Support Vector Machine by analyzing packet length, remote hosts' discreteness, connection responded success rate and the ratio of IP and port at the host level without relying on the port numbers and packet payload. Finally, the experiment results indicate that this approach can effectively identify P2P applications.

These libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that fit within the theme of the library. We show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text classification techniques and topic modeling. Our models address two significant challenges in making scope judgments: only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available, and the topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classification problems. To meet these challenges, our models combine support vector machine learners optimized to different performance metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical topic models. Our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in DLESE from resources that don't with an accuracy of around 70%. We see these models as the first steps towards increasing the scalability of digital libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them.

But different authors may share the same names, either as full names or as initials and last names (complete name change examples are not considered here). In such a case, the user would like the digital library to differentiate among these authors. Name disambiguation can help in many cases; one being a user in a search of all articles written by a particular author. Disambiguation also enables better bibliometric analysis by allowing a more accurate counting and grouping of publications and citations. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for pair-wise disambiguation of author names based on a machine learning classification algorithm, random forests. We define a set of similarity profile features to assist in author disambiguation. Our experiments on the Medline database show that the random forest model outperforms other previously proposed techniques such as those using support-vector machines (SVM). In addition, we demonstrate that the variable importance produced by the random forest model can be used in feature selection with little degradation in the disambiguation accuracy. In particular, the inverse document frequency of author last name and the middle name's similarity alone achieves an accuracy of almost 90%.	[Treeratpituk, Pucktada; Giles, C.

And bibliographic data extraction has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic extraction of bibliographic data in Chinese electronic book and propose a tool called CEBBIP. for the task, which includes three main systems: data preprocessing, data parsing and data postprocessing. In the data preprocessing system, the tool adopts a rules-based method to locate citation data in a book and to segment citation data into citation strings of individual referencing literature. And a learning-based approach, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), is employed to parse citation strings in the data parsing system. Finally, the tool takes advantage of document intrinsic local format consistency to enhance citation data segmentation and parsing through clustering techniques. CEBBIP has been used in a commercial E-book production system. Experimental results show that CEBBIP's precision rate is very high. More specially, adopting the document intrinsic local format consistency obviously improves the citation data segmenting and parsing accuracy.

This is specially true for fields such as Computer Science and Electric Engineering, where conference publications are crucial. However, the majority of the existing approaches for assessing the quality of publication venues has been proposed for journals. In this paper, we characterize a large number of features that can be used as criteria to assess the quality of scientific conferences and study how these several features can be automatically combined by means of machine learning techniques to effectively perform this task. Within the features studied are citations, submission and acceptance rates, tradition of the conference, and reputation of the program committee members. Among our several findings, we can cite that: (1) separating high quality conferences from medium and low quality ones can be performed quite effectively, but separating the last two types is a much harder task; and (2) citation features followed by those associated with the tradition of the conference are the most important ones for the task.

In digital libraries they have the potential to be used as a support tool for traditional information retrieval functions. Among the major recommendation algorithms, the successful collaborative filtering (CF) methods explore the use of user-item interactions to infer user interests. Based on the finding that transitive user-item associations can alleviate the data sparsity problem in CF, multiple heuristic algorithms were designed to take advantage of the user-item interaction networks with both direct and indirect interactions. However, the use of such graph representation was still limited, in learning-based algorithms. In this paper, we propose a graph kernel-based recommendation framework. For each user-item pair, we inspect its associative interaction graph (AIG) that contains the users, items, and interactions n steps away from the pair. We design a novel graph kernel to capture the AIG structures and use them to predict possible user-item interactions. The framework demonstrates improved performance on an online bookstore dataset, especially when a large number of suggestions are needed.

We demonstrate how identifying concrete factors of quality for web-based educational resources can make machine learning approaches to automating quality characterization tractable. Using data from several previous studies of quality, we gathered a set of key dimensions and indicators of quality that were commonly identified by educators. We then performed a mixed-method study of digital library curation experts, showing that our characterization of quality captured the subjective processes used by the experts when assessing resource quality for classroom use. Using key indicators of quality selected from a statistical analysis of our expert study data, we developed a set of annotation guidelines and annotated a corpus of 1000 digital resources for the presence or absence of these key quality indicators. Agreement among annotators was high, and initial machine learning models trained from this corpus were able to identify some indicators of quality with as much as an 18% improvement over the baseline.

Moreover, this is happening with the direct collaborative, participation of people., Wikipedia is a great example. It is an enormous repository of information with free access and edition, created by the community in a collaborative manner. However, this large amount of information, made available democratically and virtually without any control, raises questions about its relative quality. In this work we explore a significant number of quality indicators, some of them proposed by us and used here for the first, time, and study I,heir capability to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to combine these quality indicators into one single assessment judgment. Through experiments, we show that the most important quality indicators are the easiest ones to extract, namely, textual features related to length, structure and style. We were also able to determine which indicators did not contribute significantly to the quality assessment. These were, coincidentally, the most complex features, such as those based on link analysis.

To diversify teaching and to improve effects in learning, many researchers strongly advocate cooperative learning and come out many essays in the field. When it comes to grouping, snaking group members help others, learning each other, and making students progressed in cooperative learning are prospective subjects. This investigation features collecting on-line learning processes and personal thinking styles of learners to select main characteristics influenced grouping by Genetic Algorithm. We also predict optimal grouping way which decided by Support Vector Machine, one of Machine Learning. Finding best grouping model from varied characteristics helps teacher group easily and further the whole learning results in cooperative learning.

There are two factors (i.e. feature selection and parameter determination) of classification problems will mainly discuss in this study. The objectives of feature selection are to reduce number of features and remove irrelevant, noisy and redundant data. Besides, the parameter optimization for training can improve classification performance. Hence, the optimal feature subset and kernel parameter are applied to SVM classifier for reducing the computational time in an acceptable classification accuracy. Furthermore, the classification accuracy is increased. The different classes and types in UC1 machine learning repository is used to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed CSO+SVM and GA+SVM methods..

In order to develop useful technologies and a subsequent industry around smart environments, we need to proceed in a principled manner. This paper suggests that human activity can be expressed in a language. This is a special language with its own phonemes, its own morphemes (words) and its own syntax and it can be learned using machine learning techniques applied to gargantuan amounts of data collected by sensor networks. Developing such languages will create bridges between Ambient Intelligence and other disciplines. It will also provide a hierarchical structure that can lead to a successful industry.

Horse breed discrimination using machine learning methods	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						breed discrimination; genetic diversity; horse breeds; machine learning algorithms; microsatellite		Genetic relationships and population structure of 8 horse breeds in the Czech and Slovak Republics were investigated using classification methods for breed discrimination. To demonstrate genetic differences among these breeds, we used genetic information - genotype data of microsatellite markers and classification algorithms - to perform a probabilistic prediction of an individual's breed. In total, 932 unrelated animals were genotyped for 17 microsatellite markers recommended by the ISAG for parentage testing (AHT4, AHT5, ASB2, HMS3, HMS6, HMS7,HTG4, HTG10, VHL20, HTG6, HMS2, HTG7, ASB17, ASB23, CA425, HMS1, LEX3). Algorithms of classification methods - J48 (decision trees); Naive Bayes, Bayes Net (probability predictors); IB1, IB5 (instance-based machine learning methods); and JRip (decision rules)- were used for analysis of their classification performance and of results of classification on this genotype dataset. Selected classification methods (Naive Bayes, Bayes Net, IB1), based on machine learning and principles of artificial intelligence, appear usable for these tasks.

Assessing naive Bayes as a method for screening credit applicants	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						credit scorecard; credit scoring; credit risk; naive Bayes; retail banking	COMPARING CLASSIFIERS	The naive Bayes rule (NBR) is a popular and often highly effective technique for constructing classification rules. This study examines the effectiveness of NBR as a method for constructing classification rules (credit scorecards) in the context of screening credit applicants (credit scoring). For this purpose, the study uses two real-world credit scoring data sets to benchmark NBR against linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression analysis, k-nearest neighbours, classification trees and neural networks. Of the two aforementioned data sets, the first one is taken from a major Greek bank whereas the second one is the Australian Credit Approval data set taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/similar to mlearn/MLRepository.html). The predictive ability of scorecards is measured by the total percentage of correctly classified cases, the Gini coefficient and the bad rate amongst accepts. In each of the data sets, NBR is found to have a lower predictive ability than some of the other five methods under all measures used. Reasons that may negatively affect the predictive ability of NBR relative to that of alternative methods in the context of credit scoring are examined.	[Antonakis, A. C.; Sfakianakis, M.

Complex Question Answering: Unsupervised Learning Approaches and Experiments	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information. In this paper, we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. We compare the results of these approaches. Our experiments show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and EM performs better than K-means. However, the performance of these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these features. In order to measure the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic) for each of the document sentences. We use a local search technique to learn the weights of the features. To the best of our knowledge, no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntactic/ semantic information for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences and the document sentences in order to generate query-focused summaries (or answers to complex questions). For each of our methods of generating summaries (i.e. empirical, K-means and EM) we show the effects of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over the bag-of-words (BOW) features.

Survival prediction is often accomplished by the TNM system that involves only three factors: tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. This prediction from the TNM has been limited, because other potential prognostic factors are not used in the system. Based on availability of large cancer datasets, it is possible to establish powerful prediction systems by using machine learning procedures and statistical methods. In this paper, we present an ensemble clustering-based approach to develop prognostic systems of cancer patients. Our method starts with grouping combinations that are formed using levels of factors recorded in the data. The dissimilarity measure between combinations is obtained through a sequence of data partitions produced by multiple use of PAM algorithm. This dissimilarity measure is then used with a hierarchical clustering method in order to find clusters of combinations. Prediction of survival is made simply by using the survival function derived from each cluster. Our approach admits multiple factors and provides a practical and useful tool in outcome prediction of cancer patients. A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for lung cancer patients. Copyright (C) 2009 Dechang Chen et al.

Recent advances in radiotherapy and biotechnology provide new opportunities and challenges for predicting radiation-induced toxicities, particularly radiation pneumonitis (RP), in lung cancer patients. In this work, we utilize datamining methods based on machine learning to build a predictive model of lung injury by retrospective analysis of treatment planning archives. In addition, biomarkers for this model are extracted from a prospective clinical trial that collects blood serum samples at multiple time points. We utilize a 3-way proteomics methodology to screen for differentially expressed proteins that are related to RP. Our preliminary results demonstrate that kernel methods can capture nonlinear dose-volume interactions, but fail to address missing biological factors. Our proteomics strategy yielded promising protein candidates, but their role in RP as well as their interactions with dose-volume metrics remain to be determined. Copyright (C) 2009 Sarah J.

Nevertheless, it is generally difficult, if not impossible, to identify the characteristic(s) that make a rule produce a particular pattern. Discovering rules that produce spatial patterns that a human being would find "similar" to another given pattern is a very important task, given its numerous possible applications in many complex systems models. In this paper, we propose a general framework to accomplish this task, based on a combination of Machine Learning strategies including Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks. This framework is tested on a 3-values, 6-neighbors, k-totalistic cellular automata rule called the "burning paper" rule. Results are encouraging and should pave the way for the use of our framework in real-life complex systems models.

In this study we explore the possibilities of using docking and scoring experiments on cytochrome P450 1A2. Three different questions have been addressed: 1. Binding orientations and conformations were successfully predicted for various substrates. 2. A virtual screen was performed with satisfying enrichment rates. 3. A classification of individual compounds into active and inactive was performed. It was found that while docking can be used successfully to address the first two questions, it seems to be more difficult to perform the classification. Different scoring functions were included, and the well-characterized water molecule in the active site was included in various ways. Results are compared to experimental data and earlier classification data using machine learning methods. The possibilities and limitations of using structure-based drug design tools for cytochrome P450 1A2 come to light and are discussed.	[Vasanthanathan, Poongavanam; Hritz, Jozef; Vermeulen, Nico P.

Inductive Transfer of Knowledge: Application of Multi-Task Learning and Feature Net Approaches to Model Tissue-Air Partition Coefficients	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							ASSOCIATIVE NEURAL NETWORKS; STRUCTURE-PROPERTY; COMBINATORIAL LIBRARY; CROSS-VALIDATION; DATA SETS; PREDICTION; DATABASE; BIAS; CLASSIFICATION; LIPOPHILICITY	Two inductive knowledge transfer approaches - multitask learning (MTL) and Feature Net (FN) - have been used to build predictive neural networks (ASNN) and PLS models for I I types of tissue-air partition coefficients (TAPC). Unlike conventional single-task learning (STL) modeling focused only on a single target property without any relations to other properties, in the framework of inductive transfer approach, the individual models are viewed as nodes in the network of interrelated models built in parallel (MTL) or sequentially (FN). It has been demonstrated that MTL and FN techniques are extremely useful in structure-property modeling on small and structurally diverse data sets, when conventional STL modeling is unable to produce any predictive model. The predictive STL individual models were obtained for 4 out of I I TAPC, whereas application of inductive knowledge transfer techniques resulted in models for 9 TAPC. Differences in prediction performances of the models as a function of the machine-learning method, and of the number of properties simultaneously involved in the learning, has been discussed.

J	Gluhovsky, I				Gluhovsky, Ilya			CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR MODEL FOR QUALITY-OF-SERVICE ENVIRONMENTS WITH MANY SERVICE LEVELS	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH			English	Article						customer demand; grid computing; internet economics; machine learning; online services; probabilistic algorithms; revenue optimization; utility computing		In a general on-line service environment, a service provider (SP) offers a set of service levels to customers at various prices. Higher priced service levels typically include a guarantee for faster response/completion times. The problem that an SP faces is pricing different service levels. Such a price schedule greatly impacts the rate of incoming requests, the mix of their service levels, and consequently the revenue of the SP. In this work we propose a data driven method for estimating the rate and the mix for any given price schedule. The data exclusively consist of the observed rate of request submissions and the actual choices that customers have made when presented with previously used price schedule(s). Given this characterization, the SP is able to provision resources and optimize scheduling for a given price schedule and ultimately choose the price schedule that optimizes the revenue. The problem is motivated by network service and utility computing environment applications.

J	Martin, HJA; de Lope, J				Antonio Martin, Jose H.; de Lope, Javier			A model for the dynamic coordination of multiple competing goals	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						goal coordination; conflicting goals; multi-objective optimisation; reinforcement learning		A general framework for the problem of coordination of multiple competing goals in dynamic environments for physical agents is presented. This approach to goal coordination is a novel tool to incorporate a deep coordination ability to pure reactive agents. The framework presented is based on the notion of multi-objective optimisation. In this article we propose a kind of 'aggregating functions' formulation with the particularity that the aggregation is weighted by means of a dynamic weighting unitary vector [image omitted], which is dependent from the system dynamic state allowing the agent to dynamically coordinate the priorities of its single goals. This dynamic weighting unitary vector is represented as a (n - 1) set of angles. The dynamic coordination must be established by means of a mapping between the state of the agent's environment S to the set of angles i(S) by means of any sort of machine-learning tool. In this work, we investigate the use of Reinforcement Learning as a first approach to learn that mapping.

J	Subramani, K				Subramani, K.			On memoryless provers and insincere verifiers	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						random walk; binary boolean constraints; Chebyshev's inequality; type 3 certificates; Prover-Verifier model	LINEAR-TIME ALGORITHM; 2 VARIABLES; INEQUALITY	In this article, we introduce a Prover-Verifier model for analysing the computational complexity of a class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) termed boolean binary constraint satisfaction problems (BBCSPs). BBCSPs represent an extremely general class of CSPs and find applications in a wide variety of domains including constraint programming, puzzle solving and program testing. The constraints in a BBCSP permit the combination of multiple theories as opposed to traditional constraint systems in which all constraints belong to the same theory. We establish that each instance of a BBCSP admits a coin-flipping Turing machine that halts in time polynomial in the size of the input. Furthermore, the algorithm is oblivious in that it never sees more than one constraint at a time. The prover, P, in the Prover-Verifier model is endowed with very limited powers. In particular, it has no memory and it can only pose restricted queries to the verifier. The verifier, on the other hand, is both omniscient in that it is cognisant of all the problem details and insincere in that it does not have to decide a priori on the intended proof. However, the verifier must stay consistent in its responses, i.e. it cannot rule out a certain possibility in one response to a query from the prover and then rule in the same possibility in response to a subsequent query. We note that the combination of the resources required by the prover and the type of certificate demanded of the verifier, determine the resources required by an algorithm. Inasmuch as our provers will be memoryless and our verifiers will be asked for extremely simple certificates, our work establishes the existence of a simple, randomised algorithm for BBCSPs. Our model itself serves as a basis for the design of zero-knowledge machine learning algorithms in that the prover ends up learning the proof desired by the verifier. Likewise, our work finds applications in the domain of certifying algorithm design, wherein the goal is to provide a proof of correctness of the algorithm on the input instance by providing an easily checkable certificate.

J	Khreisat, L				Khreisat, Laila			A machine learning approach for Arabic text classification using N-gram frequency statistics	JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Categorization; Arabic; N-gram; Machine learning	CATEGORIZATION	In this paper a machine learning approach for classifying Arabic text documents is presented. To handle the high dimensionality of text documents, embeddings are used to map each document ( instance) into R ( the set of real numbers) representing the tri-gram frequency statistics profiles for a document. Classification is achieved by computing a dissimilarity measure, called the Manhattan distance, between the pro. le of the instance to be classified and the profiles of all the instances in the training set. The class ( category) to which an instance ( document) belongs is the one with the least computed Manhattan measure. The Dice similarity measure is used to compare the performance of method.

Application of multi-class support vector machines for power system on-line static security assessment using DT - based feature and data selection algorithms	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM); feature selection; power system security	NEURAL-NETWORKS	This paper presents a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) based algorithm for on-line static security assessment of the power systems. The proposed SVM based security assessment algorithm has a very small training time and space in comparison with the traditional machine learning methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based algorithms. In addition, the proposed algorithm is faster than existing algorithms. One of the main points, to apply a machine learning method is feature selection. In this paper, a new Decision Tree (DT) based feature selection algorithm has been presented. The proposed SVM algorithm has been applied to New England 39-bus power system. The simulation results show the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed method for on-line static security assessment. The effectiveness of the proposed feature selection algorithm has been investigated, too. The proposed feature selection algorithm has been compared with different feature selection algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature algorithm.	[Mohammadi, M.; Gharehpetian, G.

The models are constructed by statistical extraction of significant patterns from a musical corpus. The minimum description length (MDL) principle is used to select the best model from among the members of a non-parametric model family characterized by an unbounded parameter set. The chosen model achieves optimal compromise between goodness-of-fit and model complexity, thereby avoiding the over-fitting normally associated with such a family of models. The MDL method is illustrated through its application to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. We derive an original mathematical expression for the MDL complexity of HMMs that employ a finite alphabet of symbols; these models are particularly suited to the symbolic modelling of musical structure. As an illustration, we use the proposed HMM complexity expression to construct a model for a common melodic formula in Greek church chant. Such formulas are characterized by text-tune association that is governed by complex rules. We show that MDL-guided model construction gradually 'learns' important aspects of the melodic formula's structure, and that the MDL principle terminates the process when nothing significant is left to learn. We outline how the musical applications of MDL can be extended beyond the HMM framework, and how they address general methodological concerns in empirical music research.

However, most online newspapers still offer all users the same content and fail to raise an individual user's satisfaction and to increase revenue for an online newspaper company. The Dynamic Dissemination of Digital Information (DDDI) system developed here provides personalized online content based on a user's preference. The DDDI system is a hybrid application of machine learning techniques, combined with Bayesian content classification, neural content clustering, and online content matching. In addition, the system adopts a time-varying user profiling method (i.e., current-page, last-session, and recent-sessions profiles), which considers dynamic changes in the user needs or preference for digital content. Through the dynamic profiling, this system overcomes the shortcomings of the static user profiles that have been used in the content personalization research so far and creates a one-to-one relationship between the content provider and the users.

Automated or semi-automated image analysis processes, combined with machine-learning techniques for the identification of plankton, have been proposed to assist in sample analysis. A difficulty in automated plankton recognition and classification systems is the selection of the number of classes. This selection can be formulated as a balance between the number of classes identified (zooplankton taxa) and performance (accuracy; correctly classified individuals). Here, a method is proposed to evaluate the impact of the number of selected classes, in terms of classification performance. On the basis of a data set of classified zooplankton images, a machine-learning method suggests groupings that improve the performance of the automated classification. The end-user can accept or reject these mergers, depending on their ecological value and the objectives of the research. This method permits both objectives to be equally balanced: (i) maximization of the number of classes and (ii) performance, guided by the end-user.

Systematic Definition of Protein Constituents along the Major Polarization Axis Reveals an Adaptive Reuse of the Polarization Machinery in Pheromone-Treated Budding Yeast	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						Proteomics; polarized growth; subcellular localization; pheromone response; yeast	CORTICAL ACTIN CYTOSKELETON; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; ENDOCYTIC MACHINERY; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; FAMILY-MEMBERS; CELL POLARITY; GENE; MORPHOGENESIS; LOCALIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Polarizing cells extensively restructure cellular components in a spatially and temporally coupled manner along the major axis of cellular extension. Budding yeast are a useful model of polarized growth, helping to define many molecular components of this conserved process. Besides budding, yeast cells also differentiate upon treatment with pheromone from the opposite mating type, forming a mating projection (the 'shmoo') by directional restructuring of the cytoskeleton, localized vesicular transport and overall reorganization of the cytosol. To characterize the proteomic localization changes accompanying polarized growth, we developed and implemented a novel cell microarray-based imaging assay for measuring the spatial redistribution of a large fraction of the yeast proteome, and applied this assay to identify proteins localized along the mating projection following pheromone treatment. We further trained a machine learning algorithm to refine the cell imaging screen, identifying additional shmoo-localized proteins. In all, we identified 74 proteins that specifically localize to the mating projection, including previously uncharacterized proteins (Ycr043c, Ydr348c, Yer071c, Ymr295c, and Yor304c-a) and known polarization complexes such as the exocyst. Functional analysis of these proteins, coupled with quantitative analysis of individual organelle movements during shmoo formation, suggests a model in which the basic machinery for cell polarization is generally conserved between processes forming the bud and the shmoo, with a distinct subset of proteins used only for shmoo formation. The net effect is a defined ordering of major organelles along the polarization axis, with specific proteins implicated at the proximal growth tip.

Brian			Towards Automatic Recognition of Scientifically Rigorous Clinical Research Evidence	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION; STACKED GENERALIZATION; BIOMEDICAL TEXT; SYSTEM	The growing numbers of topically relevant biomedical publications readily available due to advances in document retrieval methods pose a challenge to clinicians practicing evidence-based medicine. It is increasingly time consuming to acquire and critically appraise the available evidence. This problem could be addressed in part if methods were available to automatically recognize rigorous studies immediately applicable in a specific clinical situation. We approach the problem of recognizing studies containing useable clinical advice from retrieved topically relevant articles as a binary classification problem. The gold standard used in the development of PubMed clinical query filters forms the basis of our approach. We identify scientifically rigorous studies using supervised machine learning techniques (Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and boosting) trained on high-level semantic features. We combine these methods using an ensemble learning method (stacking). The performance of learning methods is evaluated using precision, recall and F, score, in addition to area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Using a training set of 10,000 manually annotated MEDLINE citations, and a test set of an additional 2,000 citations, we achieve 73.7% precision and 61.5% recall in identifying rigorous, clinically relevant studies, with stacking over five feature-classifier combinations and 82.5% precision and 84.3% recall in recognizing rigorous studies with treatment focus using stacking over word + metadata feature vector. Our results demonstrate that a high quality gold standard and advanced classification methods can help clinicians acquire best evidence from the medical literature.

J	Uzuner, O; Zhang, XR; Sibanda, T				Uzuner, Oezlem; Zhang, Xiaoran; Sibanda, Tawanda			Machine Learning and Rule-based Approaches to Assertion Classification	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							RADIOLOGY	Objectives: The authors study two approaches to assertion classification. One of these approaches, Extended NegEx (ENegEx), extends the rule-based NegEx algorithm to cover alter-association assertions; the other, Statistical Assertion Classifier (StAC), presents a machine learning solution to assertion classification. Design: For each mention of each medical problem, both approaches determine whether the problem, as asserted by the context of that mention, is present, absent, or uncertain in the patient, or associated with someone other than the patient. The authors use these two systems to (1) extend negation and uncertainty extraction to recognition of alter-association assertions, (2) determine the contribution of lexical and syntactic context to assertion classification, and (3) test if a machine learning approach to assertion classification can be as generally applicable and useful as its rule-based counterparts. Measurements: The authors evaluated assertion classification approaches with precision, recall, and F-measure. Results: The ENegEx algorithm is a general algorithm that can be directly applied to new corpora. Despite being based on machine learning, StAC can also be applied out-of-the-box to new corpora and achieve similar generality. Conclusion: The StAC models that are developed on discharge summaries can be successfully applied to radiology reports. These models benefit the most from words found in the +/- 4 word window of the target and can outperform ENegEx.

J	Koppel, M; Schler, J; Argamon, S				Koppel, Moshe; Schler, Jonathan; Argamon, Shlorno			Computational Methods in Authorship Attribution	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Review							TEXT CATEGORIZATION; LANGUAGE MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; STYLE; PERSPECTIVE; FEDERALIST; RICHNESS; MESSAGES; FEATURES	Statistical authorship attribution has a long history, culminating in the use of modern machine learning classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real-life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle-in-a-haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant.

In most cases, the performance of an ensemble is better than a single classifier. Many methods for creating diverse classifiers were developed during the past decade. When these diverse classifiers are generated, it is important to select the proper base classifier to join the ensemble. Usually, this selection process is called pruning the ensemble. In general, the ensemble pruning is a selection process in which an optimal combination will be selected from many existing base classifiers. Some base classifiers containing useful information may be excluded in this pruning process. To avoid this problem, the multilayer ensemble pruning model is used in this paper. In this model, the pruning of one layer can be seen as a multimodal optimization problem. A novel multi-sub-swarm particle swarm optimization (MSSPSO) is used here to find multi-solutions for this multilayer ensemble pruning model. In this model, each base classifier will generate an oracle output. Each layer will use MSSPSO algorithm to generate a different pruning based on previous oracle output. A series of experiments using UCI dataset is conducted, the experimental results show that the multilayer ensemble pruning via MSSPSO algorithm can improve the generalization performance of the multi-classifiers ensemble system. Besides, the experimental results show a relationship between the diversity and the pruning technique.

The Mixture of Bernoulli Experts: A theory to quantify reliance on cues in dichotomous perceptual decisions	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						cue combination; cue recruitment; cue learning; bistability; ambiguous figure; perceptual dichotomy; appearance; sensory fusion; machine learning; Bayes; naive Bayes; Bayes rule	STEREOSCOPIC SLANT PERCEPTION; STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; TEXTURE; MODELS; COMBINATION; INTEGRATION; STEREOPSIS; VIEWPOINT; ILLUSIONS	The appearances of perceptually bistable stimuli can by definition be reported with confidence, so these stimuli may be useful to investigate how visual cues are learned and combined to construct visual appearance. However, interpreting experimental data (percent of trials seen one way or the other) requires a theoretically motivated measure of cue effectiveness. Here we describe a simple Bayesian theory for dichotomous perceptual decisions: the Mixture of Bernoulli Experts or MBE. In this theory, a cue's subjective reliability is the product of a weight and an estimate of the cue's ecological validity. The theory (1) justifies the use of probit analysis to measure the system's reliance on a cue and (2) enables hypothesis testing. To illustrate, we used apparent 3D rotation direction in perceptually ambiguous Necker cube movies to test whether the visual system relied on a newly recruited cue (position of the stimulus within the visual field) to the same extent when a long-trusted cue (binocular disparity) was present or not present in the display. For six trainees, reliance on the newly recruited cue was similar whether or not the long-trusted cue was present, suggesting that the visual system assumed the new cue to be conditionally independent.

Even though obtaining labelled data in this domain is hard due to the high cost of domain experts' time, the application of the machine learning-based technology was successful, yielding results comparable to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we present a comparison between several machine learning approaches in extracting knowledge from reports about jet engines. NW show that the application of a semi-supervised approach does not provide a significant increase in accuracy so as to justify its adoption due to its much higher computational cost, but that the application of a large-scale approach considerably reduces both training and testing time while keeping accuracy comparable to the standard supervised approach, making it a good choice for this class of application scenarios	Univ Sheffield, Dept Comp Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England	Iria, J (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Comp Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.	j.iria@sheffield.ac.uk					BELKIN M, 2002, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, V15; BLUM A, 2004, P 21 INT C MACH LEAR; Bordes A., 2007, ICML 07, P89; Boser B.

Large-Scale Behavioral Targeting	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Behavioral targeting; large-scale; grid computing		Behavioral targeting (BT) leverages historical user behavior to select the ads most relevant to users to display. The state-of-the-art of BT derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history. We designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to BT using Hadoop MapReduce framework. With our parallel algorithm and the resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the entire Yahoo's user base within one day, the scale that one can not even imagine with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20% CTR lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset. Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance in spite of the typically skewed distribution of domain data. (2) An in-place feature vector generation algorithm with linear time complexity O(n) regardless of the granularity of sliding target window. (3) An in-memory caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk IOs to make large-scale learning practical. (4) Highly efficient data structures and sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates. We believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in general. Finally, we report comprehensive experimental results, using industrial proprietary codebase and datasets.

Irrespective of the learning algorithm itself, the final classifier has a weight to multiply by each feature. This suggests that ideally each input feature should be linearly correlated with the target variable (or anti-correlated) whereas raw features may be highly non-linear. In this paper, we attempt to re-shape each input feature so that it is appropriate to use with a linear weight and to scale the different features in proportion to their predictive value. We demonstrate that this pre-processing is beneficial for linear SVM classifiers on a large benchmark-of text classification tasks as well as UCI datasets.

Recently, several progressive sampling strategies for maximizing the overall data mining utility have been proposed. All these strategies are based on repeated acquisitions of additional training examples until a utility decrease is observed In this paper, we present an alternative, projective sampling strategy, which fits functions to a partial learning curve and a partial run-time curve obtained from a small subset of potentially available data and then uses these projected functions to analytically estimate the optimal training set size. The proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of benchmark datasets using the RapidMiner environment for machine learning and data mining processes. The results show that the learning and run-time curves projected from only several data points can lead to a cheaper data mining process than the common progressive sampling methods.

In the meanwhile, they reduce the utility of the data. It is important to consider the tradeoff between privacy and utility. In a paper that appeared in KDD 2008, Brickell and Shmatikov proposed an evaluation methodology by comparing privacy gain with utility gain resulted from anonymizing the data, and concluded that "even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility". This conclusion seems to undermine existing work on data anonymization. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental characteristics of privacy and utility, and show that it is inappropriate to directly compare privacy with utility. We then observe that the privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing is similar to the risk-return tradeoff in financial investment, and propose an integrated framework for considering privacy-utility tradeoff, borrowing concepts from the Modem Portfolio Theory for financial investment. Finally, we evaluate our methodology on the Adult dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. Our results clarify several common misconceptions about data utility and provide data publishers useful guidelines on choosing the right tradeoff between privacy and utility.

Sparse logistic regression embeds feature selection in the classification framework using the PI-norm regularization, and is attractive in many applications involving high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose Lassplore for solving Large-scale sparse logistic regression. Specifically, we formulate the problem as the l(1)-ball constrained smooth convex optimization, and propose to solve the problem using the Nesterov's method, an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. One of the critical issues in the use of the Nesterov's method is the estimation of the step size at each of the optimization iterations. Previous approaches either applies the constant step size which assumes that the Lipschitz gradient is known in advance, or requires a sequence of decreasing step size which leads to slow convergence in practice. In this paper, we propose an adaptive line search scheme which allows to tune the step size adaptively and meanwhile guarantees the optimal convergence rate. Empirical comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed Lassplore algorithm for large-scale problems.

Although many methods have been developed to identify statistically significant anomalies, a more difficult task is to identify anomalies that are both interesting and statistically significant. Category detection is an emerging area of machine learning that can help address this issue using a "human-in-the-loop" approach. In this interactive setting, the algorithm asks the user to label a query data point under an existing category or declare the query data point to belong to a previously undiscovered category. The goal of category detect ion is to bring to the user's attention a representative data point from each category in the data in as few queries as possible. In a data set with imbalanced categories, the main challenge is in identifying the rare categories or anomalies; hence, the task is often referred to as Tare category detection. We present a new approach to rare category detection based on hierarchical mean shift. In our approach, it hierarchy is created by repeatedly applying mean shift with an increasing bandwidth on the data. This hierarchy allows its to identify anomalies in the data set at different scales, which are then posed as queries to the user. The main advantage of this methodology over existing approaches is that it does not require any knowledge of the dataset properties such as the total number of categories or the prior probabilities of the categories. Results on real-world data sets show that our hierarchical mean shift approach performs consistently better than previous techniques.

Learning Patterns in the Dynamics of Biological Networks	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Dynamic Network Analysis; Graph Mining; Biological Network; Graph Rewriting Rule	DISCOVERY; KNOWLEDGE	Our dynamic graph-based relational mining approach has been developed to learn structural patterns in biological networks as they change over time. The analysis of dynamic networks is important not only to understand life at the system-level, but also to discover novel patterns in other structural data. Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook dynamic features of biological networks, because they are focused on only static graphs. Our approach analyzes a sequence of graphs and discovers rules that capture the changes that occur between pairs of graphs in the sequence. These rules represent the graph rewrite rules that the first graph must go through to be isomorphic to the second graph. Then, our approach feeds the graph rewrite rules into a machine learning system that learns general transformation rules describing the types of changes that occur for a class of dynamic biological networks. The discovered graph-rewriting rules show how biological networks change over time, and the transformation rules show the repeated patterns in the structural changes. In this paper, we apply our approach to biological networks to evaluate our approach and to understand how the biosystems change over time. We evaluate our results using coverage and prediction metrics, and compare to biological literature.

OpinionMiner: A Novel Machine Learning System for Web Opinion Mining and Extraction	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Opinion Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Lexicalized HMMs		Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to share their opinions and hands-on experiences on products they have purchased. Unfortunately, reading through all customer reviews is difficult, especially for popular items, the number of reviews can be up to hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. The OpinionMiner system designed in this work aims to mine customer reviews of a product and extract high detailed product entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions are identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that employed rule-based or statistical techniques, we propose a novel machine learning approach built under the framework of lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates multiple important linguistic features into automatic learning. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main components of the system. The evaluation of the proposed method is presented based on processing the online product reviews from Amazon and other publicly available datasets.

Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search Advertisements	KDD-09: 15TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2009	Paris, FRANCE	ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGMOD		Bounce Rate; Sponsored Search; Machine Learning		This paper explores an important and relatively unstudied quality measure of a sponsored search advertisement: bounce rate. The bounce rate of an ad can be informally defined as the fraction of users who click on the ad, but almost immediately move on to other tasks. A high bounce rate can lead to poor advertiser return on investment, and suggests search engine users may be having a poor experience following the click. In this paper, we first provide quantitative analysis showing that bounce rate is an effective measure of user satisfaction. We then address the question, can we predict bounce rate by analyzing the features of the advertisement? An affirmative answer would allow advertisers and search engines to predict the effectiveness and quality of advertisements before they are shown. We propose solutions to this problem involving large-scale learning methods that leverage features drawn from ad creatives in addition to their keywords and landing pages.

However. the existing news extraction methods based on template-level wrapper induction have three serious limitations. First, the existing methods cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template. Second, it is costly to maintain up-to-date wrappers for a large amount of news websites, because any change of a template may invalidate the corresponding wrapper. Last, the existing methods can merely extract unformatted plain texts, and thus are not user friendly In this paper, we tackle the problem of tern plate-independent Web news extraction in a user-friendly way. We formalize Web news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site. Novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed. Correlations between news titles and news bodies are exploited. Our template-independent wrapper can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates. Moreover, our approach can extract not only texts, but also images and animates within the news bodies and the extracted news articles are in the same visual style as in the original pages. In our experiments, a wrapper learned from 40 pages from a single news site achieved an accuracy of 98.1% on 3, 973 news pages from 12 news sites.

We trained the Trigrams'n'Tags Tagger by Brants (Brants, 2000) with a semantically enhanced tagset. The experiments showed that the cleanliness of the data is far more important than the amount of the same. Furthermore, it was shown that bootstrapping is a viable approach to ameliorate the results.

TEXT CLASSIFICATION THROUGH TIME Efficient Label Propagation in Time-Based Graphs	KDIR 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval	OCT 06-08, 2009	Funchal Madeira, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technol Informat Control & Commun		Text analysis; Text Classification; Machine Learning; Graph Algorithms; Preference Propagation; Semi supervised learning; Natural Language Processing; Adsorption		One of the fundamental assumptions for machine-learning based text classification systems is that the underlying distribution from which the set of labeled-text is drawn is identical to the distribution from which the text-to-be-labeled is drawn. However, in live news aggregation sites, this assumption is rarely correct. Instead, the events and topics discussed in news stories dramatically change over time. Rather than ignoring this phenomenon, we attempt to explicitly model the transitions of news stories and classifications over time to label stories that may be acquired months after the initial examples are labeled. We test our system, based on efficiently propagating labels in time-based graphs, with recently published news stories collected over an eighty day period. Experiments presented in this paper include the use of training labels from each story within the first several days of gathering stories, to using a single story as a label.

Web pages can be viewed as a large community of elements that are connected through links due to several issues. The HITS approach introduces two basic concepts, hubs and authorities, that reveal some hidden semantic information from the links. In this paper, we present XHITS, a generalization of HITS, that models multiple classes problems and a machine learning algorithm to calibrate it. We split classification influence into two sources. The first one is due to link propagation, whereas the second one is due to classification reinforcement. We derive a simple linear iterative equation to compute the classification values. We also provide an influence equation that shows how the two influence sources can be combined. Two special cases are explored: symmetric reinforcement and positive reinforcement. We show that for these two special cases the iterative scheme converges. Some illustrative examples and empirical test are also provided. They indicate that XHITS is a powerful and efficient modeling approach.

In this paper we explore the use of artificial negatives for dimension reduction in one-class classification, that is classification problems where only positive examples are available for training. We present four different strategies for generating artificial negatives and show that two of these strategies are very effective for discovering discriminating projections on the data, i.e., low dimension projections for discriminating between positive and real negative examples. The paper concludes with an assessment of the selection bias of this approach to dimension reduction for one-class classification.

BEHAVIOR OF DIFFERENT IMAGE CLASSIFIERS WITHIN A BROAD DOMAIN	KDIR 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval	OCT 06-08, 2009	Funchal Madeira, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technol Informat Control & Commun		Machine learning; Image classification; Human perception	RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION	Image classification is one of the most important research tasks in the Content-Based Image Retrieval area. The term image categorization refers to the labeling of the images under one of a number of predefined categories. Although this task is usually not too difficult for humans, it has proved to be extremely complex for machines (or computer programs). The major issues concern variable and sometimes uncontrolled imaging conditions. This paper focuses on observation of behavior for different classifiers within a collection of general purpose images (photos). We carry out a contrastive study between the groups obtained from these mathematical classifiers and a prior classification developed by humans.

This situation makes learning difficult, as learning algorithms based on optimizing accuracy over all training examples will tend to classify all examples as belonging to the majority class. In this paper we introduce a method for learning from imbalanced data sets which is composed of three algorithms. Our experimental results show that our method performs accurate classification in the presence of significant class imbalance and using small training sets.

We also show that using sentiment orientation features improves the performance of classification. At the end, the possibility of generating texts that express specific emotions is discussed.

The natural ambiguity and context-dependence Of human languages lead to problems that plague modern image search engines: A user formulating a query usually has in mind just one topic, while the results produced to satisfy this query may (and usually do) belong to the different topics. Therefore, only part of the search results are relevant for a user. One of the possible ways to improve the user's experience is to Cluster the results according to the topics they belong to and present the clustered results to the user. As opposed to the clustering based on visual features, an approach Utilising the text information in the webpages containing the image is less computationally intensive and provides the resulting clusters with semantically meaningful names.

In this paper we present and compare two approaches for the automatic recognition of temporal expressions, based on a supervised machine learning approach and trained on TimeBank. The first approach performs a token-by-token classification and the second one does a binary constituent-based classification of chunk phrases. Our experiments demonstrate that on the TimeBank Corpus constituent-based classification performs better than the token-based one. It achieves F1-measure values of 0.852 for the detection task and 0.828 when an exact match is required, which is better than the state-of-the-art results for temporal expression recognition on TimeBank.

Modern automated theorem provers, in contrast, present proofs usually at a, fixed level of detail (also called granularity). Often these presentations are neither intended nor suitable for human use. A challenge therefore is to develop user- and goal-adaptive proof presentation techniques that obey common mathematical practice. We present; a flexible and adaptive approach to proof presentation based oil classification. Expert knowledge for the classification task can be hand-authored or extracted from annotated proof examples via. machine learning techniques. The obtained models are employed for the automated generation of further proofs at in adapted level of granularity.

The system itself identifies relevant channels from the available measurements, classical process data and flame image information, and selects the most suited ones to learn a control strategy based oil observed data, Due to the shifting nature of the process, the ability to re-adapt the whole system automatically is essential. The operation in a real power plant demonstrates the impact of this intelligent control system with its ability to increase efficiency and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases much better then any previous control system.

Inconsistency rate is known as all effective measure to evaluate consistency (relevance) of feature subsets, and INTERACT, a state-of-the-art feature selection algorithm. takes advantage of it. In this paper, we shows that inconsistency rate is not the unique measure of consistency by introducing two new consistency measures, and also, show that INTERACT has the important deficiency that it fails for particular types of probability distributions. To fix the deficiency, we propose two new algorithms. which have flexibility of taking advantage of any of the new measures as well as, inconsistency rate. Furthermore, through experiments we compare the three consistency and prove effectiveness of the new algorithms.			yshin@cmuj.jp					ALMUALLIM H, 1994, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE, V69; Biesiada J., 2008, ADV SOFT COMPUTING, V45, P242; BIESIADA J, 2005, ADV SOFT COMPUTING, V30, P95; Blake C.

Case-base maintenance becomes a powerful method to refine knowledge in CBR systems. This paper proposes an integrated knowledge adaption framework for CBR systems which contains a meta database component and a maintenance strategies component. The meta database component can help track changes of interested concepts and therefore enable a CBR system to signal a need for maintenance or to invoke adaption on its own. The maintenance strategies component can perform cross-container maintenance operations in a CBR system. This paper also illustrates how the proposed integrated knowledge adaption framework assists decision makers to build dynamic prediction and decision capabilities.

The automation of the annotation process facilitates the transition from the current state-of-the-art architectures towards semantically-enabled architectures. We see the annotation process as the task of matching an arbitrary word or term with the most appropriate concept in the domain ontology. The term matching techniques that we present are based on text mining. To determine the similarity between two terms, we first associate a set of documents [that we obtain from a Web search engine] with each term. We then transform the documents into feature vectors and thus transition the similarity assessment into the feature space. After that, we compute the similarity by training a classifier to distinguish between ontology concepts. Apart from text mining approaches, we also present an alternative technique, namely Google Distance, which proves less suitable for our task. The paper also presents the results of an extensive evaluation of the presented term matching methods which shows that these methods work best on synonymous nouns from a specific vocabulary. Furthermore, the fast and simple centroid-based classifier is shown to perform very well for this task. The main contribution of this paper is thus in proposing a term matching algorithm based on text mining and information retrieval. Furthermore, the presented evaluation should give a notion of how the algorithm performs in various scenarios.

The data stream paradigm imposes that variable clustering should also be addressed as an online procedure, not only due to the dynamics inherent to streams but also because the relations between them can change over time. Moreover, streams may be produced in a distributed environment. The task that emerges from this setting is better known as clustering of streaming sensors, since the data is often produced in wide sensor networks. We overview previous attempts to address this problem and clarify where, in our perspective, these attempts may have failed to deal with it. We try to summarize the characteristics that systems addressing this task should observe and their implications for future research. The main goal of this exposure is to discuss the definition of clear requirements for an emerging task in machine learning.

They are accompanied with triggers when they are first introduced e.g. titles with person names. However, triggers are not frequently used if the same entity is being referred to again within the same article. Exploiting this phenomenon, this study aims at improving proper noun identification and semantic classification in Arabic. A particular challenge in written Arabic is the lack of orthographic features to distinguish proper nouns. Adopting a corpus-based approach, we build a classification model from a training corpus and use the resulting model in the testing phase.

Although CPGs gather all evidence available on concrete medical problems, their direct application has been proved to have some limitations. One of these limitations occurs when they have to be applied on co-morbid patients suffering from several simultaneous and mutually related diseases. In such cases, health-care professionals have to follow the indications of multiple CPGs and solve their interactions as they appear in the treatment of concrete patients. Clinical Algorithms (CA) are schematic models of the procedures appearing in a CPG. They are used to organize and summarize the recommendations contained in CPGs. Here, we extend a knowledge-based algorithm to merge CAs with a machine learning procedure to relax the knowledge dependence of that algorithm. The resulting algorithm has been tested on health-care data provided by the SAGESSA Group on hypertension patients. The results obtained prove that it is a good approach to the generation of CA from data though several improvements at the levels of prediction and medical interpretation are possible. Furthermore, the learned knowledge from the data generation process can be reused to improve the results of the merging process for similar diseases.

J	Ha, MH; Pedrycz, W; Chen, JQ; Zheng, LF				Ha, Minghu; Pedrycz, Witold; Chen, Jiqiang; Zheng, Lifang			Some theoretical results of learning theory based on random sets in set-valued probability space	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Risk minimization; Set theory; Learning	CONVERGENCE; COMPACTNESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce some basic knowledge of statistical learning theory (SLT) based on random set samples in set-valued probability space for the first time and generalize the key theorem and bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning theory in Vapnik, to the key theorem and bounds on the rate of uniform convergence for random sets in set-valued probability space. SLT based on random samples formed in probability space is considered, at present, as one of the fundamental theories about small samples statistical learning. It has become a novel and important field of machine learning, along with other concepts and architectures such as neural networks. However, the theory hardly handles statistical learning problems for samples that involve random set samples. Design/methodology/approach - Being motivated by some applications, in this paper a SLT is developed based on random set samples. First, a certain law of large numbers for random sets is proved. Second, the definitions of the distribution function and the expectation of random sets are introduced, and the concepts of the expected risk functional and the empirical risk functional are discussed. A notion of the strict consistency of the principle of empirical risk minimization is presented. Findings - The paper formulates and proves the key theorem and presents the bounds on the rate of uniform convergence of learning theory based on random sets in set-valued probability space, which become cornerstones of the theoretical fundamentals of the SLT for random set samples. Originality/value - The paper provides a studied analysis of some theoretical results of learning theory.

Morphological cues vs. number of nominals in learning verb types in Turkish: The syntactic bootstrapping mechanism revisited	LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES			English	Article						Language development; Turkish; Child-directed speech; Syntactic bootstrapping; Morphology	WORD-ORDER; ARGUMENT STRUCTURE; COMPREHENSION; INFLECTIONS; LANGUAGE; INPUT	The syntactic bootstrapping mechanism of verb learning was evaluated against child-directed speech in Turkish, a language with rich morphology, nominal ellipsis and free word order. Machine- learning algorithms were run on transcribed caregiver speech directed to two Turkish learners (one hour every two weeks between 0;9 to 1;10) of different socioeconomic backgrounds. We found that the number of nominals in child-directed utterances plays a small, but significant, role in classifying transitive and intransitive verbs. Further, we found that accusative morphology on the noun is a strong cue in clustering verb types. We also found that verbal morphology (past tense and bareness of verbs) is useful in distinguishing between different subtypes of intransitive verbs. These results suggest that syntactic bootstrapping mechanisms should be extended to include morphological cues to verb learning in morphologically rich languages.

It has the goal of locating and removing a fault after a failure occurred during test. However, it is not a trivial task and generally consumes effort and time. Debugging techniques generally use testing information but usually they are very specific for certain domains, languages and development paradigms. Because of this, a Neural Network (NN) approach has been investigated with this goal. It is independent of the context and presented promising results for procedural code. However it was not validated in the context of Object-Oriented (OO) applications. In addition to this, the use of other Machine Learning techniques is also interesting, because they can be more efficient. With this in mind, the present work adapts the NN approach to the OO context and also explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Results from the use of both techniques are presented and analysed. They show that their use contributes for easing the fault localization task.

Self-tuned libraries, iterative compilation and machine learning techniques all compare multiple compiled program versions. In each, program versions are timed to determine which has the best performance. The program needs to be run multiple times for each version because there is noise inherent in most performance measurements. The number of runs must be enough to compare different versions, despite the noise, but executing more than this will waste time and energy. The compiler writer must either risk taking too few runs, potentially getting incorrect results, or taking too many runs increasing the time for their experiments or reducing the number of program versions evaluated. Prior works choose constant size sampling plans where each compiled version is executed a fixed number of times without regard to the level of noise. In this paper we develop a Sequential sampling plan which can automatically adapt to the experiment so that the compiler writer can have both confidence in the results and also be Sure that no more runs were taken than were needed. We show that our system is able to correctly determine the best optimization settings with between 76% and 87% fewer runs than needed by it brute force, constant sampling size approach. We also compare our approach to JavaSTATS(10); we needed 77% to 89% fewer runs than it needed.

In particular, we cover the issues of automatic evaluation of machine translation output, language modeling, word-based and phrase-based translation models, and the use of syntax in machine translation. We will also do a quick roundup of some more recent directions that we believe may gain importance in the future. We situate statistical machine translation in the general context of machine learning research, and put the emphasis on similarities and differences with standard machine learning problems and practice.

Current approaches often employ machine learning techniques and require supervised data. However, many languages lack such resources. This chapter(1) presents an (almost) unsupervised learning algorithm for automatic discovery of named entities (NEs) in a resource-free language, given bilingual corpora in which it is weakly temporally aligned with a resource-rich language. NEs have similar time distributions across such corpora, and often some of the tokens in a multiword NE are transliterated. We develop an algorithm that exploits both observations iteratively. The algorithm makes use of a new, frequency-based, metric for time distributions and a resource-free discriminative approach to transliteration. Seeded with a small number of transliteration pairs, our algorithm discovers multiword NEs, and takes advantage of a dictionary (if one exists) to account for translated or partially translated NEs. We evaluate the algorithm on an English-Russian corpus, and show a high level of NEs discovery in Russian.

Combination of Statistical Word Alignments Based on Multiple Preprocessing Schemes	LEARNING MACHINE TRANSLATION	Neural Information Processing Series		English	Article; Book Chapter								Word alignments over parallel corpora have become an essential supporting technology to a variety of natural language processing applications. We present an approach to using multiple preprocessing (tokenization) schemes to improve statistical word alignments. In this approach, the text to align is tokenized before statistical alignment and is then remapped to its original form afterward. Multiple tokenizations yield multiple remappings (remapped alignments), which are then combined using supervised machine learning. Our results show that the remapping strategy improves alignment correctness by itself. We also show that the combination of multiple remappings improves measurably over a commonly used state-of-the-art baseline. We obtain a relative reduction of alignment error rate of about 38% on a blind test set.

Manually placing every part of new legislative texts in the correct place of the hierarchy, however, is expensive and slow, and therefore naturally calls for automation. In this paper, we assess the ability of machine learning methods to develop a model that automatically classifies legislative texts in a legal topic hierarchy. It is investigated whether such methods can generalize across different codes. In the classification process, the specific properties of legislative documents are exploited. Both the hierarchical structure of legal codes and references within the legal document collection are taken into account. We argue for a closer cooperation between legal and machine learning experts as the main direction of future work.

Aided by a data-driven morphological analyzer and part-of-speech tagger, we quantify the coverage of the dictionaries on large monolingual corpora of Swahili. In a second series of experiments, we investigate how applicable the dictionaries are as a tool in the development of a machine translation system, by evaluating bilingual coverage on the parallel SAWA corpus. At the same time we attempt to consolidate the dictionaries into a unified lexicographic database and compare the coverage to that of its composite parts.

Improving Elevator Call Time Responsiveness via an Artificial Neural Network Control Mechanism	LISAT: 2009 IEEE LONG ISLAND SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conferences	MAY 01, 2009	Farmingdale, NY	IEEE		Control Systems; Machine Learning; Neural Networks	GROUP CONTROL-SYSTEM	Elevator traffic comprises the movement of individuals from the floor from which they called the elevator to their destination floor. This project seeks to improve elevator call time responsiveness by utilizing the concept that traffic flows generally form definable patterns that can be used to predict future traffic flow behaviors. A feed-forward neural network-based control algorithm has been developed that can approximate elevator call patterns by learning to associate time of day with specific call locations. This algorithm was tested against fuzzy patterns of elevator calls in which the randomly generated calls were biased towards certain floors at certain times of day. When the average neural network controlled call times of 10 such fuzzy sets were compared to the typical scenario of the elevator returning to the first floor after each call, a 42% improvement in elevator call time responsiveness was observed. It is thereby suggested that a machine learning enabled-elevator control system could result in increased user satisfaction by reducing wait times by helping to ensure that the elevator is at the most likely place the elevator will be called from prior to an individual even pushing the call button. The utility of such an algorithm is likely further enhanced, however, by the fact that having the elevator in the most likely call location can also lead to significant energy savings in that the elevator will need to travel less to pick up prospective passengers.

However, despite the large attention this topic has gained, most of the research focused on the calculation of position estimates. In this paper. we go a step further and investigate how the position error that is inherent to 802.11-based positioning systems can be estimated. Knowing the position error is crucial for many applications that rely on position information: End users could be informed about the estimated position error to avoid frustration in case the system gives faulty position information. Service providers could adapt their delivered services based on the estimated position error to achieve a higher service quality. Finally, system operators could use the information to inspect whether a location system provides satisfactory positioning accuracy throughout the covered area. For position error estimation, we present four novel algorithms that take different features into account. Advantages of the combination of these four algorithms are explored by using a machine-learning approach. We evaluate Our proposed algorithms in two different real-world deployments by using real-world data and emulation. The results show that our algorithms work independently of the environment and the positioning algorithm, and with an average precision for estimating the position error of up to 1.45 meters. The algorithms can - by adjusting parameters - realize different tradeoffs between underestimating and overestimating errors. Furthermore we comment on the algorithms' space and time complexity.

This is suitable for dealing with functions that obey algebraic laws, and are typically mechanized by means of equational atributes in rule-based languages such as ASF+SDF, Elan, OBJ, Cafe-OBJ, and Maude. The algorithm computes a complete set of least general generalizations modulo the given equational axioms, and is specified by a set of inference rules that we prove correct. This work provides a missing connection between least general generalization and computing modulo equational theories, and opens up new applications of generalization to rule-based languages, theorem provers and program manipulation tools such as partial evaluators, test case generators, and machine learning techniques, where function symbols obey algebraic axioms. A Web tool which implements the algorithm has been developed which is publicly available.

In fact, the design and implementation of complex systems cannot be done without it. In general, abstraction is used to simplify elements of complex systems such that complexity is lowered without decreasing performance significantly. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, its main goal is to lower the complexity of reasoning and learning without losing the ability to deal effectively with the task. In this chapter, we focus on abstraction mechanisms used in the context of MDPs. The learning algorithms from the previous chapter do not scale up well to larger state spaces. Various abstractions are proposed in the literature that make use of the inherent structure in MDPs such that even very large problems can be solved. Structure can be found in symmetries and equivalence classes in state and action spaces, in task hierarchies and also in regularities in transition models and reward functions. Making use of abstractions renders a need to deal with structural induction and deduction in parallel with value and policy learning algorithms. The main purpose of this chapter is to highlight the principles of abstraction in MDPs and the interplay between abstractions and RL algorithms. We introduce PIAGET as an extension of GPI in the face of abstraction. Furthermore, we distinguish five types of abstraction for solution of MDPs and the same underlying principles can be found in the following chapters covering relational representations.

Feature selection and regularization of decision rule are combined in a single procedure. The selection of features is realized by introducing weight coefficients, characterizing degree of relevance of respective feature. A priori information about feature ordering is taken into account in the form of quadratic penalty or in the form of absolute Value penalty on the difference of weight coefficients of neighboring features.

To overcome this problem, feature selection and ensemble classification are applied in order to improve accuracy and stability. This research presents an analysis of the effect of removing irrelevant and redundant features with ensemble classifiers using five datasets and compared with floating search method. Eliminating redundant features provides better accuracy and computational time than removing irrelevant features of the ensemble.

It builds an SVM on the feature space neighborhood of the query point in the training set and uses it to predict its class. There, is both empirical and theoretical evidence that Local SVM call improve over SVM and kNN in terms of classification accuracy, but the computational cost of the method permits the application only on small datasets. Here, we propose FastLSVM, a classifier based on Local SVM that decreases the number of SVMs that, must be built in order to be suitable for large dataset's. FastLSVM precomputes a set, of local SVMs in the training set and assigns to each model all the points lying in the central neighborhood of the k points oil which it, is trained. The prediction is performed applying to the query point the model corresponding to its nearest neighbor in the training set. The empirical evaluation we provide points out, that FastLSVM is a good approximation of Local SVM and its computational performances oil big datasets (a large artificial problem with 100000 samples and a very large real problem with more than 500000 samples) dramatically ameliorate performances of SVM and it's fast, existing approximations improving also the generalization accuracies.

The Effect of Domain Knowledge on Rule Extraction from Support Vector Machines	MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING IN PATTERN RECOGNITION	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 23-25, 2009	Leipzig, GERMANY			Data mining; Machine learning; Domain knowledge utilization; Rule learning; Support Vector Machines		Prior knowledge about it problem domain can be utilized to bias Support Vector Machines (SVMs) towards learning better hypothesis functions. To this end, a number of methods have been proposed that demonstrate improved generalization performance after the application of domain knowledge; especially in the case of scarce training data. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Virtual Support vectors (VSVs) technique where only a subset of the Support vectors (SVs) is Utilized. Unlike previous methods, the Purpose here is to compensate for noise and uncertainty in the training data. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of domain knowledge not only oil the quality of the SVM model, but also Oil rules extracted from it: hence the learned pattern by the SVM. Results on five benchmark and one real life data sets show that domain knowledge can significantly improve both the quality Of the SVM and the rules extracted from it.

A similarity based approach is used to describe individual users' strategies and we propose two different scoring functions to evaluate them. The information contained in users bet selections improves on using only bookmaker odds. Even when only bookmaker odds are used, the approach gives results comparable to those of a regression-based forecasting model.

The major problem ill a transplantation procedure is the possibility of the receiver's immune system attack and destroy the transplanted tissue. It is therefore of capital importance to find a donor with the highest possible compatibility with the receiver, and thus reduce rejection. Finding a good donor is not a straightforward task because a complex network of relations exist's between the immunological and the clinical variables that, influence the receivers acceptance of the transplanted organ. Currently the process of analyzing these variables involves a careful study by the clinical transplant team. The number and complexity of the relations between variables make the manual process very slow. Ill this paper we propose and compare two Machine Learning algorithms that might help the transplant team ill improving and Speeding up their decisions. We achieve that objective by analyzing past real cases and constructing models as set, of rules. Such models are accurate and understandable by experts.

The algorithm is based on the geometry of the polar polytope where at each step a basis function is chosen by finding the maximal vertex using a. path-following method. The algorithmic complexity is of a similar order to OMP whilst being able to solve problems known to be hard for (O)MP. Matching Pursuit was extended to build kernel-based solutions to machine learning problems, resulting in the sparse regression algorithm, Kernel Matching, Pursuit (KMP) [17]. We develop a new algorithm to build sparse kernel-based solutions using PFP, which we call Kernel Polytope Faces Pursuit (KPFP).

The comparison of results with reference networks, by means of similarity measures and mill models, allows us to measure the significance of results, as well as their predictive power. The use of Generalised Linear Models allows us to explain the results in terms of available ground truth which we expect, to be partially relevant. We present these methods for the case of inferring a network of News Outlets based oil their preference of stories to cover. We, compare three simple network inference methods and show how our technique, can be Used to choose between them.

In this work, we develop a general approach to supervised learning by leveraging higher-order dependencies between features. We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for Classification named Higher Order Naive Bayes (HONB). Unlike approaches that assume data instances are independent, HONB leverages co-occurrence relations between feature values across different instances. Additionally, we generalize our framework by developing a novel data-driven space transformation that allows any classifier operating in vector spaces to take advantage of theses higher-order co-occurrence relations. Results obtained on several benchmark text corpora demonstrate that higher-order approaches achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy over the baseline (first-order) methods.

Automatically translating natural language questions into SQL queries, would allow for the design of effective and useful database systems from a. user viewpoint. Interesting previous work has been focused oil the use of, machine learning algorithms for automatically mapping natural language (NL) questions to SQL queries. In this paper, we present many structural kernels and their combinations for inducing the relational semantics between pairs of NL questions and SQL queries. We measure the effectiveness of such kernels by using them in Support; Vector Machines to select the queries that correctly answer to NL questions. Experimental results oil two different datasets show that our approach is viable and that syntactic information under the form of pairs of syntactic tree fragments (from queries and questions) plays a major role in deriving the relational semantics between the two languages.

Currently such classification requires a large amount of domain expert time. We show that a combination of phase invariant similarity and explicit features extracted from the time series provide domain export level classification. To facilitate, this application, we investigate the cross-correlation as a general phase invariant similarity function for time series. We establish several theoretical properties of cross-correlation showing that it is intuitively appealing and algorithmically tractable, but not positive semidefinite, and therefore not generally applicable with kernel methods. As a, solution we introduce a positive semidefinite similarity function with the same intuitive appeal as cross-correlation. An experimental evaluation in the astronomy domain as well as several other data, sets demonstrates the performance of the kernel and related similarity functions.

Semi-supervised learning and multi-task learning are two of the approaches that have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we seek to integrate these two approaches for regession applications. We first propose a new Supervised multi-task regression method called SMTR, which is based on Gaussian processes (GP) with the assumption that the kernel parameters for all tasks share a common prior. We then incorporate unlabeled data into SMTR by changing the kernel function of the GP prior to a data-dependent Kernel function, resulting in a semi-supervised extension of SMTR, called SSMTR. Moreover, we incorporate pairwise information into SSMTR to further boost the learning performance for applications in which such information is available. Experiments conducted on two commonly used data sets for multi-task regression demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

In this paper we take a detailed look at the problem of modeling and optimization of network computing systems for parallel decision tree induction methods. First, we present a comprehensive discussion on mentioned induction methods with a special focus on their parallel versions. Next, we propose a generic optimization model of a network computing system that can be used for distributed implementation of parallel decision trees. To illustrate our work we provide results of numerical experiments showing that the distributed approach enables significant improvement of the system throughput.

These algorithms are based on nondeterministic decision rules that are called template's decision rules. The conditional part of these rules is a template and the decision part is satisfactorily small set of decisions. Only rules with suficiently large support are used. The proposed classification algorithms were tested on the group of decision tables from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Results of experiments show that the classification algorithms based on template's decision rules are often better than the algorithms based on deterministic decision rules.

One of the type of prior information for classification task is knowledge on the data. Here we will propose another type of prior knowledge, for which a distance from decision boundary to selected data samples (detractors) is maximised. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a widely used algorithm for data classification. Detractors will be incorporated into SVMs by weighting the samples. For the reason, that standard C-SVM sample weights are not suitable for maximising the distance to selected points, additional SVM weights will be proposed. We will show that detractors can enhance the classification quality for areas with lack of training samples and for time series classification. We will demonstrate that incorporating detractors to stock price predictive models can lead to increased investment profits.

Use of machine-learning algorithms for the automated detection of cold-water coral habitats: a pilot study	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Machine-learning; Image analysis; ROV; Lophelia pertusa; Geodia baretti; Mycale lingua; Cold-water coral; MPA	LOPHELIA-PERTUSA SCLERACTINIA; PORCUPINE SEABIGHT; CARBONATE MOUNDS; HYPERBOLIC SOM; NE ATLANTIC; DEEP; SEA; IMPACTS; REEFS; BIOLOGY	Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as important biodiversity hotspots on the continental margin. The location of terrain features likely to be associated with living reef has been made easier by recent developments in acoustic sensing technology. For accurate assessment and fine-scale mapping of these newly identified coral habitats, analysis of video data is still required. In the present study we explore the potential of manual and automatic abundance estimation of cold-water corals and sponges from still image frames extracted from video footage from Tisler Reef (Skagerrak, Norway). The results and processing times from 3 standard visual assessment methods (15-point quadrat, 100-point quadrat and frame mapping) are compared with those produced by a new computer vision system. This system uses machine-learning algorithms to detect species within frames automatically. Cold-water coral density estimates obtained from the automated method were similar to those gained by the other methods. The automated method slightly underestimated (by 10 to 20%) coral coverage in frames which lacked a uniform seabed illumination. However, it did much better in the detection of small live coral fragments than the 15-point method. For assessing sponge coverage, the automated system did not perform as satisfactorily. It mistook a percentage of the seabed for sponge (0.1 to 2% of most frames) and underestimated sponge coverage in frames that contained many sponges. Results indicate that the machine-learning approach is appropriate for estimating live cold-water coral density, but further work is required before the system can be applied to sponges within the reef environment.

The motivations for using an increasing filter instead of an unconstrained filter have been described as: 1) fast and efficient implementation, 2) the relationship to mathematical morphology and 3) more precise estimation with finite sample data. This last motivation is related to methods developed in machine learning and the relationship was explored in (I]. In this paper we investigate this relationship by applying Stack Filters directly to classification problems. This provides a new perspective on how monotonicity constraints can help control estimation errors, and also suggests new learning algorithms for Boolean function classifiers when they are applied to real-valued inputs.

Sixty percent of P. falciparum genes have no known function and therefore new methods of gene function prediction are needed. To address this problem, we train a naive Bayes classifier on multiple sources of data and subsequently apply a modified version of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Algorithm to predict gene function in P. falciparum. To define gene function, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology, specifically using the Biological Process category. We demonstrate the value of integrating multiple data sources by achieving accurate predictions on genes that cannot be annotated using simple sequence similarity based methods.	[Tedder, Philip M.

In Buteau 2006 we presented a model extension of an earlier approach in order to integrate the concept of melodic clustering in motivic spaces, demonstrated an application to the soprano voice of Schumann's Traumerei, and provided a comparison with a human-made segmentation (clustering) analysis (Repp 1992) and a machine learning approach (Cambouropoulos and Widmer 2000). In this short paper, we present our novel dynamic visualization of melodic clustering in OpenMusic software, and extend our initial analysis of Traumerei to multi-voice clustering.

The robot must find shortest route from given origin to the target position. Moreover, it should be able to memorize the environment and, if it faces known world, execute already learned trajectory found by HBMA solver, or solve the world and memorize the trajectory for the given environment. This is done using Adaptive Resonance Theory based neural network. This way simulated robot is able to navigate through environment and to continuously increase its knowledge.

We also show applications of anatomical labeling on a bronchoscopy guidance system. This paper performs automated labeling by using machine learning and combination optimization. The actual procedure consists of four steps: (a) extraction of tree structures of the bronchus regions extracted from CT images, (b) construction of AdaBoost classifiers, (c) computation of candidate names for all branches by using the classifiers, (d) selection of best combination of anatomical names. We applied the proposed method to 90 cases of 3D CT datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can assign correct anatomical names to 86.9% of the bronchial branches up to the sub-segmental lobe branches. Also, we overlaid the anatomical names of bronchial branches on real bronchoscopic views to guide real bronchoscopy.

Several recent papers have demonstrated that Such classification is possible with MR or PET images, using machine learning methods Such as SVM and boosting. These algorithms learn the classifier Using one type of image data. However, AD is not well characterized by one imaging modality alone, and analysis is typically performed using several image types - each measuring a different type of structural/functional characteristic. This paper explores the AD classification problem using multiple modalities simultaneously. The difficulty here is to assess the relevance of each modality (which cannot be assumed a priori), as well as to optimize the classifier. To tackle this problem, We Utilize and adapt a recently developed idea called Multi-Kernel learning (MKL). Briefly, each imaging modality spawns one (or more kernels) and we simultaneously solve for the kernel weights and a maximum margin classifier. To make the model robust, we propose strategies to suppress the influence of a small subset Of Outliers on the classifier - this yields an alternative minimization based algorithm for robust MKL. We present promising multi-modal classification experiments oil a large dataset of images from the ADNI project.

In this technique physics-based computations using finite elements are used to generate a massive database to train neural networks during an offline pre-computation step. These neural networks are used during real time computations, resulting in massive computational efficiency. The significance of the method is that, for the first time, linear and nonlinear simulations may be performed with almost the same operational complexity. Additionally, the quality of the real time computations may be easily controlled by scaling the number of neurons used in the computations. This system provides a unique platform to leverage the computational speed and scalability of soft computation methods for real time interactive simulations.

The A CO is a metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of real ants, where they search optimal solutions by considering both local heuristic and previous knowledge, observed by pheromone changes. In this paper we study a parallel implementation of the Ant-Miner algorithm developed by Parpinelli, Lopes and Freitas for rule induction. The main idea in this paper is to speed up the searching process and diminish the standard deviations obtained in the sequential version of this algorithm. This algorithm is suited for parallelization in the multi-ants population contrary to the standard proposition, when the performance of single ant is observed. The comparative study will be carried out using the 4 data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Parallelization of Ant-Miner demonstrates the improvement of the obtained results. It demonstrates also that high-performance computing of this approach is feasible to analyze large data sets from Machine Learning repository.

This paper presents an exploratory study carried out in the contents of four public repositories that uses clustering and association rule mining algorithms to extract characterizations of repository contents. The results of the analysis include potential relationships between different attributes of learning objects that may be useful to gain an understanding of the kind of resources available and eventually develop search mechanisms that consider repository descriptions as a criteria in federated search.

ANLAGIS can be applied to both pattern recognition and learning control problems. Another interesting contribution of this paper is the distinction between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic learning in artificial neural networks. To illustrate the capabilities of ANLAGIS some experiments on knowledge discovery in data mining and machine learning are presented. Previous work of Jang et al. [1] on adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems, or simply ANFIS, can be considered a precursor of ANLAGIS. The main, novel contribution of ANLAGIS is the incorporation of Learning Automata Theory within its structure.

Alternative machine-learning approaches perform better in classification tasks but require long learning sessions to build an optimized representational space. Here we present a radically new approach to the problem of classification based on the fact that networks associated to random hard constraint satisfaction problems display naturally an exponentially large number of attractor clusters. We introduce a warning propagation dynamics that allows selective mapping of arbitrary input vector onto these well-separated clusters of states, without need of training. The potential for Such networks with exponential capacity to handle inputs with a combinatorially complex structure is finally explored with a toy-example.

A Sensitivity Clustering Method for Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms	METHODS AND MODELS IN ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL COMPUTATION, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Work-Conference on the Interplay Between Natural and Artificial Computation	JUN 22-26, 2009	Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN				FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK	The machine learning community has traditionally used the correct classification rate or accuracy to measure the performance of a classifier, generally avoiding the presentation of the sensitivities (i.e. the classification level of each class) in the results, especially in problems with more than two classes. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are powerful global optimization techniques but they axe very poor in terms of convergence performance. Consequently, they axe frequently combined with Local Search (LS) algorithms that can converge in a few iterations. This paper proposes a new method for hybridizing EAs and LS techniques in a classification context, based on a clustering method that applies the k-means algorithm in the sensitivity space, obtaining groups of individuals that perform similarly for the different classes. Then, a representative of each group is selected and it is improved by a LS procedure. This method is applied in specific stages of the evolutionary process and we consider the minimum sensitivity and the accuracy as the evaluation measures. The proposed method is found to obtain classifiers with a better accuracy for each class than the application of the LS over the best individual of the population.

We have supplied our students with a scrutable (manageable and understandable) web application that shows an ontology, which includes collaborative features. The ontology structures collaboration context information, which has been obtained form explicit (based on questionnaires) and implicit methods (supported by several machine learning techniques). From two consecutive years of experiences with hundreds of students we researched students' interactions to find implicit methods to identify and characterize students' collaboration. Based on the outcomes of our experiments we claim that showing useful and structured information to students and tutors about students' collaborative features can have a twofold beneficial impact on students learning and on the management of their collaboration.

Image content analysis enables us to use more natural, human-level concepts for querying large collections of images typically found in multimedia databases. Out of the numerous features proposed for image content description those based on frequency representation are of special interest as they often offer high levels of invariance to distortions and noise. In this chapter several frequency domain methods designed to describe different aspects of an image, i.e. contour, texture and shape are discussed. Current standards and database solutions supporting content-based image retrieval, including SQL Multimedia and Application Packages, Oracle 9i/10g interMedia and MPEG-7, are also presented.

Rule-based Clustering for Gene Promoter Structure Discovery	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Intelligent Data Analysis in Biomedicine and Pharmacology	JUL 08, 2007	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS			Promoter analysis; gene expression analysis; machine learning; rule-based clustering	MICROARRAY DATA; BINDING SITES; ELEMENTS; GENOME; CODE	Background: The genetic cellular response to internal and external changes is determined by the sequence and structure of gene-regulatory promoter regions. Objectives: Using data on gene-regulatory elements (i.e., either putative or known transcription factor binding sites) and data on gene expression profiles we can discover structural elements in promoter regions and infer the underlying programs of gene regulation. Such hypotheses obtained in silico can greatly assist us in experiment planning. The principal obstacle for such approaches is the combinatorial explosion in different combinations of promoter elements to be examined. Methods: Stemming from several state-of-the-art machine learning approaches we here propose a heuristic, rule-based clustering method that uses gene expression similarity to guide the search for informative structures in promoters, thus exploring only the most promising parts of the vast and expressively rich rule-space. Results: We present the utility of the method in the analysis of gene expression data on budding yeast S. cerevisiae where cells were induced to proliferate peroxisomes. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to infer informative relations uncovering relatively complex structures in gene promoter regions that regulate gene expression.

DCE-MRI Data Analysis for Cancer Area Classification	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Intelligent Data Analysis in Biomedicine and Pharmacology	JUL 08, 2007	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS			DCE-MRI; cluster analysis; classification; SVM	MEAN SHIFT; CONTRAST; MODEL	Objectives: The paper aims at improving the support of medical researchers in the context of in-vivo cancer imaging. Morphological and functional parameters obtained by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) techniques are analyzed, which aim at investigating the development of tumor microvessels. The main contribution consists in proposing a machine learning methodology to segment automatically these MRI data, by isolating tumor areas with different meaning, in a histological sense. Methods: The proposed approach is based on a three-step procedure: i) robust feature extraction from raw time-intensity curves, ii) voxel segmentation, and iii) voxel classification based on a learning-by-example approach. In the first step, few robust features that compactly represent the response of the tissue to the DCE-MRI analysis are computed. The second step provides a segmentation based on the mean shift (MS) paradigm, which has recently shown to be robust and useful for different and heterogeneous clustering tasks. Finally, in the third step, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify voxels according to the labels obtained by the clustering phase (i.e., each class corresponds to a cluster). indeed, the SVM is able to classify new unseen subjects with the same kind of tumor. Results: Experiments on different subjects affected by the same kind of tumor evidence that the extracted regions by both the MS clustering and the SVM classifier exhibit a precise medical meaning, as carefully validated by the medical researchers. Moreover, our approach is more stable and robust than methods based on quantification of DCE-MRI data by means of pharmacokinetic models. Conclusions: The proposed method allows to analyze the DCE-MRI data more precisely and faster than previous automated or manual approaches.

As a critical part of this technology, our objective is to design software algorithms that recognize and assess the consistency of activities of daily living that individuals perform in their own homes. Methods: We have designed algorithms that automatically learn Markov models for each class of activity. These models are used to recognize activities that are performed in a smart home and to identify errors and inconsistencies in the performed activity. Results: We validate our approach using data collected from 60 volunteers who performed a series of activities in our smart apartment testbed. The results indicate that the algorithms correctly label the activities and successfully assess the completeness and consistency of the performed task. Conclusions: Our results indicate that activity recognition and assessment can be automated using machine learning algorithms and smart home technology. These algorithms will be useful for automating remote health monitoring and interventions.	[Cook, D.

This study is aimed at combining computational geometry methods with machine learning algorithms for classification of inorganic solid materials of known structure. Zeolite crystals are used for the pilot study where a model based on the topology is developed for classification of the compound by mineral name and by zeolite framework type. The topological descriptors are derived from the Delaunay tessellation for 220 zeolites contained in the inorganic crystal structure database. This zeolite-structure-predictor (ZSP) is trained for classifying this set of selected zeolite crystals into 22 different types of minerals and into 13 framework types. The ZSP is based on the random forest algorithm and contains attributes of Delaunay simplex properties such as tetrahedrality index, frequency of simplex occurrence, and site occupation probability. The ZSP is able to obtain classification in this multitude of classes with more than 81% of correctly classified instances based on framework type. The model shows that the classification into framework types is superior, and that the classification into mineral names is not structurally unique. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In recent years video streaming over MANETs has drawn significant attention due to the popularity of high-speed IEEE 802.11 standard series. However, it is still a challenging task for channel variation and bandwidth limitation and fluctuation. In this paper a priority based cross-layer transmission scheme using the idea of "unequal protection" is proposed to improve video transmission quality of MANETs. Priorities are determined by video coding algorithm and submitted to network layer and MAC layer so that packet routing and frame scheduling algorithms could forward video data according to their priorities. Proposed scheme provides coding adaptivity through priority assignment and transmission adaptivity through machine learning methods.

Artificial immunisation algorithm (AIA) is used to optimise the parameters in PSO in this paper. The AIA is a new optimisation method based on the biologic immune principle of human being and other living beings. It can effectively avoid the premature convergence and guarantees the variety of solution. With the parameters optimised by AIA, the total capability of the PSO classifier is improved. The fault diagnosis of mine hosit shows that the PSO optimised by AIA can give higher recognition accuracy than the normal PSO.

The analysis of learning and testing of data sets (generated for the selected analog system) allows determining the difficulty of the system for the diagnostic procedure. This helps to compare different artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches used to detect, locate and identify faults. The versatile method of the data sets' difficulty based on the graph clustering algorithm is proposed and explained. It is then applied to test two advanced methods: fuzzy logic and rough sets against the sixth order Butterworth lowpass filter. The paper is concluded with future prospects of the proposed method.

Detection of Seam Carving and Localization of Seam Insertions in Digital Images	MM&SEC'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 ACM SIGMM MULTIMEDIA AND SECURITY WORKSHOP			English	Proceedings Paper	11th ACM Multimedia and Security Workshop	SEP 07-08, 2009	Princeton, NJ	ACM SIGMM		Image forensics; Markov features; Seam carving; Seam insertion; Steganalysis features; Tamper detection	FORGERIES	"Seam carving" is a recently introduced content aware image resizing algorithm. This method can also be used for image tampering. In this paper, we explore techniques to detect seam carving (or seam insertion) without knowledge of the original image. We employ a machine learning based framework to distinguish between seam-carved (or seam-inserted) and normal images. It is seen that the 324-dimensional Markov feature, consisting of 2D difference histograms in the block-based Discrete Cosine Transform domain, is well-suited for the classification task. The feature yields a detection accuracy of 80% and 85% for seam carving and seam insertion, respectively. For seam insertion, each new pixel that is introduced is a linear combination of its neighboring pixels. We detect seam insertions based on this linear relation, with a high detection accuracy of 94% even for very low seam insertion rates. We show that the Markov feature is also useful for scaling and rotation detection.	[Sarkar, Anindya; Nataraj, Lakshmanan; Manjunath, B.

However, in order for such a device to be Suitable for long-term wear, it must be both comfortable and lightweight. Typical state-of-the-art non-invasive seizure onset detection algorithms require 2 1 scalp electrodes to be placed oil the head. These electrodes are used to generate 18 data streams, called channels The large number of electrodes is inconvenient for the patient and processing 18 channels can consume a considerable amount of energy, a problem for a battery-powered device In this paper, we describe an automated way to construct detector-3 that use fewer channels, and thus fewer electrodes. Starting from an existing technique for constructing 18 channel patient-specific detectors, we use machine learning to automatically construct reduced channel detectors We evaluate our algorithm on data from 16 patients used in all earlier study. On average, our algorithm reduced the number of channels from 18 to 4.6 while decreasing the mean fraction of seizure onsets detected from 99% to 9 90 7, For 12 out of the 16 patients, there was no degradation in the detection rate. While the average detection latency increased from 7 8 s to 11 2 s. the average rate of false alarms per hour decreased from 0 35 to 0 19. We also describe a prototype implementation of a single channel EEC monitoring device built using off-the-shelf components, and use this implementation to derive all energy consumption model. Using fewer channels reduced file average energy Consumption by 69%, which amounts to a 3 3x increase in battery lifetime Finally, we show how additional energy savings call be realized by using a low-power screening detector to rule out segments of data that are obviously not seizures. Though this technique does not reduce the number of electrodes needed, it does reduce the energy consumption by an additional 16%	[Shih, Eugene I.; Shoeb, Ali H.; Guttag, John V.] MIT, Dept EECS, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA	Shih, EI (reprint author), MIT, Dept EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.	eishih@mit.edu; ashoeb@mit.edu; guttag@mit.edu					Agarwal Y, 2007, MOBISYS '07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES, P179; Avestruz AT, 2008, IEEE J SOLID-ST CIRC, V43, P3006, DOI 10.1109/JSSC.2008.2006460; BENBASAT AY, 2007, P 5 ACM C EMB NETW S, P219, DOI 10.1145/1322263.1322285; CHANG C, 2001, LIBSVM LIBR SUPP VEC; Cristianini N., 2000, INTRO SUPPORT VECTOR; Dutta P., 2005, INFORM PROCESSING SE, P497, DOI 10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440983; Flinn J., 1999, S OP SYST PRINC, P48; Freund Y, 1997, J COMPUT SYST SCI, V55, P119, DOI 10.1006/jcss.1997.1504; GLASSMAN E, 2006, IEEE EMBS 2006, P2175; Guyon I, 2002, MACH LEARN, V46, P389, DOI 10.1023/A:1012487302797; Guyon I., 2003, Journal of Machine Learning Research, V3, DOI 10.1162/153244303322753616; Kohavi R, 1997, ARTIF INTELL, V97, P273, DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00043-X; Kravets R., 1998, MobiCom'98.

Therefore incremental techniques have been developed to facilitate batch SVM learning. In this chapter we propose a new incremental technique called Incremental Twin Support Vector Machines for training in batch mode. This technique is based on a newly developed classifier, called Twin Support Vector Machines (TWSVM) classifier. The TWSVM classifier determines two non-parallel planes by solving two related support vector machines-type problems, each of which is smaller than in a conventional Incremental SVM. Numerical implementation on several benchmark datasets has shown that the Incremental Twin SVM is not only fast, but also has good generalization.

This chapter will present a classification study of different categories of companies on the basis of their various financial attributes using a quadratic optimization based classifier namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). We have also used this model for sector wise classification of the company. To validate the performance, we compared the results with the ratings for companies provided by ICICI direct, a well known trading website in Indian stock market. The comparison shows that the model generated by SVM is efficient and the results obtained using this technique are quite impressive.

These advances have often accompanied reductions in personnel resources and a diminishing expertise base. Conversely, the resolution of problems in the global manufacturing complex increasingly go beyond the abilities of individual experts and can be very time consuming as the process is influenced by a large number of, often, interactive variables. The application of expert systems in the textile industry can help address many of these problems more effectively and economically.

J	Park, K; Lee, S; Ahn, HS; Kim, D				Park, Keunwan; Lee, Soyoung; Ahn, Hee-Sung; Kim, Dongsup			Predicting the multi-modal binding propensity of small molecules: towards an understanding of drug promiscuity	MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article							MULTIPLE TARGETS; MAGIC BULLETS; PROTEIN; NETWORK; DISCOVERY; DESIGN; H-1-ANTIHISTAMINES; CLASSIFICATION; SPECIFICITY; REGRESSION	Drug promiscuity is one of the key issues in current drug development. Many famous drugs have turned out to behave unexpectedly due to their propensity to bind to multiple targets. One of the primary reasons for this promiscuity is that drugs bind to multiple distinctive target environments, a feature that we call multi-modal binding. Accordingly, investigations into whether multi-modal binding propensities can be predicted, and if so, whether the features determining this behavior can be found, would be an important advance. In this study, we have developed a structure-based classifier that predicts whether small molecules will bind to multiple distinct binding sites. The binding sites for all ligands in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were clustered by binding site similarity, and the ligands that bind to many dissimilar binding sites were identified as multi-modal binding ligands. The mono-binding ligands were also collected, and the classifiers were built using various machine-learning algorithms. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure showed 70-85% accuracy depending on the choice of machine-learning algorithm, and the different definitions used to identify multi-modal binding ligands. In addition, a quantified importance measurement for global and local descriptors was also provided, which suggests that the local features are more likely to have an effect on multi-modal binding than the global ones. The interpretable global and local descriptors were also ranked by their importance. To test the classifier on real examples, several test sets including well-known promiscuous drugs were collected by a literature and database search. Despite the difficulty in constructing appropriate testable sets, the classifier showed reasonable results that were consistent with existing information on drug behavior. Finally, a test on natural enzyme substrates and artificial drugs suggests that the natural compounds tend to exhibit a broader range of multi-modal binding than the drugs.

Identification and analysis of essential genes is key to understanding the systems level organization of living cells. On the other hand, the ability to predict these genes in pathogens is of great importance for directed drug development. Global analysis of protein interaction networks provides an effective way to elucidate the relationships between genes. It has been found that essential genes tend to be highly connected and generally have more interactions than nonessential ones. With recent large-scale identifications of essential genes and protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, we have systematically investigated the topological properties of essential and nonessential genes in the protein-protein interaction networks. Essential genes tend to play topologically more important roles in protein interaction networks. Many topological features were found to be statistically discriminative between essential and nonessential genes. In addition, we have also examined sequence properties such as open reading frame length, strand, and phyletic retention for their association with the gene essentiality. Employing the topological features in the protein interaction network and the sequence properties, we have built a machine learning classifier capable of predicting essential genes. Computational prediction of essential genes circumvents expensive and difficult experimental screens and will help antimicrobial drug development.

Prediction of conditional gene essentiality through graph theoretical analysis of genome-wide functional linkages	MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; COMPLEX NETWORKS; PROTEIN NETWORKS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; CENTRALITY; YEAST; DISPENSABILITY; SYSTEM	The genome of an organism characterizes the complete set of genes that it is capable of encoding. However, not all of the genes are transcribed and translated under any defined condition. The robustness that an organism exhibits to environmental perturbations is partly conferred by the genes that are constitutively expressed under all the conditions, and partly by a subset of genes that are induced under the defined conditions. The conditional importance of genes in conferring robustness can be understood in the context of the functional attributes of these genes and their correlations to the defined environmental conditions. However, a priori prediction of such genes for a given condition is yet not possible. We have attempted such predictions by integrating the available gene expression data with genome-wide functional linkages through the well known centrality-lethality correlations in graph theory. We make use of three distinct concepts of centrality, namely, degree, closeness and betweenness, which yield mutually complementary information. We then demonstrate the efficacy of combined graph theoretical and machine learning approaches in ranking essential nodes from a large network of genome-wide functional linkages, which yields predictions with high accuracy. We therefore perceive such predictions as highly useful in applications such as defining and prioritizing drug targets.

In recent years, both, advanced representations and machine learning methods, have proved to yield high recognition performance while keeping false detection rates low. However, building general detectors applicable to a wide range of scenes leads to high model complexity and thus to unnecessarily complex detectors. To alleviate this problem, we propose to train scene-specific object detectors by co-training from multiple cameras. The main idea is that each camera holds a separate classifier, which is trained by online learning incorporating (detection) information from other cameras. Thus, incrementally better scene-specific classifiers can be obtained. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we performed experiments on two data sets for two and three cameras, respectively. We show that, with the proposed approach, state-of-the-art detection results can be obtained without requiring a great number of training samples.	[Roth, P.

Specifically, we estimate the generalization capability of two feature extraction schemes extracted from supra-segmental and segmental information. In addition, two machine learning approaches are considered: k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and Gaussian mixture models (GMM).

Recently, this classical approach has been embedded in the Error-Correcting Output Codes framework (ECOC). This framework is based on a coding step, where a set of binary problems are learnt and coded in a matrix, and a decoding step, where a new sample is tested and classified according to a comparison with the positions of the coded matrix. In this paper, we present a novel approach to redefine without retraining, in a problem-dependent way, the one-versus-one coding matrix so that the new coded information increases the generalization capability of the system. Moreover, the final classification can be tuned with the inclusion of a weighting matrix in the decoding step. The approach has been validated over several UCI Machine Learning repository data sets and two real multi-class problems: traffic sign and face categorization. The results show that performance improvements are obtained when comparing the new approach to one of the best ECOC designs (one-versus-one). Furthermore, the novel methodology obtains at least the same performance than the one-versus-one ECOC design.

One problem is posed by the reality that usually there are multiple human operators doing the inspection, who will inevitable contradict each other occasionally. In this paper a framework is proposed which is able to deal with this issue, based on trained ensembles of classifiers. Most ensemble techniques have however difficulties learning in these circumstances. Therefore several novel enhancements to the Grading ensemble technique are proposed within this framework called Active Grading. The Active Grading algorithm is evaluated on data obtained from a real-world industrial system for visual quality inspection of the printing of labels on CDs, which was labelled independently by four different human operators and their supervisor, and compared to the standard Grading algorithm and a range of other ensemble (classifier fusion) techniques.

Our goal is to go one step further in the understanding of RF mechanisms by studying the parametrization of the reference algorithm Forest-RI. In this algorithm, a randomization principle is used during the tree induction process, that randomly selects K features at each node, among which the best split is chosen. The strength of randomization in the tree induction is thus led by the hyperparameter K which plays an important role for building accurate RF classifiers. We have decided to focus our experimental study on this hyperparameter and on its influence on classification accuracy. For that purpose, we have evaluated the Forest-RI algorithm on several machine learning problems and with different settings of Kin order to understand the way it acts on RF performance. We show that default values of K traditionally used in the literature are globally near-optimal, except for some cases for which they are all significatively sub-optimal. Thus additional experiments have been led on those datasets, that highlight the crucial role played by feature relevancy in finding the optimal setting of K.

In this paper we propose a novel ensemble algorithm for multilabel, multi-path, tree-structured hierarchical classification problems based on the true path rule borrowed from the Gene Ontology. Local base classifiers, each specialized to recognize a single class of the hierarchy, exchange information between them to achieve a global "consensus" ensemble decision. A two-way asymmetric flow of information crosses the tree-structured ensemble: positive predictions for a node influence its ancestors, while negative predictions influence its offsprings. The resulting True Path Rule hierarchical ensemble is applied to the prediction of gene function in the yeast, using the FunCat taxonomy and biomolecular data obtained from high-throughput biotechnologies.

While the MCS community has been focused mainly on the latter, our paper is concerned with questions that arise from ensembles of generative models. Generative models provide us with neat ways of thinking about two interesting learning issues: model selection and semi-supervised learning. Preliminary results show that for semi-supervised low-variance generative models, traditional MCS techniques like Bagging and Random Sub-space Method (RSM) do not outperform the single classifier approach. However, RSM introduces diversity between base classifiers. This starting point suggests that diversity between base components has to lie within the structure of the base classifier, and not in the dataset, and it highlights the need for novel generative ensemble learning techniques.

This assumption does not hold true in many real cases. Sequential learning is the discipline of machine learning that deals with dependent data such that neighboring examples exhibit some kind of relationship. In the literature, there are different approaches that try to capture and exploit this correlation, by means of different methodologies. In this paper we focus on meta-learning strategies and, in particular, the stacked sequential learning approach. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: first, we generalize the stacked sequential learning. This generalization reflects the key role of neighboring interactions modeling. Second, we propose an effective and efficient way of capturing and exploiting sequential correlations that takes into account long-range interactions by means of a multi-scale pyramidal decomposition of the predicted labels. Additionally, this new method subsumes the standard stacked sequential learning approach. We tested the proposed method on two different classification tasks: text lines classification in a FAQ data set and image classification. Results on these tasks clearly show that our approach outperforms the standard stacked sequential learning. Moreover, we show that the proposed method allows to control the trade-off between the detail and the desired range of the interactions.

Many of these methods fall into the field of study of machine learning. Some of the most effective algorithms in this domain succeed by combining a number of distinct predictive elements to form what can be described as a type of committee. Well known examples of such algorithms are AdaBoost, bagging and random forests. Stochastic discrimination is a committee-forming algorithm that attempts to combine a large number of relatively simple predictive elements in an effort to achieve a high degree of accuracy. A key element of the success of this technique is that its coverage of the observed feature space should be uniform in nature. We introduce a new uniformity enforcement method, which on benchmark datasets, leads to greater predictive efficiency than the currently published method.

Binary linear models, trained on-line on images seen by the robot at different points in time, are added to a model library as the robot navigates. To predict terrain in a given image, each model in the library is applied to feature data, from that image, and the models' predictions are combined according to a single-layer (flat) ME approach. Although these simple linear models have excellent discrimination in their local area in feature space, they do not generalize well to other types of terrain, and must be applied carefully. We use the distribution of training data as the source of the a priori pointwise mixture coefficients that form the soft gating network in the ME model. Single-class Gaussian models are learned during training, then later used to perform density estimation of incoming data points, resulting in pointwise estimates of model applicability. The combined output given by ME thus permits models to abstain front making predictions for certain parts of the image. We show that this method outperforms a less sophisticated, non-local baseline method in a statistically significant evaluation using natural datasets taken from the domain.

Traditional approaches to text categorization require encoding documents into numerical vectors which leads to the two main problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution in each numerical vector. In this research, documents are encoded into string vectors instead of numerical vectors, and a new neural network called NTC which receive a string vector as its input vector is used for text categorization. The goal of this research is to avoid the two main problems by encoding documents into alternative structured data to numerical vectors. We will validate the performance of NTC by comparing it with other machine learning algorithms on the standard test bed, Reuter 21578.

However the precision of an ICS is degraded by the presence of Triangle Inequality Violations (TIVs). Simple methods have been proposed to detect TIVs, based e.g. on the empirical observation that a TIV is more likely when the distance is underestimated by the coordinates. in this paper, we apply supervised machine learning techniques to try and derive more powerful criteria to detect TIVs. We first show that (ensembles of) Decision Trees (DTs) learnt on our datasets are very good models for this problem. Moreover, our approach brings out a discriminative variable (called OREE), which combines the classical estimation error with the variance of the estimated distance. This variable alone is as good as an ensemble of DTs, and provides a much simpler criterion. If every node of the ICS sorts its neighbours according to OREE, we show that cutting these lists after a given number of neighbours, or when OREE crosses a given threshold value, achieves very good performance to detect TIVs.

The discrimination process is then separated into two stages: a projection stage that reduces the dimensionality of the data by projecting it on a line and a threshold stage where the distributions of the projected patterns of both classes are separated. For this, we extend the popular mean-of-class prototype classification using algorithms from machine learning that satisfy a set of invariance properties. We report a simple yet general approach to express different types of linear classification algorithms in an identical and easy-to-visualize formal framework using generalized prototypes where these prototypes are used to express the normal vector and offset of the hyperplane. We investigate non-margin classifiers such as the classical prototype classifier, the Fisher classifier, and the relevance vector machine. We then study hard and soft margin classifiers such as the support vector machine and a boosted version of the prototype classifier. Subsequently, we relate mean-of-class prototype classification to other classification algorithms by showing that the prototype classifier is a limit of any soft margin classifier and that boosting a prototype classifier yields the support vector machine. While giving novel insights into classification per se by presenting a common and unified formalism, our generalized prototype framework also provides an efficient visualization and a principled comparison of machine learning classification.

Based on the deep analysis of virtual classification tree based hierarchical text classification, combining the two application models of single document adjustment after classification and new sample set learning, a dynamic online learning algorithm and a sample set incremental learning algorithm are put forward. By amending classifiers and updating the feature space, the algorithms improve the current classification models.

The construction of the new covariance function and the proof of its positive semi-definiteness are based on geometric reasoning combined with analytic computations.

This paper proposes two methods for estimating the driver's phase by applying machine learning techniques to the sequences of brake signals. One method models the signal set with a mixture of Gaussians, where a. Gaussian corresponds to a phase. The other method classifies a segment of the brake sequence to one of the hidden Markov models, each of which represents a phase. These methods are validated with experimental data, and are shown to be consistent with each other for the collected data from an unconstrained drive.

A pair of duo output neural networks is created. The first neural network is trained to provide two outputs which are the truth and the falsity values. The second neural network is also trained to provide two outputs; however, the sequence of the outputs is organized in reverse order of the first one. Therefore, the two outputs of this neural network is the falsity and the truth values. All the truth and the non-falsity values obtained from both neural networks are then averaged to give the final output. We experiment our proposed approach to the classical benchmark problems which are housing, concrete compressive strength, and computer hardware data, sets from the UCI machine learning repository. It is found that the proposed approach provides better performance when compared to the complementary neural networks, backpropagation neural networks, and support vector regression with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function kernels.

Experimental results show that the performance of the NNTrees is usually better than that of the traditional univariate DTs. In addition, the NNTrees are more usable than the single model fully connected NNs because their structures can be determined automatically in the induction process. Recently, we proposed an algorithm that can induce the NNTrees efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose to improve the performance of the NNTrees further through fine-tuning of the threshold of each internal node. Experimental results on several public databases show that, although the proposed method is very simple, the performance of the NNTrees can be improved in most cases, and in some cases, the improvement is even significant.

Namely, we explore how to incorporate confidence values introduced in each primitive training sample and compute these values automatically into machine learning. In the proposed SVMAC we use both the labels of training samples and the label confidence which projected by a monotonic function as input. The main contribution of SVMAC is that the confidence value of each training sample is calculated by some common algorithms, such as SVM, Neural Network and so on, for gender classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SVMAC can improve classification accuracy dramatically.

The problem addressed here consists of classifying streaming data which not only are unlabeled, but also have a number 1 of attributes arriving after some time delay T. In this context, the main issues are what to do when the unlabeled incomplete samples and, later on, their missing attributes arrive; when and how to classify these incoming samples; and when and how to update the training set. Three different strategies (for l = 1 and constant T) are explored and evaluated in terms of the accumulated classification error. The results reveal that the proposed on-line strategies, despite their simplicity, may outperform classifiers using only the original, labeled-and-complete samples as a fixed training set. In other words, learning is possible by properly tapping into the unlabeled, incomplete samples, and their delayed attributes. The many research issues identified include a better understanding of the link between the inherent properties of the data set and the design of the most suitable on-line classification strategy.

Recently, many two-locus and multi-locus analysis techniques have been shown to be promising for the epistasis detection. However, exhaustive multi-locus analysis requires prohibitively large computational efforts when problems involve large-scale or genome-wide data. Furthermore, there is no explicit proof that a combination of multiple two-locus analyses can lead to the correct identification of multi-locus interactions. 2LOmb which performs an omnibus permutation test on ensembles of two-locus analyses is proposed. The algorithm consists of four main steps: two-locus analysis, a permutation test; global p-value determination and a progressive search for the best; ensemble. 2LOmb is benchmarked against a set association approach, a correlation-based feature selection technique and a tuned ReliefF technique. The simulation results from multi-locus interaction problems indicate that 2LOmb has a low false-positive error. Moreover, 2LOmb has the best performance in terms of an ability to identify all causative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which signifies a high detection power. 2LOmb is subsequently applied to type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D and T2D) data sets, which are obtained as a part of the UK genome-wide genetic epidemiology study by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. After primarily screening for SNPs that locate within or near candidate genes and exhibit no marginal single-locus effects, the T1D and T2D data sets are reduced to 2,359 SNPs from 350 genes and 7,065 SNPs from 370 genes, respectively. The 2LOmb search reveals that 28 SNPs in 21 genes are associated with T1D while 11 SNPs in four genes are associated with T2D. The findings provide an alternative explanation for the aetiology of T1D and T2D in a UK population.

The protein fold prediction problem can be expressed as a prediction problem that can be solved by machine learning techniques. In this paper, a new method based on ensemble of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LogitBoost and AdaBoost.M1) is proposed for the protein fold prediction problem. The dataset used in this experiment is from the standard damsel provided by Ding and Dubchak. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhanced the prediction accuracy up to 64% on an independent test damsel, which is the highest prediction accuracy in compare with other methods proposed by the works have done by literature.

This implies that if no signature is known/created in advance, attack detection will be problematical. Addressing unknown attacks detection; we develop in this paper a network traffic and spam analyzer using a string kernel based SVM (support vector machine) supervised machine learning. The proposed method is capable of detecting network attack without known/earlier determined attack signatures; as SVM automatically learning attack signatures from traffic data. For application to internet security, we have implemented the proposed method for spam email detection over the SpamAssasin and E. M. Canada datasets, and network application authentication via real connection data analysis. The obtained above 99% accuracies have demonstrated the usefulness of string kernel SVMs on network security for either detecting 'abnormal' or protecting 'normal' traffic.

They are currently being an alternative to traditional statistical methods for mining data sots in order to classify data. Artificial Neural Networks are well-established technology for solving prediction and classification problems, using training and testing data to build a model. However, the success of the networks is highly dependent on the performance of the training process and hence the training algorithm. In this paper, we applied the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Optimization Algorithm on training feed-forward neural networks to classify different data sets which are widely used in the machine learning community. The performance of the ABC algorithm is investigated on benchmark classification problems from classification area and the results arc compared with the other well-known conventional and evolutionary algorithms. The results indicate that ABC algorithm can efficiently be used on training feed-forward neural networks for the purpose of pattern classification.

Additionally. machine learning techniques are widely, used for multimedia-analysis with great success. This work presents a combined approach aiming at the semantic adaptation of neural network classifiers in a multimedia framework. Our proposal is based on a fuzzy reasoning engine which is able to evaluate the outputs and the confidence levels of the neural network classifier, using a domain specific knowledge base. The results obtained by the fuzzy reasoning engine are used as input for the adaptation of the network classifier, further increasing its ability to provide accurate classification of the specific content. The improved performance of the adapted neural network is used by a semantic segmentation algorithm that, merges neighbouring regions satisfying certain criteria.

Novel delay-dependent stability criterions based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality technique are derived. Compared with previous results, the signs of elements of weight matrices of the non-fuzzy terms is considered. Thus, the obtained criterions are less conservative than the results in Liu and Tang [Exponential stability of fuzzy cellular neural networks with constant and time-varying delays, Phys. Lett. A 323 (3/4) (2004) 224-233], Zhong et al.

Moreover, the restriction on the change rate of time-varying delays is relaxed in the proposed criterions. Two examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results.

Constructing optimal educational tests using GMDH-based item ranking and selection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						GMDH algorithm; Abductive networks; Neural networks; Machine learning; Optimal test design; Feature selection; Feature ranking; Educational measurements; Item response theory; Mutual information; Filter methods; Wrapper methods; Genetic algorithms	MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURES; CLASSIFIERS	Item ranking and selection plays a key role in constructing concise and informative educational tests. Traditional techniques based on the item response theory (IRT) have been used to automate this task, but they require model parameters to be determined a priori for each item and their application becomes more tedious with larger item banks. Machine-learning techniques can be used to build data-based models that relate the test result as output to the examinees' responses to various test items as inputs. With this approach, test item selection can benefit from the vast amount of literature on feature selection in many areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence that are characterized by high data dimensionality. This paper describes a novel technique for item ranking and selection using abductive network pass/fail classifiers based on the group method of data handling (GMDH). Experiments were carried out on a dataset consisting of the response of 2000 examinees to 45 test items together with the examinee's true ability level. The approach utilizes the ability of GMDH-based learning algorithms to automatically select optimum input features from a set of available inputs. Rankings obtained by iteratively applying this procedure are similar to those based on the average item information function (IIF) at the pass-fail ability threshold, IIF (theta = 0), and the average information gain (IG). An optimum item subset derived from the GMDH-based ranking contains only one third of the test items and performs pass/fail classification with 91.2% accuracy on a 500-case evaluation subset, compared to 86.8% for a randomly selected item subset of the same size and 92% for a subset of the 15 items having the largest values for IIF (theta = 0). Item rankings obtained with the proposed approach compare favorably with those obtained using neural network modeling and popular filter type feature selection methods, and the proposed approach is much faster than wrapper methods employing genetic search.

In particular, the Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) network is investigated, and a new pruning technique is proposed. The pruning technique is implemented successively to eliminate those rarely activated nodes in the category layer of FAM. Three data sets with different characteristics are used to analyze its effectiveness. In addition, a benchmark medical problem is used to evaluate its applicability as a decision support tool for medical diagnosis. From the experiment, the pruning technique is able to improve classification performances, as compared with those of to the original FAM network, as well as other machine learning methods. More importantly, the pruning technique yields more stable performances with fewer nodes, and results in a more parsimonious FAM network for undertaking data classification and decision support tasks.

However, it is difficult, to apply SVM-based active learning to general domains because the kernel used in SVMs, should be selected properly before active, learning process but good kernels for the target, task is usually unknown. If the pre-selected kernel is inadequate for the target data, both the active learning process and the learned SVM have poor performance. Therefore. new active learning met'liods are required which effectively fiml all adequate kernel for the target data. as well;is the labels of unknown samples in the active learning process. In this we propose a two-phased SKM-based active learning method for the purpose. By experiments, we show that the proposed SKM-based active learning method has quick response suited to interaction With human experts and can find all appropriate kernel among linear combinations of given multiple kernels.

Therefore an efficient, counting method was needed. Our method automatically recognizes and counts the number of floating leaves in recorded video using color and motion features. The color feature is represented by 3 dimensional histogram of a color space. We have developed a used interface based oil the inter-active machine learning model to acquire the color feature front video images. The user can easily produce in the same of sample data to extract, the color feature by the user interface in the same way as coloring a picture.

Previous studies of language acquisition by robots have proposed methods to learn words, such as "box" and "blue," that indicate objects or events in the world. However, the robots could not learn and understand interrogative words by those methods because the words do not directly indicate objects or events. The meanings of those words are grounded in communication and stimulate specific responses by a listener. These are called communicative meanings. Our proposed method learns the relationship between human utterances and robot responses that have communicative meanings on the basis of a graphical model of the human-robot interaction.

Prediction of dual protein targeting to plant organelles	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						ambiguous targeting; chloroplast; genome annotation; intracellular sorting; mitochondrion	MOSS PHYSCOMITRELLA-PATENS; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; TRANSLATION INITIATION; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SORTING SIGNALS; RNA-POLYMERASES; MITOCHONDRIAL; DATABASE; CHLOROPLASTS; SEQUENCE	Dual targeting of proteins to more than one subcellular localization has been found in animals, in fungi and in plants. In the latter, ambiguous N-terminal targeting signals have been described that result in the protein being located in both mitochondria and plastids. We have developed ambiguous targeting predictor (ATP), a machine-learning implementation that classifies such ambiguous targeting signals. Ambiguous targeting predictor is based on a support vector machine implementation that makes use of 12 different amino acid features. Prediction results were validated using fluorescent protein fusion. Both in silico and in vivo evaluations demonstrate that ambiguous targeting predictor is useful for predicting dual targeting to mitochondria and plastids. Proteins that are targeted to both organelles by tandemly arrayed signals (so-called twin targeting) can be predicted by both ambiguous targeting predictor and a combination of single targeting prediction tools. Comparison of ambiguous targeting predictor with previous experimental approaches, as well as in silico approaches, shows good congruence. Based on the prediction results, land plant genomes are expected to encode, on average, > 400 proteins that are located in mitochondria and plastids. Ambiguous targeting predictor is helpful for functional genome annotation and can be used as a tool to further our understanding about dual protein targeting and its evolution.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach based on genetic algorithm and artificial neural network to develop a neural-evolutionary model for case-based planning in real time strategy (RTS) games. This model provides efficient, fair and natural game AI to tackle the RTS game problems. Experimental results are provided to support our idea. This model could be integrated with warbots in battlefields, either real or synthetic ones, in the future for mimic human like behaviors.	[Niu, Ben; Wang, Haibo; Ng, Peter H. F.; Shiu, Simon C.

In supervised classification, several approaches were proposed such as: Induction of Decision Trees, and Formal Concept Analysis. The learning of formal concepts is based, generally, on the mathematical structure of Galois lattice (or concept lattice). The complexity of generation of Galois lattice, limits the application fields of these systems. In this paper, we present several methods of supervised classification based on Formal Concept Analysis. We present methods based on concept lattice or sub lattice. We also present the boosting of classifiers, an emerging technique of classification. Finally, we propose the boosting of formal concepts: a new adaptive approach to build only a part of the lattice including the best concepts. These concepts are used as classification rules. Experimental results are given to prove the interest of the proposed method.

This paper deals with the case where no local sensor can be used, inducing the use of video to detect and evaluate the atmospheric pollution coming from large industrial facilities. This paper presents a comparison of different classifiers used in a monitoring system of polluting smokes detected by cameras. The data used in this work are stemming from a system of video analysis and signal processing. The database also includes the pollution level of plumes of smoke defined by an expert. Several Machine Learning techniques are tested and compared. The experimental results are obtained from a real world database of polluting rejects. The parameters of each type of classifier are split in three categories: learned parameters, parameters determined by a first step of the experimentation, and parameters set by the programmer. The comparison of the results of the best classifier of each type indicates that all of them provide good results.

In particular, attempts have been made to better understand the origin of the contrast observed in breast lesions using physiological models that take into account the vascular and tissue-specific features that influence tracer perfusion. In addition, model-free algorithms to decompose enhancement patterns in order to segment and classify different breast tissue types have been developed. This review includes a description of the mechanism of contrast enhancement by gadolinium-based contrast agents, followed by the current status of the physiological models used to analyze breast DCE-MRI and related critical issues. We further describe more recent unsupervised and supervised methods that use a range of different common algorithms. The model-based and model-free methods strive to achieve scientific accuracy and high clinical performance - both important goals yet to be reached. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SLIPstream: Scalable Low-latency Interactive Perception on Streaming Data	NOSSDAV 09: 18TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON NETWORK AND OPERATING SYSTEMS SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL AUDIO AND VIDEO			English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video	JUN 03-05, 2009	Williamsburg, VA	ACM SIGMM, ACM SIGOPS, ACM SIGCOMM		Parallel Computing; Cluster Applications; Multimedia; Sensing; Stream Processing; Computational Perception		A critical problem in implementing interactive perception applications is the considerable computational cost of current computer vision and machine learning algorithms, which typically run one to two orders of magnitude too slowly to be used interactively. Fortunately, many of these algorithms exhibit coarse-grained task and data parallelism that can be exploited across machines. The SLIPstream project focuses on building a highly-parallel runtime system called Sprout that can harness the computing power of a cluster to execute perception applications with low latency. This paper makes the case for using clusters for perception applications, describes the architecture of the Sprout runtime, and presents two compute-intensive yet interactive applications.

We show that Skype traffic can be identified by observing 5 seconds of a Skype traffic flow, with recall and precision better than 98%. We found the most effective features for classification were characteristic packet lengths less than 80 bytes, statistics of packet lengths greater than 80 bytes and inter-packet arrival times. Our classifiers do not rely on observing any particular part of a flow. We also report on the performance of classifiers built using combinations of two of these features and of each feature in isolation.

Machine Learning Methodologies in P300 Speller Brain-Computer Interface Systems	NRSC: 2009 NATIONAL RADIO SCIENCE CONFERENCE: NRSC 2009, VOLS 1 AND 2	National Radio Science Conference NRSC		English	Proceedings Paper	26th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC 2009)	MAR 17-19, 2009	Cairo, EGYPT	Natl Radio Sci Comm, IEEE Egypt Sect, Natl Telecommun Inst, Natl Telecommun Regulartory Authority, Informat Technol Ind Dev Agcy	Future Univ, Fac Engn		BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB; ENSEMBLE; SVMS	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is a one kind of communication system that enables control of devices or communication with others only through brain signal activities without using motor activities. P300 Speller is a BCI paradigm that helps disabled subjects to spell words by means of their brain signal activities. This paper tries to demonstrate the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on classification accuracy. Performance has been evaluated on the data sets acquired using BCI2000's P300 Speller Paradigm provided by BCI competitions II (2003) & III (2004) organizers for three subjects. As a primary stage, a preprocessing was applied on the samples in order to extract the most significant features before introducing them to machine learning algorithms. The algorithms applied are Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA), linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Generalized Anderson's Task linear classifier (GAT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). BLDA and SVM yielded the highest accuracy for all 3 subjects. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on the data presented to the BLDA classifier for dimensionality reduction. The results obtained after this stage were slightly lower than those without reduction but they are still acceptable.

While several sophisticated systems had been developed in the area of Intrusion Detection, new challenges arised. Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like Network Behavior Analyses (NBA) Systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time. To overcome these shortcomings, we are introducing a fast-learning modular neural network based on pre-processed components. For the development of the new system, the possible attacks on NBA systems have to be investigated and understood in depth.

Various approaches to Intrusion Detection are currently being used, but they are relatively ineffective. Recently applying Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to IDS are increasing. Artificial Intelligence plays a driving role in security services. This paper proposes an Immune based Adaptive Intrusion Detection System Model (IAIDSM). Analyzing the training data obtaining from internet, the self behavior set and nonself behavior set can be obtained by the partitional clustering algorithm, then it extracts Self and nonsetf pattern sets from these two behavior sets by association rules and sequential patterns mining. The Self and nonself sets can update automatically and constantly online. So IAIDSM improves the ability of detecting new type intrusions and the adaptability of the system.

Array-based evolution of DNA aptamers allows modelling of an explicit sequence-fitness landscape	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							SINGLE-STRANDED-DNA; RNA; ADAPTATION; RESOLUTION; MUTATIONS; SELECTION; TOPOLOGY; LIGANDS; ENZYME	Mapping the landscape of possible macromolecular polymer sequences to their fitness in performing biological functions is a challenge across the biosciences. A paradigm is the case of aptamers, nucleic acids that can be selected to bind particular target molecules. We have characterized the sequence-fitness landscape for aptamers binding allophycocyanin (APC) protein via a novel Closed Loop Aptameric Directed Evolution (CLADE) approach. In contrast to the conventional SELEX methodology, selection and mutation of aptamer sequences was carried out in silico, with explicit fitness assays for 44 131 aptamers of known sequence using DNA microarrays in vitro. We capture the landscape using a predictive machine learning model linking sequence features and function and validate this model using 5500 entirely separate test sequences, which give a very high observed versus predicted correlation of 0.87. This approach reveals a complex sequence-fitness mapping, and hypotheses for the physical basis of aptameric binding; it also enables rapid design of novel aptamers with desired binding properties. We demonstrate an extension to the approach by incorporating prior knowledge into CLADE, resulting in some of the tightest binding sequences.

It is a curated repository for factual information compiled largely from published references. It uses a functional/phylogenetic system of classification, and currently encompasses about 5000 representative transporters and putative transporters in more than 500 families. We here describe novel software designed to support and extend the usefulness of TCDB. Our recent efforts render it more user friendly, incorporate machine learning to input novel data in a semiautomatic fashion, and allow analyses that are more accurate and less time consuming. The availability of these tools has resulted in recognition of distant phylogenetic relationships and tremendous expansion of the information available to TCDB users.

This selection mechanism generates premature memory cells and decreases the classification accuracy. In this study, the Real World Tournament Selection (RWTS) method is incorporated in resource competition phase of AIRS to tackle this limitation. Some experiments are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of new algorithm, named RWTSAIRS. Algorithms were tested on benchmark datasets of UCI machine learning repository and RWTSAIRS achieved better classification accuracy in all cases.

The purpose of having a good iris mask is to indicate which part of iris texture map is useful and which part is occluded or contains noisy artifacts such as eyelashes, eyelids and specular reflections. The accuracy of the iris mask is extremely important. The performance of the iris recognition system will decrease dramatically when iris mask is inaccurate, even when the best recognition algorithm is used. Traditionally, people used naive rule-based algorithms to estimate iris makes from the iris texture map. But the accuracy of the iris mask generated in this way is questionable. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic and learning-based method to automatically estimate iris make from iris texture map. The features used in this method are very simple, yet the resulting estimated iris mask is significantly more accurate than the rule-based methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by performing iris recognition based on masks estimated by different algorithms. Experimental results show the masks estimated by the proposed algorithm help to increase the iris recognition rate on NIST Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) database.

Rapid assessment of side-scan imagery for object detection is critical for port security needs. However, current side-scan data processing techniques are largely manual, highly time-consuming, and prone to operator error. Availability of well-trained analysts is also a challenge. This article describes a research and development effort at Science Applications International Corporation to automate side-scan sonar target detection for safety of navigation surveys. Included in the development effort are innovative image processing and machine learning techniques designed to reduce the number of false alarms. These automated techniques are directly applicable to port security operations.

This presentation summarizes our recent research on application of light-scatter measurements paired with machine learning and pattern recognition methodologies for label-free classification of bioparticles. Two separate examples of light scatter-based techniques are discussed: forward-scatter measurements of bacterial colonies in an imaging system, and flow cytometry measurements of scatter signals formed by individual bacterial particles. Recently, we have reported a first practical implementation of a system capable of label-free classification and recognition of pathogenic species of Listeria, Salmonella, Vibrio, Staphylococcus, and E. coli using forward-scatter patterns produced by bacterial colonies irradiated with laser light. Individual bacteria in flow also form complex patterns dependent on particle size, shape, refraction index, density, and morphology. Although commercial flow cytometers allow scatter measurement at two angles this rudimentary approach cannot be used to separate populations of bioparticles of similar shape, size, or structure. The custom-built system used in the presented work collects axial light-loss and scatter signals at five carefully chosen angles. Experimental results obtained from colony scanner, as well from the extended cytometry instrument, were used to train the pattern-recognition algorithm. The results demonstrate that information provided by scatter alone may be sufficient to recognize various bioparticles with 90-99% success rate, both in flow and in imaging systems.

Radar systems have limitations on the minimum detectable range and lack high-level classification power. In this paper, we present an innovative Automated Intelligent Video Surveillance System for Ships (AIVS3) as a vision-based solution for ship security. Capitalizing on advanced computer vision algorithms and practical machine learning methodologies, the developed AIVS3 is not only capable of efficiently and robustly detecting, classifying, and tracking various maritime targets, but also able to fuse heterogeneous target information to interpret scene activities, associate targets with levels of threat, and issue the corresponding alerts/recommendations to the man-in-the-loop (MITL). AIVS3 has been tested in various maritime scenarios and shown accurate and effective threat detection performance. By reducing the reliance on human eyes to monitor cluttered scenes, AIVS3 will save the manpower while increasing the accuracy in detection and identification of asymmetric attacks for ship protection.

However, similar to other classification methods, the performance of the TWSVM classifier depends on the choice of the kernel. In this paper we treat the kernel selection problem for TWSVM as an optimization problem over the convex set of finitely many basic kernels, and formulate the same as an iterative alternating optimization problem.

A fundamental problem posed by a parallel environment is the decision of whether it is best to simulate a particular circuit sequentially or on a parallel platform. Furthermore, in the event that a circuit should be simulated on a parallel platform, it is necessary to decide how many computing nodes should be used on the given platform. In this paper we propose a machine learning algorithm as an aid in making these decisions. The algorithm is based on the well-known K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. After an extensive training regime, it was shown to make a correct prediction 99% of the time on whether to use a parallel or sequential simulator. The predicted number of nodes to use on a parallel platform was shown to produce an average execution time which was not more than 12% of the smallest execution time. The configuration which resulted in the minimal execution time was picked 61 % of the time.

Analysis in a timely manner of the acquired multidimensional images allows to develop applications with high social impact, such as urban growing monitoring, crop fields identification, target detection for military and defense/security deployment, wildland fire detection and monitoring, biological threat detection, biophysical parameter estimation, or monitoring of oil spills and other types of chemical contamination. In this context, support vector machines (SVM) [1, 2, 3] have become one of the state-of-the-art machine learning tools for hyperspectral image classification. However, its high computational cost for large scale applications makes the use of SVM limited to off-line processing scenarios. Certainly, with the recent explosion in the amount and complexity of hyperspectral data, parallel processing has soon become a requirement in many remote sensing missions, especially with the advent of low-cost systems such as commodity clusters and distributed networks of computers In order to address this relevant issue, this chapter explores the development of two parallel versions of SVMs for remote sensing image classification. Sequential minimal optimization is a very popular algorithm for training SVMs, but it still requires a large amount of computation time for solving large size problems. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a parallel implementation of the SVM based on the parallelization of the incomplete Cholesky factorization and present novel parallel implementations that balance the load across the available processors through standard Master-Worker decompositions. Both methodologies are theoretically analyzed in terms of scalability, computational efficiency and time response. The impact of the multi-class scheme is also analyzed. Results on real multispectral and hyperspectral datasets illustrate the performance of the methods. We finally discuss the possibility of obtaining processing results quickly enough for practical use via the Marenostrum supercomputer available at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain, and other massively parallel facilities at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

We show how the problem can be reformulated to become suitable for high-performance parallel computing. In our algorithm, data is preprocessed in parallel to generate an approximate low-rank Cholesky decomposition. Our optimization solver then exploits the problem's structure to perform many linear algebra operations in parallel, with relatively low data transfer between processors, resulting in excellent parallel efficiency for very-large-scale problems.

It is unclear, however, whether the clinical significance of GBS can be predicted based solely on such molecular markers. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that GBS virulence can be predicted by using the molecular epidemiology markers. Methods: We examined 912 human GBS isolates in which 18 distinct molecular markers (including virulence-associated mobile genetic elements, polysaccharide capsule determinants, variants of a surface antigen and invasin, and antibiotic resistance-related genes) were characterised using multiplex PCR based reverse line blot assay. All strains were classified in clinically relevant invasive and colonising categories. Relationships between molecular markers and clinical phenotypes were tested using statistical and machine learning analyses. Classifier performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The distribution of serotypes was comparable with those in previous reports (Ia, 22.1%; III, 34.7%; V, 17.7%). From single marker analyses, only alp3 (which encodes a surface protein antigen, commonly associated with serotype V) showed an increased association with invasive diseases (OR 2.93, p = 0.0003). Molecular serotype (MS) II (OR 10.0, p = 0.0007) had a significant association with early-onset neonatal disease when compared with late-onset diseases. Predictive analysis with logistic regression and machine learning classifiers, however, only yielded weak predictive power (AUC 0.56-0.71, stratified 10-fold cross-validation) across all the subgroups. Conclusion: While some molecular epidemiological markers are important in defining GBS clusters, a definitive predictive relationship between the molecular markers and clinical outcomes may be lacking.

J	Raghuraj, R; Lakshminarayanan, S				Raghuraj, Rao; Lakshminarayanan, Samavedham			Variable predictive models-A new multivariate classification approach for pattern recognition applications	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Data classification; Variable predictive models; Discriminant analysis; Machine learning; Multivariate statistics		Many pattern recognition algorithms applied in literature exhibit data specific performances and are also computationally intense and complex. The data classification problem poses further challenges when different classes cannot be distinguished just based on decision boundaries or conditional discriminating rules. As ail alternate to existing methods, inter-relations among the feature vectors can be exploited for distinguishing Samples into specific classes. Based on this idea, variable predictive model based class discrimination (VPMCD) method is proposed as a new and alternative classification approach. Analysis is carried Out Using seven well studied data sets and the performance of VPMCD is benchmarked against well established linear and non-linear classifiers like LDA, kNN, Bayesian networks, CART, ANN and SVM. it is demonstrated that VPMCD is an efficient supervised learning algorithm showing consistent and good performance over these data sets. The new VPMCD method has the potential to be effectively and successfully extended to many pattern recognition applications of recent interest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xue, H; Chen, SC; Yang, Q				Xue, Hui; Chen, Songcan; Yang, Qiang			Discriminatively regularized least-squares classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Classifier design; Discriminative information; Manifold learning; Pattern recognition	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NETWORKS; KERNEL; APPROXIMATION; FRAMEWORK	Over the past decades, regularization theory is widely applied in various areas of machine learning to derive a large family of novel algorithms. Traditionally, regularization focuses Oil smoothing only, and does not fully Utilize the Underlying discriminative knowledge which is vital for classification. fit this paper, we propose a novel regularization algorithm in the least-squares sense, called discriminatively regularized least-squares classification (DRLSC) method, which is specifically designed for classification. Inspired by several new geometrically Motivated methods, DRLSC directly embeds the discriminative information as well as the local geometry of the samples into the regularization term so that it can explore as much underlying knowledge inside the samples as possible and aim to maximize the margins between the samples of different classes in each local area. Furthermore, by embedding equality type constraints in the formulation, the solutions of DRLSC can follow from solving a set of linear equations and the framework naturally contains multi-class Problems. Experiments on both toy and real world problems demonstrate that DRLSC is often superior in classification performance to the classical regularization algorithms, including regularization networks, support vector machines and some of the recent studied manifold regularization techniques.

Pairwise similarity plays a crucial role in classification algorithms like nearest neighbors, and is practically important for applications like searching for images that are similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are both visually similar and semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, current approaches for learning semantic similarity are limited to small scale datasets, because their complexity grows quadratically with the sample size, and because they impose costly positivity constraints on the learned similarity functions. To address real-world large-scale AT problem, like learning similarity over all images on the web, we need to develop new algorithms that scale to many samples, many classes, and many features. The current abstract presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a dataset with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. Comparing OASIS with different symmetric variants, provides unexpected insights into the effect of symmetry on the quality of the similarity. For large, web scale, datasets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within two days on a single CPU. Human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten top images ranked by OASIS were semantically relevant to a query image. This suggests that query-independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large-scale datasets that could not be handled before.

As it has to be performed while only having samples of the correct phonemes, it is an example of one-class classification. To solve this problem, first all phonemes are modelled with a number of Gaussian distributions; then the problem is converted into a two-class classification task by generating counter-examples; this way some machine learning algorithm (like ANNs) can be used to separate the two classes. We tested two methods for a counter-example generation like this: one was a solution specific to the anti-phoneme problem, while the other used a general algorithm. By making modifications to the latter to reduce its time requirements, we were able to achieve an improvement in the recognition scores of over 60% compared to having no anti-phoneme model at all, and it performed considerably better than the other two methods.

The results are based on two mutually independent features. The first feature is the use of slang words which is a new concept proposed by us for Stylistic study of bloggers. For the second feature, we have analyzed the variation in average length of sentences across various age groups and gender. These features are augmented with previous study results reported in literature for stylistic analysis. The combined feature list enhances the accuracy by a remarkable extent in predicting age and gender. These machine learning experiments were done on two separate demographically tagged blog corpus. Gentler determination is more accurate than age group detection over the dataspread across all ages but the accuracy of age prediction increases if we sample data with remarkable age difference.

The performance of a Steganalysis depends not only on the choice of classifier but also on features that are used to represent the image. Features extracted from images may contain irrelevant and redundant features which makes them inefficient for machine learning. Relevant features not only decrease the processing time to train a classifier but also provide better generalization. In this paper, kullback divergence measure, chernoff distance measure and linear regression are used for relevant feature selection. The performance of steganalysis using different measures used for feature selection is compared and evaluated in terms of classification error and computation time of training classifier. Experimental results show that Linear regression measure used for feature selection outperforms other measures used for feature selection in terms of both classification error and compilation time.

However, a common requirement amongst many existing clustering methods is that all pairwise distances between patterns must be computed in advance. This makes it computationallly expensive and difficult to cope with large scale data used in several applications, such as in bioinformatics. In this paper we propose a novel sequential hierarchical clustering technique that initially builds a hierarchical tree from a small fraction of the entire data, while the remaining data is processed sequentially and the tree adapted constructively. Preliminary results using this approach show that the quality of the clusters obtained does not degrade while reducing the computational needs.

To operationally test this, we analysed the compounds in terms of known drug-like filters and developed a novel machine learning method to discriminate approved pharmaceuticals from "drug-like" compounds. This method uses both structural features and molecular properties for discrimination.

When inference methods are designed using data collected using a particular platform, they are unlikely to work directly on measurements taken from a different type of array. We report on this cross-platform transfer problem, and show that, working with transcriptome representations at binary numerical precision, similar to the gene expression bar code method, helps circumvent the variability across platforms in several cancer classification tasks. We compare our approach with a recent machine learning method specifically designed for shifting distributions, i.e., problems in which the training and testing data are not, drawn from identical probability distributions, and show superior performance in three of the four problems in which we could directly compare.

An experimental comparison of performance measures for classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Classification; Performance measures; Ranking; Calibration		Performance metrics in classification are fundamental in assessing the quality of learning methods and learned models. However, many different Measures have been defined in the literature with the aim of making better choices in general or For a specific application area. Choices made by one metric are claimed to be different from choices made by other metrics. In this work, we analyse experimentally the behaviour of 18 different performance metrics in several scenarios, identifying clusters and relationships between measures. We also perform a sensitivity analysis for all of them in terms of several traits: class threshold choice, separability/ranking quality, calibration performance and sensitivity to changes in prior class distribution. From the definitions and experiments, we make a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between metrics, and a taxonomy and arrangement of them according to the previous traits. This call be useful for choosing the most adequate measure (or set of measures) for a specific application. Additionally, the Study also highlights some niches in which new measures might be defined and also shows that Sonic supposedly innovative measures make the same choices (or almost) as existing ones. Finally, this work can also be used as a reference for comparing experimental results in pattern recognition and machine learning literature, when using different measures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we treat facial reconstruction as a machine learning problem. We use separate statistical shape models to represent the skull and face morphology. We learn the relationship between the parameters of the models by fitting them to a set of MR images of the head and using ridge regression on the resulting model parameters. Since the facial shape is not uniquely defined by the skull shape, we allow to specify target attributes, such as age or weight. Our experiments show that the reconstruction results are generally close to the original face, and that by specifying the right attributes the perceptual and measured difference between the original and the predicted face is reduced.

Inspired by the recent advancement on semi-supervised learning techniques, we propose a novel learning-based multiview video compression framework. Our scheme can efficiently compress the multiview video represented by multiview-video-plus-depth (MVD) format. We model the multiview video compression problem as a semi-supervised learning problem and design sophisticated mechanisms to achieve high compression efficiency. Our approach is significantly different from the traditional hybrid coding scheme such as H.264-based multiview video coding methods. The preliminary results show promising compression performance.

The main aims were: (1) to compare the predictive ability of the generalised boosting method used with more common parametric techniques (generalised linear model) and machine-learning methods (artificial neural networks) and (2) to assess the tenability of the explanatory variables highlighted by the generalised boosting method. The results showed the robustness of the boosting method in predicting the distribution of periglacial phenomena in the sub-Arctic landscape. Furthermore, the environmental factors selected by the boosting method coincided well with the expected controls of the phenomena. The strengths of the generalised boosting method lie in its high predictive ability, flexibility in capturing complex process-environment relationships and realistic model outcomes.

Here we focus on neuroadaptations in reward-related neurotransmitter systems and their impact on central processing of alcohol-associated and reward-indicating stimuli. We discuss genotype effects on cue-induced neuronal activation and present new computational methods based on machine learning to deal with complex genotype-phenotype interactions, e.g. between brain atrophy and genes associated with glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.

B	Kononenko, I		Zerovnik, E; Markic, O; Ule, A		Kononenko, Igor			NATURAL AND MACHINE LEARNING, INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS	PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT MODERN SCIENCE	Scientific Revolutions		English	Article; Book Chapter								In the first part of this chapter, which is more "scientific", we discuss learning and its relation to natural and artificial intelligence, and we relate learning and intelligence to (phenomenal) consciousness. Practising, imitating the teacher, and repeated trial and error is called learning. The process of transformation due to learning is called knowledge acquisition. Learning by a living system is called natural learning; if the learner is a machine - a computer - it is called machine learning. Learning is a precondition for intelligent behavior. Intelligence can be defined as the ability to adapt to the environment and to solve problems. Artificial intelligence research deals with the development of systems that act more or less intelligently and are able to solve relatively hard problems. With respect to the complexity of the learning process we differentiate several learning types and learners use different search strategies which are also used in machine learning. Important aspects for understanding the abilities of artificial intelligence are the impact of learning on intelligence, the speed of problem solving, the principal limitations of algorithms (stemming from the theory of computability), and the imitation of intelligent behavior. We expect an intelligent system to be (at least to some extent) intelligent in all the areas which are characteristic for human problem solving. However, most speculations about artificial intelligence do not take into account yet another level: consciousness. Consciousness seems to be fundamentally related to the following notions: life, intelligence, and free will. The world (the real-ity - the analogy in mathematics are real numbers, which are in great majority irrational) is most probably non-describable by any of the symbolic formalisms which we are able to use with our rational mind (that can tackle only the rational part of reality - the analogy in mathematics are rational numbers), and the same limitation holds for computers. In the second part, which is less scientific and expresses the author's own viewpoint, we discuss the relation between objectivity (in the sense of measurability and describability), and (phenomenal) subjectivity (in the sense of the 1(st) person, direct experience) which seem to be the relation between intelligent and conscious behavior and is in turn the relation between objective science and subjective spirituality (in the sense of spiritual, phenomenal experience). Phenomenal consciousness is highly subjective (in the sense of the 1(st) person experience), while science - by definition - is struggling to be objective. Scientists mostly use the rational mind (intellect) in order to indirectly and objectively study matter and to derive knowledge. Mystics on the other hand mostly use the intuitive mind (inner sense, heart) in order to directly and subjectively experience consciousness and to attain wisdom. Both extremes, objective science and experiental (phenomenal) spirituality search for the truth. They are complementary to each other and we need both.

Optimal construction of a fast and accurate polarisable water potential based on multipole moments trained by machine learning	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Review							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; LIQUID WATER; FORCE-FIELD; DIPOLE-MOMENT; CONFORMATIONAL ENERGIES; FLUCTUATING CHARGE; HYDROGEN-FLUORIDE; MODELS; MECHANICS	To model liquid water correctly and to reproduce its structural, dynamic and thermodynamic properties warrants models that account accurately for electronic polarisation. We have previously demonstrated that polarisation can be represented by fluctuating multipole moments (derived by quantum chemical topology) predicted by multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in response to the local structure of the cluster. Here we further develop this methodology of modeling polarisation enabling control of the balance between accuracy, in terms of errors in Coulomb energy and computing time. First, the predictive ability and speed of two additional machine learning methods, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and Kriging, are assessed with respect to our previous MLP based polarisable water models, for water dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer and hexamer clusters. Compared to MLPs, we find that RBFNNs achieve a 14-26% decrease in median Coulomb energy error, with a factor 2.5-3 slowdown in speed, whilst Kriging achieves a 40-67% decrease in median energy error with a 6.5-8.5 factor slowdown in speed. Then, these compromises between accuracy and speed are improved upon through a simple multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal combinations. Compared to the Kriging results, combinations are found that are no less accurate (at the 90th energy error percentile), yet are 58% faster for the dimer, and 26% faster for the pentamer.

However, this has long been a difficult work for both experimental and computational practices. In this research, we presented a novel computational strategy which combined the analysis of the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) contexts and machine learning approach. Using this strategy, we conducted a genome-wide investigation into novel direct target genes of dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs), the members of AP2-EREBPs transcription factor super family which is reported to be responsive to various abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide searching yielded in total 474 target gene candidates. With reference to the microarray data for abiotic stresses-inducible gene expression profile, 268 target gene candidates out of the total 474 genes predicted, were induced during the 24-h exposure to abiotic stresses. This takes about 57% of total predicted targets. Furthermore, GO annotations revealed that these target genes are likely involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation, protein binding and Endomembrane sorting system.

Towards a Holistic Approach to Auto-Parallelization Integrating Profile-Driven Parallelism Detection and Machine-Learning Based Mapping	PLDI'09 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 ACM SIGPLAN CONFERENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION			English	Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation	JUN 15-20, 2009	Dublin, IRELAND	ACM SIGPLAN, ACM SIGSOFT, Sci Fdn Ireland, Natl Sci Fdn, ACE, ARM, CAPS, Google, Hewlett-Packard Labs, IBM Res, Intel, Microsoft Res, Movidia, Sun Microsyst		Auto-Parallelization; Profile-Driven Parallelism Detection; Machine-Learning Based Parallelism Mapping; OpenMP		Compiler-based auto-parallelization is a much studied area, yet has still not found wide-spread application. This is largely due to the poor exploitation of application parallelism, subsequently resulting in performance levels far below those which a skilled expert programmer could achieve. We have identified two weaknesses in traditional parallelizing compilers and propose a novel, integrated approach, resulting in significant performance improvements of the generated parallel code. Using profile-driven parallelism detection we overcome the limitations of static analysis, enabling us to identify more application parallelism and only rely on the user for final approval. In addition, we replace the traditional target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics with a machine-learning based prediction mechanism, resulting in better mapping decisions while providing more scope for adaptation to different target architectures. We have evaluated our parallelization strategy against the NAS and SPEC OMP benchmarks and two different multi-core platforms (dual quad-core Intel Xeon SNIP and dual-socket QS20 Cell blade). We demonstrate that our approach not only yields significant improvements when compared with state-of-the-art parallelizing compilers, but comes close to and sometimes exceeds the performance of manually parallelized codes. On average, our methodology achieves 96% of the performance of the hand-tuned OpenMP NAS and SPEC parallel benchmarks on the Intel Xeon platform and gains a significant speedup for the IBM Cell platform, demonstrating the potential of profile-guided and machine-learning based parallelization for complex multi-core platforms.

We give the first distributed algorithms with provable guarantees in the physical model, and also give the first algorithms in the protocol model that do riot assume transmitters can coordinate with their neighbors in the interference graph, so every transmitter chooses whether to broadcast based purely on local events. Our techniques draw heavily from algorithmic game theory and machine learning theory, even though our goal is a distributed algorithm. Indeed, our main results allow every transmitter to run any algorithm it wants, so long as its algorithm has a learning-theoretic property known as no-regret in a game-theoretic setting.

As the data become heterogeneous and large-scale, single kernel methods become insufficient to classify nonlinear data. The finite combinations of kernels are limited up to a finite choice. In order to overcome this discrepancy, we propose a novel method of "infinite" kernel combinations for learning problems with the help of infinite and semi-infinite programming regarding all elements in kernel space. Looking at all infinitesimally fine convex combinations of the kernels from the infinite kernel set, the margin is maximized subject to an infinite number of constraints with a compact index set and an additional (Riemann-Stieltjes) integral constraint due to the combinations. After a parametrization in the space of probability measures, it becomes semi-infinite. We analyze the regularity conditions which satisfy the Reduction Ansatz and discuss the type of distribution functions within the structure of the constraints and our bi-level optimization problem.

We defined statistical candidate utterance selection as a question that automatically selects an appropriate utterance from speech collections prepared in advance as responses. To realize automatic utterance evaluation, we employed manually evaluated data as learning data so that relative magnitude correlation will be learned from them. We checked the order of the automatically evaluated values to prove the validity of our proposed method. In this simulation, the result. shows that the top appropriate utterance is selected at 47.5%, and it is selected within the top 10 at 78.0%. For implementing this method in agents that assist humans by replying, we found that it is quite possible to realize such an agent.

As the amounts of data being generated are getting huge, the need for machine learning methods which can deal with them in an appropriate way - i.e. methods which can be adapted incrementally - becomes very important. Ensembles of classifiers have been shown to be able to improve the predictive accuracy as well as the robustness of single classification methods. In this work novel incremental variants of several well-known classifier fusion methods (Fuzzy Integral, Decision Templates, Dempster-Shafer Combination and Discounted Dempster-Shafer Combination) are presented. Furthermore, a novel incremental classifier fusion method called Incremental Direct Cluster-based fusion will be introduced, which exploits an evolving clustering approach. A flexible and interactive framework for on-line learning will be introduced, in which the ensemble (classifier fusion) methods are adapted incrementally in a sample-wise manner together with their base classifiers. The performance of this framework and the proposed incremental classifiers fusion methods therein are evaluated on five real-world visual quality inspection tasks, captured on-line from an industrial CD imprint production process.

Different with the existing approaches which align hierarchical structures like sub-trees, our method conducts alignment on chunks. The alignment is finished through a simultaneous bilingual chunking algorithm. Using the constrains of chunk correspondence between source language (SL) and target language (TL), our algorithm can dramatically reduce search space, support time synchronous DP algorithm, and lead to highly consistent chunking. Furthermore, by unifying the POS tagging and chunking in the search process, our algorithm alleviates effectively the influence of POS tagging deficiency to the chunking result.

In this paper, two baselines are used to validate the results of our experiments. A set of features of individual feed is firstly constructed by decision tree to represent the similarity distribution of every feed against certain interest. Features are then selected by computing their centroid distances to standard centroids of relevant feeds and irrelevant feeds. Later, SVM classifier is used to predict and re-rank the top 250 results of two baselines. The result shows that our algorithm can effectively present the feeds' similarity distribution and re-rank them into a new order which has much better MAP.

However, due to the lexical gap between questions and answers as well as spam typically existing in user-generated content, filtering and ranking answers is very challenging. Previous solutions mainly focus on generating redundant features, or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques; none of them ever consider questions and their answers as relational data but instead model them as independent information. Moreover, they only consider the answers of the current question, and ignore any previous knowledge that would be helpful to bridge the lexical and semantic gap. We assume that answers are connected to their questions with various types of latent links, i.e. positive links indicating high-quality answers, negative links indicating incorrect answers or user-generated spam, and propose an analogical reasoning-based approach which measures the analogy between the new question-answer linkages and those of previous relevant knowledge which contains only positive links; the candidate answer which has the most analogous link is assumed to be the best answer. We conducted experiments based on 29.8 million Yahoo!Answer question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of our approach.

On the Local Optimality of LambdaRank	PROCEEDINGS 32ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval	JUL 19-23, 2009	Boston, MA	ACM SIGIR, Microsoft Res, Yahoo, Google, IBM Res, Sun		Learning to Rank; Web Search		A machine learning approach to learning to rank trains a model to optimize a target evaluation measure with repect to training data. Currently, existing information retrieval measures are impossible to optimize directly except for models with a very small number of parameters. The IR community thus faces a major challenge: how to optimize IR measures of interest directly. In this paper, we present a solution. Specifically, we show that LambdaRank [1], which smoothly approximates the gradient of the target measure, can be adapted to work with four popular IR target evaluation measures using the same underlying gradient construction. It is likely, therefore, that this construction is extendable to other evaluation measures. We empirically show that LambdaRank finds a locally optimal solution for mean NDCG@10, mean NDCG, MAP and MRR with a 99% confidence rate. We also show that the amount of effective training data varies with IR measure and that with a sufficiently large training set size, matching the training optimization measure to the target evaluation measure yields the best accuracy.

Since users are more likely to click ads that are relevant to their query, it is crucial for search engine to deliver the fight ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed. There are several works investigating on how to learn a ranking function to maximize the number of ad clicks. In this paper, we address a new revenue optimization problem and aim to answer the question: how to construct a ranking model that can deliver high quality ads to the user as well as maximize search engine revenue? We introduce two novel methods from different machine learning perspectives, and both of them take the revenue component into careful considerations. The algorithms are built upon the click-through log data with real ad clicks and impressions. The extensively experimental results verify the proposed algorithm that can produce more revenue than other methods as well as avoid losing relevance accuracy. To provide deep insight into the importance of each feature to search engine revenue, we extract twelve basic features from four categories. The experimental study provides a feature ranking list according to the revenue benefit of each feature.

But the Traditional Classifications depend on certain header fields (take port numbers for instance). These port-based and payload-based approaches will be out of action when a lot of applications like P2P use dynamic port numbers. Masquerading techniques and payload encryption requires a high amount of resource of computing and is easily infeasible in the protocol that unknown or encrypted. This paper describes a different level in network traffic-analysis using an unsupervised machine learning technique. In this approach flows are automatically classified by exploiting the different statistics characteristics of flow. We implement and estimate the efficiency and feasibility of our approach using data at different location of Internet. A new attribute selection method is put forward to determine optimal attribute set and evaluate the influence.

In recent years video streaming over MANETs has drawn significant attention due to the popularity of high-speed IEEE 802.11 standard series. However, it is still a challenging task for channel variation and bandwidth limitation and fluctuation. In this paper a priority based cross-layer transmission scheme using the idea of "unequal protection" is proposed to improve video transmission quality of MANETs. Priorities are determined by video coding algorithm and submitted to network layer and MAC layer so that packet routing and frame scheduling algorithms could forward video data according to their priorities. Proposed scheme provides coding adaptivity through priority assignment and transmission adaptivity through machine learning methods.

In this model, the dominant factors affecting the credit sales risk are the input vectors and the risk of sale on credit is divided into four grades based on the credit sale risk degree. Through a special data dealing process, the multi-class SVM classifier, trained with the sampling data, identifies out the four grades of credit sale risk. An empirical analysis shows the proposed model is feasible and accurate.

The improvement in authorship identification, in our work, is by utilizing a hybrid collection of linguistic features that best capture the style of users in diaries blogs. The features sets contain LIWC with its psychology background, a collection of syntactic features & part-of-speech (POS), and the misspelling errors features. Furthermore, we analyze the contribution of each feature set on the final result and compare the outcome of using different combination from the selected feature sets. Our new categorization of misspelling words which are mapped into numerical features, are noticeably enhancing the classification results. The paper also confirms the best ranges of several parameters that affect the final result of authorship identification such as the author numbers, words number in each post, and the number of documents/posts for each author/user. The results and evaluation show that the utilized features are compact, while their performance is highly comparable with other much larger feature sets.

For computer security, data mining are introduced for helping intrusion detection System (IDS) to detect intruders correctly. However, one of the essential procedures of data mining is feature selection, which is the technique (commonly used in machine learning) for selecting a subset of relevant features for building robust learning models, due to the fact that feature selection can help enhance the efficiency of prediction rate. In the previous researches on feature selection, the criteria and way about how to select the features in the raw data are mostly difficult to implement. Therefore, this paper presents the easy and novel method, for feature selection, which can be used to separate correctly between normal and attack patterns of computer network connections. The goal in this paper is to effectively apply Euclidean Distance for selecting a subset of robust features using smaller storage space and getting higher Intrusion detection performance. During the evaluation phase, three different test data sets are used to evaluate the performance of proposed approach with C5.0 classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed approach based on the Euclidean Distance can improve the performance of a true positive intrusion detection rate especially for detecting known attack patterns.

The feature use the chamfer distance as a shape comparison measure. It can be calculated very quickly using a look-up table. Random sampling boosting algorithm is used to form an object detector. Floating search post optimization procedure is used to remove base classifiers which cause higher error rates. The resulting classifier consists of fewer base classifiers yet achieves better generalization performance. To demonstrate our method we trained a system to detect pedestrians in complex natural scenes. Experimental results show that our system can extremely rapidly detect objects with high detection rate. The learning techniques can be extended to detect other objects.

A well known algorithm based on boosting is AdaBoost. Boosting At Start (BAS) is a boosting framework that generalizes AdaBoost by allowing any initial weight distribution. BAS Committee is a scheme that uses feature clustering to determine the best weight assignments in the BAS framework. One of the drawbacks of BAS Committee is its final step which uses a simple Majority Voting approach over the chosen classifiers. Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL) is a machine learning strategy that combines Decision Trees and Transformation Based Learning avoiding the explicit need of Template Design. Here, we present ETL Voting BAS Committee, a scheme that combines ETL and BAS Committee in order to determine the best combination for the classifiers of the ensemble. Besides that, since no extra assumption is made, ETL Voting is generic and can be used in any committee approach. Our empirical findings indicate that the BAS performance can be improved with a new combination of the classifiers determined by ETL Voting.

Pruned decision trees usually have simpler structure and are expected to have higher generalization ability at the expense of classification accuracy. Nowadays, various priming methods are available. However, the problem of how to make a trade-off between structural simplicity and classification accuracy has not been well solved. In this paper, we firstly propose a method to evaluate structural complexities of decision trees in pruning process. Based upon the method, we introduce a new measure for post-pruning decision trees, which takes into account both classification accuracy and structural complexity The experimental results on 20 benchmark data sets from the UCI machine learning data repository show that the proposed method is competitively feasible for pruning decision trees.

As an effective tool, support vector machine (SVM) has been broadly adopted in pattern recognition and machine learning fields. In developing a successful SVM classifier, eliminating noise and extracting feature are very important. This paper proposes the application of kernel PCA to LS-SVM for feature extraction.

Many feature selection methods have been studied for supervised problems. However feature selection for unsupervised learning is rarely studied. In this paper, we proposed an approach to select features for unsupervised problems. Firstly, the original features are clustered according to their relevance degree defined by mutual information. And then the most informative feature is selected from each cluster based on the contribution-information of each feature. The experimental results show that the proposed method can match some popular supervised feature selection methods. And the features selected by our method do include most of the information hidden in the overall original features.

However, like many other supervised approaches, one of the main problems with learning to rank is lack of labeled data. Recently, there have been attempts to address the challenges In active sampling for learning to rank. But none of these methods take into consideration the differences between queries*. In this paper, we propose a novel active ranking framework on query-level which alms to employ different ranking models for different queries. Then, we used Rank SVM as a base ranker, realized a query-level active ranking algorithm and applied it to document retrieval. Experimental results on real-world dataset stow that our approach can reduce the labeling cost greatly without decreasing the ranking accuracy.

However, one can not compute the generalization error for a given problem exactly. Therefore, many research efforts have been put to estimate the generalization error for a given classification problem. The Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) is one of the recently proposed analytical generalization error upper bound models. In the L-GEM, an upper bound of generalization error of unseen samples within a Q-neighborhood of training samples is provided. The L-GEM has been widely adopted in many application areas, e.g. image classification, corporate credit risk prediction and construction productivity enhancement in civil engineering. Hwever, the selection of Q value is vital to the success of L-GEM to application problems. In this work, we provide an experimental study on the selection of the Q value and found that Q value equal to half of average of input variances yield a good generalization capability of RBFNN.

Input and output of the algorithm are named as fault and hypothesis respectively. Because of the complexity and uncertainty of fault and symptom, it's difficult to accurately model the relationship of them in probabilistic fault localization. Fault localization algorithm depends on the prior specified model, and the parameter and structure of model is approximate correct and often differ from the real situation. So we propose DMCA+ algorithm which has 3 features: reduce the requirement for accuracy of initial conditions; statistically learn to automatically adapt the probability distribution of fault occurrence while localizing fault; generalize the MCA+ algorithm of no feedback. The feedback learning is similar with proportional adjusting of PID control, but increment is sensitive to detection rate because little increment adjusts output too slowly and big will result in a large number of error hypotheses.

The most popular heuristic information used in the decision tree generation is the minimum entropy. This heuristic information has a serious disadvantage-the poor generalization capability [3]. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification technique of machine learning based on statistical learning theory. It has good generalization. Considering the relationship between the classification margin of support vector machine(SVM) and the generalization capability, the large margin of SVM can be used as the heuristic information of decision tree, in order to improve its generalization capability. This paper proposes a decision tree induction algorithm based on large margin heuristic. Comparing with the binary decision tree using the minimum entropy as the heuristic information, the experiments show that the generalization capability has been improved by using the new heuristic.

In this paper, we proposed a multi-layer cascaded architecture, which can focus attention on the promising regions of the image. The whole classifiers are only evaluated on the face like parts of the image, while the most amount of background blocks are excluded by the first few layers of the detector. Instead of using predefined priori knowledge about face view partition, we divide the sample space automatically by the branching competitive learning network at different discriminative resolutions. To maintain the high detection efficiency, we adopt the simplified Support Vector Machines (SVMs), called the mirror pair of points (MPP) classifiers, as the component of our detection system. Experimental results show that our system is competitive with other systems presented recently in the literature.

In this paper, one inter-concepts strong association and dependency multi-label annotation method for video semantic concept is presented. In video content analysis process, concepts are often correlated. One concept in one shot are usually dependent on others concepts in the same shot. Co-occurrence of several semantic concepts could imply the presence of other concepts. Unlike previous approaches only to take into count the pair concepts correlations, the proposed methods exploits label correlations between concepts including more than three. For generation the inter-concepts association and dependency rules, join and prune techniques are employed to get potential semantic concept associations in one shot. Compound labels are considered as a single label in annotation step. Experiment results on real-world multi-label media data show that the performance of proposed method is relative satisfied.

CMTNN consist of a pair of opposite neural networks. The first neural network is trained to predict degree of truth values and the second neural network is trained to predict degree of falsity values. Both neural networks are complementary to each other since they deal with pairs of complementary output values. In order to predict the more accurate outputs, each pair of the truth and falsity values are aggregated based on two techniques which are equal weight combination and dynamic weight combination. The first technique is just a simple averaging whereas the second technique deals with errors occurred in the prediction. We experiment our approach to the classical benchmark problems including housing, concrete compressive strength, and computer hardware from the UCI machine learning repository. It is found that complementary neural networks Improve the prediction performance as compared to the traditional single backpropagation neural network and support vector regression used to predict only truth values. Furthermore, the difference between the predicted truth value and the complement of the predicted falsity value can be used as an uncertainty indicator to support the confidence in the prediction of unknown input data.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to discover self-correlation of stock price in virtue of the notion of time series motifs, by viewing stock price sequences as time series. Generally, time series motif is a pattern appearing frequently in a time sequence, useful to forecast the stock temporal tendencies and prices as a reliable part in time series. In the proposed approach, we firstly search for one part of time series motifs using ordinal comparison and k-NN clustering algorithm, and then attempt to discover the correlation between motifs and subsequences connected behind them. Experimental results demonstrate the positive contribution of time series motifs, the acceptable prediction accuracy, and priority of our algorithm.

In addition to a diagnostic engine capable of identifying grammatical, lexical and word usage errors of students' input translations and returning error contingent feedback, we have developed a simple table look-up parser for displying the grammar trees. The table look-up parser parses a user input, which is always erronous, by simply matching the extended part-of-speech tag sequence of a closing sentence in a template of ILTS to the entries of a look-up-table, in which each extended part-of-speech tag array corresponds to one grammar tree. The complexity of the table look-up parser is O(n), where n denotes the length of a sentence. This shows a marked improvement over the general purpose parser of which the complexity is O(n(3)).

There are lots of key issues worthy researching. In this paper, the Chinese handwriting identification technology based on texture analysis is discussed. Firstly, a practical Chinese handwriting image samples library CHSL2007 is established for the comparison of exist algorithms and further research. Then the methods of feature extraction based on texture analysis are explored and the pairwise SVM classifier is utilized. The experiment results of texture analysis based on Cabor filter is compared with DB6 wavelet filter and demonstrate that the former is more suitable for handwriting identification on CHSL2007. Finally, the sheet recognition rate is defined and can be arrived at above 99.50% for CHSL2007.

Methods of machine learning are widely used to the sentiment analysis. This paper presents an approach for Chinese sentiment analysis at phrase-level. A LMR template is designed to tag word features, like position, orientation, part of speech (POS), and so on. Then, Maximum Entropy (ME) model is employed to extract sentiment words. Parts of the first Chinese Opinion Analysis Evaluation (COAE2008) corpus are used in evaluation. Experimental results show that ME model with LMR template can achieve a good performance.

The IDS based on the new algorithm can be applied as pure SVM, pure CSOACN or their combination by constructing the detection classifier under three different training modes respectively. The initial experiments indicate that performance of their combination is better than pure SVM in terms of higher average detection rate as well as lower rates of both negative and positive false and is better than pure CSOACN in terms of less training time with comparable detection rate and false alarm rates.

However, we can't be able to get a satisfactory performance in many applications, as the KNN algorithm has a high computational complexity. Recent developments in programmable, highly paralleled Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have opened a new era of parallel computing which deliver tremendous computational horsepower in a single chip. In this paper, we describe a practical GPU based K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm implemented by CUDA. In our algorithm, a data segmentation method has introduced in the distances computation step to adapt to the CUDA thread model and memory hierarchy. We obtain highly increase in performance compared to ordinary CPU version.

Such R&D problems include global warming, emerging infectious diseases, and energy issues. One typical approach for identifying a group of expert candidates is to first come up with an initial expert and then use his/her referral to find additional experts. Hence the traditional process relies significantly on humans and their personal interrelationship. However with an increasing in the availability and accessibility of R&D information in electronic forms, one can apply techniques in the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning to automatically retrieve experts and their areas of expertise from such information sources. In this paper, we present an approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to discover experts and their associated areas of expertise from R&D bibliographic data. The LDA method could generate multiple hidden topics underlying the given data set. These topics are representatives for those multiple areas of expertise in which individual experts could be assigned into. As an illustration, we apply our approach to analyze abstracts from Compendex database in the domain of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs). Our approach can help enhance the traditional expert identification process in term of topical coverage and unbiased selection of expert candidates.

Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at distributed heterogeneous sources, and providing the user with a unified view of these data; a common and important scenario in data integration are structured or semi-structure data sources described by a schema. Ontology engineering is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the methodologies for building and maintaining ontologies. Ontology engineering offers a direction towards solving the interoperability problems brought about by semantic obstacles, such as the obstacles related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. In these contexts where users are confronted with heterogeneous information it is crucial the support of matching techniques. Matching techniques aim at finding correspondences between semantically related entities of different schemata/ontologies. Several matching techniques have been proposed in the literature based on different approaches, often derived from other fields, such as text similarity, graph comparison and machine learning. This paper proposes a matching technique based on Lexical Knowledge Extraction: first, an Automatic Lexical Annotation of schemata/ontologies is performed, then lexical relationships are extracted based on such annotations. Lexical Annotation is a piece of information added in a document (book, online record, video, or other data), that refers to a semantic resource such as WordNet. Each annotation has the property to own one or more lexical descriptions. Lexical annotation is performed by the Probabilistic Word Sense Disambiguation (PWSD) method that combines several disambiguation algorithms. Our hypothesis is that performing lexical annotation of elements (e.g. classes and properties/attributes) of schemata/ontologies makes the system able to automatically extract the lexical knowledge that is implicit in a schema/ontology and then to derive lexical relationships between the elements of a schema/ontology or among elements of different schemata/ontologies. The effectiveness of the method presented in this paper has been proven within the data integration system MOMIS (Beneventano D. et al., 2003).

We propose a general framework for handling dependencies across arms, based on a new assumption on the mean-reward function which is that it is drawn from a Gaussian Process (GP), with a given arm covariance matrix. We show on a toy problem that this allows to perform better than the popular UCB bandit algorithm, which considers arms to be independent.

Medical personnel have used the nomograms which are a graphical representation for numerical relationships that enables to easily compute a complicated function without help of computation machines. It has been widely paid attention in diagnosing diseases or predicting the progress of diseases. A nomogram is constructed from a set of clinical data which contain various attributes such as symptoms, lab experiment results, therapy history, progress of diseases or identification of diseases. It is of importance to select effective ones from available attributes, sometimes along with parameters accompanying the attributes. This paper introduces a nomogram construction method that uses a naive Bayesian technique to construct a nomogram as well as a genetic algorithm to select effective attributes and parameters.

Ayaka provides a general monitoring method for detecting anomalies using only resource usage information on systems independent of its domain, target application, and programming languages. Ayaka modifies the kernel to detect faults and uses a completely application black-box approach based on machine learning methods. It uses the clustering method to quantize the resource usage vector data and learn the normal patterns with a hidden Markov Model. In the running phase, Ayaka finds anomalies by comparing the application resource usage with the learned model. The evaluation experiment indicates that our prototype system is able to detect anomalies, such as SQL injection and buffer overrun, without significant overheads.

The conventional robot control consists of methods for path generation and path following. When a robot moves away the estimated path, it must return immediately, and while doing so, the obstacle avoidance behavior and the effectiveness of such a path are not guaranteed. So, motion control is a difficult task, especially in real time and high speed control. To achieve good tracking capability, this paper proposes a path following approach based on fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic control is used for the low level motion of a soccer robot. Firstly, the modeling of the soccer robot is presented. The soccer robot based on MiroSoT Small Size league is a differential-drive mobile robot with non-slipping and pure-rolling. Then, the design of fuzzy controller is describes. To validate the proposed fuzzy algorithm two experiments have been run: in the first experiment, the robot moves toward the static ball and shoots to the opponent goal; in the second, the robot avoid two obstacles and arrive at the desired position and shoots to the opponent goal.

Unfortunately, the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects, where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders. As a result, new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface, such as online forums and wiki pages. In our previous work, we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums, and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders. The framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view, conflicts, interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible. In this paper, we present two substantial enhancements to the Recommender System component of this framework, and demonstrate through experiments how they improve the quality of the recommendations.

The coprocessor architecture, targeted at both SVM training and classification, is based on clusters of vector processing elements (VPEs) operating in single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) mode to take advantage of large amounts of data parallelism in the application. We use the FPGA's DSP elements as parallel multiply-accumulators (MACs), a core computation in SVMs. A key feature of the architecture is that it is customized to low precision arithmetic which permits one DSP unit to perform two or more MACs in parallel. Low precision also reduces the required number of parallel off-chip memory accesses by packing multiple data words on the FPGA-memory bus. We have built a prototype using an off-the-shelf PCI-based FPGA card with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA and 1GB DDR2 memory. For SVM training, we observe application-level end-to-end computation speeds of over 9 billion multiply-accumulates per second (GMACs). For SVM classification, using data packing, the application speed increases to 14 GMACs.

We use SVM model based on (31)P MRS ((31)Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy) data to distinguish three categories of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic cirrhosis and normal hepatic tissue. The recognition accuracy of the three categories was obtained, and the classification accuracy of SVM based on polynomial and radial basis function kernel is compared. The result of experiments shows that SVM model based on (31)P MRS data provides diagnostic prediction of liver in vivo, and the performance based on polynomial is better than based on radial basis function kernel.

After the important pathways were discovered by computing the classification error rates of out-of-bag (OOB), the feature genes were also discovered according to these important pathways. The important pathways were recombined as the new gene sets and the classification error rates were recomputed by random forests algorithms. According to the rank and the frequency of feature genes, the important feature genes associated with disease were discovered. At each important pathway, the relativity of gene expression was also studied. The results showed that our method was available because the expressions of genes at the same pathway were approximate. Those genes selected by SAM software directly were not feature genes but noises. We also compared random forests with other machine learning methods and found that random forests classification error rates were the lowest. This method can provide biological insight into the study of microarray data.

Unfortunately, Raman spectroscopy data always has so many attributes that people who deal with them may often confront the problem of "curse of dimensionality". PCA is often used as a linear dimensionality reduction technique for preprocessing Raman data, which will not always get the satisfactory result, because Raman spectroscopy data are often distributed in nonlinear space. In this paper, we proposed a novel supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, KS-ISOMAP, which introduce kernel function and supervised learning to the ISOMAP, the experiments on Raman spectroscopy data and UCI data reveal that the KS-ISOMAP is a promising method and excellent in classification for Raman spectroscopy of leukemia cells.

To solve this problem, we focus in this paper on a Max-matching context kernel, which computes Max-matching points based on the angle between two points of sets and sums its context energy to Max-matching point energy. We prove Max-matching context kernel yields a Mercer kernel. We demonstrate our algorithm on Caltech 101's object recognition, which shows that the proposed method is accurate and significantly more efficient than current other approaches.

This algorithm preserves more geometrical knowledge of the high-dimensional data by local tangent space alignment, we take the method of automatic alignment of local representations to realize preserving the linear projection between every local coordinate and the global coordinate. Experiments show that method can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.

So discretizatioti of continuous attributes is one of the important steps in preprocessing of extracting knowledge. Traditional discretization algorithms based on clustering need a pre-determined clustering number k, also typically are applied in an unsupervised learning framework. This paper describes such an algorithm, called SX-means (Supervised X-means), which is a new algorithm of supervised discretization of continuous attributes on clustering. The algorithm modifies clusters with knowledge of the class distribution dynamically. And this procedure can not stop until the proper k is found. For the number of clusters k is not pre-determined by the user and class distribution is applied, the random of result is decreased greatly. Experimental evaluation of several discretization algorithms on six artificial data sets show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and can generate a better discretization schema. Comparing the output of C4.5, resulting tree is smaller, less classification rules, and high accuracy of classification.

Through the l(1)-minimization model, representing a test sample as the sparse combination of the training dictionary can effectively achieve facial images classification. However, when the number of training samples is relatively small, it is insufficient to give the test sample a sparse representation so that the recognition performance degenerates seriously. In this paper, we present a novel approach that employs the Elastic Net regularized regression model. Experimental results on several databases show that the proposed strategy improves the recognition accuracy.

It is also desirable to recognize the individuals who have been previously observed in a single-camera system. The method that represents a object image using a bag of visual words has been commonly used in image retrieval applications. For recognizing people, it can outperform the methods mainly based on global appearance like color histogram, and fit better to low-quality images compared to biometric features such as face and gait. In this paper we study the details in feature extraction, vocabulary building and classifier learning of the bag-of-features approach for classifying tracks of different individuals. Based on this approach, we design a online system applying incremental support vector machine learning with a decision scheme to distinguish reoccurrences from new targets. We get promising results from the evaluation with more than 100 tracks of 50 different people.

There have been many dimensionality reduction and manifold learning methods to discover the low dimensional representation from high dimensional data. Locality based manifold learning methods often rely on a distance metric between neighboring points. In this paper, we propose a new distance metric named relative distance, which is learned from the data and can better reflect the relative density. Combining the relative distance with Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE), we obtain a new algorithm called Relative Distance-based Laplacian Eigenmaps (RDLE) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Based on two different definitions of the relative distance, we give two variations of the RDLE. For efficient projection of out-of-sample data, we also present the linear version of RDLE, LRDLE. Experimental results on toy problems and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Sample selection is a feasible strategy to overcome the problem. From the geometry of SVM, it is clear that a SVM problem can be converted to a problem of computing the nearest points between two convex hulls. The convex hulls virtually determine the separating plane of SVM. Since a convex hull of a set only can be constructed by boundary samples of the convex hull, using boundary samples of each class to train SVM will be equivalent to using all training samples to train the classifier. In order to select boundary samples, this paper introduces a novel sample selection strategy named Kernel Subclass Convex Hull (KSCH) sample selection strategy, which iteratively select boundary samples of each class convex hull in high dimensional space (induced by kernel trick). Experimental results on face databases show that our KSCH sample selection method can select fewer high quality samples to maintain SVM with high recognition accuracy and quickly executing speed.

Inspired by the nearest point problem of SVM which computes the nearest points between two convex hulls, ASNP replaces the convex hulls with the affine subspaces of each class samples, i.e., ASNP approach constructs the two smallest subspaces which respectively contain the data in each class, and finds the closest points in two subspaces. Then, the plane, which bisects the line segment connecting the two points, is constructed as the separating plane. Compared with SVM, ASNP is simply a linear optimal problem, and it avoids the convex quadratic programming problem. We apply the ASNP approach on face recognition. The experiments on ORL face database, Yale face database and Harvard face database show that the performances of ASNP algorithms are competitive to l-NN classifier and SVM classifier for face classification.

After that we propose a gradient-based method for learning the width parameter of RBF kernels. This method is based on the possibility of computing the gradient of kernel polarization with respect to the width parameter. The proposed method is demonstrated with some UCI machine learning benchmark examples.

The proposed approach consists of three main steps. Firstly, a texture analysis is applied onto input abdominal CT images to extract pixel level features. Here, two main categories of features, namely Wavelet coefficients and Haralick texture descriptors are investigated. Secondly, support vector machines (SVM) are implemented to classify the data into pixel-wised liver or non-liver. Finally, specially combined morphological operations are designed as a post processor to remove noise and to delineate the liver. Our unique contributions to liver segmentation are twofold: one is that it has been proved through experiments that wavelet features present better classification than Haralick texture descriptors when SVMs are used; the other is that the combination of morphological operations with a pixel-wised SVM classifier can delineate volumetric liver accurately. The algorithm can be used in an advanced computer-aided liver disease diagnosis and surgical planning systems. Examples of applying the algorithm on real CT data are presented with performance validation based on the automatically segmented results and that of manually segmented ones.

However, the temporal evolution of dynamic texture is non-linear in general and is not fully captured by the linear model. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic texture learning and synthesis via nonlinear approach. Assuming that dynamic texture is sampled from a low dimensional manifold, the constrained Gaussian process latent variable model (CGPLVM) is proposed to model the dynamic texture as a set of latent states. The essence of dynamic texture is captured as the spatial relationship within the latent states. Moreover, Metropolis-Hastings sampling method is used to sample new states, which hold the spatio-temporal statistics of dynamic texture.

With the aim to integrate SVM training capability into embedded systems while being able to meet area and performance constraints, a parallel and scalable digital architecture for training SVMs on-line is proposed and implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Experiments show that the proposed SVM processor can solve the channel equalization problem effectively with fixed-point arithmetic and exhibits good scalability with respect to the number of cache update units (CUUs). This architecture is particularly suitable to be applied in embedded environments, as designers can easily trade off between area and performance to meet the constraints.

CSABAD is an improved immune algorithm proposed by us. According to the clonal selection principle and density control mechanism, only those cells that have higher affinity and lower density are selected to proliferate. In addition, we propose an improved approach, called Term Frequency, Inverted Document Frequency and Inverted Entropy (TFIDFIE), to compute term weights in document indexing. It considers the distribution of documents in the training set in which the term occurs. Our experiments show that SVM and CSABAD outperform significantly kNN and Naive Bayes, and TFIDFIE is more effective than TFIDF on OHSCAL data set.

Cluster analysis is an important field of DM, which is to classify things in light of certain requirements and rules and plays very important role in mining the useful data. Combining with the fuzzy clustering and using the general mathematical system theory, the fuzzy clustering system model is setup. Fuzzy theory is applied to cluster analysis of DM and how to make use of the fuzzy relationship among samples to analyze the correlation is discussed. The main application steps of fuzzy clustering analysis in DM and the corresponding example are given. Through analysis and discussion, it is concluded that there are a few of different classification about machine learning modes. Comparing with the real records, the results by the fuzzy clustering are in keeping with the investigation in information extraction of machine learning.

AAL systems make often use of wireless sensor networks, machine learning algorithms and sensory devices. Since wireless sensor networks and their sensors are inhomogeneous, it became apparent that such systems need to cope with different hardware platforms, different programming languages, unreliable wireless communication, energy constraints, data analysis algorithms, recognition of situations, and deployment options. Developers to date tend to use a bottom-up approach: hardware components dictate the development of AAL systems and thereby restrict the range of use cases that can be realized; domain experts by contrast would prefer a top-down approach and model the system's functionality independently from the hardware platform. Currently available software development environments and tools do not adequately support domain experts and developers to accomplish these tasks efficiently. This paper presents methods that support domain experts in their top-down approach, as well as technically experienced developers in their bottom-up approach. The implemented tools enable a model-driven software development process (from plalform-independent modeling to generating AAL application code) and thus facilitate programming AAL systems.

An alternative approachis to classify traffic by exploiting the distinctive characteristics of applications when they communicate on a network. We pursue this latter approach and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify groups of traffic that are similar using only transport layer statistics. Our work considers two unsupervised Clustering algorithms, namely K-Means and DBSCAN, that have previously not been used for network traffic classification. We evaluate these two algorithms, using empirical Internet traces. The experimental results show that both K-Means and DBSCAN work very well and much more quickly Our results indicate that although DBSCAN has lower accuracy compared to K-Meansand, DBSCAN produces better clusters.

The application of machine learning to document retrieval, which can be so called "learning to rank ", has been a hot research topic in the information retrieval and machine learning communities recently. One of the characters that discriminates this work from other studies is the use of semantic features while classifying the documents. Firstly, we extract the semantic structures from collection and index documents on these structures. Later, we construct a SVM classifier and generate it using pairwise training data. Lastly, we use this SVM to judge the relevance of documents according to given queries. In the extracting of semantic structures phrase, an analysis system that we developed previously is used. The analysis system is based on modifying relations (AM) and on the help of a knowledge base called MRKB. We give a general introduction about the system in this paper. The experiment is done on the benchmark dataset OHSUMED, and the experimental results shows that the proposed method outperforms other approaches based barely on string frequency.

In order to use these algorithms when some attributes are numeric, the numeric attributes must be discretized. Because of the prevalent of normal distribution, an approximate equal frequency discretization method based on normal distribution is presented. The method is simple to implement. Computing complexity of this method is nearly linear with the size of dataset and can be applied to large size dataset. We compare this method with some other discretization methods on the UCI datasets. The experiment result shows that this unsupervised discretization method is effective and practicable.

Second, we perform a classification using the histogram of the optical flow vectors and we use a chain coding algorithm that we applied to each class for the spatial segmentation. Finaly, we extract a high-level feature from any frame for use in the learning and search events by SVM and HMM.

Members of highly dangerous professions must obtain rigorous training so that they could bear the great historical mission. Generally speaking, these professions include armed forces, special police force, fire department, astronauts and mine disaster rescue troop. The game-based professional training systems for highly dangerous professions have their own distinct requirements. The aim of game-based learning systems is not only the study of declarative knowledge, but also entraining procedural knowledge through repeated practice until it becomes an automatic skill. The result of highly dangerous professional training is extremely important, since if a trainee dose not master the basic knowledge and skill, they could be in grave danger; the trainee's mental qualities should be continuously prompted by the training system so that they could be act intuitively under the most execrable circumstance. Based on requirements analysis and taking the case of mining rescue into account, we divide the whole training system into three parts: machine learning subsystem, brain information subsystem and credit-assignment subsystem. The machine learning subsystem (as know as serious game subsystem), contains the audio-visual coherency analysis, semantic annotation of a scene based on association memory, cooperating management of audio-visual cross-modal signals, personalization rendering of a scene. The brain information subsystem includes functions for receiving, storing and analyzing trainee's trial data based on visual and auditory signals from EEG, sEMG and psychological tests. The credit-assignment subsystem involves trainee's profiles and effect evaluation which are sent from brain information subsystem to machine learning subsystem, while the plan of knowledge learning, the result of skills training and consequence of the desensitization trial are sent as the feedback to brain information subsystem. Therefore, the whole framework works as a reinforcement learning system. The kernel of this system is the cooperating learning schema of audio-visual cross-modal signals. Furthermore, in this system the main visual signals contain scene textures, 3D character animation, 3D scene animation, while the main auditory signals contain the realistic sound, the on-the-spot orders, the on-the-spot yells and background music. In the light of cognitive principles, the following factors should be considered when a game-based leaning system is designed: (1) The working memory including phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad act as two slave systems, play the role of dual sensory channels so that semantic coherency of the visual and the auditory data could be combined with the prior knowledge to be formed as long-term memory; (2) A goal of cooperative learning for audio-visual cross-modal signals is to create an approach which can process verbal information(like the realistic sound and the on-the-spot orders) and non-verbal information(such as 3D character animation as well as 3D scene animation) from the two separate subsystems; (3) Schema acquisition (based on Theory of Cognitive Load-TCL) should be a primary means of learning, and the automation of cognitive process (including declarative knowledge procedural knowledge) will be used to reduce working memory load.

This paper presents, after a synergic new paradigm of intelligent systems, as a practical case study the fuzzy and temporal properties of knowledge formalism embedded in an Intelligent Control System (ICS), based on FT-algorithm. We are not dealing high with level reasoning methods, because we think that real-time problems can only be solved by rather low-level reasoning. For this, we use a fuzzy compiled structure of knowledge. Solving the match-time predictability problem would allow us to built much more powerful reasoning techniques.

Software testing and V&V (Verification and Validation) activities are very important for assuring high software quality. If we can predict the risky modules in safety-critical software, testing activities and regulation activities can be applied to them more intensively. In this paper, we classify the estimated risk classes which can be used for deep testing and V&V. We predict the risk class for each module using support vector machines. We can consider that the modules classified to risk class 5 or 4 are more risky than others relatively. For all classification error rates, we expect that the results can be useful and practical for software testing, V&V, and activities for regulatory reviews. In the future works, to improve the practicality, we will have to investigate other machine learning algorithms and datasets.

Large number of data attributes is easy to cause a system freezes or shuts down, especially in the neuro-fuzzy based learning. The purpose of BC is to reduce data dimensions by a binary or Boolean conversion process. All the attributes are reserved but combined into few numbers of new attributes instead of that some attributes are removed. Three data sets, nbuses, ACLP, and MONK3, are offered in this study to test and compare the learning accuracies and learning time. The results indicate that the proposed BC can keep about the same level of accuracy but increase the learning efficiency.

We mean formal languages theory and robot control communities. Blending research from both fields results in the appearance of a richer community, as has been proven by the emergence of many multidisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics and algebraic biology, to cite but two of the contiguous fields. Specifically, the present research work intends to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of grammatical inference (GI) in the control of robots for self-assembly purposes. Can we integrate the diversified works dealing with robotic self-assembly while concentrating on graph grammars as an alternative control methodology? Our aim is to answer positively this central question. As far as this paper is concerned, we only give the broad methodological lines of the research while stressing the integration of these different approaches into a single entity.

However, data sparsity remains one of the greatest obstacles to tagging languages with complex morphology. Research in POS tagging for Serbian language described in this paper has resulted in several original ideas for improving tagging accuracy and overcoming problems related to data sparsity for highly inflected languages. The POS tagger for Serbian described in this paper achieves an error rate of 10.0% when trained on a previously annotated text corpus containing 190,000 words, which is comparable with results reported for some other languages with a similar level of inflection.

We consider such AI problems as machine learning, text recognition and advanced computation in the context of granular computational models. Using the elaborated model, we demonstrate that granulation gives a powerful means for learning and computing.

Web mining is a critical issue in data mining as well as other information process techniques to the World Wide Web to discover useful patterns. People can take advantage of these patterns to access the World Wide Web more efficiently. Web mining can be divided into three categories such as content mining, usage mining, and structure mining. In this paper we are going to apply web content mining to extract non-English knowledge from the web. We will investigate and evaluate some common methods; using web mining systems which have to deal with issues in language-specific text processing. Arabic language-independent algorithm will be used as a machine learning system. The algorithm will use a set of features as a vector of keywords for the learning process to apply text classification for the system. The algorithm usually used to classify a various number of documents written in a non English text language. The techniques used in the algorithm to categorize and classified the documents are two classifiers: Classifier K-Nearest Neighbor (CK-NN) and Classifier Naive Bayes (CNB). However, the algorithms usually depend on some phrase segmentation and extraction programs to generate a set of features or keywords to represent the retrieved web documents. A proposed Arabic text classification system will be called Arabic Text Classifier (ATC). The main goal of ATC is to compares the results between both classifiers used (CK-NN, CNB) and select the best average accuracy result rates to start a retrieving process. The theorem behind the ATC was introduced in this paper without demonstrating any practical views of the system.

In this paper, we proposed an automatic sleep stages classification system by analyzing rat's EEG signal. The rat's EEG signal is transferred by FFT and then extracted features. These extracted features are used as training patterns to further construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two components, the principle component analysis (PCA) as the first component is used to projects the high dimensional features into lower dimensional subspace, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method as the second component is applied to identify the physiological state for a period of EEG signal. By experimenting on 810 periods of EEG signal, the proposed classification system achieves satisfactory classification accuracy of sleep stages.

However, there is no single classifier that works the best in all classification problems. In pervasive adaptive systems the classification of human cognitive, emotional and physical states may be somewhat specific and should be closer to the way humans actually recognize these states. As an attempt in this direction we propose a probabilistic semantic classifier, which is based on discretization, structure identification and semantic optimization. Furthermore, this classifier supports three types of learning characteristic for humans: by repetition, by generalization and by specialization.

It is important since a data center comprises thousands of machines and thus a single-digit performance improvement can significantly reduce cost and power consumption. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult as data centers are dynamic environments where applications are frequently released and servers are continually upgraded. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of different processor prefetch configurations, which can greatly influence the performance of memory system and the overall data center. We observe a wide performance gap when comparing the worst and best configurations, from 1.4% to 75.1%, for 11 important data center applications. We then develop a tuning framework which attempts to predict the optimal configuration based on hardware performance counters. The framework achieves performance within 1% of the best performance of any single configuration for the same set of applications.

In an imbalanced data set, the number of instances in at least one class is significantly greater or smaller than that in other classes. Consequently, when developing a classification model with imbalanced data, most classifiers are subjected to the unequal number of instances in each class and thereby fail to construct an accurate classification model. Balance the sample sizes from different classes using re-sampling strategy is a common approach to enhance the accuracy of a classification model for an imbalanced data. Many studies utilized try-and-error method to determine the appropriate sampling proportion in each class for imbalanced data. The try-and-error method may not effectively classify the imbalanced data if the sampling strategy determined by the try-and-error method does not include the optimal sampling strategy. The conventional under-sampling strategy or over-sampling strategy determines just a specified sampling strategy. If the optimal sampling proportion for each class is not the specific sampling strategy determined by over-sampling approach or under-sampling approach, the classifiers cannot develop an effective classification model either. This study proposes a procedure to determine the optimal re-sampling strategy using design of experiments (D.O.E.). The proposed procedure can be utilized by any classifier. Finally, the classification model based on the training data obtained from the proposed procedure is verified to be more accurate than that obtained using the try-and-error method, over-sampling approach or under-sampling approach.

Numerous researchers employed these features to study the utilization of machine learning for intrusion detection and reported detection rates up to 91% with false positive rates less than 1%. Unfortunately, with these 41 derived features as inputs, IDS systems take long time to converge when training and work slowly during on-line detections. We reduced the number of inputs while keeping IDS systems high detection rates. After simulation, analysis and experiment, we reduce the input number to 18, get a "best" architecture, i.e. 18-36-1, of BP neural network for IDS systems. Furthermore, we find an appropriate training function, i.e. trainbfg, for our "best" architecture.

Segmenting Chinese text to words is the first job for every kind of Chinese information processing, so Chinese word segmentation is a basal and difficult issue in the field of Chinese information processing. Traditional word segmentation systems have to establish the dictionary and add unknown words out of the dictionary with manual work. This paper proposes a new Chinese word segmentation model which can automatically establish a dictionary, gradually update it and perfect it based on machine learning. Four modules of the machine learning model for Chinese word segmentation system are introduced in detail and some improvements of the algorithms are made on some module to improve system performance. After the test of closed corpus and open corpus, the results show that the method alleviates the workload of building and maintaining the dictionary, furthermore, it resolves the issues of ambiguity processing and unknown words recognition.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a new algorithm of machine learning based on statistical learning theory. Compared with traditional method, SVM can be established under condition of deficient samples and abnormal observation result can be rejected effectively. Based on comprehensive analysis of effect factors on subsidence coefficient such as mechanical characteristics of upper rock stratum, thickness of alluvium deposit, ratio value of mining deepness to thickness, mining method and roof control method, etc, data from tens of typical observation stations was used as training samples, by means of electing kernel function, insensitive loss function, proper penalty factor, regression relation model of SVM was designed between subsidence coefficient and affecting factors. Finally, testing and analyzing was done, and research results show that the SVM relation model can calculate subsidence coefficient and reliable precision can be got, which can meet the requirement of engineering. Research findings prove that the method to calculate subsidence coefficient based on SVM method is feasible. Besides, multiple effect factors can be comprehensively considered with this method, thus a new approach of efficient and accurate calculation of subsidence coefficient is provided for future research.

The designed system is simple enough not to introduce significant computational overhead, but at the same time is accurate, adaptive and fast. There is a large number of existing solutions based on machine learning techniques, but most of then) introduce high computational overhead. Moreover, due to its inherent parallelism, our solution offers a possibility of implementation using reconfigurable hardware with the implementation cost much lower than the one of the traditional systems.

Each security camera has an associated knowledge base which is updated when the environmental conditions change.

The main challange in this matter is to recognise the multiple patterns that exist across possibly heterogeneous sources. Traditional machine learning methods can generate grammars for a set of training examples but the disadvantage is their potential heavy computational overhead. The proposed incremental grammar learning method offers immediate learning of new examples by slight alteration of the existing grammar collections by measuring the changes needed to equalize two grammars. This minimal combination approach avoids overgeneralization and maintains the coverage of newly learnt and past examples without a need to repeat the training process. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms a fuzzy grammar learning algorithm implemented in normal supervised learning setting.

These physical-chemical parameters have influence on the entire lake web food chain, thus disturbing the organism's patterns and interactions between them, such as diatoms community. These communities have where high coefficient of indication on certain process such as eutrophication, which means that they can be used as bio-indicators of water quality. The CN2 algorithm can produce rules in a form IF-THEN which is suitable for organizing knowledge from diatoms abundance data. In literature the diatoms have ecological preference organized in the same manner. The experimental setup is build to satisfy not only the algorithm properties, but also the ecological knowledge of the diatoms community. We used several modifications of the algorithm, from which we compare the classification accuracy or rule quality to point which experiment proved to be most accuracy and more general. Several of the rules are presented in this paper together with the evaluation performance. Based on modifications of the CN2 algorithm parameters, we were able to extract certain knowledge form the data, which later have proved to be valid, or in some cases is novel for many newly discovered diatoms. In future we plan to investigate more modifications of the CN2 algorithm, also to implement multi-classification rule induction and compare these results to the single target.

In order to discriminate the clouds, the article applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to some channels of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which are sensitive to characteristic of clouds. To prove the performance of the cloud detection algorithm, the article uses the MODIS images of typical areas under distinct underlying surfaces in different daytime and nighttime as training and testing samples. By comparison with Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) data and MODIS Cloud Mask product, it is proved that the algorithm is good at detecting the territorial cloud and some pixels with small area. The SVM algorithm is a kind of practical machine learning method for cloud detection and good preparation for cloud elimination. What is more, the article indicates improved methods to cloud detection with SVM.

Currently, most approaches to text classification adopt the 'bag-of-words' document representation approach, where the frequency of occurrence of each word is considered as the most important feature, but this method ignores important semantic relationships between key terms. In this paper, we proposed a system that uses ontologies and Natural Language Processing techniques to index texts. Traditional BOW matrix is replaced by "Bag of Concepts"(BOC). For this purpose, we developed fully automated methods for mapping keywords to their corresponding ontology concepts.

Biomimetic Pattern Recognition is a new model of Pattern Recognition based on "matter cognition" instead of "matter classification" This new model is much closer to the function of human being, than traditional statistical Pattern Recognition using "optimal separating" as its main principle-This paper proposes a high-dimensional descriptive way about multispectral image. Geometrical properties of high-dimensional structures underlying a set of samples are learned via successive projections from fire higher dimension to tire lower dimension until Clifford space, under guidance of the established properties and theorems in high-dimensional descriptive way. Specifically, we introduce a principle of homology continuity based on Clifford Algebra and provides a geometrical learning algorithm for specifying Clifford Algebra shapes, which is then applied to biomimetic pattern recognition.

Unascertained system that imitates the human brain's thinking logical is a kind of mathematical tools used to deal with imprecise and uncertain knowledge. Integrating unascertained method with neural network technology, the reasoning process of network coding can be tracked, and the output of the network can be given a physical explanation.

Our result follows from the connection between boosting algorithms and hard-core set constructions discovered by Klivans and Servedio [11]. Informally stated, our result is the following: suppose we fix a family of boolean functions. Assume there is an efficient algorithm which for every input length and every smooth distribution (i.e. one that doesn't assign too much weight to any single input) over the inputs produces a circuit such that the circuit computes the boolean function noticeably better than random. Then, there is an efficient algorithm which for every input length produces a circuit that computes the function correctly on almost all inputs. Our algorithm significantly simplifies previous proofs of the uniform and the non-uniform hard-core lemma, while matching or improving the previously best known parameters. The algorithm uses a generalized multiplicative update rule combined with a natural notion of approximate Bregman projection. Bregman projections are widely used in convex optimization and machine learning. We present an algorithm which efficiently approximates the Bregman projection onto the set of high density measures when the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used as a distance function. Our algorithm has a logarithmic runtime over any domain from which we can efficiently sample. High density measures correspond to smooth distributions which arise naturally, for instance, in the context of online learning. Hence, our technique may be of independent interest.

Although finding the Minimal Consistent Subset is not feasible in many real applications, several authors have proposed methods to find small consistent subsets. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for this task, based on support graphs. Experiments over a wide range of repository databases show that our algorithm finds consistent subsets with lower cardinality than traditional methods.

The image database is composed of 433 benign lesions and 80 malignant melanoma. After an image pre-processing stage that includes hair removal filtering, each image is automatically segmented using well known image segmentation algorithms. Then, each lesion is characterized by a feature vector that contains shape, color and texture information, as well as local and global parameters that try to reflect structures used in medical diagnosis. The learning and classification stage is performed using AdaBoost.M1 with C4.5 decision trees. For the automatically segmented database, classification delivered a false positive rate of 8.75% for a sensitivity of 95%. The same classification procedure applied to manually segmented images by an experienced dermatologist yielded a false positive rate of 4.62% for a sensitivity of 95%.

We investigate the use of machine learning approaches for the objective segmentation and quantification of leaf area damaged by mites in avocado leaves. After extraction of the leaf veins, pixels are labeled with a look-up table generated using a Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kernel of degree 3, on the chrominance components of YCrCb color space. Spatial information is included in the segmentation process by rating the degree of membership to a certain class and the homogeneity of the classified region.

The quality of the server models is close to that of human ones but the human predictions incorporate more diverse templates from other servers which improve the human predictions in some of the distant homology targets. For the first time, the sequence-based contact predictions from machine learning techniques are found helpful for both template-based modeling (TBM) and template-free modeling (FM). In TBM, although the accuracy of the sequence based contact predictions is on average lower than that from template-based ones, the novel contacts in the sequence-based predictions, which are complementary to the threading templates in the weakly or unaligned regions, are important to improve the global and local packing in these regions. Moreover, the newly developed atomic structural refinement algorithm was tested in CASP8 and found to improve the hydrogen-bonding networks and the overall TM-score, which is mainly due to its ability of removing steric clashes so that the models can be generated from cluster centroids. Nevertheless, one of the major issues of the I-TASSER pipeline is the model selection where the best models could not be appropriately recognized when the correct templates are detected only by the minority of the threading algorithms. There are also problems related with domain-splitting and mirror image recognition which mainly influences the performance of I-TASSER modeling in the FM-based structure predictions.

Prediction of global and local model quality in CASP8 using the ModFOLD server	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						model quality assessment program; protein structure prediction; comparative modelling; fold recognition; quality prediction; clustering; metaserver; consensus	PROTEIN-STRUCTURE PREDICTIONS; FOLD-RECOGNITION; SCORING FUNCTION	The development of effective methods for predicting the quality of three-dimensional (3D) models is fundamentally important for the success of tertiary structure (TS) prediction strategies. Since CASP7, the Quality Assessment (QA) category has existed to gauge the ability of various model quality assessment programs (MQAPs) at predicting the relative quality of individual 3D models. For the CASP8 experiment, automated predictions were submitted in the QA category using two methods from the ModFOLD server-ModFOLD version 1.1 and ModFOLDclust. ModFOLD version 1.1 is a single-model machine learning based method, which was used for automated predictions of global model quality (QMODE1). ModFOLDclust is a simple clustering based method, which was used for automated predictions of both global and local quality (QMODE2). In addition, manual predictions of model quality were made using ModFOLD version 2.0-an experimental method that combines the scores from ModFOLDclust and ModFOLD v1.1. Predictions from the ModFOLDclust method were the most successful of the three in terms of the global model quality, whilst the ModFOLD v1.1 method was comparable in performance to other single-model based methods. In addition, the ModFOLDclust method performed well at predicting the per-residue, or local, model quality scores. Predictions of the per-residue errors in our own 3D models, selected using the ModFOLD v2.0 method, were also the most accurate compared with those from other methods. All of the MQAPs described are publicly accessible via the ModFOLD server at: http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/. The methods are also freely available to download from: http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/downloads/.

A soccer robot has to take an appropriate decision based on environment situation. With the role of a robot fixed as goalkeeper, the supervisor, according to the game situation, assigns the role of attacking or defending to the other robots and then the respective controllers control the robots. The controller for the attacking robot is designed using Petri nets. The Petri net model are implemented in Petri Net Toolbox under MATLAB environment. Finally, the feasibility of the Petri net model for the attacking robots is demonstrated by the experimental results.

The reason is that these systems are able to characterize the applications' normal behavior in an automated fashion. However, anomaly-based detectors for web applications suffer from false positives that are generated whenever the applications being protected change. These false positives need to be analyzed by the security officer who then has to interact with the web application developers to confirm that the reported alerts were indeed erroneous detections. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the automatic detection of changes in web applications, which allows for the selective retraining of the affected anomaly detection models. We demonstrate that, by correctly identifying legitimate changes in web applications, we can reduce false positives and allow for the automated retraining of the anomaly models. We have evaluated our approach by analyzing a number of real-world applications. Our analysis shows that web applications indeed change substantially over time, and that our technique is able to effectively detect changes and automatically adapt the anomaly detection models to the new structure of the changed web applications.

With the growing popularity of mobile devices in the last few years, attacks targeting them are also surging. Existing mobile malware detection techniques, which are often borrowed from solutions to Internet malware detection, do not perform as effectively due to the limited computing resources on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose Virus Meter, a novel and general malware detection method, to detect anomalous behaviors on mobile devices. The rationale underlying Virus Meter is the fact that mobile devices are usually battery powered and any malicious activity would inevitably consume some battery power. By monitoring power consumption on a mobile device, Virus Meter catches misbehaviors that lead to abnormal power consumption. For this purpose, Virus Meter relies on a concise user-centric power model that characterizes power consumption of common user behaviors. In a real-time mode, Virus Meter can perform fast malware detection with trivial runtime overhead. When the battery is charging (referred to as a battery-charging mode), Virus Meter applies more sophisticated machine learning techniques to further improve the detection accuracy. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, we have implemented a Virus Meter prototype on Nokia 5500 Sport and used it to evaluate some real cellphone malware, including FlexiSPY and Cabir.

S	Calic, J		Grgic, M; Delac, K; Ghanbari, M		Calic, Janko			New Video Abstractions for Summarisation and Browsing	RECENT ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter								In present-day technological developments of multimedia systems, the most challenging conundrum facing the signal processing community is how to facilitate effortless access to a rich profusion of of audio-visual data. In order to enable the intuitive access to large video archives, the areas of video summarisation and abstraction have become momentous. The main challenge of the systems for video summarisation and browsing is to achieve a good balance between removal of redundant sections of video and representative coverage of the video summary. The methods represented in this chapter make a shift towards more user-centred summarisation and browsing of large video collections by augmenting interaction rather than learning the way users create related semantics. A comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art methods in the area of video summarisation and browsing is presented, followed by a detailed analysis of a novel approach to temporal video representation. In order to create an effortless and intuitive access to the overwhelming extent of Visual information, we propose exploitation of universally familiar abstractions Such as linking ranking with spatial linear ordering and presented size, projecting highly dimensional data onto the 2D/3D visualisation space as well as using narrative structure of sequential visual art. To achieve this goal, a set of sophisticated yet robust machine learning and knowledge discovery methods are employed. By combining efficient multimedia signal processing and the computational intelligence, coupled with the user-centric interface design, the presented visualisation systems augments the vast abstract space of visual similarity, thus enabling responsive environment for intuitive experience of large-scale video databases.

The effectiveness of our optimization tool is evaluated against two benchmarks executed on a multi-core SMP machine.

While the former approaches focus on predictive accuracy, the latter ones prove to be indispensable in knowledge discovery. In this paper we present a relational description of machine learning problems. We demonstrate how common ensemble learning methods as used in classifier learning can be reformulated in a relational setting. It is shown that multimodal logics and relational data analysis with rough sets are closely related. Finally, we give an interpretation of logic programs as approximations of hypotheses. It is demonstrated that at a certain level of abstraction all these methods unify into one and the same formalisation which nicely connects to multimodal operators.

B	Bosnic, Z; Kononenko, I		Hayworth, GI		Bosnic, Zoran; Kononenko, Igor			RELIABILITY ESTIMATION OF INDIVIDUAL PREDICTIONS IN SUPERVISED LEARNING	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING ADVANCES			English	Article; Book Chapter							SELECTION	In machine learning, estimation of predictive accuracy for a given model is most commonly approached by analyzing the average accuracy of the model. In general, the predictive models do not provide reliability estimates for their individual predictions. The reliability estimates of individual predictions require the analysis of specific model and instance properties. Measuring the prediction reliability is very important in risk-sensitive areas where acting upon predictions may have significant consequences (e.g. medical diagnosis, stock market, navigation, control applications). In such areas, appropriate reliability estimates may provide additional information about the prediction correctness and can enable the user (e.g. medical doctor) to differentiate between more and less reliable predictions. This chapter summarizes research areas, which provide the motivating ideas for the development of the approaches for individual prediction reliability. Based on these motivations, we describe five approaches to reliability estimation (i.e., local sensitivity analysis, bagging variance, local cross-validation, density estimation, local error modeling) and define the corresponding reliability estimates. The empirical evaluation of eight estimates using 28 testing domains and 8 regression models indicated the promising results, especially for the usage with regression trees. The testing results also reveal that the reliability estimates exhibit different performance with different regression models and domains. To deal with this issue, we describe two approaches for automatic selection of the most appropriate estimate for a given domain and regression model: (i) the meta-learning approach and (ii) the internal cross-validation approach. The empirical results of both approaches show the advantage of the dynamically selected reliability estimate for a given domain/model pair, when compared to individual reliability estimates in terms of higher positive correlation to the prediction error. The described methodology was applied to a medical prognostic domain, which provided the medical experts with a significant improvement of the prognostic system.

J	Hahner, U; Seeger, B				Haehner, Ulrike; Seeger, Bernhard			IT-Supported Long-Term Risk Analysis for the Savigny Estate at Marburg University Library	RESTAURATOR-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PRESERVATION OF LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL MATERIAL			English	Article								Machine learning and data mining in information technology can assist in the assessment of documents endangered in the long term by ink corrosion. Using this kind of data collection, useful information could be extrapolated, such as the stages of the progress of ink corrosion and the inclusion of external damage factors. In this way, the change in manuscripts resulting from differing storage conditions could be simulated in order to support decisions taken about the choice of treatment. In addition, criteria for recommendations could be assembled by means of machine learning processes, which could form a decision-making tool about treatment options. In order to create such a system, it is necessary to establish damage stages, keywords as a threshold value for recommendations and for the assignment of additional distinguishing features such as value of the manuscripts. The contribution show the groundwork was laid to registration of the information of handwritten documents, the data capture and documentation criteria and the possible uses of a database system.

Among others, robots need to be able to adapt their behavior in order to facilitate the interaction with a human partner. This can be achieved using machine learning techniques. However, most machine learning scenarios to-date do not address the question of how learning can be achieved for tightly coupled, physical touch interactions between the learning agent and a human partner. This paper presents an example for such human in-the-loop learning scenarios and proposes a computationally cheap learning algorithm for this purpose. The efficiency of this method is evaluated in an experiment, where human care givers help an android robot to stand up.

Especially when simulating legged robots which have optimized gaits resulting from machine learning, manually finding a proper configuration within the high-dimensional parameter space of the simulation environment becomes a demanding task. In this paper, we describe a multi-staged approach for automatically optimizing a large set of different simulation parameters. The optimization is carried out offline through an evolutionary algorithm which uses the difference between the recorded data of a real robot and the behavior of the simulation as fitness function. A model of an AIBO robot performing a variety of different walking gaits serves as an example of the approach.

In realistic MAS applications such as RoboCup, repeated work has shown that traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have difficulty mapping directly from cooperative, behaviours to actuator outputs. To overcome this problem, vertical layered architectures are commonly used to break cooperation down into behavioural layers: NIL has then been used to generate different low-level skills, and a planning mechanism added to create high-level cooperation. We propose, a novel method called Policy Search Planning (PSP); in which Policy Search is used to find all optimal policy for selecting plans from a plan pool. PSP extends an existing gradient-search method (GPOMDP) to a MAS domain. We demonstrate how PSP call be used in RoboCup Simulation, and our experimental results reveal robustness, adaptivity, and over other methods.

Automatic extraction of news titles and contents from news pages therefore is air important technique for applications like news aggregation systems. However, extracting news titles accurately from news pages of various styles is found to be a challenging task in previous work. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to tackle this problem. Our approach is independent of templates and thus will riot suffer from the updates of templates which usually invalidate the corresponding extractors. Empirical evaluation of our approach over 5,200 news Web pages collected from 13 important on-line news sites shows that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of news title extraction.

Obviously, Such kind Granular Computing (GrC) has close relationship with machine learning. In this paper, we try to study the machine learning under the point of view of Granular Computing (GrC). Granular Computing (GrC) should contain two parts: (1) dimensional reduction, and (2) information transformation. We proved that although there are tremendous algorithms for dimensional reduction, their ability can't transcend the old fashion wavelet kind nested layered granular computing. To change a high dimensional complex distribution domain to a low dimensional and simple domain is the task of information transformation. We proved that such kind mapping can be achieved as a granular computing by solving a quadric optimization problem.

This paper proposes the application of SVM in classifying the causes of voltage sag in power distribution system. Voltage sag is among the major power quality disturbances that can cause Substantial loss of product and also can attribute to malfunctions, instabilities and shorter lifetime of the load. Voltage sag can be caused by fault in power system, starting of induction motor and transformer energizing. All IEEE 30 bus system is modeled using the PSCAD software to generate the data for different type of voltage sag namely, caused by fault and starting of induction motor. Feature extraction using the wavelet transformation for the SVM input has been performed prior to the classification of the voltage sag cause. Two kernels functions are used namely Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Polynomial function. The minimum and maximum of the wavelet energy are used as the input to the SVM and analysis on the performance of these two kernels are presented. In this paper, it has been found that the Polynomial kernel performed better as compared to the RBF in classifying the cause of voltage sag in power system.

We wanted to cover permutation-state methods, search-state methods, bias methods, swarm intelligence and machine learning. For accuracy, for each algorithm, we provide its description summarizing the original paper, and mention its strengths and weaknesses. Even if each algorithm may address particular issues, in order to prove their eligibility, but also to have an unified benchmark, we imagined an on-line oversubscribed scheduling scenario, named Simplified Automobile Repair Shop scheduling problem, and used data from a real automobile repair shop for testing.

Work to date on this problem has relied on identification of specific byte sequences in file headers and footers, and the use of statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms taken from the middle of the file. We argue that these approaches are fundamentally flawed because they fail to consider the inherent internal structure in widely used file types such as PDF, DOC, and ZIP. We support our argument with a bottom-up examination of some popular formats and an analysis of TK PDF files. Based on our analysis, we argue that specialized methods targeted to each specific file type will be necessary to make progress in this area.

This paper assesses the limitations of conventional practices in combating crime and illustrates the application of innovative artificial intelligence software to assumed unrelated databases - demographic, geographic, socio-economic and others - to find more effective ways to prevent criminal incidents. True unsupervised machine learning artificial intelligence software developed in South Africa provides neural network prediction of criminal incidents by identification of supposedly unrelated variables. Application of the software to find the hidden critical factors leading to bank robberies is illustrated in a specific case, where a robbery at a specific bank branch was predicted with an exceptionally high level of accuracy.

Prediction of chemical carcinogenicity by machine learning approaches	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						support vector machine; carcinogenicity; feature selection; Monte Carlo simulated annealing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RODENT CARCINOGENICITY; MOLECULAR DESCRIPTORS; TOXICOLOGY CHALLENGE; TRAINING SET; CLASSIFICATION; TOXICITY; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; MUTAGENS	In this paper we report a successful application of machine learning approaches to the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity. Two different approaches, namely a support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were evaluated for predicting chemical carcinogenicity from molecular structure descriptors. A diverse set of 844 compounds, including 600 carcinogenic (CG+) and 244 noncarcinogenic (CG-) molecules, was used to estimate the accuracies of these approaches. The database was divided into two sets: the model construction set and the independent test set. Relevant molecular descriptors were selected by a hybrid feature selection method combining Fischer's score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing from a wide set of molecular descriptors, including physiochemical properties, constitutional, topological, and geometrical descriptors. The first model validation method was based a five-fold cross-validation method, in which the model construction set is split into five subsets. The five-fold cross-validation was used to select descriptors and optimise the model parameters by maximising the averaged overall accuracy. The final SVM model gave an averaged prediction accuracy of 90.7% for CG+ compounds, 81.6% for CG- compounds and 88.1% for the overall accuracy, while the corresponding ANN model provided an averaged prediction accuracy of 86.1% for CG+ compounds, 79.3% for CG- compounds and 84.2% for the overall accuracy. These results indicate that the hybrid feature selection method is very efficient and the selected descriptors are truly relevant to the carcinogenicity of compounds. Another model validation method, i.e. a hold-out method, was used to build the classification model using the selected descriptors and the optimised model parameters, in which the whole model construction set was used to build the classification model and the independent test set was used to test the predictive ability of the model. The SVM model gave a prediction accuracy of 87.6% for CG+ compounds, 79.1% for CG- compounds and 85.0% for the overall accuracy. The ANN model gave a prediction accuracy of 85.6% for CG+ compounds, 79.1% for CG- compounds and 83.6% for the overall accuracy. The results indicate that the built models are potentially useful for facilitating the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity of untested compounds.	[Rao, H. B.; Li, Z.

Many existing management approaches require static a priori policy deployment but our proposal goes one step further modifying initially deployed policies by learning from the system behaviour. We use a hierarchical policy model to show the connection of high level goals with network level configurations. We also intend to solve two important and mostly forgotten issues: the system has multiple goals some of them contradictory and we will show how to overcome it; and, some current works optimize one network element but being unaware of other participants; instead, our proposed scheme takes into account various social behaviours, such as cooperation and competition among different elements.

As such, it is solved by formulating an energy functional depending on a contour and other image derived terms. The solution of the segmentation problem is the contour which extremizes this functional. The standard way of solving this optimization problem is by gradient descent search in the solution space, which typically suffers from many unwanted local optima and poor convergence. Classically, these problems have been circumvented by modifying the energy functional. In contrast, the focus of this paper is on alternative methods for optimization. Inspired by ideas from the machine learning community, we propose segmentation based on gradient descent with momentum. Our results show that typical models hampered by local optima solutions can be further improved by this approach. We illustrate the performance improvements using the level set framework.

The central contribution of this paper is a thorough performance study of four popular matrix factorization techniques, namely, LU, Cholesky, QR and SVD on the STI Cell broadband engine. The paper explores algorithmic as well as implementation challenges related to the Cell chip-multiprocessor and explains how we achieve near-linear speedup on most of the factorization techniques for a range of matrix sizes. For each of the factorization routines, we identify the bottleneck kernels and explain how we have attempted to resolve the bottleneck and to what extent we have been successful. Our implementations, for the largest data sets that we use, running on a two-node 3.2 GHz Cell BladeCenter (exercising a total of sixteen SPEs), on average, deliver 203.9, 284.6, 81.5, 243.9 and 54.0 GFLOPS for dense LU, dense Cholesky, sparse Cholesky, QR and SVD, respectively. The implementations achieve speedup of 11.2, 12.8, 10.6, 13.0 and 6.2, respectively for dense LU, dense Cholesky, sparse Cholesky, QR and SVD, when running on sixteen SPEs. We discuss the interesting interactions that result from parallelization of the factorization routines on a two-node non-uniform memory access (NUMA) Cell Blade cluster.	[Vishwas, B.

Blog classification using machine learning techniques is a key method towards doing it. We have devised a machine learning algorithm where features are created from individual sentences in the body of a blog by taking one word at a time. Weights are assigned to the features based on the strength of their predictive capabilities for illegitimate/legitimate determination. The predictive capabilities are estimated by the frequency of occurrence of the feature in illegitimate/legitimate collections. During classification, total illegitimate and legitimate evidence in the blog is obtained by summing up the weights of extracted features of each class and the message is classified into whichever class accumulates the greater sum. We compared the algorithm against the popular Naive Bayes algorithm and found its performance does not deteriorate in the least than that of Nave Bayes algorithm both in terms of catching blog spam and for reducing false positives	[Roy, Pinki; Roy, Amrit; Thirani, Vineet] Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Silchar 10, Assam, India	Roy, P (reprint author), Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Silchar 10, Assam, India.	pinkiroy05@yahoo.co.in; amritroy@gmail.com; vineet_nits_2103@yahoo.co.uk					Carreras X., 2001, P 4 INT C REC ADV NA, P58; Chhabra S, 2004, FOURTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS, P347, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2004.10031; Drucker H, 1999, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V10, P1048, DOI 10.1109/72.788645; McCallum A., 1998, AAAI 98 WORKSH LEARN, P41; RENNIE J, 2000, KDD 2000 WORKSH TEXT; YERAZUNIS WS, 2003, MIT SPAM C JAN	6	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3925-6	INT C COMP ELEC ENG			2009							205	208		10.1109/ICCEE.2009.202		4	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BOK69	WOS:000276905300041

However, only a small portion of static analysis alerts may be important to the developer (actionable). The remainder are false positives (unactionable). We propose a process for building false positive mitigation models to classify static analysis alerts as actionable or unactionable using machine learning techniques. For two open source projects, we identify sets of alert characteristics predictive of actionable and unactionable alerts out of 51 candidate characteristics. From these selected characteristics, we evaluate 15 machine learning algorithms, which build models to classify alerts. We were able to obtain 88-97% average accuracy for both projects in classifying alerts using three to 14 alert characteristics. Additionally, the set of selected alert characteristics and best models differed between the two projects, suggesting that false positive mitigation models should be project-specific.

In the absence of a test oracle, one approach to testing these applications is to use metamorphic testing: existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x' such that we can predict f(x') based on f(x); if the application or function does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x') (or both) is wrong. By using metamorphic testing, we are able to provide built-in "pseudo-oracles "for these so-called "non-testable programs" that have no test oracles. In this paper we describe an approach in which a function's metamorphic properties are specified using an extension to the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral interface specification language that is used to support the "design by contract" paradigm in Java applications. Our implementation, called Corduroy, pre-processes these specifications and generates test code that can be executed using JML runtime assertion checking, for ensuring that the specifications hold during program execution. In addition to presenting our approach and implementation, we also describe our findings from case studies in which we apply our technique to applications without test oracles.

It is thus computationally infeasible on very large data sets. TFA was put forward to overcome this problem,but it is not perfect to large scale problems. We propose CB-TFA based on TFA. CB-TFA decompose large datasets to data blocks,get the solution by chain iteration,taking TFA as basis algorithm, reduce the time complexitiy further more while keeping high accuracy and sparsity simultaneously. Regression experiments with synthetical large benchmark data set demonstrates CB-TFA yields state-of-the-art performance.

It analyzes RC4 by Data mining algorithm (J48) for the first time and discloses more vulnerabilities of RC4. The motivation for this paper is combining Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning with cryptography to decrypt cyphertext in the shortest possible time. This analysis shows that lots of numbers in RC4 during different permutations and substitutions do not change their positions and are fixed in their places. This means KSA and PRGA are bad shuffle algorithms. In this method, the information theory and Decision trees are used which are very powerful for solving hard problems and extracting information from data. The results of this Data mining approach could be used to improve the existing methods of breaking WEP (or other encryption algorithms) in less time with fewer packets.

Query transformation is a strategy often used in search engines to derive queries that are able to return more useful search results than the original query and most popular search engines provide facilities that let users complete, specify, or reformulate their queries. We study the problem of semantic query suggestion, a special type of query transformation based on identifying semantic concepts contained in user queries. We use a feature-based approach in conjunction with supervised machine learning, augmenting term-based features with search history-based and concept-specific features. We apply our method to the task of linking queries from real-world query logs (the transaction logs of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision) to the DBpedia knowledge base. We evaluate the utility of different machine learning algorithms, features, and feature types in identifying semantic concepts using a manually developed test bed and show significant improvements over an already high baseline. The resources developed for this paper, i.e., queries, human assessments, and extracted features, are available for download.

One approach is to enter this information manually. A second approach is to take advantage of pre-existing databases, and to develop common ontologies, publishing standards, and reward systems to make this data widely accessible. We consider here a third approach: developing software that automatically extracts structured information from unstructured text present on the web. We also describe preliminary results demonstrating that machine learning algorithms can learn to extract tens of thousands of facts to populate a diverse ontology, with imperfect but reasonably good accuracy.

Existing matching systems trade-off precision and recall and have their specific strengths and weaknesses. This leads to problems when the right matcher for a given task has to be selected. In this paper, we present a method for improving matching results by not choosing a specific matcher but applying machine learning techniques on an ensemble of matchers. Hereby we learn rules for the correctness of a correspondence based on the output of different matchers and additional information about the nature of the elements to be matched, thus leveraging the weaknesses of an individual matcher. We show that our method always performs significantly better than the median of the matchers used and in most cases outperforms the best matcher with an optimal threshold for a given pair of ontologies. As a side product of our experiments, we discovered that the majority vote is a simple but powerful heuristic for combining matchers that almost reaches the quality of our learning results.

Typically, the mining engineer supports or reinforces the stopes when needed, by means of rockbolts, wire meshes and steel sets. At the same time, a monitoring system based on geotechnical or geodetic measurements can provide against tiny displacements of control targets. This paper presents the application of artificial intelligence techniques, namely, decision trees, to turn underground mine data into knowledge. Particularly, geodetic measurements, engineering and geologic observations that originate from the Red Rock underground mine in central Greece, are analyzed by an open source decision tree algorithm. The algorithm builds a failure criterion for the mine, which is dynamically adapted to posterior cases.

Haussler, Inform. and Comput., 100 (1992), pp. 78-150] and [M. Kearns, R. Schapire, and L. Sellie, Machine Learning, 17 (1994), pp. 115-141]. We show that under the uniform distribution, agnostically learning parities reduce to learning parities with random classification noise, commonly referred to as the noisy parity problem. Together with the parity learning algorithm of [A. Blum, A. Kalai, and H. Wasserman, J. ACM, 50 (2003), pp. 506-519], this gives the first nontrivial algorithm for agnostic learning of parities. We use similar techniques to reduce learning of two other fundamental concept classes under the uniform distribution to learning of noisy parities. Namely, we show that learning of disjunctive normal form (DNF) expressions reduces to learning noisy parities of just logarithmic number of variables, and learning of k-juntas reduces to learning noisy parities of k variables. We give essentially optimal hardness results for agnostic learning of monomials over {0, 1}(n) and halfspaces over Q(n). We show that for any constant epsilon finding a monomial (halfspace) that agrees with an unknown function on 1/2 + epsilon fraction of the examples is NP-hard even when there exists a monomial (halfspace) that agrees with the unknown function on 1 - epsilon fraction of the examples. This resolves an open question due to Blum and significantly improves on a number of previous hardness results for these problems. We extend these results to epsilon = 2(-log1-lambda n) (epsilon = 2(-root log n) in the case of halfspaces) for any constant lambda > 0 under stronger complexity assumptions.

J	Guruswami, V; Raghavendra, P				Guruswami, Venkatesan; Raghavendra, Prasad			HARDNESS OF LEARNING HALFSPACES WITH NOISE	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	OCT 21-24, 2006	Berkeley, CA	IEEE		hardness of approximation; perceptron; computational learning	MAXIMIZING AGREEMENTS; PERMUTATIONS; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	Learning an unknown halfspace (also called a perceptron) from labeled examples is one of the classic problems in machine learning. In the noise-free case, when a halfspace consistent with all the training examples exists, the problem can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming. However, under the promise that a halfspace consistent with a fraction (1 - epsilon) of the examples exists (for some small constant epsilon > 0), it was not known how to efficiently find a halfspace that is correct on even 51% of the examples. Nor was a hardness result that ruled out getting agreement on more than 99.9% of the examples known. In this work, we close this gap in our understanding and prove that even a tiny amount of worst-case noise makes the problem of learning halfspaces intractable in a strong sense. Specifically, for arbitrary epsilon, delta > 0, we prove that given a set of examples-label pairs from the hypercube, a fraction (1 - epsilon) of which can be explained by a halfspace, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that correctly labels a fraction (1/2 + delta) of the examples. The hardness result is tight since it is trivial to get agreement on 1/2 the examples. In learning theory parlance, we prove that weak proper agnostic learning of halfspaces is hard. This settles a question that was raised by Blum et al., in their work on learning halfspaces in the presence of random classification noise [Algorithmica, 22 (1998), pp. 35-52], and raised by authors of some more recent works as well. Along the way, we also obtain a strong hardness result for another basic computational problem: solving a linear system over the rationals.

If our algorithm is allotted 2l passes, it will produce an approximation with error at most c using (O) over tilde (k(3)/c(2/l)) bits of memory, the most critical resource for streaming computation. We demonstrate that this tradeoff between passes and memory allotted is intrinsic to the problem and model of computation by proving lower bounds on the memory requirements of any l pass randomized algorithm that are nearly matched by our upper bounds. In this problem, we are given a set of n points drawn randomly according to a mixture of k uniform distributions and wish to approximate the density function of the mixture. The points are placed in a data stream (possibly in adversarial order), which may only be read in sequential passes by the algorithm. The algorithm is quite general and can be adapted to solve the problems of learning a mixture of linear distributions in R and a mixture of uniform distributions in R(2).

We show how an asymptotic formula of Denisov, which approximately counts the n-variable correlation immune functions, can be improved so as to be accurate even for fairly small n. We also provide error estimates for our approximations, which Denisov did not do, and show a connection to the behavior of random walks.

MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION AND MACHINE LEARNING WITH SUMS OF SEPARABLE FUNCTIONS	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						multivariate regression; machine learning; curse of dimensionality; separation of variables	SPARSE GRIDS; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHMS; DIMENSIONS	We present an algorithm for learning (or estimating) a function of many variables from scattered data. The function is approximated by a sum of separable functions, following the paradigm of separated representations. The central fitting algorithm is linear in both the number of data points and the number of variables and, thus, is suitable for large data sets in high dimensions. We present numerical evidence for the utility of these representations. In particular, we show that our method outperforms other methods on several benchmark data sets.

The advantages of using principal components reside from the fact that bands are uncorrelated and no information contained in one band can be predicted by the knowledge of the other bands. The semi-supervised learning (SSL) problem has recently drawn large attention in the machine learning community, mainly due to its significant importance in practical applications. The aims of the research reported in this paper are to report experimentally derived conclusions on the performance of a PCA-based supervised technique in a semi-supervised environment. A series of conclusions experimentally established by tests performed on samples of signals coming from two classes are exposed in the final section of the paper.

Initial results showed that both classifiers are able to classify the four main postures with high recognition rate. Moreover, the tremendous performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier Is confirmed based on the Kappa Score calculated. Initial findings have proven that SSG is apt as feature vectors for posture recognition whilst ANN and SVM were apposite to perform the classification task.

Optimizing HIV therapies is crucial since the virus rapidly develops imitations to evade drug pressures. Modern anti-HIV regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent, or at least delay, the development of resistance imitations. In recent years, large databases have been collected to allow the automatic analysis of relations between the virus genome other clinical and demographical information, and the failure or success of a therapy. The EuResist integrated database (EID) collected from about 18500 patients and 65000 different therapies is probably one of the largest clinical genomic databases. Only one third of the therapies in the EID contain therapy response information and only 5% of the therapy records have response information as well as genotypic data. This leads to two specific challenges (a) semi-supervised learning - a, setting where many samples are available but only a small proportion of them are labeled and (b) missing data. We review a novel solution for the first setting: a novel dimensionality reduction framework that binds information theoretic considerations with geometrical constraints over the simplex. The dimensionality reduction framework is formulated to find optimal low dimensional geometric embedding of the simplex that preserves pairwise distances. This novel similarity-based clustering solution was tested oil toy data and textual data. We show that this solution, although it outperforms other methods and provides good results oil a small sample of the Euresist data, is impractical for the large EuResist dataset. In addition, we review a generative-discriminative prediction system that successfully overcomes the missing value challenge. Apart from a review of the EuResist project and related challenges, this chapter provides all overview of recent developments in the field of machine learning-based prediction methods for HIV drug resistance.

However, these components are orders of magnitude more expensive than typical desktop components, and they lag years behind in terms of speed and size. We have integrated algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) methods into onboard data analysis algorithms to detect radiation-induced errors, which ultimately may permit the use of spacecraft memory that need not be fully hardened, reducing cost and increasing capability at the same time. We have also developed a lightweight software radiation simulator, BITFLIPS, that permits evaluation of error detection strategies in a controlled fashion, including the specification of the radiation rate and selective exposure of individual data structures. Using BITFLIPS, we evaluated our error detection methods when using a support vector machine to analyze data collected by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. We observed good performance from both an existing ABFT method for matrix multiplication and a novel ABFT method for exponentiation. These techniques bring us a step closer to "rad-hard" machine learning algorithms.

The accuracy of anomaly frequency estimates can be affected by characteristics of the anomaly data and the problem reporting system maintaining that data. We have been using text mining and machine learning techniques to address one of these issues, in which the number of software-related anomalies is incorrectly reported because the problem reporting system does not tag them correctly. Results to date indicate that these techniques may substantially increase the accuracy of anomaly frequency estimates.

Although their configuration is defined by experts, learning schemes based on evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms have been employed for improving their efficiency and effectiveness. This paper comprises an extensive study of the recently proposed swarm intelligence memetic algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization with both deterministic and stochastic local search schemes, for fuzzy cognitive maps learning tasks. Also, a new technique for the adaptation of the memetic schemes, with respect to the available number of function evaluations per application of the local search, is proposed. The memetic learning schemes are applied on four real-life problems and compared with established learning methods based on the standard particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and genetic algorithms, justifying their superiority.

In this chapter, we propose a Self-Adaptive Migration Model GA (SAMGA), where parameters of population size, the number of points of crossover and mutation rate for each population are adaptively fixed. Further, the migration of individuals between populations is decided dynamically. This chapter gives a mathematical schema analysis of the method stating and showing that the algorithm exploits previously discovered knowledge for a more focused and concentrated search of heuristically high yielding regions while simultaneously performing a highly explorative search on the other regions of the search space. The effective performance of the algorithm is then shown using standard testbed functions and a set of actual classification based datamining problems. Michigan style of classifier is used to build the classifier and the system is tested with machine learning databases of Pima Indian Diabetes database, Wisconsin Breast Cancer database and few others.

S		Venugopal, KR; Srinivasa, KG; Patnaik, LM				Venugopal, KR; Srinivasa, KG; Patnaik, LM		Evolutionary Approach for XML Data Mining	SOFT COMPUTING FOR DATA MINING APPLICATIONS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL	Extensible Markup Language(XML) has emerged as a medium for interoperability over the Internet. The XML technology, with its self-describing and extensible tags, is significantly contributing to the next generation semantic web. The present search techniques used for HTML and text documents are not efficient to retrieve relevant XML documents. In chapter four, Self Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for XML Search(SAGAXSearch) is presented to learn about the tags, which are useful in indexing. The indices and relationship strength metrics are used to extract fast and accurate semantically related elements in the XML documents. Experiments are conducted on the DataBase systems and Logic Programming (DBLP) XML corpus and are evaluated for precision and recall. The proposed SAGAXSearch outperforms the existing algorithms XSEarch and XRank with respect to accuracy and query execution time. As the number of documents published in the form of XML is increasing, there is a need for selective dissemination of XML documents based on user interests. In the proposed technique, a combination of Self Adaptive Genetic Algorithms and multi class Support Vector Machine is used to learn a user model. Based on the feedback from the users, the system automatically adapts to the users preference and interests. The user model and a similarity metric are used for selective dissemination of a continuous stream of XML documents. Experimental evaluations performed over a wide range of XML documents, indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the selective dissemination task, with respect to accuracy and efficiency. On similar grounds, there is a need for categorization of XML documents into specific user interest categories. However, manually performing the categorization task is not feasible due to the sheer amount of XML documents available on the Internet. A machine learning approach to topic categorization which makes use of a multi class SVM for exploiting the semantic content of XML documents is also presented. The SVM is supplemented by a feature selection technique which is used to extract the useful features. Experimental evaluations performed over a wide range of XML documents indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the topic categorization task, with respect to accuracy and efficiency.

Software process and product metrics are good indicators of software complexity. These metrics have been used to build bug predictor models to hell) developers maintain the quality of software. In this paper we empirically evaluate the use of hunk metrics as predictor of bugs. We present a technique for bug prediction that works at smallest; units of code change called hunks. We build bug prediction models using random forests, which is an efficient machine learning classifier. Hunk metrics are used to train the classifier and each hunk metric is evaluated for its bug prediction capabilities. Our classifier can classify individual hunks as buggy or bug-free with 86 % accuracy, 83 % buggy hunk precision and 77% buggy hunk recall. We find that history based and change level hunk metrics are better predictors of bugs than code level hunk metrics.

We propose a general methodology to mine this rich source of information to automatically detect system runtime problems. We first parse console logs by combining source code analysis with information retrieval to create composite features. We then analyze these features using machine learning to detect operational problems. We show that our method enables analyses that are impossible with previous methods because of its superior ability to create sophisticated features. We also show how to distill the results of our analysis to an operator-friendly one-page decision tree showing the critical messages associated with the detected problems. We validate our approach using the Darkstar online game server and the Hadoop File System, where we detect numerous real problems with high accuracy and few false positives. In the Hadoop case, we are able to analyze 24 million lines of console logs in 3 minutes. Our methodology works on textual console logs of any size and requires no changes to the service software, no human input, and no knowledge of the software's internals.

Management tools have not kept pace, and we show that this has made identity snowball attacks into a critical danger. Identity snowball attacks leverage the users logged in to a first compromised host to launch additional attacks with those users' privileges on other hosts. To combat such attacks, we present Heat-ray, a system that combines machine learning, combinatorial optimization and attack graphs to scalably manage security configuration. Through evaluation on an organization with several hundred thousand users and machines, we show that Heat-ray allows IT administrators to reduce by 96% the number of machines that can be used to launch a large-scale identity snowball attack.			jdunagan@microsoft.com; alicez@microsoft.com; dansimon@microsoft.com					AGARWAL A, 2005, STOC; AMMANN P, 2002, ACSAC; ARORA S, 2004, STOC; BHATKAR S, 2003, USENIX SEC; BOUSQUET O, 2003, ADV LECT MACHINE LEA; Butler R, 2000, COMPUTER, V33, P60, DOI 10.1109/2.889094; CHEN S, 2005, NDSS; CHONG S, 2007, USENIX SECURITY; Chu W, 2007, NEURAL COMPUT, V19, P792, DOI 10.1162/neco.2007.19.3.792; Cortes C, 1995, MACHINE LEARNING, P20; Costa M., 2005, SOSP; COWAN C, 1998, USENIX SECURITY; DIJKSTRA E, 1959, NUMER MATH, V1, P1; Ellison C, 1999, SPKI CERTIFICATE THE; GRIER C, 2008, IEEE SECURITY PRIVAC; HAJAGHAYI MT, 2006, INFORM PROCESSING LE; HERBRICH R, 1999, INT C ARTIFICIAL NEU; Jain A., 2007, HDB BIOMETRICS; JOHANSSON J, 2005, PROTEC YOUR WINDOWS; JOSHI A, DTETECTING PAST PRES; KAMINSKY M, 2003, SOSP; King ST, 2005, ACM T COMPUT SYST, V23, P51, DOI 10.1145/1047915.1047918; KLEIN P, 1994, SIAM J COMPUTING; KRON M, 2007, SOSP; Lampson B., 1992, ACM T COMPUTER SYSTE; LUBY M, 1993, STOC; MOORE D, 2003, IEEE SECURITY PRIVAC; Munzner T., 2000, THESIS STANFORD U; NALDURG P, 2006, ACM WORKSH FORM METH; Newsome J., 2005, NDSS; NOEL S, 2004, ACM WORKSH VIS DAT M; Ou X, 2005, USENIX SECURITY; PROVOS N, 2007, HOTBOTS; RAJAB M, 2006, IMC; Rankl W., 2004, SMART CARD HDB; Rivest Ronald L., 1996, SDSI SIMPLE DISTRIBU; SCHECHTER S, 2006, NDSS; SCHULTZ E, 2002, C COMP SEC COMPSEC; SHAHROKHI F, 1990, JACM; SHEYNER O, 2002, IEEE SEC PRIVACY; SINGER A, 2005, USENIX LOGIN, V30, P27; Spall J., 2003, INTRO STOCHASTIC SEA; STEINER JG, 1988, USENIX; Swiler L.

S	Zheng, NN; Xue, JR	Zheng, N; Xue, J			Zheng, Nanning; Xue, Jianru	Zheng, N; Xue, J		Manifold Learning	STATISTICAL LEARNING AND PATTERN ANALYSIS FOR IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING	Advances in Pattern Recognition		English	Article; Book Chapter							NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; LAPLACIAN EIGENMAPS; MODELS	Manifold learning methods are one of the most exciting developments in machine learning in recent years. The central idea underlying these methods is that although natural data is typically represented in very high-dimensional spaces, the process generating the data is often thought to have relatively few degrees of freedom. A natural mathematical characterization of this intuition is to model the data as lying on or near a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. Recently, manifold learning has also been applied in utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data for classification, that is, semi-supervised learning. For example, once the manifold is estimated, then the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be used to provide a basis for maps intrinsically defined on this manifold and then the appropriate classifier (map) is estimated on the basis of the labeled examples. In this chapter, we will discuss the manifold perspective of visual pattern representation, dimensionality reduction, and classification problems, as well as a survey that includes manifold learning concepts, technical mechanisms, and algorithms.

From a given set of positive and negative samples, the problem asks to construct a classifier that predicts the classes of future samples with high accuracy. For this problem, we have studied a new visual classifier in our previous works, which is constructed as follows: We first create several decision tables and extract a bipartite graph structure (called an SE-graph) between the given set of samples and the set of created decision tables. We then draw the bipartite graph as a two-layered drawing by using an edge crossing minimization technique, and the resulting drawing acts as a visual classifier. We first describe our background and philosophy on such a visual classifier, and then consider improving its classification accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by computational studies using benchmark data sets, where the new classifier outperforms our older version, and is competitive even with such standard classifiers as C4.5 or LibSVM.

This article compares the results of five data-driven syllabification algorithms (Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines, IB1, Liang's algorithm, the Look Up Procedure, and Syllabification by Analogy) on nine European languages in order to determine which algorithm performs best over all. Findings show that all algorithms achieve a mean word accuracy across all lexicons of over 90%.

Statistical pattern recognition and damage detection in structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure systems	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING OF CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article; Book Chapter						pattern recognition; machine learning; statistical pattern recognition; neural networks; statistical learning theory; support vector machines		The main problems of structural health monitoring (SHM) can be cast or regarded as problems in pattern recognition (PR) or machine learning. This approach makes use of the availability of appropriate data to learn the relationship between measured quantities and a diagnosis of state-of-health. This chapter describes how PR provides a natural framework for addressing questions of SHM from basic detection to damage location and quantification. The basic theory and practice are illustrated via the use of two experimental case studies; the first concerns the classification of acoustic emission data as part of a damage assessment of a bridge box girder and the second considers the problem of damage location within an aircraft wing. A number of PR algorithms are illustrated, based on both statistical and neural network approaches. A modern approach to machine learning based on concepts of statistical learning theory is also illustrated using the aircraft wing data.

Optimizing Decision Trees Using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization	SWARM INTELLIGENCE FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE PROBLEMS IN DATA MINING	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION	Although conceptually quite simple, decision trees are still among the most popular classifiers applied to real-world problems. Their popularity is due to a number of factors - core among these is their ease of comprehension, robust performance and fast data processing capabilities. Additionally feature selection is implicit within the decision tree structure. This chapter introduces the basic ideas behind decision trees, focusing on decision trees which only consider a rule relating to a single feature at a node (therefore making recursive axis-parallel slices in feature space to form their classification boundaries). The use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to train near optimal decision trees is discussed, and PSO is applied both in a single objective formulation (minimizing misclassification cost), and multi-objective formulation (trading off misclassification rates across classes). Empirical results are presented on popular classification data sets from the well-known UCI machine learning repository, and PSO is demonstrated as being fully capable of acting as an optimizer for trees on these problems. Results additionally support the argument that multi-objectification of a problem can improve uni-objective search in classification problems.

One possible way of considering the design of Multiple Classifier Systems is to select the ensemble members from a large pool of classifiers focusing on predefined criteria, which is known as the Overproduce and Choose paradigm. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is proposed to design Multiple Classifier Systems under this paradigm while controlling the trade-off between accuracy and diversity of the ensemble members. The proposed algorithm is compared with several classifier selection methods from the literature on different UCI Repository datasets. This paper specifies several conditions for which it is worth using diversity during the design stage of Multiple Classifier Systems.
