Recommender systems aim at directing users through this information space, toward the resources that best meet their needs and interests. Web Content Recommendation has been an active application area for Information Filtering, Web Mining and Machine Learning research. Recent studies show that combining the conceptual and usage information can improve the quality of web recommendations. In this paper we exploit this idea to enhance a reinforcement learning framework, primarily devised for web recommendations based on web usage data. A hybrid web recommendation method is proposed by making use of the conceptual relationships among web resources to derive a novel model of the problem, enriched with semantic knowledge about the usage behavior. With our hybrid model for the web page recommendation problem we show the apt and flexibility of the reinforcement learning framework in the web recommendation domain, and demonstrate how it can be extended in order to incorporate various sources of information. We evaluate our method under different settings and show how this method can improve the overall quality of web recommendations.

J	David, CA; Jelinek, H				Cornforth, David; Jelinek, Herbert			Automated classification reveals morphological factors associated with dementia	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						automated classification; dementia; image processing; multi-fractal analysis; feature selection	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FRACTAL ANALYSIS; CORTEX; DIMENSIONS; NEURONS; IMAGES	Dementia is believed to be associated with changes in the physical structure of brain tissue, particularly in the pattern of small blood vessels. This study investigates one of the current research questions in the understanding of dementia, that is, whether there are differentiating factors in the structure of blood vessels of the cortex associated with different dementia subtypes and controls. Our approach is to use automated classification techniques to build predictive models based on fractal and non-fractal morphological descriptors, in order to label images of post mortem brain tissue with the appropriate pathology. Our goal is not to provide automated diagnosis, but to confirm or deny the presence of a relationship between morphological features and disease. The use of a variety of machine learning methods allows the exploration of the complex relationships that may exist. This study also addresses the choice of suitable features and the role of fractal analysis in medical image processing. The results suggest that there are differentiating factors, but these are difficult to detect, and vary between different areas of the cortex. Features derived from multi-fractal analysis showed more promise in this application than the non-fractal features we studied. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed FAMDDA model is a conflict-resolving classifier that can perform stable and incremental learning while settling overlapping of hyper-rectangular prototypes of different classes in minimizing misclassification rates. The performance of FAMDDA is evaluated using a number of benchmark data sets. The results are analyzed and compared with those from FAM and a number of machine learning classifiers. The outcomes show that FAMDDA has a better generalization capability than FAM, and its performance is comparable with those from other classifiers. The effectiveness of FAMDDA is also demonstrated in an application pertaining to condition monitoring of a circulating water system in a power generation station. Implications on the effectiveness of FAMDDA from the application point of view are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Feature selection using correlation fractal dimension: Issues and applications in binary classification problems	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						supervised learning; feature subset selection; fractal dimension; machine learning; neural networks	EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; STRANGE ATTRACTORS; NEURAL NETWORKS; SEQUENCES; SITES; IDENTIFICATION; PROMOTERS; REGIONS	Feature selection methods can be classified broadly into filter and wrapper approaches. Filter-based methods filter out features which are irrelevant to the target concept by ranking each feature according to some discrimination measure and then select features with high ranking value. In this paper, a filter-based feature selection method based on correlation fractal dimension (CFD) discrimination measure is proposed. One of the subgoals of this paper is to outline some issues that arise while calculating fractal dimension for higher dimensional 'empirical' data sets. It is well known that the calculation of fractal dimension for empirical data sets is meaningful only for an appropriate range of scales. We demonstrate through experimentation on data sets of various sizes that fractal dimension-based algorithms cannot be applied routinely to higher dimensional data sets as the calculation of fractal dimension is inherently sensitive to parameters like range of scales and the size of the data sets. Based on the empirical analysis, we propose a new feature selection technique using CFD that avoids the above issues. We successfully applied the proposed algorithm on a challenging classification problem in bioinformatics, namely, Promoter Recognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Alatas, B; Akin, E; Karci, A				Alatas, Bilal; Akin, Erhan; Karci, Ali			Modenar: Multi-objective differential evolution algorithm for mining numeric association rules	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; evolutionary computation; multi-objective optimization; differential evolution	GENETIC ALGORITHM	In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective differential evolution ( DE) algorithm is proposed as a search strategy for mining accurate and comprehensible numeric association rules ( ARs) which are optimal in the wider sense that no other rules are superior to them when all objectives are simultaneously considered. The proposed DE guided the search of ARs toward the global Pareto-optimal set while maintaining adequate population diversity to capture as many high-quality ARs as possible. ARs mining problem is formulated as a four-objective optimization problem. Support, confidence value and the comprehensibility of the rule are maximization objectives while the amplitude of the intervals which conforms the itemset and rule is minimization objective. It has been designed to simultaneously search for intervals of numeric attributes and the discovery of ARs which these intervals conform in only single run of DE. Contrary to the methods used as usual, ARs are directly mined without generating frequent itemsets. The proposed DE performs a database-independent approach which does not rely upon the minimum support and the minimum confidence thresholds which are hard to determine for each database. The efficiency of the proposed DE is validated upon synthetic and real databases. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adaptability of a GP based IDS on wireless networks	ARES 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AVAILABILITY, SECURITY AND RELIABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	MAR 04-07, 2008	Barcelona, SPAIN	SECURE Business Austria, DEXA, Univ Politech Catalunya, Austrian Comp Soc, European & Info Secur Agcy, IEEE Comp Soc				Security and Intrusion detection in WiFi networks is currently an active area of research where WiFi specific Data Link layer attacks are an area of focus; particularly recent work has focused on producing machine learning based IDSs for these WiFi specific attacks. These proposed machine learning based IDSs come in addition to the already deployed signatures which are already in use in conventional intrusion detection systems like Snort-Wireless and Kismet. In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.

The genetic component determines the brain of an individual, a machine learning architecture which is then used to transmit knowledge. Thanks to the interactions between the genetic and the knowledge parts the agents get to use species-specific recognition patterns, starting from an initial condition where the species are not distinguishable. Several machine learning architectures are investigated, as well as the influence of space and asynchronous genetic algorithm operations. Agents selecting each other for mating based on their limited recognition capacities is all that is needed for the emergence of species-specific recognition patterns: the transition between symbols to sequences with an intrinsic role within the species.

Classical machine learning techniques have had many significant empirical successes, but large real-world problems that are of interest to generally intelligent agents require teaming much faster (with much less training experience) than is currently possible. This paper presents transfer learning, where knowledge from a learned task can be used to significantly speed up learning in a novel task, as the key to achieving the learning capabilities necessary for general intelligence. In addition to motivating the need for transfer teaming in an intelligent agent, we introduce a novel method for selecting types of tasks to be used for transfer and empirically demonstrate that such a selection can lead to significant increases in training speed in a two-player game.

Artificial Immune Recognition System with nonlinear resource allocation method and application to Traditional Malay Music genre classification	ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems	AUG 10-13, 2008	Phuket, THAILAND			Artificial Immune System; AIRS; music genre classification; nonlinear resource allocation		Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) has shown an effective performance on several machine learning problems. In this study, the resource allocation method of AIRS was changed with a nonlinear method. This new algorithm, AIRS with nonlinear resource allocation method, was used as a classifier in Traditional Malay Music (TMM) genre classification. Music genre classification has a great important role in music information retrieval systems nowadays. The proposed system consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature selection and finally using proposed algorithm as a classifier. Based on results of conducted experiments, the obtained classification accuracy of proposed system is 88.6% using 10 fold cross validation for TMM genre classification. The results also show that AIRS with nonlinear allocation method obtains maximum classification accuracy for TMM genre classification.

In previous studies, many classifiers including AIS classifiers require the data to be in numerical or categorical data. types prior to processing. The transformation of data into any other specific types from their original form call degrade the originality of the data and consume more space and pre processing time. This paper introduces AIS model using immune network for classifying heterogeneous data in its original types. The model is able to process the data with the types as represented in the database and it solves some bias problems highlighted in the AIS review papers. To ensure the consistent conditions and fair comparison, the selected existing algorithms use the same set of data as used in the proposed model. Experimental results show that this network-based model produces a better accuracy rate than the existing population-based immune algorithm and than the standard classifiers on most of the data from University of California, Irvive (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (MLR) and University of California, Riverside (UCR) Time Series Data (TSR).

Although the balance is latterly beginning to be redressed (e.g. [18)), we propose that this dichotomy is somewhat to blame for the lack of significant advancement of the field in either direction. This paper outlines how ail inappropriate interpretation of Perelson's shape-space formalism has largely contributed to this dichotomy, as it neither scales to machine-learning requirements nor makes any operational distinction between signals and context. We illustrate these issues and attempt to derive both a more biologically plausible and statistically solid foundation for an online, unsupervised artificial immune system. BY extending a mathematical model of immunological tolerance, and grounding it in contemporary machine learning, we minimise any recourse to "reasoning by metaphor" and demonstrate one view of how both research agendas might still complement each other.

Here we provide a new implementation of tissue for AIS using systemic computation, a new model of computation and corresponding computer architecture based on a systemics world-view and supplemented by the incorporation of natural characteristics. We show using systemic computation how to create an artificial organism, a program with metabolism that eats data, expels waste, Clusters cells based on the nature of its food and emits danger signals suitable for an artificial immune system. The implementation is tested by application to a standard machine learning set and shows excellent abilities to recognise anomalies in its diet.

The goal of the paper is to propose a framework for adaptive and integrated machine classification and to investigate the effect of different adaptation and integration schemes. After having introduced several integration and adaptation schemes a framework for adaptive and integrated classification in the form of the software shell is proposed. The shell allows for integrating data pre-processing with data mining stages using population-based and A-Team techniques. The approach was validated experimentally. Experiment results have shown that integrated and adaptive classification outperforms traditional approaches.

In this paper, we consider a new Bayesian confirmation measure for "if..., then..." rules proposed in [4]. We analyze this measure, called Z, with respect to valuable property M of monotonic dependency on the number of objects in the dataset satisfying or not the premise or the conclusion of the rule. The obtained results unveil interesting relationship between Z measure and two other simple and commonly used measures of rule support and anti-support, which leads to efficiency gains while searching for the best rules.

Many strategies to build adaptive systems are based on the "divide-and-conquer" principle. Constructive neural network architectures with novel training methods allow to overcome some drawbacks of standard backpropagation MLP networks. They are able to handle complex multidimensional problems in reasonable time, creating models with small number of neurons. In this paper a comparison of our new constructive c3sep algorithm based on k-separability idea with several sequential constructive learning methods is reported. Tests have been performed on parity function, 3 artificial Monks problems, and a few benchmark problems. Simple and accurate solutions have been discovered using c3sep algorithm even in highly non-separable cases.

In the basic variant of the k-NN algorithm the predicted class of q is estimated by taking the majority class of the q's k-nearest neighbors. Various similarity functions may be applied leading to different classification results. In this paper a heterogeneous similarity function is constructed out of different 1-component metrics by minimization of the number of classification errors the system makes on a training set. The HSFL-NN system, which has been introduced in this paper, on five tested datasets has given better results on unseen samples than the plain k-NN method with the optimally selected k parameter and the optimal homogeneous similarity function.

Application of irregular and unbalanced data to predict diabetic nephropathy using visualization and feature selection methods	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						decision support systems; diabetic nephropathy; support vector machines; visualization; risk factor analysis; feature selection	TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION; ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; FOLLOW-UP; MELLITUS; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; MICROALBUMINURIA; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLICATIONS	Objective: Diabetic nephropathy is damage to the kidney caused by diabetes mellitus. It is a common complication and a leading cause of death in people with diabetes. However, the decline in kidney function varies considerably between patients and the determinants of diabetic nephropathy have not been clearly identified. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy accurately with simple statistical approaches such as t-test or chi(2)-test. To accurately predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy, we applied various machine Learning techniques to irregular and unbalanced diabetes dataset, such as support vector machine (SVM) classification and feature selection methods. Visualization of the risk factors was another important objective to give physicians intuitive information on each patient's clinical pattern. Methods and materials: We collected medical data from 292 patients with diabetes and performed preprocessing to extract 184 features from the irregular data. To predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy, we compared several classification methods such as logistic regression, SVM, and SVM with a cost sensitive learning method. We also applied several feature selection methods to remove redundant features and improve the classification performance. For risk factor analysis with SVM classifiers, we have developed a new visualization system which uses a nomogram approach. Results: Linear SVM classifiers combined with wrapper or embedded feature selection methods showed the best results. Among the 184 features, the classifiers selected the same 39 features and gave 0.969 of the area under the curve by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The visualization tool was able to present the effect of each feature on the decision via graphical output. Conclusions: Our proposed method can predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy about 2-3 months before the actual diagnosis with high prediction performance from an irregular and unbalanced dataset, which statistical methods such as t-test and logistic regression could not achieve. Additionally, the visualization system provides physicians with intuitive information for risk factor analysis.

J	Lee, ZJ				Lee, Zne-Jung			An integrated algorithm for gene selection and classification applied to microarray data of ovarian cancer	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						ovarian cancer; microarray data; gene selection; support vector machine; genetic algorithm; particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CDNA MICROARRAY; DNA MICROARRAY; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; CARCINOMAS; PROFILES; ARRAYS	Objective: The type of data in microarray provides unprecedented amount of data. A typical microarray data of ovarian cancer consists of the expressions of tens of thousands of genes on a genomic scale, and there is no systematic procedure to analyze this information instantaneously. To avoid higher computational complexity, it needs to select the most Likely differentially expressed gene markers to explain the effects of ovarian cancer. Traditionally, gene markers are selected by ranking genes according to statistics or machine learning algorithms. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is derived for gene selection and classification in microarray data of ovarian cancer. Methods: First, regression analysis is applied to find target genes. Genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), support vector machine (SVM), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are hybridized to select gene markers from target genes. Finally, the improved fuzzy model is applied to classify cancer tissues. Results: The microarray data of ovarian cancer, obtained from China Medical University Hospital, is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. In simulation, 200 target genes are obtained after regression analysis and six gene markers are selected from the hybrid process of GA, PCO, SVM and ANOVA. Additionally, these gene markers are used to classify cancer tissues. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm can be used to analyze gene expressions and has superior performance in microarray data of ovarian cancer, and it can be performed on other studies for cancer diagnosis.

Enhancing RBF-DDA algorithm's robustness: Neural networks applied to prediction of fault-prone software modules	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE II	INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING		English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Computer Congress	SEP 07-10, 2008	Milano, ITALY	IFIP TC 13				Many researchers and organizations are interested in creating a mechanism capable Of automatically predicting software defects. In the last years, machine learning techniques have been used in several researches with this goal. Many recent researches use data originated from NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) Facility Metrics Data Program (MDP). NW have recently applied a constructive neural network (RBF-DDA) for this task, yet MLP neural networks were not investigated using these data. We have observed that these data sets contain inconsistent patterns, that is, patterns with the same input vector belonging to different classes. This paper has two main objectives, (i) to propose a modified version of RBF-DDA, named RBF-eDDA (RBF trained with enhanced Dynamic Decay Adjustment algorithm), which tackles inconsistent patterns, and (ii) to compare RBF-eDDA and MLP neural networks in software defects prediction. The simulations reported in this paper show that RBF-eDDA is able to correctly handle inconsistent patterns and that it obtains results comparable to those of MLP in the NASA data sets.

Answer extraction for definition questions using information gain and machine learning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE II	INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING		English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Computer Congress	SEP 07-10, 2008	Milano, ITALY	IFIP TC 13				Extracting nuggets (pieces of an answer) is a very important process in question answering systems, especially in the case of definition questions. Although there are advances in nugget extraction, the problem is finding some general and flexible patterns that allow producing as many useful definition nuggets as possible. Nowadays, patterns are obtained in manual or automatic way and then these patterns are matched against sentences. In contrast to the traditional form of working with patterns, we propose a method using information gain and machine learning instead of matching patterns. We classify the sentences as likely to contain nuggets or not. Also, we analyzed separately in a sentence the nuggets that are left and right of the target term (the term to define). We performed different experiments with the collections of questions from the TREC 2002, 2003 and 2004 and the F-measures obtained are comparable with the participating systems.

The rule set is extracted using subgroup discovery (SD). The SD objective is to discover characteristics of subgroups with respect to a specific property of interest. Our interest is to obtain the origin of sag events, upstream or downstream from the measurement point. Voltage sag features registered in electric substations are used as input data to SD algorithm. The SD algorithm used is CN2-SD to learn descriptive rules. Results show the rules extracted can be easily interpreted by a domain expert, allowing the formulation of heuristic classification rules with high accuracy.

Recent research on XCS has mainly focused on achieving a better understanding of the reinforcement component, yielding several improvements to the architecture. Nonetheless, studies on the rule discovery component of the system are scarce. In this paper, we experimentally study the discovery component of XCS, which is guided by a steady-state genetic algorithm. We design a new procedure based on evolution strategies and adapt it to the system. Then, we compare in detail XCS with both genetic algorithms and evolution strategies on a large collection of real-life problems, analyzing in detail the interaction of the different genetic operators and their contribution in the search for better rules. The overall analysis shows the competitiveness of the new XCS based on evolution strategies and increases our understanding of the behavior of the different genetic operators in XCS.

The geometric solutions automatically yielded for such a description are evaluated by the user and may be subsequently used for the construction of a computational model of his/her preferences. Due to the physical limitations of the human evaluator, and the large number of the representations produced, only a subset of the latter are actually evaluated by the user and eventually a small number of them are approved, leading to imbalanced datasets in regard to the learning mechanism invoked. In the current work we discuss and assess the capability of a mechanism adopted for user modelling in a declarative design environment to handle this imbalance. The experimental results in this context indicate considerable efficiency in the prediction for the under-represented class.

A structural description of a context-free grammar is a derivation tree of the grammar in which labels are removed. The tree automata based learning in this paradigm is early introduced by Sakakibara in 1992, however his scheme assumes that all training examples are available to the learning algorithm at the beginning (i.e., it cannot be employed as an online learning) and also it doesn't optimize the storage requirements as well. Our model has several desirable features that runs in O(n(3)) time in the sum of the sizes of the input examples, obtains O(n) storage space saving, achieves good incremental behavior by updating a guess incrementally and infers a grammar from positive-only examples efficiently. Several examples and experimental results are given to illustrate the scheme and its efficient execution.

An Empirical Study of Lazy Multilabel Classification Algorithms	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THEORIES, MODELS AND APPLICATIONS, SETN 2008	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence	OCT 02-04, 2008	Syros, GREECE					Multilabel classification is a rapidly developing field of machine learning. Despite its short life, various methods for solving the task of multilabel classification have been proposed. In this paper we focus on a subset of these methods that adopt a lazy learning approach and are based on the traditional k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm. Two are our main contributions. Firstly, we implement BRkNN, an adaptation of the kNN algorithm for multilabel classification that is conceptually equivalent to using the popular Binary Relevance problem transformation method in conjunction with the kNN algorithm, but much faster. We also identify two useful extensions of BRkNN that improve its overall predictive performance. Secondly, we compare this method against two other lazy multilabel classification methods, in order to determine the overall best performer. Experiments on different real-world multilabel datasets, using a variety of evaluation metrics, expose the advantages and limitations of each method with respect to specific dataset characteristics.

The same principle has been already used in SVM and other kernel based methods as the associated optimization problems try to maximize the minimum of these margins. In this paper, we propose a kernel based method for the direct optimization of the margin distribution (KM-OMD). The method is motivated and analyzed from a game theoretical perspective. A quite efficient optimization algorithm is then proposed. Experimental results over a standard benchmark of 13 datasets have clearly shown state-of-the-art performances.	[Aiolli, F.; Martino, G.

This work is related to the Meta-Regression approach, which has been successfully applied to predict learning performance, supporting algorithm selection. Experiments were performed in a case study in which SVMs with different kernel functions were used to predict the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks. The SVMs obtained better results in the evaluated task, when compared to different algorithms that have been applied as meta-regressors in previous work.	[Guerra, Silvio B.; Prudencio, Ricardo B.

Additionally, machine learning techniques are widely used for multimedia analysis with great succes. This work presents a combined approach to semantic adaptation of neural network classifiers in multimedia frame-work. It is based on a fuzzy reasoning engine which is able to evaluate the outputs and the confidence levels of the neural network classifier, using a knowledge base. Improved image segmentation results are obtained, which are used for adaptation of the network classifier, further increasing its ability to provide accurate classification of the specific content.

We examined the performance of Vg-RAM WNN on face recognition using a well known face database-the AR Face Database. We evaluated two Vg-RAM WNN architectures configured with different numbers of neurons and synapses per neuron. Our experimental results show that, even when training with a single picture per person, Vg-RAM WNN are robust to various facial expressions, occlusions and illumination conditions, showing better performance than many well known face recognition techniques.

For these functions. One can use similar polynomial approximations as used in the correlation integral. The essential difference is that the value of the exponent, which would Correspond to the correlation dimension, differs in accordance to the position of the point in question. Moreover, we show that the multiplicative constant represents the probability density estimation at that point. This finding is used for the construction of a classifier. Tests with some data sets from the Machine Learning Repository show that this classifier can he very effective.

However defining its architecture is a difficult task, and might. make their usage very complicated. To solve this problem, a rule-based model, KBANN, was previously introduced making use of an apriori knowledge to build the network architecture. Neithertheless this apriori knowledge is not always available when dealing with real world applications. Other methods presented in the literature propose to find directly the neural network architecture by incrementally adding new hidden neurons (or layers) to the existing network, network which initially has no hidden layer. Recently, a novel neural network approach CLANN based on concept lattices was proposed with the advantage to be suitable for finding the architecture of the neural network when the apriori knowledge is not available. However CLANN is limited to application with only two-class data, which is not often the case in practice. In this paper we propose a novel approach M-CLANN in order to treat multi-class data. Carried out experiments' showed the soundness and efficiency of our approach on different UCI datasets compared to standard machine learning systems. It also comes out, that M-CLANN model considerably improved CLANN model when dealing with two-class data.

It is a supervised method based on matching observed data (e.g. a spectrum) to a grid of pre-labelled templates. However, unlike standard machine learning methods such as ANNs, SVMs or k-nn, this algorithm explicitly uses domain information to better weight each data, dimension in the estimation. Specifically, it uses the sensitivity of each measured variable to each AP to perform a local, iterative interpolation of the grid. It avoids both the non-uniqueness problem of global regression as well as the grid resolution limitation of nearest neighbours.

Through a combination of machine learning in the form of decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and genetic algorithms, the use of supercomputing resources at NCSA, and the cyberenvironment Data-to-Knowledge, we are able to provide improved classifications for over 100 million objects in the SDSS, improved photometric redshifts, and a full exploitation of the powerful k-nearest neighbor algorithm. This work is the first to apply the full power of these algorithms to contemporary terascale astronomical datasets, and the improvement over existing results is demonstrable. We discuss issues that we have encountered in dealing with data on the terascale, and possible solutions that can be implemented to deal with upcoming petascale datasets.

The early detection of potential failures and malfunctions, the identification and localization of present or impending component failures and, in particular, the monitoring of the underlying physical process are of crucial importance for the efficient operation of complex process industry assets. With respect to these suppositions a software agent based diagnosis and monitoring concept has been developed, which allows an integrated and continuous diagnosis of the communication network and the underlying physical process behavior. The present paper outlines the architecture of the developed distributed diagnostic concept based on software agents and presents the functionality for the diagnosis of the unknown process behaviour of the underlying automation system based on machine learning methods.

One application of interest is how computational intelligence can bring value to our war fighters. Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and sensor fusion efforts have fallen far short of the desired capabilities. In this article we review the capabilities requested by war fighters. When compared to our current capabilities, it is easy to conclude current Combat Identification (CID) as a Family of Systems (FoS) does a lousy job. The war fighter needed capable, operationalized ATR and sensor fusion systems ten years ago but it did not happen. The article reviews the war fighter needs and the current state of the art. The article then concludes by looking forward to where we are headed to provide the capabilities required.

In this context, large collections of image datasets are essential for training algorithms as well as for their evaluation. Indeed, the recent proliferation of recognition algorithms, generally applied to slightly different problems, make their comparisons through clean evaluation campaigns necessary. The ROBIN project tries to fulfil these two needs by putting unclassified datasets, ground truths, competitions and metrics for the evaluation of ATR algorithms at the disposition of the scientific community. The scope of this project includes single and multi-class generic target detection and generic target recognition, in military and security contexts. From our knowledge, it is the first time that a database of this importance (several hundred thousands of visible and infrared hand annotated images) has been publicly released. Funded by the French Ministry of Defence (DGA) and by the French Ministry of Research, ROBIN is one of the ten Techno-vision projects. Techno-vision is a large and ambitious government initiative for building evaluation means for cornputer vision technologies, for various application contexts. ROBIN's consortium includes major companies and research centres involved in Computer Vision R&D in the field of defence: Bertin Technologies, CNES, ECA, DGA, EADS, INRIA, ONERA, MBDA, SAGEM, THALES. This paper, which first gives an overview of the whole project, is focused on one of ROBIN's key competitions, the SAGEM Defence Security database. This dataset contains more than eight hundred ground and aerial infrared images of six different vehicles in cluttered scenes including distracters. Two different sets of data are available for each target. The first set includes different views of each vehicle at close range in a "simple" background, and can be used to train algorithms. The second set contains many views of the same vehicle in different contexts and situations simulating operational scenarios.

Anton; Heringa, Jaap; IJzerman, Adriaan P.; Marchiori, Elena			Multi-RELIEF: a method to recognize specificity determining residues from multiple sequence alignments using a Machine-Learning approach for feature weighting	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; PREDICTION; FAMILY; ENTROPY; SITES	Motivation: Identification of residues that account for protein function specificity is crucial, not only for understanding the nature of functional specificity, but also for protein engineering experiments aimed at switching the specificity of an enzyme, regulator or transporter. Available algorithms generally use multiple sequence alignments to identify residue positions conserved within subfamilies but divergent in between. However, many biological examples show a much subtler picture than simple intra-group conservation versus inter-group divergence. Results: We present multi-RELIEF, a novel approach for identifying specificity residues that is based on RELIEF, a state-of-the-art Machine-Learning technique for feature weighting. It estimates the expected local functional specificity of residues from an alignment divided in multiple classes. Optionally, 3D structure information is exploited by increasing the weight of residues that have high-weight neighbors. Using ROC curves over a large body of experimental reference data, we show that (a) multi-RELIEF identifies specificity residues for the seven test sets used, (b) incorporating structural information improves prediction for specificity of interaction with small molecules and (c) comparison of multi-RELIEF with four other state-of-the-art algorithms indicates its robustness and best overall performance.

Evolutionary algorithm for feature subset selection in predicting tumor outcomes using microarray data	BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS	LECTURE NOTES IN BIOINFORMATICS		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications	MAY 06-09, 2008	Atlanta, GA		Georgia State Univ		GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; BREAST-CANCER; REDUCTION; SIGNATURE	Feature subset selection for outcome prediction is a critical issue in large scale microarray experiments in cancer research. This paper introduces an integrative approach that combines significant gene expression analysis, the genetic algorithm and machine learning for selecting informative gene markers and for predicting tumor outcomes including survival outcomes. In case of survival data, full use of individual's survival information (both censored and uncensored) is made in selecting informative genes for survival outcome prediction. Applications of our method to published microarray data on epithelial ovarian cancer survival and breast cancer metastasis have identified prognostic genes that predict individual survival and metastatic outcomes with improved power while basing on considerably shorter gene lists.

Identifying subcellular locations from images of unknown resolution	BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PROCEEDINGS	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Bioinformatics Research and Development	JUL 07-09, 2008	Vienna, AUSTRIA				FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE IMAGES; PATTERNS	Our group has previously used machine learning techniques to develop computational systems to automatically analyse fluorescence microscope images and classify the location of the depicted protein. Based on this work, we developed a system, the Subcellular Location Image Finder (SLIF), which mines images from scientific journals for analysis. For some of the images in journals, the system is able to automatically compute the pixel resolution (the physical space represented by each pixel), by identifying a scale bar and processing the caption text. However, scale bars are not always included. For those images, the pixel resolution is unknown. Blindly feeding these images into the classification pipeline results in unacceptably low accuracy. We first describe methods that minimise the impact of this problem by training resolution-insensitive classifiers. We show that these techniques are of limited use as classifiers can only be made insensitive to resolutions which are similar to each other. We then approach the problem in a different way by trying to estimate the resolution automatically and processing the image based on this prediction. Testing on digitally down-sampled images shows that the combination of these two approaches gives classification results which are essentially as good as if the resolution had been known.

Ten healthy subjects were studied using cycle-ergometry exercise tests with constant workloads ranging from 25 Watt to 125 Watt. Breath by breath gas exchange, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and blood pressure were measured at each stage. The modeling results proved that the nonlinear modeling method (Support Vector Regression) outperforms traditional regression method (reducing Estimation Error between 59% and 80%, reducing Testing Error between 53% and 72%) and is the ideal approach in the modeling of physiological data, especially with small training data set.

Human-Like Rule Optimization for Continuous Domains	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies	JAN 28-31, 2008	Funchal, PORTUGAL			Data Mining; Rule Optimization; Feature Selection		When using machine learning techniques for data mining purposes one of the main requirements is that the learned rule set is represented in a comprehensible form. Simpler rules are preferred as they are expected to perform better on unseen data. At the same time the rules should be specific enough so that the misclassification rate is kept to a minimum. In this paper we present a rule optimizing technique motivated by the psychological studies of human concept learning. The technique allows for reasoning to happen at both higher levels of abstraction and lower level of detail in order to optimize the rule set. Information stored at the higher level allows for optimizing processes such as rule splitting, merging and deleting, while the information stored at the lower level allows for determining the attribute relevance for a particular rule. The attributes detected as irrelevant can be removed and the ones previously detected as irrelevant can be reintroduced if necessary. The method is evaluated on the rules extracted from publicly available real world datasets using different classifiers, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented rule optimizing technique.

Data from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, Arizona's Medicaid program provide a unique opportunity to exploit state-of-the-art machine learning and data mining algorithms to analyze data and provide actionable findings that can aid cost containment. Our work addresses specific challenges in this real-life healthcare application with respect to data imbalance in the process of building predictive risk models for forecasting high-cost patients. We survey the literature and propose novel data mining approaches customized for this compelling application with specific focus on non-random sampling. Our empirical study indicates that the proposed approach is highly effective and can benefit further research on cost containment in the healthcare industry.

The study specifically reports results based on two different modalities, the handwritten signature and fingerprint recognition. We demonstrate quantitatively how performance is related to classifier type, and also provide a finer-grained analysis to relate performance to specific non-biometric factors in population demographics. The paper discusses the implications for individual modalities, for multiclassifier but single modality systems, and for full multibiometric solutions.

Ten healthy subjects were studied using cycle-ergometry exercise tests with constant workloads ranging from 25 Watt to 125 Watt. Breath by breath gas exchange, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and blood pressure were measured at each stage. The modeling results proved that the nonlinear modeling method (Support Vector Regression) outperforms traditional regression method (reducing Estimation Error between 59% and 80%, reducing Testing Error between 53% and 72%) and is the ideal approach in the modeling of physiological data, especially with small training data set.

GP as an evolutionary mechanism that provides a training structure to generate features. The presented approach is experimentally compared with some kernel feature extraction methods: Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Kernel Generalised Discriminant Analysis (KGDA). Results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to transform information from high dimensional feature space into one dimensional space for breast cancer diagnosis.

We propose a graph kernel based approach for this task. In contrast to earlier approaches to PPI extraction, the introduced all-paths graph kernel has the capability to make use of full, general dependency graphs representing the sentence structure. Results: We evaluate the proposed method on five publicly available PPI corpora, providing the most comprehensive evaluation done for a machine learning based PPI-extraction system. We additionally perform a detailed evaluation of the effects of training and testing on different resources, providing insight into the challenges involved in applying a system beyond the data it was trained on. Our method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance with respect to comparable evaluations, with 56.4 F-score and 84.8 AUC on the AImed corpus. Conclusion: We show that the graph kernel approach performs on state-of-the-art level in PPI extraction, and note the possible extension to the task of extracting complex interactions. Cross-corpus results provide further insight into how the learning generalizes beyond individual corpora. Further, we identify several pitfalls that can make evaluations of PPI-extraction systems incomparable, or even invalid. These include incorrect cross-validation strategies and problems related to comparing F-score results achieved on different evaluation resources. Recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls are provided.

J	Churbanov, A; Winters-Hilt, S				Churbanov, Alexander; Winters-Hilt, Stephen			Clustering ionic flow blockade toggles with a Mixture of HMMs	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society	FEB 23-24, 2008	Oklahoma City, OK	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc			HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ALPHA-HEMOLYSIN; RNA MOLECULES; LINEAR MEMORY; DNA; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION; NANOPORE	Background: Ionic current blockade signal processing, for use in nanopore detection, offers a promising new way to analyze single molecule properties with potential implications for DNA sequencing. The alpha-Hemolysin transmembrane channel interacts with a translocating molecule in a nontrivial way, frequently evidenced by a complex ionic flow blockade pattern with readily distinguishable modes of toggling. Effective processing of such signals requires developing machine learning methods capable of learning the various blockade modes for classification and knowledge discovery purposes. Here we propose a method aimed to improve our stochastic analysis capabilities to better understand the discriminatory capabilities of the observed the nanopore channel interactions with analyte. Results: We tailored our memory-sparse distributed implementation of a Mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMMs) to the problem of channel current blockade clustering and associated analyte classification. By using probabilistic fully connected HMM profiles as mixture components we were able to cluster the various 9 base-pair hairpin channel blockades. We obtained very high Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) classification with a mixture of 12 different channel blockade profiles, each with 4 levels, a configuration that can be computed with sufficient speed for real-time experimental feedback. MAP classification performance depends on several factors such as the number of mixture components, the number of levels in each profile, and the duration of a channel blockade event. We distribute Baum-Welch Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms running on our model in two ways. A distributed implementation of the MHMM data processing accelerates data clustering efforts. The second, simultanteous, strategy uses an EM checkpointing algorithm to lower the memory use and efficiently distribute the bulk of EM processing in processing large data sequences (such as for the progressive sums used in the HMM parameter estimates). Conclusion: The proposed distributed MHMM method has many appealing properties, such as precise classification of analyte in real-time scenarios, and the ability to incorporate new domain knowledge into a flexible, easily distributable, architecture. The distributed HMM provides a feature extraction that is equivalent to that of the sequential HMM with a speedup factor approximately equal to the number of independent CPUs operating on the data.

J	Farkas, R; Szarvas, G				Farkas, Richard; Szarvas, Gyoergy			Automatic construction of rule-based ICD-9-CM coding systems	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine	DEC 06-07, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE					Background: In this paper we focus on the problem of automatically constructing ICD-9-CM coding systems for radiology reports. ICD-9-CM codes are used for billing purposes by health institutes and are assigned to clinical records manually following clinical treatment. Since this labeling task requires expert knowledge in the field of medicine, the process itself is costly and is prone to errors as human annotators have to consider thousands of possible codes when assigning the right ICD-9-CM labels to a document. In this study we use the datasets made available for training and testing automated ICD-9-CM coding systems by the organisers of an International Challenge on Classifying Clinical Free Text Using Natural Language Processing in spring 2007. The challenge itself was dominated by entirely or partly rule-based systems that solve the coding task using a set of hand crafted expert rules. Since the feasibility of the construction of such systems for thousands of ICD codes is indeed questionable, we decided to examine the problem of automatically constructing similar rule sets that turned out to achieve a remarkable accuracy in the shared task challenge. Results: Our results are very promising in the sense that we managed to achieve comparable results with purely hand-crafted ICD-9-CM classifiers. Our best model got a 90.26% F measure on the training dataset and an 88.93% F measure on the challenge test dataset, using the micro-averaged F(beta=1) measure, the official evaluation metric of the International Challenge on Classifying Clinical Free Text Using Natural Language Processing. This result would have placed second in the challenge, with a hand-crafted system achieving slightly better results. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that hand-crafted systems - which proved to be successful in ICD-9-CM coding - can be reproduced by replacing several laborious steps in their construction with machine learning models. These hybrid systems preserve the favourable aspects of rule-based classifiers like good performance, and their development can be achieved rapidly and requires less human effort. Hence the construction of such hybrid systems can be feasible for a set of labels one magnitude bigger, and with more labeled data.

J	Kilicoglu, H; Bergler, S				Kilicoglu, Halil; Bergler, Sabine			Recognizing speculative language in biomedical research articles: a linguistically motivated perspective	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine (BioNLP), ACL Workshop	JUN 19, 2008	Columbus, OH	ACL				Background: Due to the nature of scientific methodology, research articles are rich in speculative and tentative statements, also known as hedges. We explore a linguistically motivated approach to the problem of recognizing such language in biomedical research articles. Our approach draws on prior linguistic work as well as existing lexical resources to create a dictionary of hedging cues and extends it by introducing syntactic patterns. Furthermore, recognizing that hedging cues differ in speculative strength, we assign them weights in two ways: automatically using the information gain (IG) measure and semi-automatically based on their types and centrality to hedging. Weights of hedging cues are used to determine the speculative strength of sentences. Results: We test our system on two publicly available hedging datasets. On the fruit-fly dataset, we achieve a precision-recall breakeven point (BEP) of 0.85 using the semi-automatic weighting scheme and a lower BEP of 0.80 with the information gain weighting scheme. These results are competitive with the previously reported best results (BEP of 0.85). On the BMC dataset, using semi-automatic weighting yields a BEP of 0.82, a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over the previously reported best result (BEP of 0.76), while information gain weighting yields a BEP of 0.70. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that speculative language can be recognized successfully with a linguistically motivated approach and confirms that selection of hedging devices affects the speculative strength of the sentence, which can be captured reasonably by weighting the hedging cues. The improvement obtained on the BMC dataset with a semi-automatic weighting scheme indicates that our linguistically oriented approach is more portable than the machine-learning based approaches. Lower performance obtained with the information gain weighting scheme suggests that this method may benefit from a larger, manually annotated corpus for automatically inducing the weights.

J	Roberts, A; Gaizauskas, R; Hepple, M; Guo, YK				Roberts, Angus; Gaizauskas, Robert; Hepple, Mark; Guo, Yikun			Mining clinical relationships from patient narratives	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine (BioNLP), ACL Workshop	JUN 19, 2008	Columbus, OH	ACL			INFORMATION EXTRACTION; LANGUAGE SYSTEM; TREES; TEXT	Background: The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) project has built a system to extract clinically significant information from the textual component of medical records in order to support clinical research, evidence-based healthcare and genotype-meets-phenotype informatics. One part of this system is the identification of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning (ML) approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to the extraction of clinical relationships. Results: We have designed and implemented an ML-based system for relation extraction, using support vector machines, and trained and tested it on a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Over a class of seven relation types, the system achieves an average F1 score of 72%, only slightly behind an indicative measure of human inter annotator agreement on the same task. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task, how extraction performance varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships. Conclusion: We have shown that it is possible to extract important clinical relationships from text, using supervised statistical ML techniques, at levels of accuracy approaching those of human annotators. Given the importance of relation extraction as an enabling technology for text mining and given also the ready adaptability of systems based on our supervised learning approach to other clinical relationship extraction tasks, this result has significance for clinical text mining more generally, though further work to confirm our encouraging results should be carried out on a larger sample of narratives and relationship types.

In SRL, sentences are represented by one or more predicate-argument structures (PAS). Each PAS is composed of a predicate (verb) and several arguments (noun phrases, adverbial phrases, etc.) with different semantic roles, including main arguments (agent or patient) as well as adjunct arguments (time, manner, or location). PropBank is the most widely used PAS corpus and annotation format in the newswire domain. In the biomedical field, however, more detailed and restrictive PAS annotation formats such as PASBio are popular. Unfortunately, due to the lack of an annotated PASBio corpus, no publicly available machine-learning (ML) based SRL systems based on PASBio have been developed. In previous work, we constructed a biomedical corpus based on the PropBank standard called BioProp, on which we developed an ML-based SRL system, BIOSMILE. In this paper, we aim to build a system to convert BIOSMILE's BioProp annotation output to PASBio annotation. Our system consists of BIOSMILE in combination with a BioProp-PASBio rule-based converter, and an additional semi-automatic rule generator. Results: Our first experiment evaluated our rule-based converter's performance independently from BIOSMILE performance. The converter achieved an F-score of 85.29%. The second experiment evaluated combined system (BIOSMILE + rule-based converter). The system achieved an F-score of 69.08% for PASBio's 29 verbs. Conclusion: Our approach allows PAS conversion between BioProp and PASBio annotation using BIOSMILE alongside our newly developed semi-automatic rule generator and rule-based converter. Our system can match the performance of other state-of-the-art domain-specific ML-based SRL systems and can be easily customized for PASBio application development.

The curation of such databases can be made faster by ranking newly-published articles' relevance to PPI, a task which we approach here by designing a machine-learning-based PPI classifier. All classifiers require labeled data, and the more labeled data available, the more reliable they become. Although many PPI databases with large numbers of labeled articles are available, incorporating these databases into the base training data may actually reduce classification performance since the supplementary databases may not annotate exactly the same PPI types as the base training data. Our first goal in this paper is to find a method of selecting likely positive data from such supplementary databases. Only extracting likely positive data, however, will bias the classification model unless sufficient negative data is also added. Unfortunately, negative data is very hard to obtain because there are no resources that compile such information. Therefore, our second aim is to select such negative data from unlabeled PubMed data. Thirdly, we explore how to exploit these likely positive and negative data. And lastly, we look at the somewhat unrelated question of which term-weighting scheme is most effective for identifying PPI-related articles. Results: To evaluate the performance of our PPI text classifier, we conducted experiments based on the BioCreAtIvE-II IAS dataset. Our results show that adding likely-labeled data generally increases AUC by 3 similar to 6%, indicating better ranking ability. Our experiments also show that our newly-proposed term-weighting scheme has the highest AUC among all common weighting schemes. Our final model achieves an F-measure and AUC 2.9% and 5.0% higher than those of the top-ranking system in the IAS challenge. Conclusion: Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating unlabeled and likely labeled data to augment a PPI text classification system. Our mixed model is suitable for ranking purposes whereas our hierarchical model is better for filtering. In addition, our results indicate that supervised weighting schemes outperform unsupervised ones. Our newly-proposed weighting scheme, TFBRF, which considers documents that do not contain the target word, avoids some of the biases found in traditional weighting schemes. Our experiment results show TFBRF to be the most effective among several other top weighting schemes.

Soft string matching is a possible solution to the problem, but its inherent heavy computational cost discourages its use when the dictionaries are large or when real time processing is required. A less computationally demanding approach is to normalize the terms by using heuristic rules, which enables us to look up a dictionary in a constant time regardless of its size. The development of good heuristic rules, however, requires extensive knowledge of the terminology in question and thus is the bottleneck of the normalization approach. Results: We present a novel framework for discovering a list of normalization rules from a dictionary in a fully automated manner. The rules are discovered in such a way that they minimize the ambiguity and variability of the terms in the dictionary. We evaluated our algorithm using two large dictionaries: a human gene/protein name dictionary built from BioThesaurus and a disease name dictionary built from UMLS. Conclusions: The experimental results showed that automatically discovered rules can perform comparably to carefully crafted heuristic rules in term mapping tasks, and the computational overhead of rule application is small enough that a very fast implementation is possible. This work will help improve the performance of term-concept mapping tasks in biomedical information extraction especially when good normalization heuristics for the target terminology are not fully known.

However, the lack of training data (i.e. annotated corpora) makes it difficult for machine learning-based named entity recognizers to be used in building practical information extraction systems. Results: This paper presents an active learning-like framework for reducing the human effort required to create named entity annotations in a corpus. In this framework, the annotation work is performed as an iterative and interactive process between the human annotator and a probabilistic named entity tagger. Unlike active learning, our framework aims to annotate all occurrences of the target named entities in the given corpus, so that the resulting annotations are free from the sampling bias which is inevitable in active learning approaches. Conclusion: We evaluate our framework by simulating the annotation process using two named entity corpora and show that our approach can reduce the number of sentences which need to be examined by the human annotator. The cost reduction achieved by the framework could be drastic when the target named entities are sparse.

J	Wang, XL; Matthews, M				Wang, Xinglong; Matthews, Michael			Distinguishing the species of biomedical named entities for term identification	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine (BioNLP), ACL Workshop	JUN 19, 2008	Columbus, OH	ACL				Background: Term identification is the task of grounding ambiguous mentions of biomedical named entities in text to unique database identifiers. Previous work on term identification has focused on studying species-specific documents. However, full-length articles often describe entities across a number of species, in which case resolving the ambiguity of model organisms in entities is critical to achieving accurate term identification. Results: We developed and compared a number of rule-based and machine-learning based approaches to resolving species ambiguity in mentions of biomedical named entities, and demonstrated that a hybrid method achieved the best overall accuracy at 71.7%, as tested on the gold-standard ITI-TXM corpora. By utilising the species information predicted by the hybrid tagger, our rule-based term identification system was improved significantly by up to 11.6%. Conclusion: This paper shows that, in the context of identifying terms involving multiple model organisms, integration of an accurate species disambiguation system can significantly improve the performance of term identification systems.

Identification of transcription factor contexts in literature using machine learning approaches	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine	DEC 06-07, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE				PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; DISCOVERING PATTERNS; INFORMATION; DATABASE; SYSTEM; TEXT; EXTRACTION; GENES	Background: Availability of information about transcription factors (TFs) is crucial for genome biology, as TFs play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. While manual literature curation is expensive and labour intensive, the development of semi-automated text mining support is hindered by unavailability of training data. There have been no studies on how existing data sources (e.g. TF-related data from the MeSH thesaurus and GO ontology) or potentially noisy example data (e.g. protein-protein interaction, PPI) could be used to provide training data for identification of TF-contexts in literature. Results: In this paper we describe a text-classification system designed to automatically recognise contexts related to transcription factors in literature. A learning model is based on a set of biological features (e.g. protein and gene names, interaction words, other biological terms) that are deemed relevant for the task. We have exploited background knowledge from existing biological resources (MeSH and GO) to engineer such features. Weak and noisy training datasets have been collected from descriptions of TF-related concepts in MeSH and GO, PPI data and data representing non-protein-function descriptions. Three machine-learning methods are investigated, along with a vote-based merging of individual approaches and/or different training datasets. The system achieved highly encouraging results, with most classifiers achieving an F-measure above 90%. Conclusions: The experimental results have shown that the proposed model can be used for identification of TF-related contexts (i.e. sentences) with high accuracy, with a significantly reduced set of features when compared to traditional bag-of-words approach. The results of considering existing PPI data suggest that there is not as high similarity between TF and PPI contexts as we have expected.

J	Yang, YC; Wang, YP; Li, KB				Yang, Yuchen; Wang, Yu-Ping; Li, Kuo-Bin			MiRTif: a support vector machine-based microRNA target interaction filter	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article	7th International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB2008)	OCT 20-23, 2008	Taipei, TAIWAN				SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION PREDICTION; REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION; C-ELEGANS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; REGULATORY RNA; CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; LIN-14; TRANSLATION	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a set of small non-coding RNAs serving as important negative gene regulators. In animals, miRNAs turn down protein translation by binding to the 3' UTR regions of target genes with imperfect complementary pairing. The identification of microRNA targets has become one of the major challenges of miRNA research. Bioinformatics investigations on miRNA target have resulted in a number of target prediction tools. Although these tools are capable of predicting hundreds of targets for a given miRNA, many of them suffer from high false positive rates, indicating the need for a post-processing filter for the predicted targets. Once trained with experimentally validated true and false targets, machine learning methods appear to be ideal approaches to distinguish the true targets from the false ones. Results: We present a miRNA target filtering system named MiRTif (miRNA: target interaction filter). The system is a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with 195 positive and 38 negative miRNA: target interaction pairs, all experimentally validated. Each miRNA: target interaction pair is divided into a seed and a non-seed region. The encoded feature vector contains various k-gram frequencies in the seed, the non-seed and the entire regions. Informative features are selected based on their discriminating abilities. Prediction accuracies are assessed using 10-fold cross-validation experiments. Our system achieves AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.86, sensitivity of 83.59%, and specificity of 73.68%. More importantly, the system correctly predicts majority of the false positive miRNA: target interactions (28 out of 38). The possibility of over-fitting due to the relatively small negative sample set has also been investigated using a set of non-validated and randomly selected targets (from miRBase). Conclusion: MiRTif is designed as a post-processing filter that takes miRNA: target interactions predicted by other target prediction softwares such as TargetScanS, PicTar and miRanda as inputs, and determines how likely the given interaction is a real or a pseudo one.

Improved general regression network for protein domain boundary prediction	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB2007)	AUG 27-30, 2007	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA				RELATIVE SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; LINKER LENGTH; SEQUENCE; PROFILES; REGIONS; ASSIGNMENT; DATABASE	Background: Protein domains present some of the most useful information that can be used to understand protein structure and functions. Recent research on protein domain boundary prediction has been mainly based on widely known machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. In this study, we propose a new machine learning model (IGRN) that can achieve accurate and reliable classification, with significantly reduced computations. The IGRN was trained using a PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix), secondary structure, solvent accessibility information and inter-domain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence. Results: The proposed model achieved average prediction accuracy of 67% on the Benchmark_ 2 dataset for domain boundary identification in multi-domains proteins and showed superior predictive performance and generalisation ability among the most widely used neural network models. With the CASP7 benchmark dataset, it also demonstrated comparable performance to existing domain boundary predictors such as DOMpro, DomPred, DomSSEA, DomCut and DomainDiscovery with 70.10% prediction accuracy. Conclusion: The performance of proposed model has been compared favourably to the performance of other existing machine learning based methods as well as widely known domain boundary predictors on two benchmark datasets and excels in the identification of domain boundaries in terms of model bias, generalisation and computational requirements.

J	Pirooznia, M; Yang, JY; Yang, MQ; Deng, YP				Pirooznia, Mehdi; Yang, Jack Y.; Yang, Mary Qu; Deng, Youping			A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: Several classification and feature selection methods have been studied for the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray data. Classification methods such as SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods have been used in recent studies. The accuracy of these methods has been calculated with validation methods such as v-fold validation. However there is lack of comparison between these methods to find a better framework for classification, clustering and analysis of microarray gene expression results. Results: In this study, we compared the efficiency of the classification methods including; SVM, RBF Neural Nets, MLP Neural Nets, Bayesian, Decision Tree and Random Forrest methods. The v-fold cross validation was used to calculate the accuracy of the classifiers. Some of the common clustering methods including K-means, DBC, and EM clustering were applied to the datasets and the efficiency of these methods have been analysed. Further the efficiency of the feature selection methods including support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), Chi Squared, and CSF were compared. In each case these methods were applied to eight different binary (two class) microarray datasets. We evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using supervised classifiers. Conclusions: We presented a study in which we compared some of the common used classification, clustering, and feature selection methods. We applied these methods to eight publicly available datasets, and compared how these methods performed in class prediction of test datasets. We reported that the choice of feature selection methods, the number of genes in the gene list, the number of cases (samples) substantially influence classification success. Based on features chosen by these methods, error rates and accuracy of several classification algorithms were obtained. Results revealed the importance of feature selection in accurately classifying new samples and how an integrated feature selection and classification algorithm is performing and is capable of identifying significant genes.

Research and development in these two important areas are impacting the science and technology. High throughput sequencing and molecular imaging technologies marked the beginning of a new era for modern translational medicine and personalized healthcare. The impact of having the human sequence and personalized digital images in hand has also created tremendous demands of developing powerful supercomputing, statistical learning and artificial intelligence approaches to handle the massive bioinformatics and personalized healthcare data, which will obviously have a profound effect on how biomedical research will be conducted toward the improvement of human health and prolonging of human life in the future. The International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (http://www.isibm.org) and its official journals, the International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine (http://www.inderscience.com/ijfipm) and the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design (http://www.inderscience.com/ijcbdd) in collaboration with International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (Biocomp), touch tomorrow's bioinformatics and personalized medicine throughout today's efforts in promoting the research, education and awareness of the upcoming integrated inter/multidisciplinary field. The 2007 international conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BIOCOMP07) was held in Las Vegas, the United States of American on June 25-28, 2007. The conference attracted over 400 papers, covering broad research areas in the genomics, biomedicine and bioinformatics. The Biocomp 2007 provides a common platform for the cross fertilization of ideas, and to help shape knowledge and scientific achievements by bridging these two very important disciplines into an interactive and attractive forum. Keeping this objective in mind, Biocomp 2007 aims to promote interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research. 25 high quality peer-reviewed papers were selected from 400+ submissions for this supplementary issue of BMC Genomics. Those papers contributed to a wide-range of important research fields including gene expression data analysis and applications, high-throughput genome mapping, sequence analysis, gene regulation, protein structure prediction, disease prediction by machine learning techniques, systems biology, database and biological software development. We always encourage participants submitting proposals for genomics sessions, special interest research sessions, workshops and tutorials to Professor Hamid R. Arabnia (hra@cs.uga.edu) in order to ensure that Biocomp continuously plays the leadership role in promoting inter/multidisciplinary research and education in the fields. Biocomp received top conference ranking with a high score of 0.95/1.00. Biocomp is academically cosponsored by the International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine and the Research Laboratories and Centers of Harvard University - Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Indiana University - Purdue University, Georgia Tech Emory University, UIUC, UCLA, Columbia University, University of Texas at Austin and University of Iowa etc. Biocomp - Worldcomp brings leading scientists together across the nation and all over the world and aims to promote synergistic components such as keynote lectures, special interest sessions, workshops and tutorials in response to the advances of cutting-edge research.

J	Yang, JY; Yang, MQ; Dunker, KA; Deng, YP; Huang, XD				Yang, Jack Y.; Yang, Mary Qu; Dunker, Keith A.; Deng, Youping; Huang, Xudong			Investigation of transmembrane proteins using a computational approach	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: An important subfamily of membrane proteins are the transmembrane a-helical proteins, in which the membrane-spanning regions are made up of a-helices. Given the obvious biological and medical significance of these proteins, it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of transmembrane segments. The difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatic stoinfer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins. We are therefore interested in determining which physicochemical properties are most useful for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins, and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins, and in using the results of these investigations to develop classifiers to identify transmembrane segments in transmembrane proteins. Results: We determined that the most useful properties for discriminating transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured segments in transmembrane proteins were hydropathy, polarity, and flexibility, and used the results of this analysis to construct classifiers to discriminate transmembrane segments from non-transmembrane segments using four classification techniques: two variants of the Self-Organizing Global Ranking algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, and a support vector machine algorithm. All four techniques exhibited good performance, with out-of-sample accuracies of approximately 75%. Conclusions: Several interesting observations emerged from our study: intrinsically unstructured segments and transmembrane segments tend to have opposite properties; transmembrane proteins appear to be much richer in intrinsically unstructured segments than other proteins; and, in approximately 70% of transmembrane proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured segments, the intrinsically unstructured segments are close to transmembrane segments.

It follows from a comprehensive statistical analysis that a number of antigens such as hTERT, PCNA and Ki-67 can be considered as cancer markers, while another set of antigens such as P27KIP1 and FHIT are possible markers for normal tissue. Because more than one marker must be considered to obtain a classification of cancer or no cancer, and if cancer, to classify it as malignant, borderline, or benign, we must develop an intelligent decision system that can fullfill such an unmet medical need. Results: We have developed an intelligent decision system using machine learning techniques and markers to characterize tissue as cancerous, non-cancerous or borderline. The system incorporates learning techniques such as variants of support vector machines, neural networks, decision trees, self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) and recursive maximum contrast trees (RMCT). These variants and algorithms we have developed, tend to detect microscopic pathological changes based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles. We have also used immunohistochemistry techniques to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin E, P27KIP1, FHIT, Ki-67, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2, P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and the adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), adenomas (ACA), and hyperplasia (ACH) involved with Cushing's syndrome. We provided statistical evidence that higher expression levels of hTERT, PCNA and Ki-67 etc. are associated with a higher risk that the tumors are malignant or borderline as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of P27KIP1 and FHIT, etc., are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors. While no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as P27KIP1 for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors. Conclusions: Our frame work focused on not only different classification schemes and feature selection algorithms, but also ensemble methods such as boosting and bagging in an effort to improve upon the accuracy of the individual classifiers. It is evident that when all sorts of machine learning and statistically learning techniques are combined appropriately into one integrated intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power can be enhanced significantly. This research has many potential applications; it might provide an alternative diagnostic tool and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in malignant transformation as well as information that is useful for treatment planning and cancer prevention.

J	Yang, MQ; Elnitski, L				Yang, Mary Qu; Elnitski, Laura			Prediction-based approaches to characterize bidirectional promoters in the mammalian genome	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: Machine learning approaches are emerging as a way to discriminate various classes of functional elements. Previous attempts to create Regulatory Potential ( RP) scores to discriminate functional DNA from nonfunctional DNA included using Markov models trained to identify sequences from promoters and enhancers from ancestral repeats. We proposed that knowledge gleaned from those methods could be further refined using a multiple class predictor to separate classes of promoter elements from enhancers or nonfunctional DNA. Results: We extended our previous work, which identified over 5,000 candidate bidirectional promoters in the human genome, to map the orthologous promoter regions in the mouse genome. Our algorithm measured the robustness of evidence provided by the spliced EST annotations and incorporated evidence from annotations of UCSC Known Genes and GenBank mRNA. In preparation for de novo prediction of this promoter type, we examined characteristic features of the dataset as a whole. For instance, bidirectional promoters score very highly among all functional elements for Regulatory Potential Scores. This result was unexpected due to the limited sequence conservation found in these noncoding regions. We demonstrate that bidirectional promoters can be classified apart from other genomic features including non-bidirectional promoters, i. e. those promoters having no nearby upstream genes. Furthermore bidirectional promoters consistently score at the level of very highly conserved functional elements in the genome-developmental enhancers. The high scores are due to sequence- based characteristics within the promoters, not the surrounding exons. These results indicate that high-scoring RP regions can be deconvoluted into various functional classes of genomic elements. Using a multiple class predictor we are able to discriminate bidirectional promoters from enhancers, non-bidirectional promoters, and non-promoter regions on the basis of RP scores and CpG islands. Conclusions: We examine orthology at bidirectional promoters, use discriminatory machine learning approaches to differentiate multiple types of promoters from other functional and nonfunctional features in the genome and begin the process of deconvoluting classes of functional regions that score well with RP scores. These types of approaches precede supervised learning techniques to discover unannotated promoter regions.

The results of the different models are compared and discussed relative to each other and previous similar studies. The conclusions of earlier papers, that machine learning could help anticoagulation clinicians achieve better results, are reinforced here using an extensive data set. Continuously-updating neural network models are shown to predict future INR measurements best of the three types of models presented here.

However, HIV-1 protease cleavage domain with high dimensionality and small number of samples could misguide classification modeling and its interpretation. Thus, a method to select a smaller number of relevant features is required. Appropriate feature selection could eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, and thus, improves prediction performance and provides faster and more cost-effective models. As a result, we can gain deeper insight about dataset. In this paper, we introduce a new feature selection method, called FS-MLP, that extracts relevant features using multi-layered perceptron learning. With the method, we could extract a set of effective features in a multi-variate and non-linear way. Our experimental results on three types of artificial datasets and HIV-1 protease cleavage dataset show that performance of the FS-MLP is higher than other methods.

The general rule for the number of features is that the number can not be too much to improve the efficiency and speed of mining. This paper presents the wavelet methods for feature compression, and gives the evaluation of the wavelet methods comparing with data driven feature selection using the example of the project of image mining of pathogen yeast Cryptococcus Neoformans. The experiments show that the wavelet methods for feature compression are almost as effective as data driven feature selection to identify variance pathogen condition. The experiments are built on the training images set and evaluated using the new test set images with machine learning tool WEKA.

Evidence that dysregulated DNA mismatch repair characterizes human nonmelanoma skin cancer	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						DNA mismatch repair; machine learning; nonmelanoma skin cancer; tissue microarray	BASAL-CELL CARCINOMAS; MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; EXCISION-REPAIR; GASTRIC-CANCER; ENZYME HMSH-2; APOPTOSIS; GENES; P53	Background In addition to an established role in the repair of postreplicative DNA errors, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins also contribute to cellular responses to exogenous DNA damage. Previously, we have shown that Msh2-null mice display increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) B-induced tumorigenesis, but squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) generated are microsatellite stable, suggesting a role for MMR other than postreplicative repair in UV-induced cutaneous tumour formation. Objectives We questioned whether there was evidence of MMR dysfunction in human SCC, thus validating the mouse models of MMR-dependent UVB-induced skin cancer. Methods Using tissue microarrays we examined both nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of MMR proteins MSH2, MSH6, MSH3, MLH1 and PMS2 in more than 200 cases of cutaneous SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Results We found that subsets of these 10 MMR protein measures were increased in nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) compared with normal epidermal samples; this was particularly true of SCC. In fact, based on post hoc tests and MMR protein distribution patterns, BCC was distinct from SCC. With the exception of nuclear MSH2, the BCC had lower levels of identified MMR protein measures than SCC. We believe this to be important because not only is SCC more aggressive than BCC, but evidence suggests that these two NMSC subtypes arise through different molecular pathways. Conclusions In combination with previously established roles for MMR proteins in response to UVB-induced DNA damage, our data point towards an expanded perspective of the importance of MMR proteins in the suppression of UVB-induced tumorigenesis and, potentially, tumour behaviour.

This chapter focuses on packet-scheduling algorithms. The state of the art for packet scheduling in wireless multimedia networks is presented here, including the system models (e.g., network-, wireless channel-, and traffic model), challenges (e.g., diverse traffic properties and high link variability), and objectives (e.g., quality-of-service [QoS] differentiation and guarantee, maximizing bandwidth utilization, and fairness provisioning). In the overview of existing packet-scheduling algorithms, scheduling algorithms applied in wireline and wireless environment are briefly introduced. On the basis of summary of existing scheduling algorithms, a new scheduling framework, which is learning based, is proposed. The central idea of the proposed scheduling mechanism is to employ machine learning method in the scheduling process and make the scheduler adaptable to the complicated scheduling environment in wireless multimedia networks.

In case of temporal indexing, temporal features represent so called, time horizon or valid time of information, i.e. time period, to which information presented in a document relates. Approaches to temporal information indexing are based mainly on temporal expressions extracted from document contents. This method, although satisfactory for many applications, is very limited. Temporal expressions are only one of many means of relating information to time used in written language. In this paper, the possibility of temporal information indexing based on other, more broad and frequent document temporal feature is evaluated. Soundness and effectiveness of temporal indexing based on document syntactic features is presented.

Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we test an approach to Landsat image interpretation on four islands of the Lesser Antilles, including Grenada and St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius, testing a more detailed classification than earlier work in the latter three islands. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and ask how land cover has changed over the second half of the 20(th) century. The image interpretation approach combines image mosaics and ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting set of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to scene dates that could fill cloudy areas in a base scene. Such mosaics are also known as cloud-filled, cloud-minimized or cloud-cleared imagery, mosaics, or composites. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that more standard methods would confuse; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones. Cultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. This trend will likely continue where sugar cane cultivation has dominated. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Also similarly, lowland forests, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering lowland forest clearing for agriculture.

A Class of Probabilistic Models for Role Engineering	CCS'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security	OCT 27-31, 2008	Alexandria, VA	ACM SIGSAC		RBAC; Role Mining; Machine Learning; Clustering	NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS	Role Engineering is a security-critical task for systems using role-based access control (RBAC). Different role-mining approaches have been proposed that attempt to automatically infer appropriate roles front existing user-permission assignments. However, these approaches are mainly combinatorial and lack an underlying probabilistic model of the domain. We present, the first, probabilistic model for RBAC. Our model defines a general framework for expressing user permission assignments and can be specialized to different domains by limiting its degrees of freedom with appropriate constraints. For one practically important instance of this framework, we show how roles can be inferred from data using a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm. Experiments on both randomly generated and real-world data provide evidence that our approach not only creates meaningful roles but also identifies erroneous user-permission assignments in given data.

The security of Asirra, is based on the presumed difficulty of classifying these images automatically. In this paper, we describe a classifer which is 82.7% accurate in telling apart, the images of cats and dogs used it) Asirra. This classifier is a combination of support-vector machine classifiers trained on color and texture features extracted front images. Our classifier allows its to solve a 12-image Asirra challenge automatically with Probability 10.3%. This probability of success is significantly higher than the estimate of 0.2% given in [7] for machine vision attacks. Our results suggest, caution against deploying Asirra without; safeguards. We also investigate Hie impact of our attacks oil the partial credit and token bucket algorithms proposed in [7]. The partial credit algorithm weakens Asirra, considerably and we recommend against, its use. The token bucket algorithm helps mitigate the impact of our attacks and allows Asirra to be deployed in a way that maintains all appealing balance between usability and security. One, contribution of our work is to inform the choice of safeguard parameters in Asirra deployments.

Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. The uncertainty to explore if certain algorithms perform better for certain attack classes constitutes the motivation for the reported herein. In this paper, we evaluate performance of a comprehensive set of classifier algorithms using KDD99 dataset. Based on evaluation results, best algorithms for each attack category is chosen and two classifier algorithm selection models are proposed. The simulation result comparison indicates that noticeable performance improvement and real-time intrusion detection can be achieved as we apply the proposed models to detect different kinds of network attacks.

The accuracy of traditional Internet application traffic classification approaches is rapidly decreasing due to the diversity of today's Internet application traffic, such as ephemeral port allocation, proprietary protocol, and traffic encryption. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of application-level traffic classification using supervised machine learning techniques. Our results indicate that we cannot achieve high accuracy with a simple feature set. Even if a simple feature set shows good performance in application category-level classification, more sophisticated feature selection methods and other techniques are necessary for performance enhancement.

Popular engines have begun to provide tags based on simple characteristics of images (such as tags for black and white images or images that contain a face), but such approaches are limited by the fact that it is unclear what tags end-users want to be able to use in examining Web image search results. This paper presents CueFlik, a. Web image search application that allows end-users to quickly create their own rules for re-ranking images based on their visual characteristics. End-users can then re-rank any future Web image search results according to their rule. In an experiment we present in this paper, end-users quickly create effective rules for such concepts as "product photos", "portraits of people", and "clipart". hen asked to conceive of and create their own rules, participants create such rules as "sports action shot" with images from queries for "basketball" and "football". CueFlik represents both a promising new approach to Web image search and an important study in end-user interactive machine learning.

Extensive prior work has studied software development, but little prior work has studied software developers applying statistical machine learning. This paper presents interviews of eleven researchers experienced in applying statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques to human-computer interaction problems, as well as a study of ten participants working during a five-hour study to apply statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques to a realistic problem. We distill three related categories of difficulties that arise in applying statistical machine learning as a tool for software development: (1) difficulty pursuing statistical machine learning as an iterative and exploratory process, (2) difficulty understanding relationships between data and the behavior of statistical machine learning algorithms, and (3) difficulty evaluating the performance of statistical machine learning algorithms and techniques in the context of applications. This paper provides important new insight into these difficulties and the need for development tools that better support the application of statistical machine learning.

In this paper, we describe an experiment we conducted to explore some of the issues around using an electroencephalograph (EEG) for classifying working memory load. Within this experiment, we present our classification methodology, including a novel feature selection scheme that seems to alleviate the need for complex drift modeling and artifact rejection. We demonstrate classification accuracies of up to 99% for 2 memory load levels and up to 88% for 4 levels. We also present results suggesting that we can do this with shorter windows, much less training data, and a smaller number of EEG channels, than reported previously. Finally, we show results suggesting that the models we construct transfer across variants of the task, implying some level of generality. We believe these findings extend prior work and bring us a step closer to the use of such technologies in HCI research.	[Grimes, David; Shenoy, Pradeep; Rao, Rajesh P.

It has started with the integration of database schemas in the early eighties. With the rise of the semantic web and the emerging abundance of ontologies, the need for an automated integration increased further A lot of automated matching approaches and tools have been proposed so far The typical output of such tools is a simple one-to-one alignment mostly, based on schema information, e.g., similar names and structures of schema elements. However these alignments cannot cope with schema heterogeneities, hence, the,,e problems must be resolved manually. Furthermore, then? is no automated evaluation of the quality of the alignments-based on the instance level, because the matching approaches are not bound to a specific integration scenario, e.g., transformation or merge. In this work, we propose the SmartMatching approach, which can be seen as an orthogonal extension to existing matching approaches for increasing the quality of the automatically produced alignments for the transformation scenario.

Finding rare objects and building pure samples: Probabilistic quasar classification with Gaia	CLASSIFICATION AND DISCOVERY IN LARGE ASTRONOMICAL SURVEYS	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Classification and Discovery in Large Astronomical Surveys	OCT 14-17, 2008	Ringberg Castle, GERMANY	Max Planck Inst Astron, Max Planck Gesell, DFG, Emmy Noether Programme		classification; machine learning; class imbalance; Gaia; quasars	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; TREE	We have developed a method for classifying rare objects in surveys with the particular goal of building very pure samples. It works by modifying the output probabilities from a classifier so as to accommodate our expectation (prior;) concerning the relative frequencies of different classes of objects. We demonstrate our method using the Discrete Source Classifier, a supervised classifier currently based oil Support Vector Machines, which we ate developing in preparation for the Gaia data analysis. DSC classifies objects using their very low resolution optical spectra. We look in detail at the problem of quasar classification (partly because a pure quasar sample is necessary to define the Gaia astrometric reference frank). By varying a posterior probability threshold in DSC (P(t)) we can trade off sample completeness and contamination. We show, using our simulated data, that it is possible to achieve a pure sample of quasars (tipper limit on contamination of 1 in 40000) with a completeness of 65% at magnitudes of G-18.5, and 50% at G=20.0, even when quasars have a frequency of only 1 in every 2000 objects. The star sample completeness is simultaneously more than 99% with a contamination of 0.7%. Including parallax and proper motion in the classifier barely changes the results. Not accounting for class priors leads to serious misclassifications and poor predictions for sample completeness and contamination. Our method controls the prior and so allows a single model to be applied to any target population without having to time the training data and retrain the model.	[Bailer-Jones, Coryn A.

First the SVM classifier was trained on a dataset comprising the u - g, g - r, r - i and i - z colours of 47,401 stars, 415,634 galaxies and 71,031 quasars with spectral classifications. All analysis of the performance of the classifier showed a total classification error of 3.80% and demonstrates that the SVM is efficiently able to learn the non-linear, four dimensional class boundaries. Afterwards class membership probabilities for stars, galaxies and quasars were predicted for 12,362,179 objects in DR6 without spectra which were situated within the inner 90% of the training colour space and had magnitude errors below 10%. The SVM predicted 11,012,775 stars, 1,088,862 galaxies and 260,542 quasars. The relatively high number of galaxies call be explained by our constraints on colours and magnitude errors. The results were validated by cross-matching against the FIRST and USNO-B surveys. The cross-match with FIRST resulted in 8,666 radio sources of which the SVM classifier predicted 94.8% to be galaxies or quasars as expected.	[Elting, C.; Bailer-Jones, C. A. L.; Smith, K.

One of the data analysis tasks will be the identification and classification of measured objects. A vast majority of them will be "ordinary" stars from our Galaxy but a certain percentage will belong to "peculiar" objects. We are interested in detecting emission line stars (ELS). The characteristic feature of most ELS is the presence of a I-I-a emission line in their spectra. In the case of Gaia measurements, the influence of this line could be detected in low resolution prismatic spectra which will be recorded both in blue (BP) and red (RP) spectral region. In this work, we compare different algorithms for detecting and characterising H-a lines in Gaia spectra. These include a simple, integrated flux ratio-based algorithm and several machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, support vector machines and support vector regression. We study line detection both from single-transit and over-sampled end-of-mission data.

While panoramic surveys can detect variable or transient events, typically some follow-up observations are needed; for short-lived phenomena, a rapid response is essential. Ability to automatically classify and prioritize transient events for follow-tip studies becomes critical as the data rates increase. We have been developing such methods using the data streams from the Palomar-Quest survey, the Catalina Sky Survey and others, using the VOEventNet framework The goal is to automatically classify transient events, using the new measurements, combined with archival data (previous and multi-wavelength measurements), and contextual information (e.g., Galactic or ecliptic latitude, presence of a possible host galaxy nearby, etc.); and to iterate them dynamically as the follow-up data come in (e.g., light curves or colors). We have been investigating Baycsian methodologies for classification, as well as discriminated follow-up to optimize the use of available resources, including Naive Bayesian approach, and the non-parametric Gaussian process regression. We will also be deploying variants of the traditional machine learning techniques such as Neural Nets and Support Vector Machines on datasets of reliably classified transient: as they build up.

This machine learning algorithm, using Random Forests, is applied to the IBIS/ISGRI dataset in order to ease the production of unbiased future soft gamma-ray source catalogues. The key steps of candidate searching, filtering and feature extraction are described. Three training and testing sets are created in order to deal with the diverse timescales and diverse objects encountered when dealing with the gamma-ray sky. Three independent Random Forest are built: one dealing with faint persistent source recognition, one dealing with strong persistent sources and a final one dealing with transients. For the latter, a new transient detection technique is introduced and described: the Transient Matrix. Finally the performance of the network is assessed and discussed using the testing set and some illustrative source examples.

This strategy combines the power of distributed computing with machine learning and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques efficiently to explore a likelihood function, posterior distribution or chi(2)-surface. This strategy is particularly successful in cases where computing the likelihood is costly and the number of parameters is moderate or large. We apply this technique to two central problems in cosmology: the solution of the cosmological parameter estimation problem with sufficient accuracy for the Planck data using PICo; and the detailed calculation of cosmological helium and hydrogen recombination with RICO. Since the APPLe approach is designed to be able to use massively parallel resources to speed tip problems that arc inherently serial, we can bring the power of distributed computing to bear on parameter estimation problems.

The project aims to develop a modular, robust, multimodal biometrics security authentication system, which improves state-of-the-art methods in biometrics, such as face, speech, and gait and increases unobtrusiveness. For each modality, the data acquisition, feature extraction and matching procedures are briefly discussed. Subsequently, a comparative evaluation of multimodal score-level fusion methods ranging from simple classification schemes to more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and fuzzy expert systems is presented and their advantages over unimodal classification are highlighted. Experimental evaluation on data recorded in adverse environmental conditions shows that despite the increased unobtrusiveness the multimodal authentication system can achieve very satisfactory performance.

Often it is impossible to estimate sharpness prior to printing. Sometimes it is a complex task for a consumer to obtain accurate sharpening results by editing a photo on a computer. The novel method of adaptive sharpening aimed for photo printers is proposed. Our approach includes 3 key techniques: sharpness level estimation, local tone mapping and boosting of local contrast. Non-reference automatic sharpness level estimation is based on analysis of variations of edges histograms, where edges are produced by high-pass filters with various kernel sizes, array of integrals of logarithm of edges histograms characterizes photo sharpness, machine learning is applied to choose optimal parameters for given printing size and resolution. Local tone mapping with ordering is applied to decrease edge transition slope length without noticeable artifacts and with some noise suppression. Unsharp mask via bilateral filter is applied for boosting of local contrast. This stage does not produce strong halo artifact which is typical for the traditional unsharp mask filter. The quality of proposed approach is evaluated by surveying observer's opinions. According to obtained replies the proposed method enhances the majority of photos.

Correction of red eyes during printing without user intervention and making photos more pleasant for an observer are important tasks. The novel efficient technique of automatic correction of red eyes aimed for photo printers is proposed. This algorithm is independent from face orientation and capable to detect paired red eyes as well as single red eyes. The approach is based on application of 3D tables with typicalness levels for red eyes and human skin tones and directional edge detection filters for processing of redness image. Machine learning is applied for features selection. For classification of red eye regions a cascade of classifiers including Gentle AdaBoost committee from Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is applied. Retouching stage includes desaturation, darkening and blending with initial image. Several versions of approach implementation using trade-off between detection and correction quality, processing time, memory requirements are possible. The numeric quality criterion of automatic red eye correction is proposed. This quality metric is constructed by applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to consumer opinions about correction outcomes. Proposed numeric metric helps to choose algorithm parameters via optimization procedure. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with existing solutions.

Given an n x m matrix A (n >= m), the main goal of biclustering is to identify a subset of rows (called objects) and a subset of columns (called properties) such that some objective function that specifies the quality of the found bicluster (formed by the subsets of rows and of columns of A) is optimized. The problem has been proved or conjectured to be NP-hard under various mathematical models. In this paper, we study a probabilistic model of the implanted additive bicluster problem, where each element in the n x m background matrix is a random number from [0, L - 1], and a k x k implanted additive bicluster is obtained from an error-free additive bicluster by randomly changing each element to a number in [0, L - 1] with probability theta. We propose an O(n(2)m) time voting algorithm to solve the problem. We show that for any constant 6 such that (1 - delta)(1 - theta)(2) - 1/L > 0, when k >= max {8/alpha root nlog n, 8logn/c + log(2L)}, where c is a constant number, the voting algorithm can correctly find the implanted bicluster with probability at least 1 - 9/n(2). We also implement our algorithm as a software tool for finding novel biclusters in microarray gene expression data, called VOTE. The implementation incorporates several nontrivial ideas for estimating the size of an implanted bicluster, adjusting the threshold in voting, dealing with small biclusters, and dealing with multiple (and overlapping) implanted biclusters. Our experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that VOTE can find biclusters with a high accuracy and speed.

Compared with other data mining applications, medical data mining has some unique characteristics. Since medical records are related to human subjects, privacy protection is taken more seriously than other data mining tasks. This paper applied two data separation techniques - vertical and horizontal partition - to preserve privacy in medical data classification. In the vertical partition approach, each site uses a portion of the attributes to compute its results and the distributed results are assembled at a central trusted party using majority-vote ensemble method. In the horizontal partition approach, data are distributed among several sites. Each site computes its own data and a central trusted party integrate these results using ensemble. We implement these two approaches using medical datasets from UCI Machine Learning archive and report the experimental results.

However, the linearity assumption may be too restrictive for many practical applications. The implementation of nonlinear models in time series analysis involves the estimation of a large set of parameters, frequently leading to overfitting problems. In this article, a predictability coefficient is estimated using a combination of nonlinear autoregressive models and the use of support vector regression in this model is explored. We illustrate the usefulness and interpretability of results by using electroencephalographic records of an epileptic patient.

In our earlier work [9, 12] we introduced a special kind of junction tree, based on a hypergraph structure called t-cherry tree [1, 2, 3] and on some information theoretical concepts [7, 10]. In this paper we present a possibility for the improvement of these junction trees, by "cutting and refitting" of the junction tree's branches. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the improvement of the junction tree obtained after "branch cutting and refitting".

This technology improves the "Google like" experience by increasing both the total number of retrieved documents (recall) and the quality of the very best ones (precision) while maintaining the ease of entering a natural language query. We propose a hybrid approach, both in the working methodology and in the codification of the legal knowledge -subject matter expert and librarian-, through new layers of semantic analysis and algorithms. We improve the traditional tf-idf vector space model by creating a mixed document indexing schema of terms and concepts as well as a proprietary ranking algorithm trained by a hybrid genetic algorithm. These calculations also improve the quality of keyword-in-context.

Printing technique examination can therefore be a valuable source of information to determine a questioned documents authenticity. A study of graylevel features for high throughput printing technique recognition was undertaken. The evaluation included printouts generated by 49 different laser and 13 different inkjet printers. Furthermore, the extracted document features were classified using three different machine learning approaches. We were able to show that, under the given constraints of high-throughput systems, it is possible to determine the printing technique used to create a document.

Shoe-print extraction from latent images using CRF	COMPUTATIONAL FORENSICS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Computational Forensics	AUG 07-08, 2008	Washington, DC		Natl Acad Sci		CLASSIFICATION	Shoeprints are one of the most commonly found evidences at crime scenes. A latent shoeprint is a photograph of the impressions made by a shoe oil the surface of its contact. Latent shoeprints can be used for identification of suspects in a forensic case by narrowing down the search space. This is done by elimination of the type of shoe, by matching it against a set; of known shoeprints (captured impressions of many different types of shoes on a chemical surface). Manual identification is laborious and hence the domain seeks automated methods. The critical step in automatic shoeprint identification is Shoeprint Extraction - defined as the problem of isolating the shoeprint foreground (impressions of the shoe) from the remaining elements (background and noise). We formulate this problem as a labeling problem as that of labeling different regions of a latent image as foreground (shoeprint) and background. The matching of these extracted shoeprints to the known prints largely depends oil the quality of the extracted shoeprint from latent print. The labeling problem is naturally formulated as a machine learning task and in this paper we present an approach using Conditional Random Fields (CRFS) to solve this problem. The model exploits the inherent long range dependencies that exist in the latentprint and hence is more robust than approaches using neural networks and other binarization algorithms. A dataset comprising of 45 shoeprint images was carefully prepared to represent typical latent shoeprint images. Experimental results oil this data set are promising and support our claims above.

This paper describes signature verification using a non-parametric Bayesian approach. Given sample(s) of Genuine signatures of an individual, the task of signature verification is a problem of classifying a questioned signature as Genuine or Forgery. The verification problem is a two step approach - (i) Enrollment: Genuine signature samples of an individual are provided. The method presented here maps from features space to distance space by comparing all the available genuine signature samples amongst themselves to obtain a distribution in distance space - "within person distribution". This distribution captures the variation and similarities that exist within a particular person's signature; (ii) Classification: The questioned signature to be classified, is then compared to each of the genuine signatures to obtain another distribution in distance space - "Questioned vs Known distribution". The two distributions are then compared using a new Bayesian similarity measure to test whether the samples in the distribution are from the same distribution(Genuine) or not(Forgery). The approach yields improved performance over other non-parametric non Bayesian approaches.

S	Gandhi, T; Trivedi, MM		Prokhorov, D		Gandhi, Tarak; Trivedi, Mohan Manubhai			Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Enhancing Pedestrian Safety	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							OMNIDIRECTIONAL CAMERA; VEHICLE; MOTION; TRACKING; CAPTURE	Accidents involving pedestrians is one of the leading causes of death and injury around the world. Intelligent, driver support systems field a promise to minimize accidents and save many lives. Such a system would detect the pedestrian, predict the possibility of collision, and then warn the driver or engage automatic braking or other safety devices. This chapter describes the framework and issues involved in developing a pedestrian protection system. It is emphasized that the knowledge of the state of the environment, vehicle and driver are important for enhancing safety. Classification, clustering, and machine learning techniques for effectively detecting pedestrians are discussed, including the application of algorithms such as SVM, Neural Networks, and AdaBoost for the purpose of distinguishing pedestrians from background. Pedestrians unlike vehicles are capable of sharp turns and speed changes, therefore their future paths are difficult to predict. In order to estimate the possibility of collision, a probabilistic framework for pedestrian path prediction is described along with related research. It is noted that sensors in vehicle are not always sufficient to detect all the pedestrians and other obstacles. Interaction with infrastructure based systems as well as systems from other vehicles cart provide a wide area situational awareness of tire scene. Furthermore, in infrastructure based systems, clustering and learning techniques can be applied to identify typical vehicle and pedestrian paths and to detect anomalies and potentially dangerous situations. In order to effectively integrate information from infrastructure and vehicle sources, the importance of developing and standardizing vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication systems is also emphasized.

Since then, many studies have explored different issues concerning FAM optimization, training and evaluation, e. g., model sensitivity to parameters, ordering strategy for the presentation of the training patterns, training method and method of predicting the classification accuracy. Other studies have suggested variants to FAM to improve its generalization capability or overcome the prime limitation of the model, which is category proliferation (i.e., model complexity that increases with data complexity). Category proliferation is pronounced in problems that are noisy or contain a large degree of class statistical overlapping. In many investigations, FAM was improved by incorporating elements of optimization theory, Bayes' decision theory, evolutionary learning, and cluster analysis. Due to its appealing characteristics, FAM and its variants have been applied extensively and successfully to real-world classification problems. Numerous applications were reported in, for example, the processing of signals from different sources, images, speech, and text; recognition of speakers, image objects, handwritten, and genetic abnormalities; and medical and fault diagnoses. When compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, FAM and its variants showed superior speed and ease of training, and in most cases they delivered comparable classification accuracy.

Examples of these tasks range from natural language parsing to speech recognition, machine translation, image segmentation, handwritten character recognition or gene prediction. Recently many algorithms have been developed in this direction in the machine learning community. They are commonly referred as structured output learning approaches. The main idea behind them is to produce an effective and flexible representation of the data exploiting general dependencies between labels. It has been shown that in many applications structured prediction methods outperform models that do not directly represent correlation between inputs and output labels. Among the variety of the approaches developed in last few years, in particular large margin methods deserve attention since they have proved to be successful in several tasks. These techniques are based on the smart integration between Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), so they combine the ability to learn in high dimensional feature spaces typical of kernel methods with the algorithmic efficiency and the flexibility in representing data inherited by PGMs. In this paper we review some of the most recent large margin methods summarizing the main theoretical results, addressing some important computational issues, and presenting the most successful applications. Specifically, we show results in the context of biological sequence alignment and for sequence labeling and parsing in the natural language processing field. We finally discuss some of the main challenges in this new and promising research field.

A new framework for machine learning	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: RESEARCH FRONTIERS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA					The last five years have seen the emergence of a powerful new framework for building sophisticated real-world applications based on machine learning. The cornerstones of this approach are (i) the adoption of a Bayesian viewpoint, (ii) the use of graphical models to represent complex probability distributions, and (iii) the development of fast, deterministic inference algorithms, such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, which provide efficient solutions to inference and learning problems in terms of local message passing algorithms. This paper reviews the key ideas behind this new framework, and highlights some of its major benefits. The framework is illustrated using an example large-scale application.

Great progress has been made in machine learning by cleverly reducing machine learning problems to convex optimization problems with one or more hyper-parameters. The availability of powerful convex-programming theory and algorithms has enabled a flood of new research in machine learning models and methods. But many of the steps necessary for successful machine learning models fall outside of the convex machine learning paradigm. Thus we now propose framing machine learning problems as Stackelberg games. The resulting bilevel optimization problem allows for efficient systematic search of large numbers of hyper-parameters. We discuss recent progress in solving these bilevel problems and the many interesting optimization challenges that remain. Finally, we investigate the intriguing possibility of novel machine learning models enabled by bilevel programming.

We experiment both with a memory-based learning approach and a maximum entropy modeling method. As an alternative to using external lexical resources, such as the low-coverage Dutch EuroWordNet, we evaluate the effect of automatically generated semantic clusters as information source. We compare these clusters, which group together semantically similar nouns, to two semantic features based on EuroWordNet encoding synonym and hypernym relations between nouns. The syntactic function of the anaphor and antecedent in the sentence can be an important clue for resolving coreferential relations. As baseline approach, we encode syntactic information as predicted by a memory-based shallow parser in a set of features. We contrast these shallow parse based features with features encoding richer syntactic information from a dependency parser. We show that using both the additional semantic information and syntactic information lead to small but significant performance improvement of our coreference resolution approach.

But it is still unclear whether personalization is consistently effective on different queries for different users, and under different search contexts. In this paper, we study this problem and propose a personalized search approach that can easily extend a conventional search engine. We present an intelligent relevance-evaluation framework for user Intention-based personalized search based on web-mining and machine learning approaches. Users can navigate through the prior user's intention by their own needs. This is especially useful for polysemous and poor queries. By analyzing the results, we reveal that there is an unique representation of intention under different queries, contexts and users. Furthermore, we reveal that this knowledge is very important in improving retrieval performance by filtering the results, recommending a new query, and distinguishing user's characteristics. Proposed personalized search engine HPS(Hierachical Phrase Search) can provide more predictive information by clearly identifying the searcher's intention at query-time.

Protein classification problem is a difficult task because of the complexity in function and structural characteristics. This brings the necessity of computer-based methods like machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining to solving the protein classification problems. The goal of this study is to propose the application of Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering (FSC) technique to classify the function of an enzyme by analyzing its structural class similarity to families of enzymes. A codification scheme was implemented to convert the primary structure of enzymes into a real-valued vector. To evaluate our study, the dataset obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB) family database are used as the experimental datasets. The computational results have shown that FSC technique gives a better overall success prediction rate of 84.53% on average in comparison to previously published results.

Portuguese Part-of-Speech Tagging Using Entropy Guided Transformation Learning	COMPUTATIONAL PROCESSING OF THE PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Computational Processing of the Portuguese Language	SEP 08-10, 2008	Aveiro, PORTUGAL	Univ Aveiro, Inst Elect Telemat Engn Aveiro, Assoc Computat Linguist, Int Speech Commun Assoc, ISCA SIG-IL, Fund Cien Tecnol, Microsoft Intel, Springer, UZ Technol, DESIGNEED, Grande Hotel Curia				Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL) is a new machine learning strategy that combines the advantages of Decision Trees (DT) and Transformation Based Learning (TBL). In this work, we apply the ETL framework to Portuguese Part-of-Speech Taggging. We use two different corpora: Mac-Morpho and Tycho Brahae. ETL achieves the best results reported so far for Machine Learning based POS tagging of both corpora. ETL provides a new training strategy that accelerates transformation learning. For the Mac-Morpho corpus this corresponds to a factor of three speedup. ETL shows accuracies of 96.75% and 96.64% for Mac-Morpho and Tycho Brahae, respectively.

Web documents are structured but their structure is understandable only for a human that is the major problem of the Semantic Web. Semantic Web can be exploited only if metadata understood by a computer reach critical mass. Semantic metadata can be created manually, using automated annotation or tagging tools. Automated semantic annotation tools with the best results are built on different machine learning algorithms requiring training sets. Another approach is to use pattern based semantic annotation solutions built on NLP, information retrieval or information extraction methods. Most of developed methods are tested and evaluated on hundreds of documents which cannot prove its real usage on large scale data such as web or email communication in enterprise or community environment. In this paper we present how a pattern based annotation tool can benefit from Google's MapReduce architecture to process large amount of text data.

After finding and processing the data the generated rules will be evaluated by means of so called interestingness measures, and only the best rules should be returned to the user. The paper presents situation in civil engineering data processing, as a suggestion for designers of intelligent software tools, to work out difficult but much needed procedures that should be implemented into autonomous agent system, intended for retrieving special kind of information searched for example by materials technologists. A simple architecture for an agent system is suggested without, however, getting into any technical details on how the elements of such system should be constructed.

The architecture supports centralized learning. Learning may be performed by several agents in the system, but it should be independent (without communication or cooperation connected with the learning process). An agent may have several learning modules for different aspects of its activity. Each module can use different learning strategy. Application of the architecture is studied on example of Fish-Banks game simulator.

In this paper; we introduce a novel approach to object class recognition using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to evolve artificial neural networks (ANN) capable of taking advantage of the robust SIFT feature based descriptor histograms. We claim that NEAT can produce ANN classifier which exhibits outstanding ability, of learning from only a few training examples without sacrificing accuracy. Our empirical evaluations against the performance of state of the art statistical machine learning method such as support-vector machine show that NEAT-evolved ANN classifier outperforms by an average of 9.96% higher accuracy when presented with very small training set proving its superior ability to generalize its learning.

Response classification of simple polycrystalline microstructures	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						microstructure; polycrystal; probability; machine learning; classification	TEXTURE EVOLUTION; FINITE; DEFORMATION; MODEL	A new method for approximate solution of mechanics problems is presented that uses a classifier to identify regions in a random heterogeneous material where stress is likely to be highly concentrated under a prescribed set of boundary conditions. The example problem studied is an aggregate of hexagonal grains, each modeled as orthotropic and linear elastic, and subject to uniaxial extension. It is shown that the Sobol' decomposition can be used to determine which surrounding grains mechanical properties play the largest role in determining the average effective stress in any particular grain. It is also shown that the constituent functions of the Sobol' decomposition determine a unique material pattern that corresponds to maximum stress concentration. A reduced order representation of the microstructure is developed that is in essence a projection of the microstructure description onto the material pattern. Finally, a classifier is developed that operates on this reduced order representation to predict the level of stress concentration. This classifier is shown to be over 90% accurate, and, when implemented in a moving window algorithm, to provide very good predictions of the subregions in a large microstructure where large stress concentration is likely.

MDS is also well known in the machine learning community, where it is used as a basic technique for dimensionality reduction. We adapt a nonlinear variant of MDS that is popular in machine learning, Isomap, for use in analysing psychological data and re-analyse three earlier experiments on human perception of timbre. Isomap is designed to eliminate undesirable nonlinearities in the input data in order to reduce the overall dimensionality; our results show that it succeeds in these goals for timbre spaces, compressing the output onto well-known dimensions of timbre and highlighting the challenges inherent in quantifying differences in spectral shape.

Many techniques have been developed for the bioinformatics problems that have emerged, and more are being proposed everyday. I present here a selection of these problems and techniques, highlighting a fundamental property that is common to all of them. Specifically, I observe that these problems are characterized by invariants that emerge naturally from the causes and/or effects of these problems, and show that the techniques for their solutions are essentially exploitation of these invariants. In the process, we learn several major paradigms (invariants, emerging patterns, guilt by association), some important applications (active sites, key mutations, origin of species, protein functions, disease diagnosis), some interesting technologies (sequence comparison, multiple alignment, machine learning, signal processing, microarrays), and the economics of bioinformatics.

This is likely due to the difficulty in matching two objects With unknown viewpoint and pose. This paper presents a method of performing viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition using an efficiently and intelligently designed object representation, the ensemble of localized features (ELF). Instead of designing a specific feature by, hand to solve the problem, we define a feature space using our intuition about the problem and let a machine learning algorithm find the best, representation. We show how both an object class specific representation and a discriminative recognition model can be learned using the AdaBoost algorithm. This approach allows many different kinds of simple features to be combined into a single similarity function. The method is evaluated using a viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition dataset and the results are shown to be superior to all previous benchmarks for both recognition and reacquisition of pedestrians.

We explore self-similarities of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating the high stability of self-similarities tinder view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown stable under action variations within a class as well as discriminative for action recognition. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multi-view correspondence estimation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public datasets, it has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views for training only.

The color proposition could then be interactively corrected by user-provided color landmarks if necessary. Automatic colorization is nontrivial since there is usually no one-to-one correspondence between color and local texture. The contribution of our framework is that we deal directly with multimodality and estimate, for each pixel of the image to be colored, the probability distribution of all possible colors, instead of choosing the most probable color at the local level. We also predict the expected variation of color at each pixel, thus defining a non-uniform spatial coherency criterion. We then use graph cuts to maximize the probability of the whole colored image at the global level. We work in the L-a-b color space in order to approximate the human perception of distances between colors, and we use machine learning tools to extract as much information as possible from a dataset of colored examples. The resulting algorithm is fast, designed to be more robust to texture noise, and is above all able to deal with ambiguity, in contrary to previous approaches.

In this paper, we study a particular content-based image retrieval application of learning distance metrics from historical relevance feedback log data, which leads to a novel scenario called collaborative image retrieval. The log data provide the side information expressed as relevance judgements between image pairs. Exploiting the side information as well as inherent neighborhood structures among examples, we design a convex regularizer upon which a novel distance metric learning approach, named output regularized metric learning, is presented to tackle collaborative image retrieval. Different from previous distance metric methods, the proposed technique integrates synergistic information from both log data and unlabeled data through a regularization framework and pilots the desired metric toward the ideal output that satisfies pairwise constraints revealed by side information. The experiments on image retrieval tasks have been performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed distance metric technique.

This approach is based on machine learning rather than morphological filtering which was mainly used in previous works. Aircraft detection using computer vision methods is a challenging problem since target aircraft can vary from subpixels to a few pixels in size and the background can be heavily cluttered. Such a system can be a part of a collision avoidance system to warn the pilots of potential collisions. Initial results suggest that this (static) approach on a frame to frame basis achieves a detection rate of about 80% and a false positive rate which is comparable with other approaches that use morphological filtering followed by a tracking stage. The system was evaluated on over 15000 frames which were extracted from real video sequences recorded by NASA and has the potential of real time performance.

For that, in introduction to computing anticipatory systems is presented, with die definitions of strong and weak anticipation. The quasi-anticipatory systems of Robert Rosen are linked to open-loop controllers. Then, sonic properties of the natural brain are presented in relation to the triune brain theory of Paul D. MacLean, and the mind time of Benjamin Libet, with his veto of the free will. The theory of the hyperincursive discrete anticipatory systems is recalled in view to introduce the concept of hyperincursive free will, which gives a similar veto mechanism: free will as unpredictable hyperincursive anticipation The concepts of endo-anticipation and exo-anticipation are then defined. Finally, sonic ideas about artificial conscious intelligence with natural language are presented, in relation to the Turing Machine, Formal Language, Intelligent Agents and Mutli-Agent System.

Employing a domain specific ontology to perform semantic search	CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES: KNOWLEDGE VISUALIZATION AND REASONING	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS 2008)	JUL 07-11, 2008	Toulouse, FRANCE					Increasing the relevancy of Web search results has been a major concern in research over the last years. Boolean search, metadata, natural language based processing and various other techniques have been applied to improve the quality of search results sent to a user. Ontology-based methods were proposed to refine the information extraction process but they have not yet achieved wide adoption by search engines. This is mainly due to the fact that the ontology building process is time consuming. An all inclusive ontology for the entire World Wide Web might be difficult if not,impossible to construct, but a specific domain ontology can be automatically built using statistical and machine learning techniques, as done with our tool: SeseiOnto. In this paper, we describe how we adapted the SeseiOnto software to perform Web search on the Wikipedia page on climate change. SeseiOnto, by using conceptual graphs to represent natural language and an ontology to extract links between concepts, manages to properly answer natural language queries about climate change. Our tests show that SeseiOnto has the potential to be used in domain specific Web search as well as in corporate intranets.

The system's motivational drives, along with social scaffolding from a human partner, bias behaviour to create learning opportunities for a hierarchical reinforcement learning mechanism. The robot is able to learn on its own, but can flexibly take advantage of the guidance of a human teacher. We report the results of an experiment that analyses what the robot learns on its own as compared to being taught by human subjects. We also analyse the video of these interactions to understand human teaching behaviour and the social dynamics of the human-teacher/robot-learner system. With respect to learning performance, human guidance results in a task set that is significantly more focused and efficient at the tasks the human was trying to teach, whereas self-exploration results in a more diverse set. Analysis of human teaching behaviour reveals insights of social coupling between the human teacher and robot learner, different teaching styles, strong consistency in the kinds and frequency of scaffolding acts across teachers and nuances in the communicative intent behind positive and negative feedback.

A comparison of statistical learning approaches for engine torque estimation	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						neural networks; support vector machines; engine torque; black box	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PREDICTION; NETWORKS	Engine torque estimation has important applications in the automotive industry: for example, automatically setting gears, optimizing engine performance, reducing emissions and designing drivelines. A methodology is described for the on line calculation of torque values from the gear, the accelerator pedal position and the engine rotational speed. It is based on the availability of input-torque experimental signals that are pre-processed (resampled, filtered and segmented) and then learned by a statistical machine learning method. Four methods, spanning the main learning principles, are reviewed in a unified framework and compared using the torque estimation problem: linear least squares, linear and non-linear neural networks and support vector machines. It is found that a non-linear model structure is necessary for accurate torque estimation. The most efficient torque model built is a non-linear neural network that achieves about 2% test normalized mean square error in nominal conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This problem becomes even more evident in collaborative computing environments. PII may be hidden anywhere within the file system of a computer. As well, in the course of different activities, via collaboration or not, personally identifiable information may migrate from computer to computer. This makes meeting the organizational privacy requirements all the more complex. Our particular interest is to develop technology that would automatically discover workflow across organizational collaborators that would include private data. Since in this context, it is important to understand where and when the private data is discovered, in this paper, we focus on PII discovery, i.e. automatically identifying private data existant in semi-structured and unstructured (free text) documents. The first part of the process involves identifying PII via named entity recognition. The second part determines relationships between those entities based upon a supervised machine learning method. We present test results of our methods using publicly-available data generated from different collaborative activities to provide an assessment of scalability in cooperative computing environment.

Decision tree algorithm like C4.5 is very useful in the field of data mining or machine learning system. Because this is fast and deduces good result on the problem of classification. This paper proposes three methods using decision tree for solving a classification problem. Firstly, this paper suggest about the extended data expression for explaining, a classifier, Uchoo. Secondly, a classifier, UChoo is described Thirdly, this paper is to describe about rule generation. The rules expressed in the newly suggested method have almost the same information contents as compared with the original data set. The information is gotten from the sensors becomes large amount of data as the ubiquitous computation environment develops, therefore it is impossible to keep all information in memory,However. using suggested method. this problem is solved smoothly with having almost the information.

Boosting hosed technique use deterministic results of weak classifiers to compound them to a strong classifier while classifier can give class distribution as result. It involves losses of information. This problem can be solved by using prababilistic idea. In this case class distribution is used to compound classifiers. Probabilistic results compounding is presented in this paper applying to incremental learning. Probabilistic results expression is easily realized using extended data expression. Results of experiments show power when compare to Learn++, an incremental ensemble-based algorithm.

We use an inductive approach to automatically model linguistic politeness in online discussion groups and determine the impact of politeness on desired outcomes, such as increased reply rates. We describe differences in perceived politeness across a variety of groups and find that, controlling for group norms of responsiveness and message length, politeness increases reply rates in some technical groups, but rudeness is more effective in some political groups. The perceived politeness scores will be used to validate linguistic politeness strategies from theory and. to inform the creation of a machine learning model of linguistic politeness that can be applied as a "politeness checker" to educate newcomers to write in ways likely to elicit response from specific communities or as a rudeness detection tool for moderators.

They are used in a variety of areas and are among the most popular application fields in artificial intelligence. Expert systems have applications in different areas of medicine. Here we present a short history of medical expert systems and the characteristics of these systems. Medical expert systems were initially developed for academic areas and later for clinical applications also. Health care systems produce tremendous amounts of information (patient, demographic, clinical and billing data), which are susceptible to analysis by intelligent software and need new techniques to extract new knowledge. A variety of medical expert systems tools are available and can function as intelligent assistants to clinicians, helping in diagnostic processes, laboratory analysis, treatment protocol, and teaching of medical students and residents. A critical review of the strengths and limitations, as well as the latest trends in decision support systems, is discussed.

This process plays a significant role in the clearance and detoxification of many chemicals. Over the last decade the regulation and substrate profiles of UGT isoforms have been increasingly characterised. The resulting data has facilitated the prototyping of ligand based in silico models capable of predicting, and gaining insights into, binding affinity and the substrate- and regio-selectivity of glucuronidation by UGT isoforms. Pharmacophore modelling has produced particularly insightful models and quantitative structure-activity relationships based on machine learning algorithms result in accurate predictions. Simple structural chemical descriptors were found to capture much of the chemical information relevant to UGT metabolism. However, quantum chemical properties of molecules and the nucleophilic atoms in the molecule can enhance both the predictivity and chemical intuitiveness of structure-activity models. Chemical diversity analysis of known substrates has shown some bias towards chemicals with aromatic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. Future progress in in silico development will depend on larger and more diverse high quality metabolic datasets. Furthermore, improved protein structure data on UGTs will enable the application of structural modelling techniques likely leading to greater insight into the binding and reactive processes of UGT catalysed glucuronidation.

In particular, a truncated Euclidean similarity measure and a self-normalized similarity measure related to the Canberra distance. It is proved that they are positive semi-definite (p.s.d.), thus facilitating their use in kernel-based methods, like the Support Vector Machine, a very popular machine learning tool. These kernels may be better suited than standard kernels (like the RBF) in certain situations, that are described in the paper. Some rather general results concerning positivity properties are presented in detail as well as some interesting ways of proving the p.s.d. property.

A general class of kernel functions which incorporates known pattern invariances are invariant distance substitution (IDS) kernels. Instances such as tangent distance or dynamic time-warping kernels have demonstrated the real world applicability. This motivates the demand for investigating the elementary properties of the general IDS-kernels. In this paper we formally state and demonstrate their invariance properties, in particular the adjustability of the invariance in two conceptionally different ways. We characterize the definiteness of the kernels. We apply the kernels in different classification methods, which demonstrates various benefits of invariance.

The study assesses both misclassification error and model complexity on bootstrap replications of 18 different benchmark datasets. It is carried out in the R system for statistical computing, made possible by means of the RWeka package which interfaces R to the open-source machine learning toolbox Weka. Both algorithms are found to be competitive in terms of misclassification error-with the performance difference clearly varying across data sets. However, C4.5 tends to grow larger and thus more complex trees.

Support vector machines (SVM) are useful classification methods for credit client scoring. However, the urgent need to further boost classification performance as well as the stability of results in applications leads the machine learning community into developing SVM with multiple kernels and many other combined approaches. Using a data set from a German bank, we first examine the effects of combining a large number of base SVM on classification performance and robustness. The base models are trained on different sets of reduced client characteristics and may also use different kernels. Furthermore, using censored outputs of multiple SVM models leads to more reliable predictions in most cases. But there also remains a credit client subset that seems to be unpredictable. We show that in unbalanced data sets, most common in credit scoring, some minor adjustments may overcome this weakness. We then compare our results to the results obtained earlier with more traditional, single SVM credit scoring models.

Furthermore, the encoded information is static and has to be refined for newly emerging sight seeing objects, restaurants or hotels. Automatic acquisition can support and enhance the manual acquisition and can be implemented as a run-time approach to obtain information not encoded in the data or knowledge base of a tourist information system. In our work we apply unsupervised learning to the challenge of web-based address extraction from plain text data extracted from web pages dealing with locations and containing the addresses of those. The data is processed by an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger (Biemann, 2006a), which constructs domain-specific categories via distributional similarity of stop word contexts and neighboring content words. In the address domain, separate tags for street names, locations and other address parts can be observed. To extract the addresses, we apply a Conditional Random Field (CRF) on a labeled training set of addresses, using the unsupervised tags as features. Evaluation on a gold standard of correctly annotated data shows that unsupervised learning combined with state of the art machine learning is a viable approach to support web-based information extraction, as it results in improved extraction quality as compared to omitting the unsupervised tagger.

This paper presents a novel approach to systematic model selection through bilevel optimization. We show how modelling tasks for widely used machine learning methods can be formulated as bilevel optimization problems and describe how the approach can address a broad range of tasks-among which are parameter, feature and kernel selection In addition, we also discuss the challenges in implementing these approaches and enumerate opportunities for future work in this emerging research area.

The proposed algorithm is a two phase algorithm which combines a Multi-Swarm Constriction Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP algorithm for the solution of the clustering problem. In this paper in PSO: multiple swarms are used in order to give to the algorithm more exploration and exploitation abilities as the different swarms have the possibility to explore different parts of the solution space and, also, a constriction factor is used for controlling the behaviour of particles in each swarm. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other popular metaheuristic methods like classic genetic algorithms, tabu search, GRASP, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In order to assess Hie efficacy of the proposed algorithm, this methodology is evaluated on datasets from the UCl Machine Learning Repository. The high performance of the proposed algorithm is achieved as the algorithm gives very good results and in some instances the percentage of the corrected clustered samples is very high and is larger than 98%.

However, hypotheses computed by these methods are often considered difficult to understand. This could be an important drawback in fields such as data mining and knowledge discovery where comprehensibility is a main criterion. This paper aims to explore the area of trade-offs between accuracy and comprehensibility in ensemble machine learning methods by proposing a learning method that combines the accuracy of boosting algorithms with the comprehensibility of decision trees. The approach described in this paper avoids the voting scheme of boosting by computing simple classification rules from the boosting learning approach while achieving the accuracy of AdaBoost learning algorithm in a set of UCT datasets. The comprehensibility of the hypothesis is thus enhanced without any loss of accuracy.

Such reliability estimates may represent a decisive information in the risk-sensitive applications of machine learning (e.g. medicine, engineering, business), where they enable the users to distinguish between better and worse predictions. In this paper, we compare the sensitivity-based reliability estimates, developed in our previous work, with four other approaches, proposed or inspired by the ideas from the related work. The results, obtained using 5 regression models, indicate the potentials for the usage of the sensitivity-based and the local modeling approach, especially with the regression trees.

In particular, Bayesian networks are one machine learning technique that allows for reasoning with incomplete data, but training such networks on incomplete data may be a difficult task. Many methods were thus proposed to learn Bayesian network structure from incomplete data, based on multiple structure generation and scoring of their adequacy to the dataset. However, this kind of approaches may be time-consuming. Therefore we propose an efficient dependency analysis approach that uses a redefinition of probability calculation to take incomplete records into account while learning BN structure, without generating multiple possibilities. Some experiments on well-known benchmarks are described to show the validity of our proposal.

They arc represented by a set of B prototype examples, called support vectors, and their associated weights. To obtain a classification, a new example is compared to the support vectors. Both space to store a prediction model and time to provide a single classification scale as O(B). A problem with kernel perceptrons is that on noisy data the number of support vectors tends to grow without bounds with the number of training examples. To reduce the strain at computational resources, budget kernel perceptrons have been developed by upper bounding the number of support vectors. In this work, we propose a new budget algorithm that upper bounds the number of bits needed to store kernel perceptron. Setting the bitlength constraint could facilitate development of hardware and software implementations of kernel perceptrons on resource-limited devices such as microcontrollers. The proposed compressed kernel perceptron algorithm decides on the optimal tradeoff between number of support vectors and their bit precision. The algorithm was evaluated on several benchmark data sets and the results indicate that it can train highly accurate classifiers even when the available memory budget is below 1 Kbit. This promising result points to a possibility of implementing powerful learning algorithms even on the most resource-constrained computational devices.

An agent-based decision support system for wholesale electricity market	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision support software; agent-based approach; electricity market; machine learning	POWER INDUSTRY INTRODUCTION; MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; SPECIAL-ISSUE; ROUGH SETS; FRAMEWORK; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION	Application software has been developed for analyzing and understanding a dynamic price change in the US wholesale power market. Traders can use the software as an effective decision-making tool by modeling and simulating a power market. The software uses different features of a decision support system by creating a framework for assessing new trading strategies in a competitive electricity trading environment. The practicality of the software is confirmed by comparing its estimation accuracy with those of other methods (e.g., neural network and genetic algorithm). The software has been applied to a data set regarding the California electricity crisis in order to examine whether the learning (convergence) speed of traders is different between the two periods (before and during the crisis). Such an application confirms the validity of the proposed software. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chau, M; Chen, H				Chau, Michael; Chen, Hsinchun			A machine learning approach to web page filtering using content and structure analysis	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Web page classification; link analysis; machine learning; Web mining	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; MEDICAL INFORMATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; INTERNET; CLASSIFICATION	As the Web continues to grow, it has become increasingly difficult to search for relevant information using traditional search engines. Topic-specific search engines provide an alternative way to support efficient information retrieval on the Web by providing more precise and customized searching in various domains. However, developers of topic-specific search engines need to address two issues: how to locate relevant documents (URLs) on the Web and how to filter out irrelevant documents from a set of documents collected from the Web. This paper reports our research in addressing the second issue. We propose a machine-learning-based approach that combines Web content analysis and Web structure analysis. We represent each Web page by a set of content-based and link-based features, which can be used as the input for various machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach was implemented using both a feedforward/backpropagation neural network and a support vector machine. Two experiments were designed and conducted to compare the proposed Web-feature approach with two existing Web page filtering methods - a keyword-based approach and a lexicon-based approach. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach in general performed better than the benchmark approaches, especially when the number of training documents was small. The proposed approaches can be applied in topic-specific search engine development and other Web applications such as Web content management. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Weibull analysis is the process of discovering the trends in product or system failure data, and using them to predict future failures in similar situations. Support Vector Regression is a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, which has been applied successfully to solve forecasting problems in many fields. In this paper, support vector regression is used to build a parameter estimating model for Weibull distribution. Numerical examples are presented to show good performance of this method.

The classifier was trained and tested on broadcast news material provided by VRT (Flemish Radio and Television Network). Several feature sets and machine learning algorithms have been tested, providing choices of speed and performance for a target system. The audio classifier is part of a greater system that together with visual data can retrieve information from news broadcasts: speech can be converted to text and the speaker can be recognized. Music can be further used for genre classification, jingle recognition or copyright infringement detection. Silence is recognized and used to provide cues on topic changes or speaker turns. At this point everything that is not classified as speech, music or silence is labeled garbage. Garbage classes can be further used for background categorization giving information on the environment where someone speaks (an anchor in the studio or a reporter in the street).

The analysis results provide sentiment orientations in multiple perspectives, each focusing on a specific aspect of the reviewed entity. Sentiment classification in multiple perspectives can provide more comprehensive sentiment analysis for applications like sentiment ranking and rating. By utilizing information extraction techniques such as entity extraction, co-referencing and pronoun resolution, the review texts are segmented into sections where each section discusses particular aspect of the reviewed entity. For each section of sentences, Support Vector Machine (SVM) using vectors of terms is applied to determine sentiment orientation toward the target aspect.

The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach for sentiment classification of movie reviews.	[Thet, Tun Thura; Na, Jin-Cheon; Khoo, Christopher S.

In this work, we address this problem in the context of references to persons as they are found in bibliographic data, specifically in the case of consolidating multiple datasets. Or solution follows the extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) process, typical in data warehouses. It computes the similarities of the attribute values for the references, and employs a decision tree to decide when the references match. We describe the characteristics of these references within bibliographic datasets, and how we explored those characteristics by developing new similarity metrics to improve the quality of the consolidation process. We evaluated our work by designing an experiment with data from four national libraries. The results show that the proposed similarity metrics contribute significantly to the consolidation process.

In particular, universal steganalysis, not limited to attacking a specific steganographic tool, is of extensive interests due to its practicality. Recently, splicing detection, another important area in digital forensics has attracted increasing attention. Is there any relationship between steganalysis and splicing detection? Is it possible to apply universal steganalysis methodologies to splicing detection? In this paper, we address these intact and yet interesting questions. Our analysis and experiments have demonstrated that, on the one hand, steganography and splicing have different goals and strategies, hence, generally causing different statistical artifacts on images. However, on the other hand, both of them make the touched (stego or spliced) image different from the corresponding original (natural) image. Therefore, natural image model based on a set of carefully selected statistical features under the machine learning framework can be used for steganalysis and splicing detection. It is shown in this paper that some successful universal steganalytic schemes can make promising progress in splicing detection if applied properly. A more advanced natural image model developed from these state-of-the-art steganalysis methods is thereafter presented. Furthermore, a concrete implementation of the proposed model is applied to the Columbia Image Splicing Detection Evaluation Dataset, which has achieved an accuracy of 92%, indicating a significant advancement in splicing detection.

In this article, we propose a formalization that underlies the key concepts of many such paradigms and discuss their relevance to scientific discovery; with the aim of assessing what scientists can expect from machines designed to assist them in their quest for the discovery of valid laws. re illustrate the formalization on several variations of a card game; and highlight the differences that paradigms impose on learners, as well as the assumptions they make on the nature of the learning process. We then use the formalization to describe a multi-agent interaction protocol; that has been inspired by these paradigms and that has been validated recently on solve groups of agents. Finally, we propose extensions to this protocol.

We study this problem using machine learning principles, and introduce the novel task of active k-optimization. The problem consists of approximating the k best instances with regard to an unknown function and the learner is active, that is, it can present a limited number of instances to an oracle for obtaining the target value. We also develop an algorithm based on Gaussian processes for tackling active k-optimization, and evaluate it on a challenging set of tasks related to structure-activity relationship prediction.

The application we focus on is drug discovery. Although graphs have become very popular for the representation of molecules, a lot of operations on graphs are NP-complete. Representing the molecules as outerplanar graphs, a subclass within general graphs, and rising the block-and-bridge preserving subgraph isomorphism, we define a metric and we present an algorithm for computing it in polynomial time. We evaluate this metric and more generally also the block-and-bridge preserving matching operator on a large dataset of molecules, obtaining favorable results.

Exploring use of images in clinical articles for decision support in evidence-based medicine	DOCUMENT RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL XV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Document Recognition and Retrieval XV	JAN 29-31, 2008	San Jose, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE			TEXT	Essential information is often conveyed pictorially (images, illustrations, graphs, charts, etc.) in biomedical publications. A clinician's decision to access the full text when searching for evidence in support of clinical decision is frequently based solely on a short bibliographic reference. We seek to automatically augment these references with images from the article that may assist in finding evidence. In a previous study, the feasibility of automatically classifying images by usefulness (utility) in finding evidence was explored using supervised machine learning and achieved 84.3% accuracy using image captions for modality and 76.6% accuracy combining captions and image data for utility on 743 images from articles over 2 years from a clinical journal. Our results indicated that automatic augmentation of bibliographic references with relevant images was feasible. Other research in this area has determined improved user experience by showing images in addition to the short bibliographic reference. Multi-panel images used in our study had to be manually pre-processed for image analysis, however. Additionally, all image-text on figures was ignored. In this article, we report on developed methods for automatic multi-panel image segmentation using not only image features, but also clues from text analysis applied to figure captions. In initial experiments on 516 figure images we obtained 95.54% accuracy in correctly identifying and segmenting the sub-images. The errors were flagged as disagreements with automatic parsing of figure caption text allowing for supervised segmentation. For localizing text and symbols, on a randomly selected test set of 100 single panel images our methods reported, on the average, precision and recall of 78.42% and 89.38%, respectively, with an accuracy of 72.02%.

Word segmentation of off-line handwritten documents	DOCUMENT RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL XV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Document Recognition and Retrieval XV	JAN 29-31, 2008	San Jose, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		word segmentation; handwritten document processing; document analysis		Word segmentation is the most critical pre-processing step for any handwritten document recognition and/or retrieval system. When the writing style is unconstrained (written in a natural manner), recognition of individual components may be unreliable, so they must be grouped together into word hypotheses before recognition algorithms can be used. This paper describes a gap metrics based machine learning approach to separate a line of unconstrained handwritten text into words. Our approach uses a set of both local and global features, which is motivated by the ways in which human beings perform this kind of task. In addition, in order to overcome the disadvantage of different distance computation methods, we propose a combined distance measure computed using three different methods. The classification is done by using a three-layer neural network.

Such a mapping has several applications in fields ranging from machine learning where large quantities of truth data are required for evaluating handwriting recognition algorithms, to data mining where word image indexes are used in ranked retrieval of scanned documents in a digital library. The alignment also aids "writer identity" verification algorithms. Interfaces which display scanned handwritten documents may use this alignment to highlight manuscript tokens when a person examines the corresponding transcript word. We propose an adaptation of the True DTW dynamic programming algorithm for English handwritten documents. The integration of the dissimilarity scores from a word-model word recognizer and Levenshtein distance between the recognized word and lexicon word, as a cost metric in the DTW algorithm leading to a fast and accurate alignment, is our primary contribution. Results provided, confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

In astrophysics there is ample experience dealing with large data sets due to an increasing number of measurement instruments. The problem of digitization of historical documents of the Dutch cultural heritage is a similar problem. This paper discusses the. use of a system developed at the Kapteyn Institute of Astrophysics for the processing of large data sets, applied to the problem of creating a very large searchable archive of connected cursive handwritten texts. The system is adapted to the specific needs of processing document images.

Because the DANs are sparsely-located in the articles, we take a hierarchical approach. The HTML journal articles are first segmented into zones according to text and geometric features. The zones are then classified as DAN zones or other zones by an SVM classifier. A set of heuristic rules are applied on the candidate DAN zones to extract DANs according to their edit distances to the DAN formats. An evaluation shows that the proposed method can achieve a very high recall rate (above 99%) and a significantly better precision rate compared to extraction through brute force regular expression matching.

J	Klimek, P				Klimek, Petr			Data mining with clustering	E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT			Czech	Article						data mining; clustering; nearest neighbour method; dendrogram		Data mining is a new discipline lying at the interface of statistics, database technology, pattern recognition, machine learning, and other areas. It is concerned with the secondary analysis of large databases in order to find previously unsuspected relationships which are of interest or value to the database owners. There are two keys to success in data mining. First is coming up with a precise formulation of the problem you are trying to solve. A focused statement usually results in the best payoff. The second key is using the right data. After choosing from the data available to you, or perhaps buying external data, you may need to transform and combine it in significant ways. New problems arise, partly as a consequence of the sheer size of the data sets involved, and partly because of issues of pattern matching. However, since statistics provides the intellectual glue underlying the effort, it is important for statisticians to become involved. There are very real opportunities for statisticians to make significant contributions. The main definition of data mining and the special data mining tasks are mentioned in the first part of this paper, The data mining problem was also discussed in previous issues of E+M. One method (clustering) was chosen to be a subject of this article. One of the opportunities to gain knowledge from data is a use of clustering analysis. Clustering analysis belongs to unsupervised methods of data mining. We put here a focus on this method. Some basic principles are described in the second part of this paper. This method is examined on two examples from the marketing field In the first example is used software Statgraphics 5.0Plus (www.statgraphics.com) to solve clustering problem (nearest neighbour algorithm and Eucleidian distance), and in the second example is used Statistica 6.0Cz software (from Statoft, Inc., www.statsoft.com or www.statsoft.cz). But the building models is only one step in knowledge discovery. It is vital to property collect and prepare the data, and to check the models against the real world. The "best" model is often found after building models of several different types, or by trying different technologies or algorithms.

For large advertisers, these phrases often come from quasi-algorithmically generated lists of thousands of terms prone to poor linguistic construction. A bidded term by itself is usually unsuitable for direct insertion into an ad copy template; it must be rephrased and capitalized properly to fit the template, possibly with additional language to avoid semantic ambiguity. We develop a natural language generation system to automate these steps, preparing a list of terms for insertion into an ad template. For each input term, our system first finds a proper word ordering by mining a corpus of Web search query logs. Next it determines whether the term is ambiguous and-if semantics dictate-attaches a clarifying modifier culled from query logs. Finally, it applies proper capitalization by analyzing pages from Web search engine results. Each step yields a plausible set of displayable forms from which a machine-learned model selects the best. The models are trained and tested on a large set of human-labeled data. The overall system significantly outperforms baseline systems that use simple heuristics.

One natural type of question that can be asked in network analysis is "Given two sets R and T of individuals in a graph with complete and missing knowledge, respectively, about a property of interest, which individuals in T are closest to R with respect to this property?". To answer this question, we can rank the individuals in T such that the individuals ranked highest are most likely to exhibit the property of interest. Several methods based on weighted paths in the graph and Markov chain models have been proposed to solve this task. In this paper, we show that we can improve previously published approaches by rephrasing this problem as the task of property prediction in graph-structured data from positive examples, the individuals in R, and unlabelled data, the individuals in T, and applying an inexpensive iterative neighbourhood's majority vote based prediction algorithm ("iNMV") to this task. We evaluate our iNMV prediction algorithm and two previously proposed methods using Markov chains on three real world graphs in terms of ROC AUC statistic. iNMV obtains rankings that are either significantly better or not significantly worse than the rankings obtained from the more complex Markov chain based algorithms, while achieving a reduction in run time of one order of magnitude on large graphs.

Machine learning has long ago been proposed as a way to alleviate this problem. Machine learning usually helps the domain expert to uncover some of the more tacit concepts. However, the learned concepts are often hard to understand and hard to extend. A common view is that a combination of a domain expert and machine learning would yield the best results. Recently, argument based machine learning (ABML) has been introduced as a combination of argumentation and machine learning. Through argumentation, ABML enables the expert to articulate his knowledge easily and in a very natural way. ABML, was shown to significantly improve the comprehensibility and accuracy of the learned concepts. This makes ABML a most natural tool for constructing a knowledge base. The present paper shows how this is accomplished through a case study of building a knowledge base of an expert system used in a chess tutoring application.

We propose an intelligent monitoring system that makes use of many artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural networks for temporal abstraction, temporal reasoning, model based diagnosis, decision rule based system for adaptivity and machine learning for knowledge acquisition. To tackle the difficulty of taking context change into account, we introduce a pilot aiming at adapting the system behavior by reconfiguring or tuning the parameters of the system modules. A prototype has been implemented and is currently experimented and evaluated. Some results, showing the benefits of the approach, are given.

This device can react to a gas Substance by providing signals that can be analyzed to classify the input. It is composed of a sensor array (6 MOS sensors, in our case) and a pattern classification process based on machine learning techniques. During the first phase of our research, we have evaluated the possibility and accuracy of lung cancer diagnosis by classifying the olfactory signal associated to exhalations Of Subjects. The second part of the research, still in progress, is aimed at assessing the possibility of discriminating also the different types and stages of the disease. At the end of the first phase, results have been very satisfactory and promising: we achieved an average accuracy of 92.6%, sensitivity of 95.3% and specificity of 90.5%. In particular we analyzed the breath of 101 individuals, of which 58 control subjects, and 43 suffer from different types of lung cancer (primary and not) at different stages. In order to find the components able to discriminate between the two classes 'healthy' and 'sick' at best, and to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, we have extracted the most significant features and projected them into a lower dimensional space using Non Parametric Linear Discriminant Analysis. Finally, we have used these features as input to several supervised pattern classification algorithms, based on different k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) approaches (classic, modified and Fuzzy k-NN), linear and quadratic discriminant classifiers and on a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). The observed results have all been validated using cross-validation. These results pushed us to begin the second phase of the project to investigate the possibility of early lung cancer diagnosis: we are involving it larger number of subjects, partioned in different classes according to the type and stage of the disease. The research demonstrates that the electronic nose is a promising alternative to current lung cancer diagnostic techniques: the obtained predictive errors are lower than those achieved by present diagnostic methods, and the cost of the analysis, both in money, time and resources, is lower. The introduction of this technology will lead to very important social and business effects: its low price and small dimensions allow a large scale distribution, giving the opportunity to perform non invasive, cheap, quick, and massive early diagnosis and screening.

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based oil measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the trees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%.

Based on the concept of Thai character cluster, a Thai running text is preliminarily segmented into a sequence of inseparable units, called TCCs. To enable the handling of a large-scaled text, a sorted sistring (or suffix array) is applied to calculate a number of statistics of each TCC. Using these statistics, we applied three alternative supervised machine learning techniques, naive Bayes, centroid-based and k-NN, to learn classifiers for keyword identification. Our method is evaluated using a medical text extracted from WWW. The result showed that k-NN achieves the highest performance of 79.5% accuracy.

The word segmentation approaches could be classified into distinct types, dictionary based (DCB) and machine learning based (MLB). The DCB approach relies on a set of terms for parsing and segmenting input texts. Whereas the MLB approach relies on a model trained from a corpus by using machine learning techniques. We compare between two algorithms from the DCB approach: longest-matching and maximal matching, and four algorithms from the MLB approach: Naive Bayes (NB), decision free, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Conditional Random Field (CRF). From (he experimental results, the DCB approach yielded better performance than the NB, decision tree and SVM algorithms from the MLB approach. However, the best performance was obtained from the CRF algorithm with the precision and recall of 95.79% and 94.98%, respectively.

Experiments were conducted in two introductory-undergraduate programming courses to examine the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis and assessment tools. The learners' work including the source code and comments were processed by the proposed text mining and machine learning techniques. This system also provides immediate feedback and high-quality evaluation results to guide the learners with poor performance.

Linear discriminant analysis was the best method and next multilayer perceptron neural networks provided that the data was input into a network in the form of principal components. Nearest neighbour searching, k-means clustering and Kohonen neural networks achieved almost as good results as the former, but decision trees slightly worse. Thus, these methods fared well, but Naive Bayes rule could not be used since some data matrices were singular. Otoneurological cases subject to the six diseases given can be reliably distinguished.

However, before they can be used in real clinical situations, these systems must be extensively tested, to ensure that they conform to the clinical guidelines (CG) on which they are based. Existing methods cannot be used for the systematic testing of all possible test cases. We describe here a new exhaustive dynamic verification method. fit this method, the DSS is considered to be a black box, and the Quinlan C4.5 algorithm is used to build a decision tree from an exhaustive set of DSS input vectors and outputs. This method was successfully used for the testing of a medical DSS relating to chronic diseases: the ASTI critiquing module for type 2 diabetes.

This paper proposes utilisation of Machine Learning methods in the field of financial praxis. Two modelling approaches - enhanced Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and back propagation Neural network - were employed for CZK/EUR exchange rate forecasting. Predictions were used for financial management decision simulation of a virtual company and the results indicate, that machine learning proved to be useful source of information in the area. This implies that the proposed modelling approaches can be used as a feasible solution for exchange rate forecasting in exchange rate management.

By employing the estimation results, agents can modify their negotiation strategies in order to achieve an agreement much quicker or to gain higher benefits. Some of estimation strategies have been proposed by researchers, and most of them are based on machine learning mechanisms. However the machine learning based approach may not work well in some open and dynamic domains for the reasons of (1) lacking of sufficient data to train the system, and (2) requesting plenty of resources in each training process. Furthermore, because the estimation results may have errors, so single result maybe not accurate and practical enough in most situations. In order to address these issues mentioned above, we propose a quadratic regression analysis approach to predict partners' behaviors in this paper. The proposed approach is based only on the history of the offers during the current negotiation and does not require any training process in advance. This approach can estimate an interval of behaviors according to an accuracy requirement. The experimental results illustrate that by employing the proposed mechanism, agents can gain more accurate estimation results on partners' behaviors by comparing with other two estimation functions.

However, the standard SVM can not select variables automatically and therefore its solution typically utilizes all the input variables without discrimination. This makes it difficult to identify important predictor variables, which is often one of the primary goals in data analysis. In this paper, we propose two novel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM) for simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally requires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax rule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize its importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with different functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to a penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we propose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on different variables according to their relative importance. Both types of regularization automate variable selection in the process of building classifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced interpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low sample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy implementation via standard linear programming. Several simulated examples and one real gene data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the adaptive supnorm penalty in various data settings.

Activity recognition plays an important role in mobile and ubiquitous computing both as a goal in itself and as an intermediate task in the design of advanced applications. Virtually all existing activity, recognition systems for mobile phones base their predictions on location cues. This approach forces the user to disclose personal information such as her home or work area. In this paper we present a novel activity recognition system called TRAcME (Temporal Recognition of ACtivities for Mobile Environments) which recognises generic human activities from large windows of context, Allen's temporal relations and anonymous landmarks. Unlike existing systems. TRAcME handles simultaneous activities and outputs activities which are consistent with each other at the scale of a user's day.

J	Deng, G; Ng, WY				Deng, Guang; Ng, Wai-Yin			Iterative estimation algorithms using conjugate function lower bound and minorization-maximization with applications in image denoising	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; BIVARIATE SHRINKAGE; VARIABLE SELECTION; SCALE MIXTURES; MM ALGORITHMS; WAVELET; REGULARIZATION; SPARSE; DECONVOLUTION	A fundamental problem in signal processing is to estimate signal from noisy observations. This is usually formulated as an optimization problem. Optimizations based on variational lower bound and minorization-maximization have been widely used in machine learning research, signal processing, and statistics. In this paper, we study iterative algorithms based on the conjugate function lower bound (CFLB) and minorization-maximization ( MM) for a class of objective functions. We propose a generalized version of these two algorithms and show that they are equivalent when the objective function is convex and differentiable. We then develop a CFLB/MM algorithm for solving the MAP estimation problems under a linear Gaussian observation model. We modify this algorithm for wavelet-domain image denoising. Experimental results show that using a single wavelet representation the performance of the proposed algorithms makes better than that of the bishrinkage algorithm which is arguably one of the best in recent publications. Using complex wavelet representations, the performance of the proposed algorithm is very competitive with that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. Copyright (c) 2008.

J	Forestier, G; Wemmert, C; Gancarski, P				Forestier, Germain; Wemmert, Cedric; Gancarski, Pierre			Multisource images analysis using collaborative clustering	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							DECISION FUSION; CLASSIFICATION	The development of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has produced a huge amount of data. The multiplication of satellites which embed different types of sensors provides a lot of heterogeneous images. Consequently, the image analyst has often many different images available, representing the same area of the Earth surface. These images can be from different dates, produced by different sensors, or even at different resolutions. The lack of machine learning tools using all these representations in an overall process constraints to a sequential analysis of these various images. In order to use all the information available simultaneously, we propose a framework where different algorithms can use different views of the scene. Each one works on a different remotely sensed image and, thus, produces different and useful information. These algorithms work together in a collaborative way through an automatic and mutual refinement of their results, so that all the results have almost the same number of clusters, which are statistically similar. Finally, a unique result is produced, representing a consensus among the information obtained by each clustering method on its own image. The unified result and the complementarity of the single results (i.e., the agreement between the clustering methods as well as the disagreement) lead to a better understanding of the scene. The experiments carried out on multispectral remote sensing images have shown that this method is efficient to extract relevant information and to improve the scene understanding.

The GPs framework can be used to solve both classification (GPC) and regression (GPR) problems. The minimum mean squared error solution is the expectation of the transmitted symbol given the information at the receiver, which is a nonlinear function of the received symbols for discrete inputs. GPR can be presented as a nonlinear MMSE estimator and thus capable of achieving optimal performance from MMSE viewpoint. Also, the design of digital communication receivers can be viewed as a detection problem, for which GPC is specially suited as it assigns posterior probabilities to each transmitted symbol. We explore the suitability of GPs as nonlinear digital communication receivers. GPs are Bayesian machine learning tools that formulates a likelihood function for its hyperparameters, which can then be set optimally. GPs outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear machine learning approaches that prespecify their hyperparameters or rely on cross validation. We illustrate the advantages of GPs as digital communication receivers for linear and nonlinear channel models for short training sequences and compare them to state-of-the-art nonlinear machine learning tools, such as support vector machines.

J	Sajn, L; Kononenko, I				Sajn, Luka; Kononenko, Igor			Multiresolution image parametrization for improving texture classification	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ASSOCIATION RULES; FEATURES; SEGMENTATION; SCALE; MODEL	In the paper an innovative alternative to automatic image parametrization on multiple resolutions, based on texture description with specialized association rules, and image evaluation with machine learning methods is presented. The algorithm ArTex for parameterizing textures with association rules belonging to structural parametrization algorithms was developed. In order to improve the classification accuracy a multiresolution approach is used. The algorithm ARes for finding more informative resolutions based on the SIFT algorithm is described. The presented algorithms are evaluated on several public domains and the results are compared to other well-known parametrization algorithms belonging to statistical and spectral parametrization algorithms. Significant improvement of classification results was observed when combining parametrization attributes at several image resolutions for most parametrization algorithms. Our results show that multiresolution image parametrization should be considered when improvement of classification accuracy in textural domains is required. These resolutions have to be selected carefully and may depend on the domain itself. Copyright (C) 2008.

Since radio propagation characteristics vary in different environments, knowing the environment of the mobile user is essential for accurate Received Signal Strength- (RSS-) based location estimation. The key feature of our method is its capability to estimate the environment of the mobile user using machine learning techniques and to utilize this information for enhancing RSS-based distance calculations. The proposed algorithm, namely, EARBALE, has been evaluated using field measurements collected from a GSM network in diverse geographic locations. Our approach turns out to be significantly beneficial, enhancing estimation accuracy, and thereby enabling high-performance mobile positioning in a practical and cost-effective manner. Additionally, it is computationally light-weight and can be integrated onto any RSS- based algorithm as an enhancement add-on. Copyright (C) 2008 Onur Turkyilmaz et al.

Mobility management has widely been recognized as one of the most challenging problems for seamless access to wireless networks. In this paper, a novel link enhancement mechanism is proposed to deal with mobility management problem in vehicular ad hoc networks. Two machine learning techniques, namely, particle swarm optimization and fuzzy logic systems, are incorporated into the proposed schemes to enhance the accuracy of prediction of link break and congestion occurrence.

Classification of estrogen receptor-beta ligands on the basis of their binding affinities using support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						classification; estrogen receptor-beta; linear discriminant analysis; support vector machine; the heuristic method	SPECTROMETRIC DATA; BREAST-CANCER; HIGHLY POTENT; C-13 NMR; ALPHA; QSAR; TRANSCRIPTION; SUPERFAMILY; DERIVATIVES; MODULATORS	Classification models of estrogen receptor-beta ligands were proposed using linear and nonlinear models. The data set was divided into active and inactive classes on the basis of their binding affinities. The two-class problem (active, inactive) was firstly explored by linear classifier approach, linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In order to get a more accurate prediction model, the nonlinear novel machine learning technique, support vectors machine (SVM), was subsequently used to investigate. The heuristic method (HM) was used to pre-select the whole descriptor sets. The model containing eight descriptors founded by SVM, showed better predictive ability than LDA. The accuracy in prediction for the training, test and overall data sets are 92.9%, 85.8% and 91.4% for SVM, 83.1%, 76.1% and 81.9% for LDA, respectively. The results indicate that SVM can be used as a powerful modeling tool for QSAR studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Luan, F.; Liu, H.

We therefore propose a new approach that relies only on more general language structures such as parsing and dependency information for the construction of feature vectors that can be used by standard machine learning algorithms in deciding whether a sentence describes a protein interaction or not. As our approach is not dependent on the use of specific interaction keywords, it is applicable to heterogeneous corpora. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that our method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art algorithms for the extraction of protein interactions.

Development and evaluation of an open-ended computational evolution system for the genetic analysis of susceptibility to common human diseases	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING IN BIOINFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	6th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics	MAR 26-28, 2008	Naples, ITALY				EPISTASIS; COMPLEXITY	An important goal of human genetics is to identify DNA sequence variations that are predictive of susceptibility to common human diseases. This is a classification problem with data consisting of discrete attributes and a binary outcome. A variety of different machine learning methods based on artificial evolution have been developed and applied to modeling the relationship between genotype and phenotype. While artificial evolution approaches show promise, they are far from perfect and are only loosely based on real biological and evolutionary processes. It has recently been suggested that a new paradigm is needed where "artificial evolution" is transformed to "computational evolution" (CE) by incorporating more biological and evolutionary complexity into existing algorithms. It has been proposed that CE systems will be more likely to solve problems of interest to biologists and biomedical researchers. The goal of the present study was to develop and evaluate a prototype CE system for the analysis of human genetics data. We describe here this new open-ended CE system and provide initial results from a simulation study that suggests more complex operators result in better solutions.

These measurements are represented by the expression levels of thousands of genes in normal and tumor sample tissues. In this paper we present a two-phase algorithm for gene expression data classification. In the first phase, a novel gene selection method based on mixed-integer optimization is applied with the aim of selecting a small subset of cancer marker genes. In the second phase, a binary polyhedral classifier is used in order to label gene expression data. Computational experiments performed on three benchmark datasets indicate the usefulness of the proposed framework which is capable of competitive performances with respect to the best classification accuracy so far achieved for each dataset. Moreover, the classification rules generated are based on very few genes which, in our computations, can be credited as the most influential genes for tumor differentiation.

Statistical learning studies of pseudo folding pathways	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING IN BIOINFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	6th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics	MAR 26-28, 2008	Naples, ITALY				QUALITY	Many algorithms that attempt to predict proteins' native structure from sequence need to generate a large set of hypotheses in order to ensure that nearly correct structures are included, leading to the problem of assessing the quality of alternative 3D conformations. This problem has been mostly approached by focusing on the final 3D conformation, with machine learning techniques playing a leading role. We argue in this paper that additional information for recognising native-like structures can be obtained by regarding the final conformation as the result of a generative process reminiscent of the folding process that generates structures in nature. We introduce a coarse representation of protein pseudo-folding based on binary trees and introduce a kernel function for assessing their similarity. Kernel-based analysis techniques empirically demonstrate a significant correlation between information contained into pseudo-folding trees and features of native folds in a large and non-redundant set of proteins.

ISCLEs uses the machine learning technique of boosting, which does importance sampling of "weak learners" to create all overall circuit ensemble. In ISCLEs, the weak learners are circuit topologies with near-minimal transistor sizes. In each boosting round, first a new weak learner topology and sizings are found via genetic programming-based "MOJITO" multi-topology optimization, then it is combined with previous learners into all ensemble. and finally the weak-learning target is updated. Results are shown for the trustworthy synthesis of a sinusoidal function generator, and a 3-bit A/D converter.

Other types of cancers may spread to the lungs from other organs. However, these are not lung cancers because they did not start in the lungs. It is evident that usage of machine learning methods in disease diagnosis has been increasing gradually. In this study, diagnosis of lung cancer, which is a very common and important disease, was conducted with such a machine learning system. In this study, we have detected on lung cancer using principles component analysis (PCA), fuzzy weighting pre-processing and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). The approach system has three stages. First, dimension of lung cancer dataset that has 57 features is reduced to four features using principles component analysis. Second, a new weighting scheme based on fuzzy weighting pre-processing was utilized as a pre-processing step before the main classifier. Third, artificial immune recognition system was our used classifier. We took the lung cancer dataset used in our study from the UCI machine learning database. The obtained classification accuracy of our system was 100% and it was very promising with regard to the other classification applications in literature for this problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, DC; Yeh, CW				Li, Der-Chang; Yeh, Chun-Wu			A non-parametric learning algorithm for small manufacturing data sets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						trend and potency function; small data sets; non-parametric learning; machine learning	TIME-SERIES; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM; SIMULATION; MODELS	Nowadays the manufacturing environment changes promptly owing to globalization and innovation. It is noteworthy that the life cycle of products consequently becomes shorter and shorter. Although data mining techniques are widely employed by researchers to extract proper management information from the data, scarce data can only be obtained in the early stages of a manufacturing system. From the view of machine learning, the size of training data significantly influences the learning accuracies. Learning based on limited experience will be a tough task. On account of the cause, this research systematically estimates the data behavior such as the trend and potency to capture the dependency within a sequence of time series data. It should also be added that the analyzed data in this article are dependent examples that come from different populations. This research proposes a non-parametric learning algorithm instead of using parametric statistics for small-data-set learning. The proposed algorithm named the trend and potency tracking method (TPTM) attempts to explore the predictive information through the generation of trend and potency (TP) value of each datum. The extra information extracted from the data trend and potency proves that it can speed up stabilizing the learning task and can dynamically improve the derived knowledge from the occurrence of the latest data.

One drawback in using an NNTree is that the system may become very complicated if the dimensionality of the feature space is high. To avoid this problem, we propose in this paper to reduce the dimensionality first using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and then induce the NNTree. After dimensionality reduction, the NNTree can become much more simpler. The question is, can we still get good NNTrees in the lower dimensional feature space? To answer this question, we conducted experiments on several public databases. Results show that the NNTree obtained after dimensionality reduction usually has less number of nodes, and the performance is comparable with the one obtained without dimensionality reduction.

The approach used both the labeled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-DNA complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. The evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices and several new descriptors. The sequence-derived features were used to train random forests, which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. The use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RF classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset. The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies.

Students receive the necessary mathematical and theoretical foundation in lecture format. The final learning experience may require that students create and code their own fuzzy logic application that solves a real world problem. This can be an issue when the target is a Bioengineering course that introduces classical control theory, fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms and genetic programming through the use of a low cost robot, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) handheld computer, and custom PDA software. In this course, the concepts and theories discussed in lecture are reinforced and extended in a corresponding laboratory through the use of wireless robots and PDAs. Fuzzy logic libraries and software modules for laptops and desktop computers are readily available, however, when it comes to handheld computers no such libraries exist. Students are able to spend more time experimenting with different fuzzy logic controllers when a custom fuzzy logic library and PDA graphical user interface are utilized. In this paper we introduce and discuss a unique low cost wireless robot, a custom fuzzy logic library, a custom fuzzy logic GUI for the PDA, and the implementation results for the fuzzy logic section in a newly created Bioengineering course. Diagnostic and summative assessment in the form of a pretest and post-test was administered for each section of the course, however, only the results for the fuzzy logic section will be provided.

Bayesian networks provide a human readable model of correlations in large data sets, which enables researchers to improve their understanding of the data without preconceptions. We compare the results of our learned structures with human expectations and interpretation of the data as well as with cross-validation an the data. The average Area Under the Curve of the networks using cross-validation was 0.6. The domain experts believe the methodology of automatically learning such structures is promising and we are continuing to improve the structure learning process.

Feature selection is effective in reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant data, increasing learning accuracy and efficiency. In this paper we propose a new information distance to measure the relevancy of two features. Unlike the information measure in previous feature selection works, our proposed information distance meets the condition of triangle inequality. We use InfoDist to feature selection and the experimental results showed it has a better performance.

Since it can provide faster and cost-effective learning machine and also improve the prediction performance of the predictors, it is a crucial step in machine learning. The feature selection methods using support machine have obtained satisfactory results, but the noises and outliers often reduce the performance. In this paper, we propose a feature selection approach based on nonlinear fuzzy support vector machine, in which the fuzzy membership is calculated in the feature space and is represented by kernels. This method gives good performance on reducing the effects of outliers and improves the results of feature selection.

It can improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of data mining by reducing the dimensions of feature space and removing the irrelevant and redundant information. In this paper we transform the attribute selection problem into the optimization problem which tries to find the attribute subset with the maximal fractal dimension and the attribute number restriction simultaneously. In order to avoid exhaustive search in the huge attribute subset space we integrate the individual attribute priority with attribute subset evaluation for dimensionality reduction and propose the unsupervised Sequential Forward Fractal Dimensionality Reduction(SFFDR) algorithm. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the algorithm proposed can get the satisfied resulting attribute subset with a rather low time complexity.

Learning systems tend to be biased towards the majority class and thus have poor generalization for the minority class instances. This paper analyses the imbalance problem in accuracy-based learning classifier systems. In particular, we propose a novel approach based on XCS classifier system and cost-sensitive learning. In our approach, the reward value of correctly identifying the positive (rare) class outweighs the value of correctly identifying the common class. This research provides guidelines to set reward base on the dataset imbalance ratio and a method to calculate reward online base on the information collected by XCS during training is also proposed. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets show that, with appropriate reward settings, XCS is robust to class imbalances.

A novel method, substituting data mining modeling for original theoretical modeling, is proposed creatively in this paper, attempting to solve the problem by machine learning theory. Data mining modeling is to construct "EM scattering training model", applying regression analysis algorithm on measurement data, to achieve the effect superior to that theoretical modeling can have.

As a filter solution, the algorithm can evaluate the weight of each feature by calculating the spatial coverage relations of features of instances with the same and different class labels in multidimensional data space. And the approach is simple to implement. The experimental results evaluated on some public data set downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository show that the proposed method compares well with some classical feature selection methods such as Relief and SVAMttributeEval which are implemented in Weka.

However, the training complexity of SVM is highly dependent on the size of a data set. A preprocessing Support Vector Machines (PSVM) method for large-scale data set classification is presented to speed up SVM training. By analyzing the neighbor classification feature for each sample in training data set, a decision criterion was built to keep or delete this sample from the original data set without losing the classification. The new method can provide an SVM with high quality samples. Experiments with random data and UCI databases show that SVM with our new preprocessing method retains the high quality of training data set and the classification accuracy very well.

A spatial overlapping based hierarchical clustering method SOHC was also developed and implemented aimed to justify the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure. SOHC works well both in low-dimensional and high-dimensional datasets, and is able to cluster arbitrary shape of clusters. Moreover, it can work for both numerical and categorical attributes in a uniform way. Experimental results carried out on some public datasets collected from the UCI machine learning repository and predictive toxicology domain show that SOHC is a promising clustering method in data mining.

However, the approach also suffers from one major deficiency: a training data set often generates a huge set of rules. It is challenging to store, retrieve, prune and sort a large number of rules efficiently for classification, especially on dense databases. In this study, we propose a new associative classification method, ACCF(Associative Classification Based on Closed Frequent Itemsets). The method extends an efficient closed frequent pattern mining method, Charm to mine all frequent closed itemsets (CFIs) and their tidsets, which would help to generate the Class Association Rules (CARs)([6]) And we also adopt a new way to classify an unseen case correspondingly. Our extensive experiments on 18 databases from UCI machine learning database repositor)([10]) show that ACCF is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with CBA([6]). Moreover, our performance study shows that the method helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems.

The existing approaches to the development of such beliefs through machine learning rely on particular social cues or specifically defined award functions. Their applications can, therefore, be limited. This paper presents an active robot learning approach to facilitate the robots to develop the beliefs by actively collecting/discovering evidence they need. The emphasis is on active learning. Hence social cues and award functions are not necessary. Simulations show that the presented approach successfully enabled a robot to discover evidences it needs.

The set of traffic control rules is divided into the set of fixed-rule and the set of variable-rule. The genetic algorithm is used to improve the set of variable-rule during the process of traffic signal control. The genetic algorithm is a part of the signal control process instead of calculating the optimal scheme of signal control. A self-learning traffic signal control model based on juzzy clustering and genetic algorithm is established The instance of simulation is an isolated intersection controlled by signal. After simulating, the control effects of this self-learning approach, the fixed-time control method and the actuated control method are compared. The result of simulating illustrates that the effect of this self-learning approach is better than the traditional ones.

Firstly, support vectors are obtained from the training data set to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules with membership functions described in terms of kernel functions via support vector machine learning procedure. Then, a combined fuzzy rule base is created based on both the generated rules and linguistic rules of human experts. Thus, it has the inherent advantages that the rule base is optimized automatically during the SVM learning procedure, and, takes both "subjective" experts' prior knowledge and "objective" training data into account. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Automatic text summarization helps users to quickly understand the documents. This paper proposes an automated technique for Chinese document summarization based on kernel words recognition and discourse segment extraction. This method can be divided into the following five steps. First, the input articles are annotated by lexical analysis. Second, all focused named entities are recognized using a machine learning method. Third, the input articles are divided into several discourse segments, all kernel words of these segments are extracted by the way of rule-based main verbs recognition, and all relations among entities are extracted. Fourth, all important sentence candidates are ranked based on some rules, and redundant sentences are removed based on kernel words information. Finally, several most important sentences are extracted to compose the summarization according to expected compression ratio, and these important sentences are output using a special document as reference. A series of experiments are performed on two Chinese document collections. The results show the superiority of the proposed technique over reference systems.

Attribute reduction is an important research issue in rough set theory. At present, there are many different attribute reduction definitions, for example, attribute reduction based on Pawlak, based on information entropy and based on Skowron's discernibility matrix, etc. In this paper, a new measurement with parameter is provided based on rough set. Then monotony of the new measurement with parameter is proved. So definition of attribute reduction based on the new measurement with parameter is got. At the some time, it is proved that attribute reduction based on Skowron's discernibility matrix and on information entropy are the special cases of the new proposed attribute reduction. Therefore the new attribute reduction in rough set is very meaningful.

Locally linear embedding (LLE) is one of several promising manifold learning methods. But ordinary LLE can not distinguish effectively the low-dimensional embeddings of noise data. By introducing the reconstruction similarity into LLE, this paper proposes a generalized locally linear embedding algorithm based on local reconstruction similarity. Experimental results show on Columbia object image data that the new generalized version is superior to LLE in revealing the visualization of high-dimensional image dataset containing noise images.

The GraphSOM is a generalization of the Self-Organizing Maps for Structured Domain (SOM-SD) which had been shown to be a capable unsupervised machine learning method for some types of graph structured information. An application of the SOM-SD to document mining tasks as part of an international competition: Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX), on the clustering of XML formatted documents was conducted, and the method subsequently won the competition in 2005 and 2006 respectively. This paper applies the GraphSOM to the clustering of a larger dataset in the INEX competition 2007. The results are compared with those obtained when utilizing the more traditional SOM-SD approach. Experimental results show that (1) the GraphSOM is computationally more efficient than the SOM-SD, (2) the performances of both approaches on the larger dataset in INEX 2007 are not competitive when compared with those obtained by other participants of the competition using other approaches, and, (3) different structural representation of the same dataset can influence the performance of the proposed GraphSOM technique.

Its goal is to find a set of fuzzy rules which describe classification problems. Most of the existing fuzzy rule induction methods (e.g., the fuzzy decision trees induction method) focus on searching rules consisting of t=norms (i.e., AND) only, but not t-conorms (OR) explicitly. This may lead to the omission of generating important rules which involve t-conorms explicitly. This paper proposes a type of tree termed pattern trees which make use of different aggregations including both t-norms and t-conorms. Like decision trees, pattern trees are an effective machine learning tool for classification applications. This paper discusses the difference between decision trees and pattern trees, and also shows that the subsethood based method (SBM) and the weighted subsethood based method (WSBM) are two specific cases of pattern trees, with each having a fixed pattern tree structure. A novel pattern tree induction method is proposed. The comparison to other classification methods including SBM, WSBM and fuzzy decision tree induction over datasets obtained from UCI dataset repository shows that pattern trees can obtain higher accuracy rates in classifications. In addition, pattern trees are capable of generating classifiers with good generality, while decision trees can easily fall into the trap of over-fitting. According to two different configurations, simple pattern trees and pattern trees have been distinguished. The former not only produce high prediction accuracy, but also preserve compact tree structures, while the latter can produce even better accuracy, but as a compromise produce more complex tree structures. Subject to the particular demands (comprehensibility or performance), simple pattern trees and pattern trees provide an effective methodology for real world applications. Weighted pattern trees have been proposed in which certain weights are assigned to different trees, to reflect the nature that different trees may have different confidences. The experiments on British Telecom (BT) customer satisfaction dataset show that weighted pattern trees can slightly outperform pattern trees, and both are slightly better than fuzzy decision trees in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, the experiments show that both weighted and unweighted pattern trees are robust to over-fitting. Finally, a limitation of pattern trees as revealed via BT dataset analysis is discussed and the research direction is outlined.

Unlike the standard rough set model the indiscernibility relation in our paper is based on a quasi-order, not necessarily an equivalence relation. Feature selection, though algorithmically difficult in general, appears to be easier in many cases of scaled many-valued contexts, because the difficulties can at least partially be projected to the scale contexts. We propose a heuristic algorithm for this.

However, fuzz testing is still conducted in an ad-hoc manner with considerable manual effort, which is mainly due to the unavailability of protocol model. In this paper we present our on-going work of developing an automated and measurable protocol fuzz testing approach that uses a formally synthesized approximate formal protocol specification to guide the testing process. We adopt the Finite State Machine protocol model and study two formal methods for protocol synthesis: an active black-box checking algorithm that has provable optimality and a passive trace minimization algorithm that is less accurate but much more efficient. We also present our preliminary results of using this method to implementations of the MSN instant messaging protocol: MSN clients Gaim (pidgin) and aMSN. Our testing reveals some serious reliability and security flaws by automatically crashing both of them.

To deal with the class imbalance problem in machine learning, especially with decision trees, different authors proposed such asymmetric splitting criteria. After the tree is grown a decision rule has to be assigned to each leaf. The classical Bayesian rule that selects the more frequent class is irrelevant when the dataset is strongly imbalanced. A best suited assignment rule taking asymmetry into account must be adopted. But how can we then evaluate the resulting prediction model? Indeed the usual error rate is irrelevant when the classes are strongly imbalanced. Appropriate evaluation measures are required in such cases. We consider ROC curves and recall/precision graphs for evaluating the performance of decision trees grown from imbalanced datasets. These evaluation criteria are used for comparing trees obtained with an asymmetric splitting criterion with those grown with a symmetric one.

Statistical natural language processing techniques are combined in order to achieve a completely autonomous functionality of the portal. The news items are automatically collected from a large number of news sources using web syndication. Afterward, machine learning techniques are used for achieving an automatic classification of the news stream. Firstly, the items are clustered using an agglomerative algorithm and the resulting groups correspond to the main news topics. Thus, more information about each of the main topics is acquired from various news sources. Secondly, text classification algorithms are applied to automatically label each cluster of news items in a predetermined number of classes. More than a thousand news items were employed for both the training and the evaluation of the classifiers. The paper presents a complete comparison of the results obtained for each method.

In addressing this issue, this paper proposes an ensemble of one-class classifiers where each uses different learning paradigms. The techniques deployed in this ensemble model are; Linear Genetic Programming (LGP), Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Forest (RF). The strengths from the individual models were evaluated and ensemble rule was formulated. Empirical results show an improvement in detection accuracy for all classes of network traffic; Normal, Probe, DoS, U2R and R2L. RF which is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual result was also able to address imbalance dataset problem that many of machine learning techniques fail to sufficiently address it.

Here we explore whether similarly constrained neural network controllers can be exploited for embodied, situated adaptive behaviour. We demonstrate that it is possible to evolve globally stable neurocontrollers containing a single basin of attraction, which nevertheless sustain multiple modes of behaviour. This is achieved by exploiting interaction between environmental input and transient dynamics. We present results that suggest that this globally stable regime may constitute an evolvable and dynamically rich subset of recurrent neural network configurations, especially in larger networks. We discuss the issue of scalability and the possibility that there may be alternative adaptive behaviour tasks that are more 'attractor hungry'.

Active learners can significantly reduce labeling cost by only selecting the most informative instances for labeling. Graph-based learning methods are popular in machine learning in recent years because of clear mathematical framework and strong performance with suitable models. However, they suffer heavy computation when the whole graph is in huge size. In this paper, we propose a scalable algorithm for graph-based active learning. The proposed method can be described as follows. In the beginning, a backbone graph is constructed instead of the whole graph. Then the instances in the backbone graph are chosen for labeling. Finally, the instances with the maximum expected information gain are sampled repeatedly based on the graph regularization model. The experiments show that the proposed method obtains smaller data utilization and average deficiency than other popular active learners on selected datasets from semi-supervised learning benchmarks.

Support Vector Machine has been successfully used in pattern recognition and function estimation. In order to tackle with incremental learning problems with new features, an incremental feature learning algorithm based on Least Square Support Vector Machine is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, features of newly joined samples contain two parts: already existing features and new features. Using historic structural parameters which are trained from the already existing features, the algorithm only trains the new features with Least Square Support Vector Machine. Experiments show that this algorithm has two outstanding properties. First, different kernel functions can be used for the already existing features and the new features according to the distribution of samples. Consequently, this algorithm is more suitable to deal with classification tasks which can not be well solved by using a single kernel function. Second, the training time and the memory space can be reduced because the algorithm fully uses the structural parameters of classifiers trained formerly and only trains the new features with Least Square Support Vector Machine. Some UCI datasets are used to demonstrate the less training time and comparable or better performance of this algorithm than the Least Square Support Vector Machine.

Clustering methods can be used to group co-expressed genes, shedding light on gene function and co-regulation. Alternatively, they can group samples or conditions to identify phenotypical groups, disease subgroups, or to help identify disease pathways. A rich variety of unsupervised techniques have been applied, including partitional, hierarchical, graph-based, model-based, and biclustering methods. While a number of machine learning problems and tools have found mainstream applications in bioinformatics, in this article we identify some challenging problems which, though clearly relevant to bioinformatics, have not been extensively investigated in this domain. These include i) unsupervised clustering with unsupervised feature selection, ii) semisupervised learning, iii) unsupervised learning (and supervised learning) in the presence of confounding variables, and iv) stability of clustering solutions. We review recent methods which address these problems and take the position that these methods are well-suited to addressing some common scenarios that occur in bioinformatics.

Application of data mining technology in assembly quality control	FRONTIERS IN ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Research and Practical Issues of Enterprise Information Systems	OCT 14-16, 2007	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA			knowledge management; knowledge discovery; data mining; neural network; assembly; quality; control; finite element method		Knowledge management is the collection of processes that govern the creation, dissemination, and utilization of knowledge. Data mining is the important approach to realize knowledge discovery. It is the process of extracting patterns or predicting previously unknown and useful trends from large quantities of data by using the knowledge of multidisciplinary fields such as statistics, mode identify, artificial intelligence, machine learning, database, management information system and so on. Assembly is the pivotal component in product life cycle process. The control technology of assembly quality has become a hot topic. Assembly technologic parameters are the important influencing factors of assembly quality, and the loaded stress distribution of the key structure is one of the main evaluation indexes of assembly quality. The description of relations between influencing factors and evaluation index is crucial. The present paper gives an engineering application of data mining based on neural networks. The back propagation neural network is used as the algorithm of data mining. Then the effects of assembly technologic parameters on loaded stress distribution in the weld region of the shield engine rotor in a submarine are analyzed. The mined data come from the numerical simulations of the finite element method. The effects of different parameters on the stress in the weld region are achieved from the results of the data mining. The discovered knowledge is beneficial to the improvement of assembly quality.

Many human activity recognition tasks are - from a machine learning perspective - quite similar to tagging tasks in natural language processing. Motivated by this similarity, we develop a relational transformation-based tagging system based on inductive logic programming principles, which is able to cope with expressive relational representations as well as a background theory. The approach is experimentally evaluated on two activity recognition tasks and an information extraction task, and compared to Hidden Markov Models, one of the most popular and successful approaches for tagging.

The research reported here was conducted while the authors participated in the international ECML/PKDD 2007 Discovery Challenge competition - Track 1. The results presented here ended up as the winning solution to the contest. We describe the contest tasks and the real industrial datasets concerning the recorded behaviour of sample of Polish Web users on which our experiments were performed. We present the whole extensive experimental process from the data preprocessing phase to exploratory analysis of the data to the experimental comparison and discussion of various prediction models which we examined. As we explain, our solution has low time and space complexity, scales well with large datasets and, at the same time, produces high-quality results.

J	Clark, A; Watkins, C				Clark, Alexander; Watkins, Chris			Some alternatives to Parikh matrices using string kernels	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article							LANGUAGES	We describe methods of representing strings as real valued vectors or matrices; we show how to integrate two separate lines of enquiry: string kernels, developed in machine learning, and Parikh matrices [8], which have been studied intensively over the last few yearn as a powerful tool in the study of combinatorics over words. In the field of machine learning, there is widespread use of string kernels, which use analogous mappings into high dimensional feature spaces based on the occurrences of subwords or factors. In this paper we show how one can use string kernels to construct two alternatives to Parikh matrices, that overcome some of the limitations of the Parikh matrix construction. These are morphisms from the free monoid to rings of real-valued matrices under multiplication: one is based on the subsequence kernel and the other on the gap-weighted string kernel. For the latter kernel we demonstrate that for many values of the gap-weight hyperparameter the resulting morphism is injective.

The approach uses a novel combination of model checking and machine learning. We first translate a goal model formalised in linear temporal logic into a (potentially zeno) labelled transition system. We then iteratively identify zeno traces in the model and learn operational requirements in the form of preconditions that prevent the traces from occurring. Identification of zeno traces is acheived by model checking the behaviour model against a time progress property expressed in linear temporal logic, while learning operational requirements is achieved using Inductive Logic Programming. As a result of the iterative process, not only a non-zeno behaviour model is produced but also a set of preconditions that, in conjunction with the known goals, ensure the non-zeno behaviour of the system.

The basis for our method is provided by asymmetric bilinear factorization of a given motion segment. In the first step, we use locally linear embedding (LLE), a nonlinear manifold method, to compute a distinct characteristic for the given motion segment in the form of a curve in lower dimension space. Next using generalized radial basis functions we formulate the second factor, a reconstruction matrix which maps a point in LLE space to a motion frame. Keeping the distinct characteristic unchanged, perturbations of the reconstruction matrix yield variations of the same motion. Further, to join the varied motion segments into a longer animation sequence, we present all embedding space method. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it can be applied to both skeleton-based and mesh-based animation. Through experimental results, we show that our method provides an animator with a very useful tool to specify variations in repetitive motion sequences.

GP classification under imbalanced data sets: Active sub-sampling and AUC approximation	GENETIC PROGRAMMING, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Genetic Programming	MAR 26-28, 2008	Naples, ITALY				COEVOLUTION	The problem of evolving binary classification models under increasingly unbalanced data sets is approached by proposing a strategy consisting of two components: Sub-sampling and 'robust' fitness function design. In particular, recent work in the wider machine learning literature has recognized that maintaining the original distribution of exemplars during training is often not appropriate for designing classifiers that are robust to degenerate classifier behavior. To this end we propose a 'Simple Active Learning Heuristic' (SALH) in which a subset of exemplars is sampled with uniform probability under a class balance enforcing rule for fitness evaluation. In addition, an efficient estimator for the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance metric is assumed in the form of a modified Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) statistic. Performance is evaluated in terms of six representative UCI data sets and benchmarked against: canonical GP, SALH based GP, SALH and the modified WMW statistic, and deterministic classifiers (Naive Bayes and C4.5). The resulting SALH-WMW model is demonstrated to be both efficient and effective at providing solutions maximizing performance assessed in terms of AUC.

Predicting gene function in a hierarchical context with an ensemble of classifiers	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							YEAST SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; HETEROGENEOUS DATA; GENOMIC DATA; PROTEIN; MOUSE; ANNOTATION; DATABASE; INTEGRATION; LANDSCAPE; NETWORKS	Background: The wide availability of genome-scale data for several organisms has stimulated interest in computational approaches to gene function prediction. Diverse machine learning methods have been applied to unicellular organisms with some success, but few have been extensively tested on higher level, multicellular organisms. A recent mouse function prediction project (MouseFunc) brought together nine bioinformatics teams applying a diverse array of methodologies to mount the first large-scale effort to predict gene function in the laboratory mouse. Results: In this paper, we describe our contribution to this project, an ensemble framework based on the support vector machine that integrates diverse datasets in the context of the Gene Ontology hierarchy. We carry out a detailed analysis of the performance of our ensemble and provide insights into which methods work best under a variety of prediction scenarios. In addition, we applied our method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have experimentally confirmed functions for a novel mitochondrial protein. Conclusion: Our method consistently performs among the top methods in the MouseFunc evaluation. Furthermore, it exhibits good classification performance across a variety of cellular processes and functions in both a multicellular organism and a unicellular organism, indicating its ability to discover novel biology in diverse settings.

We demonstrate that our method allowed de novo identification of hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)4 alpha binding sites and significantly improved an overall recognition of faithful HNF4 alpha targets. When applied to published findings, an unprecedented high number of false positives were identified. The technique can be applied to any transcription factor.

Recently we demonstrated that the support vector machine (SVM), a tool from machine learning, can be readily adapted for this task, and offers significant advantages. On the conceptual side, the SVM avoids the use of untestable assumptions, such as ergodicity, while on the practical side, the SVM out performs geostatistics at low sampling densities. In this study, we use the SVM within an inverse modeling framework to incorporate hydraulic head measurements into lithofacies delineation, and identify the directions of feuture research.

A Machine Learning Based Reputation System for Defending Against Malicious Node Behavior	GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 08)	NOV 30-DEC 04, 2008	New Orleans, LA	IEEE		Machine Learning; Peer-to-Peer; Reputation Systems; Support Vector Machines	TIME-SERIES PREDICTION	Reputation Systems (RS) are designed to detect malicious nodes in a network and thwart their attacks, such as the spreading of viruses or worms, or attacking known vulnerabilities. They do this by collecting information about past transactions of a node and utilizing that to predict its future behavior. Traditionally, RSs have been designed by manually devising specific models or equations that use historical data to defend against certain types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning based RS that automates the process of devising the RS model and defends against many patterns of attacks. We discuss the merits of this approach and propose using Support Vector Machines as the basis of the RS.

However, as many newly-emerged Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications using dynamic port numbers, masquerading techniques, and payload encryption to avoid detection, the classical approaches based on port mapping and payload analysis are ineffective. An alternative approach is to classify traffic by distinguishing the behavior of an application within the first few packets of TCP connection. We pursue this approach and demonstrate that information of few packets is enough to effectively identify P2P traffic. In our work, C4.5 decision tree and REPTree are evaluated and compared with the previously used clustering method K-Means. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform K-Means algorithm in accuracy. In addition, the proposed approaches can accommodate known and unknown P2P traffic and even encrypted traffic in fast and accurate way, which ensures the real-time applications on the Internet traffic surveillance and QoS provisioning.

Our algorithm is an attempt to keep the rigorous guarantees of the original one but use sample sizes that are not as astronomical as predicted by the theory. We prove that indeed our algorithm PAC- learns in a stronger sense than the Clark-Thollard. We also perform very preliminary experiments: We show that on a few small targets (8-10 states) it requires only hundreds of examples to identify the target. We also test the algorithm on a web logfile recording about a hundred thousand sessions from an ecommerce site, from which it is able to extract some nontrivial structure in the form of a PDFA with 30-50 states. An additional feature, in fact partly explaining the reduction in sample size, is that our algorithm does not need as input any information about the distinguishability of the target.

This is a challenging task because in many cases it deals with extremely large, inherently not structured and fuzzy data, plus the presence of uncertainty. Therefore it is required to know a priori the quality of future procedures without using any additional information. In this chapter we propose new measures to evaluate the quality of training sets used by supervised learning classifiers. Our training set assessment relied on measures furnished by rough set theory. Our experimental results involved three classifiers (k-NN, C-4.5, MLP) from international databases. New training sets are built taking into account the results of the measures and the accuracy obtained by the classifiers, aiming to infer the accuracy that the classifiers would obtain by using a new training set. This is possible using a rule generator (C4.5) and a function estimation algorithm (k-NN).								ARCO L, 2006, LNAI, V4293; CABALLERO Y, 2006, P 8 INT S SYMB NUM A; Choubey S.

This study investigates dietary and other factors that may influence plasma levels of these anti-oxidants. A rough sets approach is employed on a clinical dataset to determine the attributes and their values are associated with plasma levels of carotene/retinol. The resulting classifier produced an accuracy of approximately 90% for both beta-carotene and retinol. The results from this study indicate that age, smoking, and dietary intake of these enogenous anti-oxidants is predictive of plasma levels.

Finding a knowledge model may require to join all the data sources and to run a machine learning algorithm on the joint set. We present an alternative based on a Multi Agent System (MAS): an agent mines one data source in order to extract a local theory (knowledge model) and then merges it with the previous MAS theory using a knowledge fusion technique. This way, we obtain a global theory that summarizes the distributed knowledge without spending resources and time in joining data sources. The results show that, as a result of knowledge fusion, the accuracy of initial theories is improved as well as the accuracy of the monolithic solution.	[Gaya, Maria Cruz; Giraldez, J.

Its main role in a broader system is to notify of an unusual traffic and in that way provide the possibility of detecting unknown attacks. Most of the machine-learning techniques deployed for intrusion detection are supervised as these techniques are generally more accurate, but this implies the need of labeling the data for training and testing which is time-consuming and error-prone. Hence, our goal is to devise an anomaly detector which would be unsupervised. but at the same time robust and accurate. Genetic algorithms are robust and able to avoid getting stuck in local optima, unlike the rest of clustering techniques. The model is verified on KDD99 benchmark dataset generating a solution competitive with the solutions of the state-of-the-art which demonstrates high possibilities of the proposed method.

They can find information that can be decisive in order to analyze the behavior of different learning algorithms with specific datasets. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to study by means of three similar datasets from UCI Repository Machine Learning, the possible reasons for which breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset, in comparison with other 20 datasets, showed in a previous research that Stacking by Meta-Decision Trees (MDT) was significant better than all other multiclassifier models, including Stacking by Multi-Response Linear Regression (MLR). In our experiments the proportion of missing values, among other significant changes in different measure values, provided evidences about the possible origin of the different behaviors presented by these multiclassifier schemes depending on data characteristics.

Self-organizing map (SOM), one of artificial neural networks, is employed to determine stocked products' allocation to the racks. In applying SOM, a number of order forms for rounding up the products are treated as a set of input signals and rack positions are regarded as SOM topology. Numerical simulation proves that the proposed method allow us to determine an efficient assignment of the stocked products to the racks.

The later classifies individual anomalies within each category of known attacks. The paper also investigates various feature selection techniques for choosing relevant features and study its effect on the performance of the anomaly detection classifiers.

In order to facilitate their application in different areas, ranging from protein to protein interaction in bioinformatics to text mining in computational linguistics research, a modular and general mining framework is needed. The major constraint to the generalization process concerns the feature design for the description of relational data. In this paper, we present a machine learning framework for the automatic mining of relations, where the target objects are structurally organized in a tree. Object types are generalized by means of the use of roles, whereas the relation properties are described by means of the underlying tree structure. The latter is encoded in the learning algorithm thanks to kernel methods for structured data, which represent structures in terms of their all possible subparts. This approach can be applied to any kind of data disregarding their very nature. Experiments with Support Vector Machines on two text mining datasets for relation extraction, i.e. the PropBank and FrameNet corpora, show both that our approach is general, and that it reaches state-of-the-art accuracy.

But at large scales, mining for useful patterns still presents challenges in terms of data management as well as computation. These issues can be addressed by dividing both data and computation to build ensembles of classifiers in a distributed fashion, but trade-offs in cost, performance, and accuracy must be considered when designing or selecting an appropriate architecture. In this paper we present air abstraction for scalable data mining that allows us to explore these trade-offs. Data and computation are distributed to a computing cloud with minimal effort from the user and multiple models for data management are available depending on the workload and system configuration. We demonstrate the performance and scalability characteristics of our ensembles using a wide variety of datasets and algorithms on a Condor-based pool with Chirp to handle the storage.

It is an open challenge in machine learning and plays key roles in real applications such as financial fraud detection, network intrusion detection, astronomy, spam image detection, etc. In this paper, we develop, a new graph-based method for rare category detection named GRADE. It makes use of the global similarity, matrix motivated by the manifold ranking algorithm, which results in more compact clusters for the minority classes; by selecting examples from the regions where probability density changes the most, it relaxes the assumption that the majority classes and the minority classes are separable. Furthermore, when detailed information about the data set is not available, we develop a modified version of GRADE named GRADE-LI, which only needs an upper bound on the proportion of each minority class as input. Besides working with data with structured features, both GRADE and GRADE-LI can also work, with graph data, which can not be handled by existing rare category detection methods.

The Cox proportional hazards model is the standard tool for the analysis of continuous censored survival data. We propose a novel machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Regression for Censored Data (SVRe) for improved analysis of medical survival data. SVRc leverages the high-dimensional capabilities of traditional SVR while adapting it for use with censored data through a modified asymmetric loss/penalty function which allows censored (left and right censored) data to be processed We applied the new algorithm to predict the recurrence and disease progression of prostate cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. Compared with the traditional Cox model, SVRc achieves significant improvement in overall accuracy as well as in the ability to identify high-risk and low-risk patient populations.			faisal.khan@aureon.com; valentina.bayer@aureon.com					Cordon-Cardo C, 2007, J CLIN INVEST, V117, P1876, DOI 10.1172/JCI31399; COX DR, 1972, J ROYAL STAT SOC; DESILVA CJS, 1994, AUST COMPUT J, V26, P78; DONOVAN M, 2007, ASCO             MAY; Donovan MJ, 2008, J CLIN ONCOL, V26, P3923, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3155; Evers L, 2008, BIOINFORMATICS, V24, P1632, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn253; GORDON L, 1985, CANCER TREAT REP, V69, P1065; Harrell FE., 2001, REGRESSION MODELING; Kattan MW, 1998, COMPUT BIOMED RES, V31, P363, DOI 10.1006/cbmr.1998.1488; MANGASARIAN O, 1994, MPTR9410 U WISC; SAIDI O, 2006, NATURE CLIN PRACTICE, V4, P39; SHIVASWAMY P, 2007, 655660 ICDM; SMOLA A, 1998, TR98030 ESPRIT WORK; SNOW P, 1997, J UROLOGY, V152, P1923; VANBELLE V, CIMED2007, P1; VAPNIK VN, 1998, STAT LEAMING THEORY; YIJUN H, 2006, CHINESE GERMAN J CLI, V5	17	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1550-4786	978-0-7695-3502-9	IEEE DATA MINING			2008							863	868		10.1109/ICDM.2008.50		6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BJA60	WOS:000264173600098

The objective function of our method contains a weighted variance minimization part as well. This modification makes the method more efficient in time series forecasting, as this paper will show The proposed method is a generalization of the well-known LS-SVM algorithm. It has similar advantages like the applicability of the kernel-trick, it has a linear and unique solution, and a short computational time, but can perform better in certain scenarios. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the novel Variance Minimization Least Squares Support Vector Machine (VMLS-SVM) method and to show its superiority through experimental results using standard benchmark time series prediction datasets.

It is also an important issue with the increasing use of skin patches as a means of drug delivery. In this work, we apply K-nearest-neighbour regression, single layer networks, mixture of experts and Gaussian processes to predict the permeability coefficient. We obtain a considerable improvement oiler the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSARs) predictors. We show that using five features, which are Molecular weight, solubility parameter lipophilicity, the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor and donor groups, can produce better predictions than the one using only lipophilicity and the molecular weight. The Gaussian process regression with five compound features gives the best performance in this work.

Most of these works only focus on time series of a single attribute or univariate time series data. However, in many real world problems, data arrive as one or many series of multiple attributes, i.e., they are multivariate time series data. Because they contain multiple attributes, multivariate time series data promise to provide more intrinsic correlations among them, from which more important information can be gathered and extracted. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model and predict the behaviors of multivariate time series data based on a rule evolution methodology. Our approach is divided into distinct steps, each of which can be accomplished by several machine learning techniques. This makes our system highly flexible, configurable and extendable. Experiments are also conducted on real S&P 500 stock data to examine the effectiveness and reliability of our approach. Empirical results demonstrate that our system has substantial estimation reliability and prediction accuracy.

The proposed algorithm is a two phase algorithm which combines a memetic algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP algorithm for the solution of the clustering problem. In this paper, contrary to the genetic algorithms, the evolution of each individual of the population is realized with the use of a PSO algorithm where each individual have to improve its physical movement following the basic principles of PSO until it will obtain the requirements to be selected as a parent. Its performance is compared with other popular metaheuristic methods like classic genetic algorithms, tabu search, GRASP, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, this methodology is evaluated on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The high performance of the proposed algorithm is achieved as the algorithm gives very good results and in some instances the percentage of the corrected clustered samples is very high and is larger than 96%.

More accurately, depending on the kind of attack it targets, an NIDS can be oriented to detect misuses (by defining all possible attacks) or anomalies (by modelling legitimate behaviour and detecting those that do not fit on that model). Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this, we present here ESIDE-Depian, the first unified misuse and anomaly prevention system based on Bayesian Networks to analyse completely network packets, and the strategy to create a consistent knowledge model that integrates misuse and anomaly-based knowledge. Finally, we evaluate ESIDE-Depian against well-known and new attacks showing how it outperforms a well-established industrial NIDS.

B	Chiong, R; Theng, LB			ICIEA	Chiong, Raymond; Theng, Lau Bee			A hybrid naive Bayes approach for information filtering	ICIEA 2008: 3RD IEEE CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-3	IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA 2008)	JUN 03-05, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE Ind Electron Chap, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc			TEXT CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	Naive Bayes has been widely used in the field of machine learning research for many years. While it is fast and easy to implement, its performance in comparison to other machine learning methods is not ideal, In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using naive Bayes for information filtering. This approach differs from previous approaches in that it uses Multivariate Bernoulli Model and Multinomial Model successively. We report on the performance of our proposed approach using Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups data. In the filtering process, we first use Multivatiate Bernoulli Model to estimate the preexamined probability for words appear in a document. Subsequently, the Multinomial Model is used to estimate the post-examined probability for final classification. We show that with sufficient training data, this hybrid approach can achieve higher F-measure score than using Multivariate Bernoulli Model or Multinomial Model alone. It can even achieve competitive results as compared to the highly complex learning method such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) with less computational time.

Case-based reasoning, which is abbreviated to CBR, is an important machine learning method. It has been successfully applied in many areas, including the decision-making support system. This paper mainly discusses about the similarity computation between two cases in CBR. First, we briefly introduce the commonly similarity computation functions based on distance, and then, we present a new approach to compute the similarity and discuss some problems related to this subject.

Our work is based on a residual generation scheme, where the prediction of a model for process normal behavior is compared against measured process values. The residuals may indicate the presence of a fault. The model consists of a general statistical inference engine operating on discrete spaces, and represents the maximum entropy joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probabilities. The joint pmf is a rich model that, once learned, allows us to address inference tasks, which can be used for prediction applications. In our case the model allows the one step-ahead prediction of process variable, given its past values. The relevant dependencies between the forecast variable and past values are learnt by applying an algorithm to discover discrete bayesian network structures from data. The parameters of the statistical engine are also learn by an approximate method proposed by Yan and Miller. We show the performance of the prediction models and their application in power systems fault detection.

The learning system is characterized by using a Direct Policy Search method for learning the internal state/action mapping. Policy only algorithms may suffer from long convergence times when dealing with real robotics. In order to speed LIP the process, the learning phase has been carried out in a simulated environment and, in a second step, the policy has been transferred and tested Successfully on a real robot. Future steps plan to continue the learning process on-line while on the real robot while performing the mentioned task. We demonstrate its feasibility with real experiments on the underwater robot ICTINEUAUV.

These 2-grams gave a comparable performance with the existing methods in the literature. An in-depth analysis of data sets using 2-grams is performed. The analysis presented a scenario where there is a confusion between a majority of promoters with a minor set of non-promoter and vice versa. In an effort to build a complete classification system, using the majority and minority sets in promoters as well as non-promoters, a multi-level cascading system and Ada-Boost classifier are applied. The results indicate that much further improvement is not possible with the modifications proposed.	[Rani, T.

An intuitive approach is the use of machine learning techniques based on specific network traffic characteristics. These traffic characteristics are also known as features, which have to be extracted and selected carefully to build robust and accurate learning models. Thus, finding the best possible learning model in combination with extracting the best possible feature-set is a necessary requirement to design accurate traffic classification models. While feature selection can be automated to find the best subset of a given set of features, there are no known mechanisms to solve the problem of feature extraction. Thus, extracting the best possible features has to be done empirically. In this work we present a framework to simplify the empirical model selection and feature extraction process.

In order to simplify the design of the SVM classifier and improve efficiency of machine learning, both a grid vector representation and a center radiating vector representation are proposed to abstract features of the object. The sample data is obtained through processing and analysis including human and no-human which forms the training input to SVM.

Integrating the distinct aspects of indiscernibility capability of rough set theory and good generalization ability of support vector machine, this paper proposes a new classification method named Rough Support Vector Machine. Rough set was employed as an attribute reduction tool to work on the original attribute set in order to carry out a redundancy removing. The reduct attribute result, which is composed of a low dimensional set of attributes with minimal loss of information, is then combined together according to our new attribute creation method and used as input to a support vector classifier with good generalization performance. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated experimentally on classifying the text classification benchmark dataset and compared with the traditional rough set method and other machine learning methods.

Support vector machine (SVM) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for solving problems in regression, but its performance mainly depends on the parameters selection of it. Parameters selection for SVM is very complex in nature and quite hard to solve by conventional optimization techniques, which constrains its application to some degree. In this paper Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is proposed to choose the parameters of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) automatically in time series prediction. This method has been applied in a real Electricity Load Forecasting, the results show that the proposed approach has a better performance and is also more accurate and effective than LS-SVM based on particle swarm optimization.

Diverse Density (DD) algorithm is a typical multiple-instance learning method Due to the character of sparse positive instances, when classifying the bags which include multiple overlapped instances, some negative bags are considered as positive bags. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a new classification method, which modifies the influence strategy of the instances to the bags when classifying the bags. To verify the method, it is used to classify the real and pseudo microRNA precursors in bioinformatics, and has obtained exciting results.

Basic GEP method has been proved to be powerful in symbolic regression and other data mining as well as machine learning tasks. However, GEPs potential for neural network learning has not been well studied In this paper, we prove that GEP neural network(GEPNN) is not able to solve high order regression problems. Based on our proof we propose an extended method for evolving neural network with GEP. The extended GEPNN is used in various kinds of function finding problems. Results on multiple leaning methods show the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we give out a novel definition of Granular Computing which can be easily treated by neural network. Perception learning as granular computing tries to study the machine learning from perception information sampling to dimensional reduction and samples classification in a granular way, and can be summaries as two kind approaches: (1) covering learning, (2) svm kind learning. We proved that although there are tremendous algorithms for dimensional reduction and information transformation, their ability can't transcend wavelet kind nested layered granular computing which are very easy for neural network processing.

In such a problem, almost all the examples are labeled as one class, while far fewer examples are labeled as the other class, usually the more important class. In this case, standard machine learning algorithms tend to be overwhelmed by the majority class and ignore the minority class since traditional classifiers seeking an accurate performance over a full range of instances. This paper reviewed academic activities special for the class imbalance problem firstly. Then investigated various remedies in four different levels according to learning phases. Following surveying evaluation metrics and some other related factors, this paper showed some future directions at last.

The less generalization error is, the better the performance of machine learning and on the contrary, the worse. To further study characteristic of machine learning algorithm, the decomposition method of the generalization error for estimators is usually used Wherein the bias-variance decomposition for quadratic error loss functions is well known and serves as an important tool for analyzing supervised learning algorithms. In this paper, Aiming at the weighting fusion method and quadratic error loss function, we give detailed decomposition process of generalization error for weighting fused ensemble estimators. On the basis of this, the decomposition equation for the optimal fused method is further obtained.

As one of the most predominant semi-supervised learning algorithms, co-training has drawn much attention and shown its superiority in many applications. So far, there have been a variety of variants of co-training algorithms aiming to settle practical problems. In order to launch an effective co-training process, these variants as a whole create their diversities in four different ways, i.e. two-view level, underlying classifiers level, datasets level and active learning level. This paper gives a review on co-training style algorithms just from this view and presents typical examples and analysis for each level respectively.

A typical library is used by client programs through an application programming interface (API) that hides its internals from the client. Typically, the rules governing the correct usage of the API are documented informally. In many cases, libraries may have complex API usage rules and unclear documentation. As a result, the behaviour of the library under some corner cases may not be well understood by the programmer. Formal specifications provide a precise understanding of the API behaviour. We propose a methodology for learning interface specifications using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our technique runs several unit. tests on the library in order to generate relations describing the operation of the library. The data collected from these tests are used by an inductive learner to obtain rich Datalog/Prolog specifications. Such specifications capture essential properties of interest to the user. They may be used for applications such as reverse engineering the library internals or constructing checks on the application code to enforce proper API usage along with other properties of interest.			srirams@nec-labs.com; ivancic@nec-labs.com; agupta@nec-labs.com					Acharya M., 2007, ESEC FSE, P25; Alur R., 2005, POPL, P98, DOI 10.1145/1040305.1040314; Ammons G., 2002, P 29 ACM SIGPLAN SIG, P4, DOI 10.1145/503272.503275; Bergadano F., 1996, INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROG; Cadar C, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3639, P2; Christodorescu M, 2007, ESEC FSE 07, P5; COHEN WW, 1994, AAAI, P142; Csallner C, 2004, SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER, V34, P1025, DOI 10.1002/spe.602; ERNST MD, 2000, DYNAMICALLY DISCOVER; Godefroid P, 2005, ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES, V40, P213, DOI 10.1145/1064978.1065036; Henzinger T.A., 2001, ESEC SIGSOFT FSE, P109; Jiang GF, 2005, ICAC 2005: Second International Conference on Autonomic Computing, Proceedings, P111; Jones C.B., 1980, SOFTWARE DEV RIGOROU; Mitchell T, 1997, MACHINE LEARNING; MUGGLETON S, 1995, NEW GENERAT COMPUT, V13, P245; Pazzani M., 1991, P 8 INT WORKSH MACH, P432; QUINLAN JR, 1990, MACH LEARN, V5, P239, DOI 10.1023/A:1022699322624; Ramanathan MK, 2007, PLDI'07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 ACM SIGPLAN CONFERENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, P123, DOI 10.1145/1250734.1250749; SEN K, 2005, ESEC FSE 05; Srinivasan A., ALEPH MANUAL; Whaley J., 2004, PLDI 04, P131, DOI 10.1145/996841.996859; Whaley J., 2002, ISSTA, P218; Yang J., 2006, P ICSE	23	0	0	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA		978-1-60558-079-1				2008							131	140				10	Computer Science, Software Engineering	Computer Science	BJI63	WOS:000266158500014

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based on measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the frees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the pre-processing phase, where feature selection and outliers identification is carried out, in order to provide the basis of a high performance automated diagnostic system. The conclusions derived are of more general interest and applicability.

Observable information is the one that is explicitly stored in a database. Unobservable information is information hidden in various coding schemes, transaction streams or free-text-description fields. Nowadays credit risk management tends to employ cutting edge technologies and approaches from the fields of statistics and machine learning for achieving their goals. Often it is forgotten that machine learning schemes can only use completely observable information. The issue is eventually addressed - but instead when using the data it should be addressed during the data warehouse design phase.

Many researchers have proposed various methods that usually focus on point estimates. Software cost estimation, up to now, has been treated as a regression problem. However, in order to prevent over/under estimates, it is more practical to predict the interval of estimations instead of the exact values. In this paper, we propose an approach that converts cost estimation into a classification problem and classifies new software projects in one of the effort classes each corresponding to an effort interval. Our approach integrates cluster analysis with classification methods. Cluster analysis is used to determine effort intervals while different classification algorithms are used to find the corresponding effort classes. The proposed approach is applied to seven public data sets. Our experimental results show that hit rates obtained for effort estimation are around 90%-100%s. For point estimation, the results are also comparable to those in the literature.

Nearly 90% of the cost is maintenance due to error correction, adoptation and mainly enhancements. As Belady and Lehman (Lehman and Belady, 1985) state that software will become increasingly unstructured as it is changed. One way to overcome this problem is refactoring. Refactoring is an approach which reduces the software complexity by incrementally improving internal software quality. Our motivation in this research is to detect the classes that need to be rafactored by analyzing the code complexity. We propose a machine learning based model to predict classes to be refactored. We use Weighted Naive Bayes with InfoGain heuristic as the learner and we conducted experiments with metric data that we collected from the largest GSM operator in Turkey. Our results showed that we can predict 82% of the classes that need refactoring with 13% of manual inspection effort on the average.

Our approach is very different from previous approach, the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based machine learning is combined with the Bootstrapping algorithm. Based on the Bootstrapping algorithm, seed words and seed patterns were used to build a learning program, which extracts more characteristic words using Scalar Clusters as the important feature of CRFs algorithm. These characteristic words have semantic similarity with seed words. Moreover, Combined the CRFs algorithm, ten features have been proposed for entity relation extraction in this paper, which includes Morphology, grammar and semantic feature. The system architecture used for entity relation extraction has been constructed Experiment shows that the performance is promising. So it is useful to extract automatic entity relation.

The basic idea is to introduce an additional weight (namely the importance vector) for each feature of reference vectors to indicate the importance of this feature during the classification. The importance vectors are adapted regarding the fitness of the respective reference vetor over the training iteration. Along with the progress or the training procedure, the dual weights (reference vector and importance vector) can be adjusted simultaneously and mutually to improve the recognition rate eventually. Machine learning databases from UCI are selected to verify the performance of the proposed new approach. The experimental results show that DWLVQ can yield superior performance in terms of recognition rate, computational complexity and stability, compared with the other existing methods which including LVQ, Generalized LVQ(GLVQ), Relevance LVQ(RLVQ) and Generalized Relevance LVQ (GRLVQ).

New work is emerging on the use of statistical traffic characteristics to assist in the identification and classification process. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to IP traffic classification - an inter-disciplinary blend of IP networking and data mining techniques. We provide context and motivation for the application of ML techniques to IP traffic classification, and review 18 significant works that cover the dominant period from 2004 to early 2007. These works are categorized and reviewed according to their choice of ML strategies and primary contributions to the literature. We also discuss a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based traffic classifiers in operational IP networks, and qualitatively critique the extent to which the reviewed works meet these requirements. Open issues and challenges in the field are also discussed.	[Nguyen, Thuy T.

In particular the identification of novel trends and upcoming issues, as well as their dynamic evolution oiler time, is of utter importance to corporate communications and market analysts. Automated machine learning systems using clustering techniques have only partially succeeded in addressing these newly arising requirements,failing in their endeavor to properly assign short-term hype topics to long-term trends. We propose an approach which allows to monitor news wire on different levels of temporal granularity, extracting key-phrases that reflect short-term topics as well as longer-term trends by means of statistical language modelling. Moreover our approach allows for assigning those windows of smaller scope to those of longer intervals.

Previous approaches to customer review classification included document level, sentence and clause level sentiment analysis and feature based opinion summarization. In this paper, we present a feature driven opinion summarization method, where the term "driven" is employed to describe the concept-to-detail (product class to product-specific characteristics) approach we took. For each product class we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as for example high or low for price, small or big for size and modern or faddy for design). Further on, we assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes using a previously annotated corpus and Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization[1] machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance[2]. We show how the method presented is employed to build a feature-driven opinion summarization system that is presently working in English and Spanish. In order to detect the product category, we use a modified system for person names classification. The raw review text is split into sentences and depending on the product class detected, only the phrases containing the specific product features are selected for further processing. The phrases extracted undergo a process of anaphora resolution, Named Entity Recognition and syntactic parsing. Applying syntactic dependency and part of speech patterns, we extract pairs containing the feature and the polarity of the feature attribute the customer associates to the feature in the review. Eventually, we statistically summarize the polarity of the opinions different customers expressed about the product on the web as percentages of positive and negative opinions about each of the product features. We show the results and improvements over baseline, together with a discussion on the strong and weak points of the method and the directions for future work.

We studied the degree of importance of information by using machine learning. We first performed experiments using newspaper documents (D-n). In this experiment, we assumed that I document on the front page or at the top of the front page is important. We were able to identify important documents with a precision of 0.9 by using machine learning. We found that in the case of I newspaper, the degree of importance can be estimated with high precision. Next, to estimate the degree of importance that people attach to a document, we conducted experiments using questionnaire data (D-q) as test data. In these experiments, the subjects were asked to identify which document front a pair was more important, and,I high accuracy of 94% was obtained with more than 80% of them responding with the same answer. Furthermore, on using newspaper documents (D-n) as training data, we could obtain (i) the same accuracy by using D-n only instead of using D-n with D-q and (ii) a higher accuracy on using D-n and D-q instead of using D-q only. This observation is useful because preparing questionnaire data (D-q) can be an expensive process, whereas (D-n) is free. Finally, we extracted the characteristic words that differentiated important information from less important information by calculating the parameters of the features in machine learning (maximum entropy (ME) method).

Building a bilingual dictionary is one of the main applications for word alignment. However, the research of using the bilingual dictionary to improve the word alignment is not enough. There are two bottlenecks. The first is that large bilingual dictionary is hard to get. The second is that the normal approach of using bilingual dictionary does not make full use of the dictionary. We designed a bootstrapping algorithm to conquer the bottlenecks, achieving a good result.

In this paper, we present an automatic identification approach for this task. In our work, some novel features are proposed, which are based on dependency grammars, surrounding words and their POS tags. All the features are automatically extracted using a part-of-speech (POS) tagger and a dependency parser. Our experiments are on a commonly available dialogue corpus, Trains-93. Several machine learning algorithms are used in the experiments, including CME, CRF and SVM. Results show that compared to the approaches used in the previous work, our algorithm is simpler and achieves a higher accuracy.

Therefore spatial filters are extremely useful in single-trial analysis in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. There are powerful methods from machine learning and signal processing that permit the optimization of spatio-temporal filters for each subject in a data dependent fashion beyond the fixed filters based on the sensor geometry, e.g., Laplacians. Here we elucidate the theoretical background of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, a popular method in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Apart from reviewing several variants of the basic algorithm, we reveal tricks of the trade for achieving a powerful CSP performance, briefly elaborate on theoretical aspects of CSP, and demonstrate the application of CSP-type preprocessing in our studies of the Berlin BCI (BBCI) project.

Decision tree algorithm like C4.5 is much useful in the field of data mining or machine learning system. Because this is fast and deduces good result on the problem of classification. This paper proposes three methods using decision tree for solving a classification problem. First, this paper suggest about the extended data expression. Second, a classifier, UChoo, based on the extended data expression is described. Third, this paper is to describe about rule generation. The rules expressed in the newly suggested method have almost the same information contents as compared with the original data set. The information is gotten from the sensors becomes large amount of data as the ubiquitous computation environment develops, therefore it is impossible to keep all information in memory. However, using suggested method, this problem is solved smoothly without losing almost the information.

We use Logic Programming (LP) as the underlying computing machinery to encode the relations as rules and facts and compute with them. A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains.

J	Cai, D; He, XF; Han, JW				Cai, Deng; He, Xiaofei; Han, Jiawei			SRDA: An efficient algorithm for large-scale discriminant analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						linear discriminant analysis; spectral regression; dimensionality reduction.	SPARSE LINEAR-EQUATIONS; LEAST-SQUARES; LSQR	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features that preserves class separability. The projection functions of LDA are commonly obtained by maximizing the between-class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within-class covariance. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigendecomposition, which can be computationally expensive in both time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t(3) )time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features, and t = min(m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework that facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Specifically, SRDA only needs to solve a set of regularized least squares problems, and there is no eigenvector computation involved, which is a huge save of both time and memory. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(<= n) n is the average number of nonzero features in each sample. Extensive experimental results on four real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

J	Wang, F; Zhang, CS				Wang, Fei; Zhang, Changshui			Label propagation through linear Neighborhoods	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						structured data mining; semisupervised learning; graph; label propagation; linear neighborhoods	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; CLASSIFICATION; EM	In many practical data mining applications such as text classification, unlabeled training examples are readily available, but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semisupervised learning algorithms have aroused considerable interests from the data mining and machine learning fields. In recent years, graph-based semisupervised learning has been becoming one of the most active research areas in the semisupervised learning community. In this paper, a novel graph- based semisupervised learning approach is proposed based on a linear neighborhood model, which assumes that each data point can be linearly reconstructed from its neighborhood. Our algorithm, named Linear Neighborhood Propagation ( LNP), can propagate the labels from the labeled points to the whole data set using these linear neighborhoods with sufficient smoothness. A theoretical analysis of the properties of LNP is presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also derive an easy way to extend LNP to out-of-sample data. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit, and text classification tasks.

An assessment of qualitative performance of machine learning architectures: Modular feedback networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						delay vector variance; nonlinearity; pipelined recurrent neural networks (PRNNs); qualitative performance; sensitivity	NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME-SERIES; NONLINEARITY; DETERMINISM	A framework for the assessment of qualitative performance of machine learning architectures is proposed. For generality, the analysis is provided for the modular nonlinear pipelined recurrent neural network (PRNN) architecture. This is supported by a sensitivity analysis, which is achieved based upon the prediction performance with respect to changes in the nature of the processed signal and by utilizing the recently introduced delay vector variance (DVV) method for phase space signal characterization. Comprehensive simulations combining the quantitative and qualitative analysis on both linear and nonlinear signals suggest that better quantitative prediction performance may need to be traded in order to preserve the nature of the processed signal, especially where the signal nature is of primary importance (biomedical applications).

The groups are described by means of relational logic features, extracted from publicly available GO information, and are straightforwardly interpretable by medical experts. We applied the proposed method to three gene expression data sets with the following respective sets of sample classes: 1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) versus acute myeloid leukemia (AML); 2) seven subtypes of ALL; and 3) 14 different types of cancers. Significant number of discovered groups of genes had a description that highlighted the underlying biological process responsible for distinguishing one class from the other classes. The quality of the discovered descriptions was also verified by cross validation. We believe that the. presented approach will significantly contribute to the application of relational machine learning to gene expression analysis, given the expected increase in both the quality and quantity of gene/protein annotations in the, near future.

This study proposes a use of a multi-agent intelligent simulator (MAIS) to numerically examine several reasons regarding why the crisis has occurred during May 2000-Janurary 2001. The MAIS explains the price fluctuation of wholesale electricity during the crisis with estimation accuracy (91.15%). We also find that 40.46% of the price increase was due to an increase in marginal production cost, 17.85% to traders' greediness, 5.27% to a real demand change and 3.56% to market power. The remaining 32.86% came e front the other unknown components. This result indicates that the price hike has occurred due to an increase in fuel prices and real demand. The two market fundamentals explained 45.73% (= 40.46%+5.27%) of the price increase. The responsibility of energy firms was 21.41% (= 17.85%+3.56%). The numerical evidences are different from the very well-known research of Joskow and Kahn (2002), which has attributed the exercise of market power by large energy firms.

Binary shape is a very popular and commendable one. It has many advantages and can be successfully used in many applications, especially in engineering. To achieve better characteristics, various shape transformations are used. Obviously, they should be robust to as many shape deformations as it is possible. In this paper results of exhaustive exploration of a new method are presented. This method is based on transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, but it overcomes few problems, that were not solved yet. Above all, the proposed transform is more robust to occlusion and noise, two the most challenging problems.

J	Maillot, NE; Thonnat, M				Maillot, Nicolas Eric; Thonnat, Monique			Ontology based complex object recognition	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						ontology; machine learning; categorization; cognitive vision	KNOWLEDGE	This paper presents a new approach for object categorization involving the following aspects of cognitive vision: learning, recognition and knowledge representation. A major element of our approach is a visual concept ontology composed of several types of concepts (spatial concepts and relations, color concepts and texture concepts). Visual concepts contained in this ontology can be seen as an intermediate layer between domain knowledge and image processing procedures. Machine learning techniques are used to solve the symbol grounding problem (i.e. linking meaningfully symbols to sensory information). This paper shows, how a new object categorization system is set up by a knowledge acquisition and learning phase and then used by an object categorization phase. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical mode decomposition for simultaneous image enhancement and fusion	IMAGE FUSION: ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter							FACE RECOGNITION; REMOVAL	Image enhancement and restoration via information fusion is addressed using the inherent fission properties of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Fission via EMD describes the adaptive decomposition of an image signal into a set of oscillatory modes that act as a set of naturally derived basis functions. Embedded in the modes are the frequency scales of the image data. Given that a variety of humanly observable image features such as object texture or degradation effects such as noise can often be attributed to local variations in specific spatial frequencies, it follows that the behaviour of the extracted image modes reflect these features. Simultaneous restoration and enhancement can be achieved by fusion of the 'relevant' modes. The fusion process can be used to highlight specific image attributes to aid machine vision tasks such as object recognition. Examples on a variety of image processing problems from denoising through to the fusion of visual and thermal images support the analysis and also it is demonstrated how machine learning techniques such as adaptive filtering can be combined with EMD to enhance the fusion process.

The main idea of the proposed method is to avoid the error pooling step of many factors (in frequential and spatial domain) commonly applied to obtain a final quality score. A classification process based on the Support Vector Machine method is designed to obtain the final quality class with respect to the standard quality scale provided by the UIT. Thus, for each degraded color image, a feature vector is computed including several Human Visual System characteristics, such as, contrast masking effect, color correlation, and so on. Selected features are of two kinds: 1) full-reference features and 2) no-reference characteristics. That way, a machine learning expert, providing a final class number is designed.

We compare the use of different POS, namely nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs with a feature set that contains all POS. The best results are obtained with the use of only nouns. Therefore, we make use of a WordNet-based POS feature selection approach using the nouns feature set to compare with popular feature selection methods, namely Chi Square (Chi2) and Information Gain (IG). We find that the WordNet-based POS approach using only nouns as features can outperform Chi2 and IG in categorization effectiveness. Here, a machine learning approach to text categorization is employed and the Reuters-21578 top ten categories are used as the dataset.

We present a generalization of the composition of weighted transducers, 3-way composition, which is dramatically faster in practice than the standard composition algorithm when combining more than two transducers. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm for composing three transducers T-1, T-2, and T-3 resulting in T, is O(vertical bar T vertical bar(Q) min(d(T-1)d(T-3), d(T-2)) + vertical bar T vertical bar(E)), where vertical bar (.) vertical bar Q denotes the number of states, vertical bar (.) vertical bar(E) the number of transitions, and d((.)) the maximum out-degree. As in regular composition, the use of perfect hashing requires a pre-processing step with linear-time expected complexity in the size of the input transducers. In many cases, this approach significantly improves on the complexity of standard composition. Our algorithm also leads to a dramatically faster composition in practice. Furthermore, standard composition can be obtained as a special case of our algorithm. We report the results of several experiments demonstrating this improvement. These theoretical and empirical improvements significantly enhance performance in the applications already mentioned.

The scalability problem of bandwidth broker, being a centralised resource manager in a domain, can be solved by employing a distributed architecture. The decisions regarding the distributed architecture, namely, number and location of distributed entities can be best solved using computational intelligence. This paper focuses on the fuzzy logic based approach for resolving architectural issues of Bandwidth Broker. In addition, we also propose two phase resource allocation algorithm for bandwidth broker. In first phase, when large amount of resources are available, fuzzy logic is used for decision making to reduce processing overhead. In case of low resource availability, the resource allocation algorithm transitions to second phase, where crisp values are used for decision purpose. His paper proposes a novel idea of using fuzzy logic for architectural and resource management aspects of the bandwidth broker. The scalability problem of bandwidth broker, being a centralised resource manager in a domain, can be solved by employing a distributed architecture. The decisions regarding the distributed architecture, namely, number and location of distributed entities can be best solved using computational intelligence.

Kernels are actually the natural entry point for inserting prior knowledge into the learning process. Inductive logic programming (ILP), on the other hand, offers a powerful and flexible framework for describing existing background knowledge and extracting additional knowledge from the data. It therefore seems natural to explore the synergy between these two important paradigms of machine learning. In this extended abstract (see [1] for a longer version), I briefly review some of our recent work about statistical learning with kernel machines in the ILP setting.

Recent work has extended these boundaries even further by unifying these two powerful learning frameworks. However, new frontiers await. Current techniques are capable of learning only a subset of the knowledge needed by practitioners in important domains, and further unification of probabilistic and logical learning offers a unique ability to produce the full range of knowledge needed in a wide range of applications.

Specifically, SSST exploits the feasible paths in the control flow graph, that is, paths which are actually exerted for some values of the program input; the limitation is that feasible paths are massively outnumbered by infeasible ones. Addressing this limitation, this paper presents an active learning algorithm aimed at sampling the feasible paths in the control flow graph. The difficulty comes from both the few feasible paths initially available and the nature of the feasible path concept, reflecting the long-range dependencies among the nodes of the control flow graph. The proposed approach is based on a frugal representation inspired from Parikh maps, and on the identification of the conjunctive subconcepts in the feasible path concept within a Disjunctive Version Space framework. Experimental validation on real-world and artificial problems demonstrates significant improvements compared to the state of the art.

We propose a new SRL algorithm, GleanerSRL, to generate the probability that an example is positive within highly-skewed relational domains. In this work, we combine clauses from Gleaner, an ILP algorithm for learning a wide variety of first-order clauses, with the propositional learning technique of support vector machines to learn well-calibrated probabilities. We find that our results are comparable to SRL algorithms SAYU and SAYU-VISTA on a well-known relational testbed.

Existing methods either try to gain this information by analysis of the program code or by running extensive timing analyses. This paper presents a new approach to the problem based on using Machine Learning in the form of ILP to infer program properties based on sample executions of the code. Additionally, significant improvements in the range of functions learnable and the time taken for learning can be made by the application of more advanced ILP techniques.

To overcome this shortcoming we propose L-modification, a modification to this evaluation function such that the lengths of individual examples are considered. We use a set of bio-sequences known as neuropeptide precursor middles (NPP-middles). Using L-modification to learn from these NPP-middles results in induced grammars that have a better performance than that achieved when using the standard positive-only clause evaluation function. We also show that L-modification improves the performance of induced grammars when learning on short, medium or long NPPs-middles. A potential disadvantage of L-modification is discussed. Finally, we show that, as the limit on the search space size increases, the greater is the increase in predictive performance arising from L-modification.

A typical example of this in the biomedical context is antibiotic resistance, where pathogen sensitivity may change over time as new pathogen strains develop resistance to antibiotics that were previously effective. This problem, known as concept drift, complicates the task of learning a model from data and requires special approaches, different from commonly used techniques that treat arriving instances as equally important contributors to the final concept. The underlying data distribution may change as well, making previously built models useless. This is known as virtual concept drift. Both types of concept drifts make regular updates of the model necessary. Among the most popular and effective approaches to handle concept drift is ensemble learning, where a set of models built over different time periods is maintained and the best model is selected or the predictions of models are combined, usually according to their expertise level regarding the current concept. In this paper we propose the use of an ensemble integration technique that would help to better handle concept drift at an instance level. In dynamic integration of classifiers, each base classifier is given a weight proportional to its local accuracy with regard to the instance tested, and the best base classifier is selected, or the classifiers are integrated using weighted voting. Our experiments with synthetic data sets simulating abrupt and gradual concept drifts and with a real-world antibiotic resistance data set demonstrate that dynamic integration of classifiers built over small time intervals or fixed-sized data blocks can be significantly better than majority voting and weighted voting, which are currently the most commonly used integration techniques for handling concept drift with ensembles.

Ensemble methods for anomaly detection and distributed intrusion detection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						multiple classifier systems; ensemble methods; anomaly detection; distributed detection; intrusion detection; Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks	MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; FUSION STRATEGIES; NOVELTY DETECTION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	This paper examines the problem of distributed intrusion detection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), utilizing ensemble methods. A three-level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (intrusion detection systems) are attached to each node of the MANET, collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the mismatch between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which averages the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager which averages them. On the theoretical side, we show that averaging improves detection rates under very mild conditions concerning the distributions of the anomaly indexes of the normal class and the anomalous class. On the practical side, the paper describes clustering algorithms to update cluster centers and machine learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes. The complete suite of algorithms was implemented and tested, under two types of MANET routing protocols and two types of attacks against the routing infrastructure. Performance evaluation was effected by determining the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the ROC curve (AUC) metrics for various operational conditions. The overall results confirm the theoretical developments related with the benefits of averaging with detection accuracy improving as we move up in the node-cluster-manager hierarchy.

The most remarkable characteristic of the proposed model is that it is able to extract high-level features that reflect the semantic content of the images. This is accomplished by a semantic mapper that maps conventional low-level features to high-level features using state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. The semantic mapper is trained using images labeled by a pathologist. The system was tested on a collection of 1502 histopathology images and the performance assessed using standard measures. The results show an improvement from a 67% of average precision for the first result, using low-level features, to 80% of precision using high-level features.

Combating Spamdexing has become one of the top challenges for web search. Machine learning based methods have shown their superiority for being easy to adapt to newly developed spam techniques. In this paper, we propose a two-stage classification strategy to detect web spam, which is based on the predicted spamicity of learning algorithms and hyperlink propagation. Preliminary experiments on standard WEBSPAM-UK2006 benchmark show that the two-stage strategy is reasonable and effective.

The online feature requires the spam filter has a strong timely generalization and has a high processing speed. Machine learning can be employed to fulfill the two requirements. In this paper, we propose a SVMEL (SVM Ensemble Learning) method to combine five simple filters for higher accuracy and an active learning method to choose training emails for less training time. The experiments results show the filter applying active learning method can reduce requirements of labeled training emails and reach steady-state performance more quickly.

Here, sex identification is taken as a base study in information mining in chat mediums. In order to do this, a simple discrimination function and semantic analysis method are proposed for sex identification in Turkish chat mediums. Then, the proposed sex identification method is compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) methods. Finally, results show that the proposed system has achieved accuracy over 90% in sex identification.

J	Kapociute-Dzikiene, J; Raskinis, A				Kapociute-Dzikiene, Jurgita; Raskinis, Arimantas			Hierarchical classificator: A cognitive approach to decision tree building	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL			English	Article								We present a new algorithm that follows "divide and conquer" machine learning approach and exhibits a few interesting cognitive properties. The algorithm aims at building the decision tree with only one terminal node per class. Splits of tree nodes are constrained to functions that take identical values (true or false) for every instance within the same class. Appropriate splits are found through an exhaustive search in the attribute-value-based function space. Simple single-attribute functions are considered before complex multi-attribute k-DNF type ones. Redundant functions are also being incorporated into the decision tree. The unique structure of the decision tree results in that semantic interpretation can be attached to both terminal and non-terminal nodes, the task-specific set of classes is structured within a hierarchy of similarity relationships, and sources of recognition errors can be traced back (localized) to some particular function/split in the decision tree. The new algorithm was implemented, experimentally evaluated and compared with the well-known machine learning techniques Ripper and C4.5. Though limited in scope the experiments showed that the new algorithm can perform at least as well as Ripper and C4.5. Redundant knowledge incorporated into the decision tree helped to improve the recognition accuracy.

The incorporation of fuzzy set theory into nearest neighbor classification makes the decision process more flexible and adaptable to noise in the data. We have also embodied an efficient approach for nearest neighbor search in our algorithm which results in significant reduction in computational time during training and classification. We present results of classification of different data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach for classification purposes. We also give an application of the proposed classification methodology to electrocardiogram (ECG) based recognition of 9 types of arrhythmias using wavelet domain features.

Aiming at some problems, which include high false alarm rate, difficulties in obtaining exactly clean data for the modeling of normal patterns and the deterioration of detection rate because of some "noisy" data(unclean data) in the training set, in current intrusion detection techniques, we propose a novel network anomaly detection method based on MRMHC-SVM machine learning algorithm. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect anomalies with high true positive rate and low false positive rate than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, the proposed method retains good detection performance after employing feature selection aiming at avoiding the "curse of dimensionality". In addition, even interfered by "noisy" data, it is robust and effective.

Investigating the optimal number of attributes to manage knowledge performances	INNOVATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN BUSINESS GLOBALIZATION: THEORY & PRACTICE, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International-Business-Information-Management-Association Conference	JUN 30-JUL 01, 2008	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA					Rules are the most important element in knowledge extraction. The performance or strength of rules will determine how good a model is. Higher accuracy implies that a model is good and vise versa. However, the strength of rules depends on the attributes. The number of attributes in a rule can influence the percentage of accuracy in a model. Most machine learning techniques produce a large number of rules. The consequence is with large number of rules generated, processing time is much longer. This study investigated the performances of rules with different lengths of attribute and identified the optimal number of rule for a good model. The research performed experiments using several data mining techniques. Data of 50 hardware dataset companies which, contains 31 attributes and 400 records was used. Results showed that in terms of number of rules, Genetic Algorithm (GA) produced the highest number of rules followed by Johnson's Algorithm and Holie's 1R. The best classifier for extracting rules in this study is VOT (Voting of Object Tracking). In terms of performance of rules, best results comes from rules with 30 attributes, followed by rules with I intersection attribute and lastly rules with 3 intersection attributes. Among the three sets of attributes, the set with 3 attributes arc, considered as the best and three (3) has been identified as the optimal number of attributes.

Military communities of interest are beginning to use blogs and related tools for information sharing, providing a comparable environment to the use of blogs for system requirement discussions. This paper describes the work in the area being performed under the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Comparisons are then made to how the technology could provide similar capabilities for a requirements analysis environment. An additional discussion of how the task learning capabilities from PAL could also benefit requirements analysis in a rapid prototyping process is provided.

Previous anti-money laundering (AML) systems were mostly rule-based systems which suffered from low efficiency and could can be easily learned and evaded by money launders. Recently researchers have begun to use machine learning methods to solve the suspicious activity detection problem. However nearly all these methods focus on detecting suspicious activities on accounts or individual level. In this paper we propose a sequence matching based algorithm to identify suspicious sequences in transactions. Our method aims to pick out suspicious transaction sequences using two kinds of information as reference sequences: 1) individual account's transaction history and 2) transaction information from other accounts in a peer group. By introducing the reference sequences, we can combat those who want to evade regulations by simply learning and adapting reporting criteria, and easily detect suspicious patterns. The initial results show that our approach is highly accurate.

Increasingly people are expressing their views on these events and government agencies' responses and policies online. Recent years have seen significant interest in investigating methods to recognize favorable and unfavorable sentiments towards specific subjects, including public health opinions, from online natural language text. However, most of these efforts are focused on English. In this paper, we study Chinese opinion mining in the context of public health opinions. We explore two complementary approaches-a Chinese opinionated word-based approach and a machine learning approach. We also conduct related comparative analysis and discuss the important role Chinese NLP techniques play in polarity classification.

The first step has been to conceive a multi-agent environment that supports simulation of disasters, taking into account geospatial, temporal and rescue organizational information. The problem we address is the acquisition of situated expert knowledge that is used to organize rescue missions. We propose an approach based on participatory techniques, interactive learning and machine learning. This paper presents an algorithm that incrementally builds a model of the expert knowledge by online analysis of its interaction with the simulator's proposed scenario.

LEARNING APPROACHES APPLIED TO HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION FOR SPACE MISSIONS	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Interactive Learning; Human Robot Collaboration; Machine Learning		Advances in space science and technology have enabled humanity to reach a stage where we are able to send manned and unmanned vehicles to explore nearby planets. However, given key differences between terrestrial and space environments such as differences in atmospheric content and pressure, acceleration due to gravity among many others between our planet and those we wish to explore, it is not always easy or feasible to expect all mission related tasks to be accomplished by astronauts alone. The presence of robots that specialize in different tasks would greatly enhance our capabilities and enable better overall performance. In this paper we discuss a methodology for building a robotic system that can learn to perform tasks via interactive learing. This teaming functionality extends the ability for a robot agent to operate with similar competence as their human teacher- whether astronaut, mission designer, or engineer. We provide details on our approach and give representative examples of applying the different methods in relevant task scenarios.

J	Choo, YH; Abu Bakar, A; Hamdan, AR				Choo, Yun-Huoy; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza; Hamdan, Abdul Razak			The fitness-rough: A new attribute reduction method based on statistical and rough set theory	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						attribute reduction; fitness degree; information loss; rough reducts; heuristic rule	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; INFORMATION; DEPENDENCY	Attribute reduction has become an important pre-processing task to reduce the complexity of the data mining task. Rough reducts, statistical methods and correlation-based methods have gradually contributed towards improving attribute reduction techniques to a certain extent. Statistical methods are generally lower in computational complexity compared to the rough reducts and the correlation-based methods, but many have proven that the rough reducts method is significant in reducing important attributes without causing too much information loss. Correlation-based methods on the other hand evaluate features as a subset instead of individual attribute. In this paper, we propose a combination of statistical and rough set methods to reduce important attributes in a simpler way while maintaining a lesser degree of information loss from the raw data. The fitness-rough method (FsR) indicates important attributes from raw data and it is further simplified to a more compact information table. Besides that, we have also looked into the problem of information loss in this method. Ten UCI machine learning datasets were used as testing sets on the proposed method as compared to the classical rough reducts (RR) method, the statistical entropy ( ENT) method and the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. Experimental results show that our method has performed comparatively well with higher reduction strength and smaller rules set against the benchmarking methods, especially in medium size datasets. However, the FsR method is basically less efficient when used on mix-mode and nominal datasets as the non-quantitative attributes involved in these datasets are normally pre-categorised.

If the dataset has a sufficient amount of labeled data points, the optimal value for the hyperparameter can be found via validation by using a subset of the given dataset. However, for semi-supervised learning-one of the most recent learning algorithms-this is not as available as in conventional supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning it is assumed that the dataset is given with only a few labeled data points. Therefore, holding out some of labeled data points for validation is not easy. ne lack of labeled data points, furthermore. makes it difficult to estimate the degree of noise in the dataset. To circumvent the addressed difficulties, we propose to employ ensemble learning and graph sharpening. The former replaces the hyperparameter selection procedure to an ensemble network of the committee members trained with various values of hyperparameter. The latter, oil the other hand. improves the performance of algorithms by removing unhelpful information flow by noise. The experimental result, present that the proposed method can improve performance on a publicly available bench-marking problems.

It is shown that a complex decision for global situation can be disassembled into a series of simple local problems, from which the most satisfactory decision for the local can be found out by individual ways respectively. At the lower level of total score, the best decision for the local, according to the mathematical interpretation of weight, can be considered as the decision whose distribution of scores is just consistent with the distribution of the psychological weight (or preference) of a decision maker. At a series of moderate levels, the evaluation criterion is given by human-machine interaction, in which some satisfactory samples are chosen by decision maker from a lot of samples, and the barycentre of criterion and the radius of criterion can be estimated by a learning algorithm. In this way, the most satisfactory decision for the local made by the decision maker at each level can be tracked. If we let the collection of satisfactory decision for global be the union of the local's most satisfactory decision at all levels, then the changing process of psychological criteria which varies with the change of total score can be deduced. Finally, a satisfactory degree function with which the global consistency of the collection of local satisfactory decisions at all levels could be retained is given, and a global ranking approach based on the function as well.

When used incrementally, it needs to eliminate conflict between the concept already learned and the new events to be learnt.

However, one difficulty for the application of RL control is its slow convergence, especially in environments with continuous state space. In this paper, a modified structure of RL is proposed to speed up reinforcement learning control. In this approach, supervision technique is combined with the standard Q-learning, a model-free algorithm of reinforcement learning. The a priori information is provided to the RL by an optimal LQ-controller, used to indicate preferred actions at intermittent times. It is shown that the convergence speed of the supervised RL agent is greatly improved compared to the conventional Q-Learning algorithm. Simulation work and results on the cart-pole balancing problem are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Using a machine-learning program that learns cognitive skills from examples, we have conducted a study to compare three learning strategies: learning by solving problems with feedback and hints from a tutor, learning by generalizing worked-out examples exhaustively, and learning by generalizing worked-out examples only for the skills that need to be generalized. The results showed that learning by tutored problem solving outperformed other learning strategies. The advantage of tutored problem solving was mostly due to the error detection and correction that was available only when skills were applied incorrectly. The Current study also suggested that learning certain kinds of conditions to apply rules only for appropriate Situations is quite difficult.

These were developed for various languages (Pascal, Prolog, Lisp, C++) and programming paradigms (procedural and declarative) but never for object-oriented programming in Java. JavaBugs builds a bug library automatically using discrepancies between a student and correct program. While other works analyze code snippets or UML diagrams to infer student knowledge of object-oriented design and programming, JavaBugs examines a complete Java program and identifies the most similar correct program to the student's solution among a collection of correct solutions and builds trees of misconceptions using similarity measures and background knowledge. Experiments show that JavaBugs can detect the most similar correct program 97% of the time, and discover and detect 61.4% of student misconceptions identified by the expert.

This shell synergistically integrates general problem solving, learning and tutoring engines and has been used to build a complex cognitive assistant for intelligence analysts. This assistant has been successfully used and evaluated in courses at US Army War College and George Mason University. The goal of this paper is to provide an intuitive overview of the tutoring-related capabilities of this shell which rely heavily on its problem solving and learning capabilities. They include the capability to rapidly acquire the basic abstract problem solving strategies of the application domain, directly from a subject matter expert. They allow an instructional designer to rapidly design lessons for teaching these abstract problem solving strategies, without the need of defining examples because they are automatically generated by the system from the domain knowledge base. They also allow rapid learning of test questions to assess students' problem solving knowledge. The proposed type of cognitive assistant, capable of learning, problem solving and tutoring, as well as the learning and tutoring agent shell used to build it, represent a very promising and expected evolution for the knowledge-based agents for "ill-defined" domains.

However, too often, ediscussions are not fruitful and moderation is needed. We describe our approach, which employs intelligent data analysis techniques, to support teachers as they inoderate multiple simultaneous discussions. We have generated six inachine-learned classifiers for detecting potentially important discussion characteristics, such as a "reasoned claim" and an "arguiTient-couiitei'ai-gument" sequence. All of our classifiers have achieved satisfactory Kappa values and are integrated in an online classification system. We hypothesize how a teacher might use this information by means of two authentic e-discussion examples. Finally, we discuss ways to bootstrap from these fine-grained classifications to the analysis of more complex patterns of interaction.

In order to moderate several simultalleous e-discussions effectively, teachers must be alerted regarding events of interest. We focused oil the identification of clusters of contributions representing interaction patterns that are of pedagogical interest (e.g., a student clarifies his or her opinion and then gets feedback frorn other students). We designed an algorithm that takes an example cluster as input and uses inexact graph matching, text analysis, and machine learning classifiers to search for similar patterns in a given corpus. The method was evaluated on an annotated dataset of real ediscussions and was able to detect almost 80% of the annotated Clusters while providing acceptable precision performance.

One of the most popular methods for estimating students' knowledge is Corbett and Anderson's [6] Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model. The model uses four parameters per skill, fit using student performance data, to relate performance to learning. Beck [1] showed that existing methods for detemm ing these parameters are prone to the Identiftability Problem: the same performance data can be fit equally well by different parameters, with different implications on system behavior. Beck offered a solution based on Dirichlet Priors [1], but, we show this solution is vulnerable to a different problem, Model Degeneracy, where parameter values violate the model's conceptual meaning (such as a student being more likely to get a correct answer if he/she does not know a skill than if he/she does). We offer a new method for instantiating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, using machine learning to make contextual estimations of the probability that a student has guessed or slipped. This method is no more prone to problems with Identifiability than Beck's solution, has less Model Degeneracy than competing approaches, and fits student performance data better than prior methods. Thus, it allows for more accurate and reliable student modeling in ITSs that use knowledge tracing.	[Baker, Ryan S.

In this work, we study the effects of such lexical ambiguities on second language vocabulary learning. We demonstrate that machine learning algorithms for word sense disambiguation can induce classifiers that exhibit high accuracy at the task of disambiguating homonyms (words with multiple distinct meanings). Results from a user study that compared two versions of a vocabulary tutoring system, one that applied word sense disambiguation to support learning and another that did not, support rejection of the null hypothesis that learning outcomes with and without word sense disambiguation are equivalent, with a p-value of 0.001. To our knowledge this is the first work that investigates the efficacy of word sense disambiguation for facilitating second language vocabulary learning.

Previous research has shown that note-taking leads to improved learning and performance on assessment. It was therefore hypothesized that note-taking could play an important role in narrative-centered learning. To investigate this question, a note-taking facility was introduced into a narrative-centered learning environment. Students were able to use the facility to take and review notes while solving a science mystery. In this paper we explore the individual differences of note-takers and the notes they take. Finally, we use machine learning techniques to model the content of student notes to support future pedagogical adaptation in narrative-centered learning environments.

For information Extraction tasks, we led an experimentation in which we exposed a group of 17 learners to a series of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Decision tree classifier has demonstrated the best ability to learn model structure from data collected. Among the emotions involved in learning and according to the picture from IAPS and the current emotional state, we drew up the transition diagram. Our model aims to improve the task of predicting the emotional state in an Intelligent Tutoring System and achieve a prediction accuracy of 63.11 %. These results suggest that the implementation of the decision tree algorithm in the intelligent tutoring system we are developing improves the ability for an ITS to track the learners emotional states.

Attempts have been made to manually construct such skills, with systematic categorization of silences, prosody and other candidate turn-giving signals, and to use analysis of corpora to produce static decision trees for this purpose. However, for general-purpose turntaking skills which vary between individuals and cultures, a system that can learn them on-the-job would be best. We are exploring ways to use machine learning to have an agent learn proper turntaking during interaction. We have implemented a talking agent that continuously adjusts its turntaking behavior to its interlocutors based on realtime analysis of the other party's prosody. Initial results from experiments on collaborative, content-free dialogue show that, for a given subset of turntaking conditions, our modular reinforcement learning techniques allow the system to learn to take turns in an efficient, human-like manner.

The input data are generated from a nonlinear mathematical model of the protein concentration. The protein concentrations from CDC6 data with actual kinetic parameter are taken as the target output. The data are then trained using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with a 6-6-6 configuration. The allocation of the data will be distributed into 3 categories that are 80% as training data, 10% as validation data, and 10% as test data. The learning rules used in this work to determine the best model are gradient descent, conjugate gradient, scaled conjugate gradient. It is found that the MLP with scaled conjugate gradient learning rule gives the best prediction rate.

Machine learning-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for crisp and fuzzy classification of DNA microarrays in cancer research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve; area under the curve (AUC); soft computing; fuzzy classification; gene expression; DNA microarrays	DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES; SAMPLE-SIZE; PARTICLE SWARM; BREAST-CANCER; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; TUMOR; POWER	Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to obtain classification area under the curve (AUC) as a function of feature standardization, fuzzification, and sample size from nine large sets of cancer-related DNA microarrays. Classifiers used included k-nearest neighbor (kNN), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), learning vector quantization (LVQ1), logistic regression (LOG), polytomous logistic regression (PLOG), artificial neural networks (ANN), particle swarm optimization (PSO), constricted particle swarm optimization (CPSO), kernel regression (RBF), radial basis function networks (RBFN), gradient descent support vector machines (SVMGD), and least squares support vector machines (SVMLS). For each data set, AUC was determined for a number of combinations of sample size, total sum[-log(p)] of feature t-tests, with and without feature standardization and with (fuzzy) and without (crisp) fuzzification of features. Altogether, a total of 2,123,530 classification runs were made. At the greatest level of sample size, ANN resulted in a fitted AUC of 90%, while PSO resulted in the lowest fitted AUC of 72.1%. AUC values derived from 4NN were the most dependent on sample size, while PSO was the least. ANN depended the most on total statistical significance of features used based on sum[-log(p)], whereas PSO was the least dependent. Standardization of features increased AUC by 8.1% for PSO and -0.2% for QDA, while fuzzification increased AUC by 9.4% for PSO and reduced AUC by 3.8% for QDA. AUC determination in planned microarray experiments without standardization and fuzzification of features will benefit the most if CPSO is used for lower levels of feature significance (i.e., sum[-log(p)] similar to 50) and ANN is used for greater levels of significance (i.e., sum[-log(p)] similar to 500). When only standardization of features is performed, studies are likely to benefit most by using CPSO for low levels of feature statistical significance and LVQ1 for greater levels of significance. Studies involving only fuzzification of features should employ LVQ1 because of the substantial gain in AUC observed and low expense of LVQ1. Lastly, PSO resulted in significantly greater levels of AUC (89.51% average) when feature standardization and fuzzification were performed. In consideration of the data sets used and factors influencing AUC which were investigated, if low-expense computation is desired then LVQ1 is recommended. However, if computational expense is of less concern, then PSO or CPSO is recommended. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Starting from BioDCV, a complete software setup for predictive classification and feature ranking without selection bias, we apply semisupervised profiling for detecting outliers and deriving informative sub-types of patients. During the profiling process, sampletracking curves are extracted, and then clustered according to a distance derived from dynamic time warping. Sampletracking allows also the identification of outlier cases, whose removal is shown to improve predictive accuracy and stability of derived gene profiles. Here we propose to employ clinical features to validate the sernisupervising procedure. The procedure is demonstrated in the analysis of a liver cancer dataset of 213 samples described by 1993 genes and by pathological features. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Clustering and visualization approaches for human cell cycle gene expression data analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						preprocessing analysis; data analysis; data visualization; microarray data	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PATTERNS; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION	In this work a comprehensive multi-step machine learning data mining and data visualization framework is introduced. The different steps of the approach are: preprocessing, clustering, and visualization. A preprocessing based on a Robust Principal Component Analysis Neural Network for feature extraction of unevenly sampled data is used. Then a Probabilistic Principal Surfaces approach combined with an agglomerative procedure based on Fisher's and Negentropy information is applied for clustering and labeling purposes. Furthermore, a Multi-Dimensional Scaling approach for a 2-dimensional data visualization of the clustered and labeled data is used. The method, which provides a user-friendly visualization interface in both 2 and 3 dimensions, can work on noisy data with missing points, and represents an automatic procedure to get, with no a priori assumptions, the number of clusters present in the data. Analysis and identification of genes periodically expressed in a human cancer cell line (HeLa) using cDNA microarrays is carried out as test case. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Single gene analysis is insufficient to describe the complex perturbations responsible for cancer onset, progression and invasion. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis can be reached focusing on deregulation of gene sets or pathways rather than on individual genes. We apply two known and statistically well founded methods for finding pathways and biological processes deregulated in pathological conditions by analyzing gene expression profiles. In particular, we measure the amount of deregulation and assess the statistical significance of predefined pathways belonging to a curated collection ( Molecular Signature Database) in a colon cancer data set. We find that pathways strongly involved in different tumors are strictly connected with colon cancer. Moreover, our experimental results show that the study of complex diseases through pathway analysis is able to highlight genes weakly connected to the phenotype which may be difficult to detect by using classical univariate statistics. Our study shows the importance of using gene sets rather than single genes for understanding the main biological processes and pathways involved in colorectal cancer. Our analysis evidences that many of the genes involved in these pathways are strongly associated to colorectal tumorigenesis. In this new perspective, the focus shifts from finding differentially expressed genes to identifying biological processes, cellular functions and pathways perturbed in the phenotypic conditions by analyzing genes co-expressed in a given pathway as a whole, taking into account the possible interactions among them and, more importantly, the correlation of their expression with the phenotypical conditions.

A machine learning methodology for the analysis of workplace accidents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering	SEP, 2006	Madrid, SPAIN			machine learning; statistics; operations research; data mining; artificial intelligence	PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; PROPAGATION	This article proposes a methodology for the analysis of the causes and types of workplace accidents (in this paper we focus specifically on floor-level falls). The approach is based on machine learning techniques: Bayesian networks trained using different algorithms (with and without a priori information), classification trees, support vector machines and extreme learning machines. The results obtained using the different techniques are compared in terms of explanatory capacity and predictive potential, both factors facilitating the development of risk prevention measures. Bayesian networks are revealed to be the best all-round technique for this type of study, as they combine a powerful interpretative capacity with a predictive capacity that is comparable to that of the best available techniques. Moreover, the Bayesian networks force experts to apply a scientific approach to the construction and progressive enrichment of their models and also enable the basis to be laid for an accident prevention policy that is solidly grounded. Furthermore, the procedure enables better variable definition, better structuring of the data capture, coding, and quality control processes.	[Matias, J.

Recently, many protein regions and some entire proteins have been identified with no definite tertiary structure, but presenting instead as dynamic, disorder ensembles Under different physiochemical circimstances. These proteins and regions are known as Intrinsically Unstructured regions and Proteins (IUP). We constructcd a Recursive Maximum Contrast Tree (RMCT) based classifier to identify IUP. The classifier has been benchmarked against industrial standard PONDR VLXT on out-of-sample, clata byexternalrrial evaluators. The IUP predictor is a viable alternative software tool for identifying intrinsic unstructured regions and proteins.

In an intuitive manner we introduce the main ideas of classification and regression trees, support vector machines, bagging, boosting and random forests. We discuss differences in the use of machine learning in the biomedical community and the computer sciences. We propose methods for comparing machines on a sound statistical basis. Data from the German Stroke Study Collaboration is used for illustration. We compare the results from learning machines to those obtained by a published logistic regression and discuss similarities and differences.	[Konig, I.

Robust kernel distance multivariate control chart using support vector principles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						control chart; support vector machines; kernel distance	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; AVERAGE CONTROL CHART; SUM CONTROL CHARTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; SHIFTS	It is important to monitor manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality and reduce production cost. Statistical Process Control (SPC) is the most commonly used method for process monitoring, in particular making distinctions between variations attributed to normal process variability to those caused by 'special causes'. Most SPC and multivariate SPC (MSPC) methods are parametric in that they make assumptions about the distributional properties and autocorrelation structure of in-control process parameters, and, if satisfied, are effective in managing false alarms/-positives and false-negatives. However, when processes do not satisfy these assumptions, the effectiveness of SPC methods is compromised. Several non-parametric control charts based on sequential ranks of data depth measures have been proposed in the literature, but their development and implementation have been rather slow in industrial process control. Several non-parametric control charts based on machine learning principles have also been proposed in the literature to overcome some of these limitations. However, unlike conventional SPC methods, these non-parametric methods require event data from each out-of-control process state for effective model building. The paper presents a new non-parametric multivariate control chart based on kernel distance that overcomes these limitations by employing the notion of one-class classification based on support vector principles. The chart is non-parametric in that it makes no assumptions regarding the data probability density and only requires 'normal' or in-control data for effective representation of an in-control process. It does, however, make an explicit provision to incorporate any available data from out-of-control process states. Experimental evaluation on a variety of benchmarking datasets suggests that the proposed chart is effective for process monitoring.	[Chinnam, R. B.; Ellis, R.

J	Patil, RJ				Patil, Rahul J.			Using ensemble and metaheuristics learning principles with artificial neural networks to improve due date prediction performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						metaheuristics; neural networks; due-date assignment; artificial intelligence; ensemble learning	ASSIGNMENT; SYSTEM	One of the common and important problems in production scheduling is to quote an attractive but attainable due date for an arriving customer order. Among a wide variety of prediction methods proposed to improve due date quotation (DDQ) accuracy, artificial neural networks (ANN) are considered the most effective because of their flexible non-linear and interaction effects modelling capability. In spite of this growing use of ANNs in a DDQ context, ANNs have several intrinsic shortcomings such as instability, bias and variance problems that undermine their accuracy. In this paper, we develop an enhanced ANN-based DDQ model using machine learning, evolutionary and metaheuristics learning concepts. Computational experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms the conventional ANN-based DDQ method under different shop environments and different training data sizes.

Object-based change detection using correlation image analysis and image segmentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REMOTE-SENSING DATA; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL	This study introduces change detection based on object/neighbourhood correlation image analysis and image segmentation techniques. The correlation image analysis is based on the fact that pairs of brightness values from the same geographic area (e.g. an object) between bi-temporal image datasets tend to be highly correlated when little change occurres, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Five different change detection methods were investigated to determine how new contextual features could improve change classification results, and if an object-based approach could improve change classification when compared with per-pixel analysis. The five methods examined include (1) object-based change classification incorporating object correlation images (OCIs), (2) object-based change classification incorporating neighbourhood correlation images (NCIs), (3) object-based change classification without contextual features, (4) per-pixel change classification incorporating NCIs, and (5) traditional per-pixel change classification using only bi-temporal image data. Two different classification algorithms (i.e. a machine-learning decision tree and nearest-neighbour) were also investigated. Comparison between the OCI and the NCI variables was evaluated. Object-based change classifications incorporating the OCIs or the NCIs produced more accurate change detection classes (Kappa approximated 90%) than other change detection results (Kappa ranged from 80 to 85%).

J	Yuan, F				Yuan, F.			Land-cover change and environmental impact analysis in the Greater Mankato area of Minnesota using remote sensing and GIS modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SATELLITE PERSPECTIVE; SURFACE RUNOFF; URBAN; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPE; TEXTURE; MICROCLIMATE; TEMPERATURE	Land use and land-cover (LULC) data provide essential information for environmental management and planning. This research evaluates the land-cover change dynamics and their effects for the Greater Mankato Area of Minnesota using image classification and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modelling in high-resolution aerial photography and QuickBird imagery. Results show that from 1971 to 2003, urban impervious surfaces increased from 18.3% to 32.6%, while cropland and grassland decreased from 54.2% to 39.1%. The dramatic urbanization caused evident environmental impacts in terms of runoff and water quality, whereas the annual air pollution removal rate and carbon storage/sequestration remained consistent since urban forests were steady over the 32-year span. The results also indicate that highly accurate land-cover features can be extracted effectively from high-resolution imagery by incorporating both spectral and spatial information, applying an image-fusion technique, and utilizing the hierarchical machine-learning Feature Analyst classifier. This research fills the high-resolution LULC data gap for the Greater Mankato Area. The findings of the study also provide valuable inputs for local decision-makers and urban planners.

J	Huang, X; Zhang, L; Li, P				Huang, X.; Zhang, L.; Li, P.			A multiscale feature fusion approach for classification of very high resolution satellite imagery based on wavelet transform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REMOTE-SENSING IMAGES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; URBAN AREAS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; LAND-DEVELOPMENT; TEXTURE; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; NETWORKS	A novel methodology based on multiscale spectral and spatial information fusion using wavelet transform is proposed in order to classify very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Conventional wavelet-based feature extraction methods employ single windows of a fixed size, which are not satisfactory as the VHR imagery contains complex and multiscale objects. In this paper, spectral and spatial features are extracted based on a set of concentric windows around a central pixel in order to integrate the information across different windows/scales. The proposed method is made up of three blocks: (1) the conventional wavelet-based feature extraction methods are extended from single band processing to multispectral bands, and from single window to multi-windows, (2) two multiscale fusion algorithms are proposed to exploit the multiscale spectral and spatial information and (3) a support vector machine (SVM), a relatively new method of machine learning, is used to classify the multiscale spectral-spatial feature sets. The proposed classification method is evaluated on two VHR datasets and the results show that the multiscale approach can improve the classification accuracy in homogeneous areas while simultaneously preserving accuracy in edge regions.

Model selection approaches for non-linear system identification: a review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Review						adaptive learning; cross validation; model selection; model generalisation; system identification; control engineering	ORTHOGONAL LEAST-SQUARES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BASIS FUNCTION NETWORKS; OPTIMALITY EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; VARIABLE SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; SUBSPACE IDENTIFICATION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS	The identification of non-linear systems using only observed finite datasets has become a mature research area over the last two decades. A class of linear-in-the-parameter models with universal approximation capabilities have been intensively studied and widely used due to the availability of many linear-learning algorithms and their inherent convergence conditions. This article presents a systematic overview of basic research on model selection approaches for linear-in-the-parameter models. One of the fundamental problems in non-linear system identification is to find the minimal model with the best model generalisation performance from observational data only. The important concepts in achieving good model generalisation used in various non-linear system-identification algorithms are first reviewed, including Bayesian parameter regularisation and models selective criteria based on the cross validation and experimental design. A significant advance in machine learning has been the development of the support vector machine as a means for identifying kernel models based on the structural risk minimisation principle. The developments on the convex optimisation-based model construction algorithms including the support vector regression algorithms are outlined. Input selection algorithms and on-line system identification algorithms are also included in this review. Finally, some industrial applications of non-linear models are discussed.

By extension, a form of chemical network computing, i.e., a massively parallel non-linear Computer, can be realised by Such an approach. In this initial study a light-sensitive sub-excitable BZ reaction in which a checkerboard image comprising of varying light intensity cells is projected onto the Surface of a thin silica gel impregnated with tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) catalyst and indicator is used to make the network. As a catalyst free BZ solution is swept past the gel, Pulses of wave fragments are injected into the checkerboard grid resulting in rich spatio-temporal behaviour. An evolutionary computing machine learning approach, a learning classifier system, is then shown able to direct the fragments through dynamic control of the light intensity within each cell in both simulated and real chemical systems.

This paper proposes a relatively transparent credit scoring model for evaluating the creditworthiness of the credit applicants through a hybrid data mining approach. The main motivation to apply this approach is to obtain a credit scoring model from a data set that not only have the required performance, but it is relatively interpretable. This objective is achieved through three steps and using complementary soli computing methods. In the first step, the fuzzy system is automatically generated from the data using a fuzzy clustering method. A genetic algorithim is used to increase the performance of the initial fuzzy inference system in the second phase. In the last phase a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to achieve two goals: to preserve the accuracy of the fuzzy model to a given value and to enhance the interpretability of the fuzzy model by reducing the fuzzy sets in the ride base. Two datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are selected to evaluate the proposed method.

Anyhow, the nature of manufacturing process dataset for the bad yield outcome is highly skewed where the majority class of good yield extremely outnumbers the minority class of bad yield. Comparison between the undersampling, over- sampling and SMOTE + VDM sampling technique indicates that the combination of SMOTE + VDM and undersampled dataset produced a robust classifier performance capable of handling better with different batches of prediction lest data sets. Furtherance, suitable distance function for SMOTE is needed to improve class recall and minimize overfilling whilst different approach on the majority class sampling is required to improve the class precision due to information loss by the undersampling.

This is due to the nature of the inherent limitations of current tools and databases and the ambiguity of the function definition. Additionally, standard methods of functional assignment involve sequence alignment to a gene function often fail to find the significant matches. This paper proposes a framework of machine learning method in predicting protein function irrespective of sequence similarity. The framework aims to provide a workflow on predicting protein function that combines both data mining and machine learning algorithms, Three main components are involved: pre-processing, model development and testing & evaluation. The study is expected to create a new method on feature selection processes towards predicting protein functional classes in addition to complementing the existing conventional method of functional assignment.

Both techniques apply different approach to perform classification but produce same structure of output with comparable result. Theoretically, different classifiers will generate different sets of rules via knowledge even though they are implemented to the same classification problem. Hence, the aim of this paper is to investigate the quality of knowledge produced by R-C and DTC when similar problems are presented to them. In this case, four important performance metrics are used as comparison, the accuracy of classification, rules quantity, rules length and rules coverage. Five dataset from UCI Machine Learning are chosen and then mined using R-C toolkit namely ROSETTA while C4.5 algorithm in WEKA application is chosen as DTC rule generator. The experimental result shows that R-C and DTC own capability to generate quality knowledge since most of the results are comparable. R-C outperform as an accurate classifier, produce shorter and simpler rule with higher coverage. Meanwhile, DTC obviously generates fewer numbers of rules with significant difference.

Therefore, it is important to use text mining to discover knowledge from these unstructured emails. Automatic email classification considered as one of important applications in text mining. It is the process of assigning a text email to one or more predefined classes based on their content. This paper focuses on classifying Arabic and English emails. Since Arabic language is highly inflectional and derivational language, this makes text mining a complex task. In our approach, we first preprocessed data using stemming natural language processing technique. Then, we used machine learning algorithm to classify emails. We ran an experiment on our approach using real data sets.

Circle-segments is a data visualization methods useful for feature selection to the reduce number of inputs but yet closely maintain the integrity of original data.

Design/methodology/approach - Machine learning approach was employed. About 2,000 human-annotated web documents were prepared for training and evaluation. The classification model was based on support vector machine, and the features used for the classification included the title and URL of documents, as well as information of the top page. Findings -With relatively small set of features, the proposed method achieved over 50 per cent accuracy. Research limitations/implications - Some of the information sender categories were found to be more difficult to classify. This is due to the subjective nature of the categories, and further refinement of the categories is needed. Practical implications - When combined with opinion/sentiment analysis techniques, information sender classification allows more profound analysis based on interactions between opinions and senders. Such analysis forms a basis of information credibility analysis. Originality/value - This study formulated the problem of information sender classification.

We first describe our approach to modelling decision discussions in spoken meetings and then compare two approaches to extracting information from these discussions. The first one uses an open-domain semantic parser that identifies candidate phrases for decision summaries and then employs machine learning techniques to select from those candidate phrases. The second one uses categorical and sequential classifiers that exploit simple syntactic and semantic features to identify words and phrases relevant for decision summarization.

We show that no-answers are emotional salient words and that it is possible to improve the accuracy of the classification of Human-computer dialogs by taking advantage of the high accuracy achieved on no-answer turns. We also show that stacked generalization using neural networks and SVM as base models improves the accuracy of each model while the combination of the no-model and the dialog model improves the accuracy of the dialog-model alone by 13%.

In this paper we combine both of them in a novel way by using statistical and syntactical dynamic bayesian networks (DBNs) together with Graphical Models (GMs) for spoken language understanding (SLU). GMs merge in a complex, mathematical way probability with graph theory. This results in four different setups which raise in their complexity. Comparing our results to a baseline system we achieve a F1-measure of 93.7% in word classes and 95.7% in concepts for our best setup in the ATIS-Task. This outperforms the baseline system relatively by 3.7% in word classes and by 8.2% in concepts. The expermiments were performend with the graphical model toolkit (GMTK).

In this paper, a set of features beyond the seven-letter window, termed non-standard features, are systematically evaluated for American English, using decision trees. The results show that adding nonstandard features to a seven-letter window gives clear improvements for English, with the most important features being the previous three phone sequences predicted, an initial prediction of lexical stress location, and a window of vowel letters around the current letter.

In this paper, we apply various Machine Learning approaches like Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Decision Forest, forest of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Auto Associative Neural Networks (AANN) for LTS rules. We used these techniques mainly for Schwa deletion in Hindi. We empirically show that the LTS using Decision Forest and Forest of ANNs outperforms the previous CART and normal ANN approaches respectively, and the non discriminative learning technique of AANN could not capture the LTS rules as efficiently as discriminative techniques. We explore use of syllabic features, namely, syllabic structure, onset of the syllable, number of syllables and place of Schwa along with primary contextual features. The results showed that use of these features leads to good performance. The Decision Forest and forest of ANNs approaches yielded phone accuracy of 92.86% and 93.18% respectively using the newly incorporated features for Hindi LTS.

When provided with a symbol sequence representing a speech signal, it is able to extract word-like patterns from it, despite the large amount of subsequences that can represent a single word. For this, it uses statistical information derived from the entire input. However, due to the abstraction of speech to symbols, much of the information originally present in the signal is no longer available to the algorithm. In this paper we propose a way of using a richer abstraction of the signal in the form of a lattice. Furthermore, a way of grounding recurring patterns to concepts in other modalities will be presented. Finally, the information learned by the algorithm using both kinds of input is tested in a recognition experiment. This will show that the use of lattices leads to a significant improvement in terms of recognition rate.

The aim of this study was to develop a technology that is able to cope with a broad field of dislluency types. A thorough investigation of our corpus led us to a detection design where basic rule-matching techniques are complemented with machine learning and N-gram based approaches.

Performance Comparison of ADRS and PCA as a Preprocessor to ANN for Data Mining	ISDA 2008: EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA 2008)	NOV 26-28, 2008	Kaohsiung, TAIWAN	IEEE, IEEE SMC Soc, Natl Sci Council, Minist Educ				In this paper we compared the performance of the Automatic Data Reduction System (ADRS) and principal component analysis (PCA) as a preprocessor to artificial neural networks (ANN). ADRS is based on a Bayesian probabilistic classifier that is used with a quantization process that results in a simplification of the feature space, including elimination of irrelevant features. ADRS has the advantage of retaining the original names of the features even though the feature space has been modified. Thus, results are easier to interpret than those of PCA and ANN, which transform the feature space in a way that obscures the original meanings of the features. The comparison showed that ADRS performs better than PICA as a preprocessor to ANN when data mining the datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It has been shown that ART2 is suitable for clustering problems that require on-line learning of large-scale and evolving databases. However, if applied to classification problems, ART2 suffers from deficiencies in terms of interpretation of class labels and sensitivity to the input data-order. This study proposes a novel evolutionary classifier based on Adaptive Resonance Theory Network II and genetic algorithms. In the proposed classifier, ART2 is used first for generating the weights between attributes and clusters. In the second stage, a genetic algorithm is employed to generate class labels of input data. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Hayes data sets from the Machine Learning Repository at UCL The experimental results show that the proposed classifier is as good as the well-known C5.0 Classifier in terms of accuracy.

In many such databases there can be correlation on the assignment of subsets of the set of categories. This can be exploited to improve machine learning techniques devoted to multilabel text categorization. In this paper, we examine a Virtual Generalizing Random. Access Memory Weightless Neural Network (VG-RAM WNN for short) architecture that takes advantage of the correlation between categories to improve text-categorization performance. We compare the performance of this architecture, that we named Data Correlated VG-RAM WNN (VG-RAM WNN-COR), with that of standard VG-RAM WNN using four multi-label categorization performance metrics: one-error, ranking loss, average precision and hamming loss. Our experimental results show that VG-RAM WNN-COR has an overall better performance than VG-RAM WNN for the set of metrics considered.

In this paper, we present a data mining approach to detect unknown malicious executables. The feature set is a key to applying data mining or machine learning to successfully detect malicious executables. We propose a method to extract features which are most representative of viral properties. To improve the performance of the Bayesian classifier, we present a novel algorithm called Ha (Increment Naive Bayes(HIB). We also evaluate the predictive power of the classifier, and show that our classifier yields high detection rates and works at a high learning speed.

These classifiers ignore the network feature of the immune system that is suitable for classification. Furthermore, the transformation of data into any other specific types from their original form can degrade the originality of the data and consume more space and pre processing time. This paper introduces resource limited immune network model with hybrid affinity measurement for classifying heterogeneous data in its original types. The model is able to process the data with the types as represented in the database. The paper shows comparisons between the model and the selected existing immune algorithms that also uses the same set of data and parameters. The experimental results show that the immune network model produces a better accuracy rate with shorter classifier on most of the heterogeneous data from University of California, Irvive (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (MLR).

Reconstructed gene network allows us to understand how genes interact with each. other However, network construction is very complex due to highly interactive nature of genes. A proposed approach to solve this complex problem is to cluster the genes according to similarity in their gene expression profiles. We applied k-means clustering with k = 10 to come up with ten clusters of genes. Then, we applied Bayesian Network structure learning with Hill-climbing search strategy and Akaike Information Criterion score to search for the best network. We compared inferred interactions to a reference positive interactions dataset and found similarities between our inferred interactions and the reference. We further study the gene interactions using Gene Ontology. From our findings, we conclude that the clustering step is essential in gene network reconstruction. Clustering produced better group of genes for Bayesian Network learning. Larger clusters also produced more gene interactions. Gene Ontology can be combined with clustering to produce better quality clusters to improve gene network construction.

The k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN) is a popular example of the latter class of these algorithms. Recently, a slight modification of it has been proposed so that the Multi-Label k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (ML-KNN) can deal better with multi-label classification problems. In this paper we are interested in automatic text categorization, which are becoming more and more important as the amount of text in electronic format grows and the access to it becomes more necessary and widespread. We proposed a Probabilistic Neural Network Algorithm (PNN) tailored to also deal with multi-label classification problems, and compared it against the ML-KNN algorithm. Our implementation surpass the ML-KNN algorithm in four metrics typically used in the literature for multi-label categorization problems.

Transportation route plans of AGVs are expected to minimize the transportation time without collisions among AGVs in the systems. In our proposed method, each AGV as an agent computes its transportation route by referring to the static path information, and it exchanges its route plan each other Once collisions are detected, one of the two agents chosen by a negotiation rule modifies its route plan. The rule consists of a condition-part and an action-part, and one rule which matches to the conditions of two agents under negotiation is selected from a set of rules. The rules are generated and improved by a genetics-based machine learning approach, where a set of rules is represented symbolically as an individual of genetic algorithms, and fitness of each individual is determined according to the total travel time of AGVs.

The learning architecture aims to help integration of the two learning process by generating internal rewards. After observing superiors, human learners usually start practicing through trial and error Humans usually learn tasks through both imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Imitation learning and reinforcement learning should be harmonized as an effective and integrative learning system. A simple reinforcement learning requires a huge amount of trials and errors in an agent's learning phase. However imitation learning can reduce the amount of time. Based on this idea, the composition of reinforcement learning and imitation learning is proposed as an integrative machine learning architecture. In this paper an additional internal reward system, which is generated by the learner agent, is introduced to achieve this goal. The learning architecture is evaluated through an experiment and the effectiveness of the integration is examined.

These forums often have relevance to the Iraqi insurgency or Al-Qaeda and are of interest to security and intelligence organizations. This paper presents an automated approach to sentiment and affect analysis of selected radical international Jihadist Dark Web forums. The approach incorporates a rich textual feature representation and machine learning techniques to identify and measure the sentiment polarities and affect intensities expressed in forum communications. The results of sentiment and affect analysis performed on two large-scale Dark Web forums are presented, offering insight into the communities and participants.

In Chinese QC, for example, a question is analyzed and then labeled with the question type it belongs to and the expected answer type. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Chinese QC that integrates syntactic tags and semantic tags into an alignment-based approach. We adopt a template alignment (TA) algorithm to process large collections of Chinese questions and compare the classification results with those of INFOMAP, a human annotated knowledge inference engine for Chinese questions. We experimented with two approaches for the proposed system: a majority algorithm and a machine learning method that uses Support Vector Machine (SVM). The TA algorithm performs well with both approaches. The experimental results show that the accuracy achieved by TA (85.5%) is comparable to that of INFOMAP (88%). In contrast, QC based oil the SVM approach, which incorporates syntactic features and TA yields an accuracy rate of 91.5%.

It's based on a new method in which rebroadcasting a packet is decided by an intelligent classification scheme. Each MN builds a classifier and uses it on data collected from the network environment. For an input vector describing a broadcast packet and current network conditions, the classifier returns a result of "Rebroadcast" or "Drop". Through the simulation,we can identify a more energetict communication protocol and more efficient use because of each MN's fitting various network condition.

However, the samples are often imbalanced. Therefore, how to reduce the effects of uneven distribution of training sets on text classification performance is a great challenge for machine learning on imbalanced data sets. Currently, the study on imbalaced data mainly lies in two aspects: data-level and algorithm-level. The paper focuses on the study of the three solutions: sample set restructuring, enhancement method of feature selection and weight retouch. Experimental results show that these methods are effective in improving classification performance. After comparing and analyzing the effects of these methods based on the experiments, this paper gets expressly some useful conclusions for some key issues, such as which sampling texts should be chosen and how many sampling texts should be decided for sample restructuring, how about defining separate threshold for each category in feature selection and how to adjust the weights in classification algorithm.

Feature Selection in Automatic Music Genre Classification	ISM: 2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MULTIMEDIA	IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia-ISM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia	DEC 15-17, 2008	Berkeley, CA	IEEE				This paper presents the results of the application of a feature selection procedure to an automatic music genre classification system. The classification system is based on the use of multiple feature vectors and an ensemble approach, according to time and space decomposition strategies. Feature vectors are extracted from music segments from the beginning, middle and end of the original music signal (time-decomposition). Despite being music genre classification a multi-class problem, we accomplish the task using a combination of binary classifiers, whose results are merged in order to produce the final music genre label (space decomposition). As individual classifiers several machine learning algorithms were employed: Naive-Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Nets. Experiments were carried out on a novel dataset called Latin Music Database, which contains 3,227 music pieces categorized in 10 musical genres. The experimental results show that the employed features have different importance according to the part of the music signal from where the feature vectors were extracted. Furthermore, the ensemble approach provides better results than the individual segments in most cases.

We will select a variety of different real images of different types and test the quality of the recovered images, the recovery time, and required resources when different measurement methods with different parameters are used or when different recovering methods are applied. Then we will propose an algorithm to reduce the noise in the recovered images and sharpen them simultaneously. The algorithm exploits a well-known bilateral filtering in order to increase the confidence in margins and edges, and then uses an adaptive unsharp mask method to sharpen the images. The adaptive unsharp mask method extends the ordinary unsharp mask method and uses machine learning square loss minimization and regression in order to learn the optimal unsharping parameters. We will argue why both bilateral filtering and unsharp mask methods should be used in the algorithm simultaneously. Finally, we will show the results of applying the algorithm on real images that are recovered using the compressed sensing method and we will interpret the experimental results.

More importantly, it works very well in a high-dimensional feature space. This paper presents a nonlinear active suspension controller which achieves a high level performance by compensating for actuator dynamics. We use a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure optimal control of nonlinear systems. An LQR is used to solve the problem of state feedback and an SVM is used to address the question of the estimation and examination of the state. These two are then combined and designed in a way that outputs feedback control. The real-time simulation demonstrates that an active suspension using the combined SVM-LQR controller provides passengers with a much more comfortable ride and better road handling.

Machine learning algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. They are particularly useful for (a) poorly understood problem domains where little knowledge exists for the humans to develop effective algorithms; (b) domains where there are large databases containing valuable implicit regularities to be discovered; or (c) domains where programs must adapt to changing conditions. Not surprisingly, the field of cyber space turns out to be a fertile ground where many software security problems could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms. This paper deals with the subject of applying machine learning in extraction detection. In the paper, we present our research work on design and implementation of an extrusion detection system for information security of big companies. The result shows a potential in real-world applications.	[Luo, Yan; Tsai, Jeffrey J.

Recently, link-based non-tree clock network attracts people's attention due to its appealing tradeoff between variation tolerance and power overhead. In this work, We investigate how to optimize such clock networks through buffer and wire sizing. A two-stage hybrid optimization approach is proposed. It considers the realistic constraint of discrete buffer/wire sizes and is based on accurate delay models. In order to provide reliable and efficient guidance for the optimization, we suggest to apply SVM (Support Vector Machine) based machine learning as a surrogate for expensive circuit-level simulation. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that our sizing method can reduce clock skew by 43% on average with very small increase on power dissipation.

The highly skewed datasets make it difficult to classify them correctly by using many traditional classifiers. Bagging is a method for improving the predictive power of weak classifiers, which can improve the performance of unstable classifiers. BeEPRC uses a special kind of emerging patterns, called essential emerging pattern (eEP), to build eEP-based classifiers, and "bagging" them to build effective ensemble. As to BeEPRC algorithm, this paper has studied two weighted-vote strategies that are voting by classification accuracy and by the rare-class F-measure value. After the particular analyses, the second voting strategy is selected and the adjusted algorithm is called BeEPRCF. Our experiments carried on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository show that BeEPRCF not only has the very high overall accuracy, but also has the reasonably high F-measure value, which achieves a good balance of precision and recall for rare-class.

We have analyzed 172 patients potentially affected by FXS in Andalusia (Spain) and, by means of a DNA test, each member of the data set is known to belong to one of two classes: affected, not affected. The whole predictor set, formed by 40 variables, and a reduced set with only nine predictors significantly associated with the response are considered. Four alternative base classification models have been investigated: logistic regression, classification trees, multilayer perceptron and support vector machines. For both predictor sets, the best accuracy, considering both the mean and the standard deviation of the test error rate, is achieved by the support vector machines, confirming the increasing importance of this learning algorithm. Three ensemble methods-bagging, random forests and boosting were also considered, amongst which the bagged versions of support vector machines stand out, especially when they are constructed with the reduced set of predictor variables. The analysis of the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the ROC curve agrees with the main conclusions extracted from the accuracy results. All of these models can be fitted by free R programs.

J	Esmeir, S; Markovitch, S				Esmeir, Saher; Markovitch, Shaul			Anytime induction of low-cost, low-error classifiers: a sampling-based approach	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Machine learning techniques are gaining prevalence in the production of a wide range of classifiers for complex real-world applications with nonuniform testing and misclassification costs. The increasing complexity of these applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and classification. In this work we introduce ACT (anytime cost-sensitive tree learner), a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. ACT is an anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for lower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utitlity of the different candidate splits. Using sampling techniques, ACT approximates the cost of the subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a stochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to campare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree learners. The results show that for the majority of domains ACT produces significantly less costly trees. ACT also exhibits good anytime behavior with diminishing returns.

J	Martinez, D; de Lacalle, OL; Agirre, E				Martinez, David; de Lacalle, Oier Lopez; Agirre, Eneko			On the use of automatically acquired examples for all-nouns Word Sense Disambiguation	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								This article focuses on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which is a Natural Language Processing task that is thought to be important for many Language Technology applications, such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, or Machine Translation. One of the main issues preventing the deployment of WSD technology is the lack of training examples for Machine Learning systems, also known as the Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck. A method which has been shown to work for small samples of words is the automatic acquisition of examples. We have previously shown that one of the most promising example acquisition methods scales up and produces a freely available database of 150 million examples from Web snippets for all polysemous nouns in WordNet. This paper focuses on the issues that arise when using those examples, all alone or in addition to manually tagged examples, to train a supervised WSD system for all nouns. The extensive evaluation on both lexical-sample and all-words Senseval benchmarks shows that we are able to improve over commonly used baselines and to achieve top-rank performance. The good use of the prior distributions from the senses proved to be a crucial factor.

On Similarities between Inference in Game Theory and Machine Learning	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							FICTITIOUS PLAY; OPTIMIZATION; ENTROPY; MODELS	In this paper, we elucidate the equivalence between inference in game theory and machine learning. Our aim in so doing is to establish an equivalent vocabulary between the two domains so as to facilitate developments at the intersection of both fields, and as proof of the usefulness of this approach, we use recent developments in each field to make useful improvements to the other. More specifically, we consider the analogies between smooth best responses in fictitious play and Bayesian inference methods. Initially, we use these insights to develop and demonstrate an improved algorithm for learning in games based on probabilistic moderation. That is, by integrating over the distribution of opponent strategies (a Bayesian approach within machine learning) rather than taking a simple empirical average (the approach used in standard fictitious play) we derive a novel moderated fictitious play algorithm and show that it is more likely than standard fictitious play to converge to a payoff-dominant but risk-dominated Nash equilibrium in a simple coordination game. Furthermore we consider the converse case, and show how insights from game theory can be used to derive two improved mean field variational learning algorithms. We first show that the standard update rule of mean field variational learning is analogous to a Cournot adjustment within game theory. By analogy with fictitious play, we then suggest an improved update rule, and show that this results in fictitious variational play, an improved mean field variational learning algorithm that exhibits better convergence in highly or strongly connected graphical models. Second, we use a recent advance in fictitious play, namely dynamic fictitious play, to derive a derivative action variational learning algorithm, that exhibits superior convergence properties on a canonical machine learning problem (clustering a mixture distribution).

J	Csaji, BC; Monostori, L				Csaji, Balazs Csanad; Monostori, Laszlo			Adaptive stochastic resource control: A machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; SEARCH; AGENTS	The paper investigates stochastic resource allocation problems with scarce, reusable resources and non-preemtive, time-dependent, interconnected tasks. This approach is a natural generalization of several standard resource management problems, such as scheduling and transportation problems. First, reactive solutions are considered and defined as control policies of suitably reformulated Markov decision processes ( MDPs). We argue that this reformulation has several favorable properties, such as it has finite state and action spaces, it is aperiodic, hence all policies are proper and the space of control policies can be safely restricted. Next, approximate dynamic programming ( ADP) methods, such as fitted Q-learning, are suggested for computing an efficient control policy. In order to compactly maintain the cost-to-go function, two representations are studied: hash tables and support vector regression ( SVR), particularly, v-SVRs. Several additional improvements, such as the application of limited-lookahead rollout algorithms in the initial phases, action space decomposition, task clustering and distributed sampling are investigated, too. Finally, experimental results on both benchmark and industry-related data are presented.

J	Miclet, L; Bayoudh, S; Delhay, A				Miclet, Laurent; Bayoudh, Sabri; Delhay, Arnaud			Analogical dissimilarity: Definition, algorithms and two experiments in machine learning	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							SEQUENCE; SEARCH	This paper defines the notion of analogical dissimilarity between four objects, with a special focus on objects structured as sequences. Firstly, it studies the case where the four objects have a null analogical dissimilarity, i.e. are in analogical proportion. Secondly, when one of these objects is unknown, it gives algorithms to compute it. Thirdly, it tackles the problem of defining analogical dissimilarity, which is a measure of how far four objects are from being in analogical proportion. In particular, when objects are sequences, it gives a definition and an algorithm based on an optimal alignment of the four sequences. It gives also learning algorithms, i.e. methods to find the triple of objects in a learning sample which has the least analogical dissimilarity with a given object. Two practical experiments are described: the first is a classification problem on benchmarks of binary and nominal data, the second shows how the generation of sequences by solving analogical equations enables a handwritten character recognition system to rapidly be adapted to a new writer.

J	Kovacevic, M; Nie, JY; Davidson, C				Kovacevic, Milos; Nie, Jian-Yun; Davidson, Colin			Providing answers to questions from automatically collected web pages for intelligent decision making in the construction sector	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE; ONTOLOGY	The construction sector is notorious for the dichotomy between (a) its intensive use of information in its decision-making processes and (b) its limited access to, and insufficient use of, the pertinent information that is potentially available. In the context of the potential availability of valid information on the Web, we have developed a question-and-answer system, which enables construction practitioners to seek for information by posing questions in English or French, instead of entering a list of relevant keywords. Based on a modular systems approach using natural language, relevant answers to questions are selected and presented in a convivial way, thus improving and speeding up the classical Web search procedure. Our system consists of two main components: An intelligent robot that traverses a Web space and decides whether a page is construction oriented or not, and a question-answer (Q-A) component (comprising three modules) that uses a domain-specific thesaurus to extract meaningful parts of a question and to detect, process, and present paragraph passages extracted from relevant Web pages. The robot is trained on positive and unlabeled examples using a machine learning approach, while the Q-A component uses natural language processing techniques. In our experiments, we show that our automatically collected database consists of approximately 16% of noise, while the performance of the Q-A component is 65.45% in mean reciprocal rank.

In this paper we present a machine learning approach to contextual advertising using a novel set of features which aims to capture subtle semantic associations between the vocabularies of the ad and the Web page. We design a model for ranking ads with respect to a page which is learned using Support Vector Machines. We evaluate our model on a large set of manually evaluated ad placements. The proposed model significantly improves accuracy over a learned model using features from current work in contextual advertising.

During the last decade the so-called data-driven models are becoming more and more common. These models rely upon the methods of computational intelligence and machine learning, and thus assume the presence of a considerable amount of data describing the modelled system's physics (i.e. hydraulic and/or hydrologic phenomena). This paper is a preface to the special issue on Data Driven Modelling and Evolutionary Optimization for River Basin Management, and presents a brief overview of the most popular techniques and some of the experiences of the authors in data-driven modelling relevant to river basin management. it also identifies the current trends and common pitfalls, provides some examples of successful applications and mentions the research challenges.

J	Dombi, J; Gera, Z				Dombi, Jozsef; Gera, Zsolt			Rule based fuzzy classification using squashing functions	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop of SOFA 2005	AUG, 2005	Arad, ROMANIA	IEEE		Lukasiewicz logic; squashing function; rule based classifier		In this paper we are dealing with the construction of a fuzzy rule based classifier. A three-step method is proposed based on Lukasiewicz logic for the description of the rules and the fuzzy memberships to construct concise and highly comprehensible fuzzy rules. In our method, a genetic algorithm is applied to evolve the structure of the rules and then a gradient based optimization to fine tune the fuzzy membership functions. The introduced squashing function allows us not only to handle the approximation of the operators and the memberships in the same way, but also to efficiently calculate the derivatives of the membership functions. We also show applications of the model on the UCI machine learning database.

The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was trained on data gathered in 2007 from various sets of proteins containing experimentally verified chemical modifications of proteins. Short sequence segments around a modification site were dissected from a parent protein, and represented in the training set as binary or profile vectors. The updated efficiency of the SVM classification for each type of modification and the predictive power of both representations were estimated using leave-one-out tests for model of general phosphorylation and for modifications catalyzed by several specific protein kinases. The accuracy of the method was improved in comparison to the previous version of the service (Plewczynski et al., "AutoMotif server: prediction of single residue post-translational modifications in proteins", Bioinformatics 21: 2525-7, 2005). The precision of the updated version reached over 90% for selected types of phosphorylation and was optimized in trade of lower recall value of the classification model. The AutoMotif Server version 2007 is freely available at http://ams2.bioinfo.pl/. Additionally, the reference dataset for optimization of prediction of phosphorylation sites, collected from the UniProtKB was also provided and can be accessed at http://ams2.bioinfo.pl/data/.

J	Lee, G; Bulitko, V; Levner, I				Lee, Greg; Bulitko, Vadim; Levner, Ilya			HSMM: Heuristic search with meta-models for image interpretation	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						genetic algorithms; meta-models; machine learning; Heuristic search; reinforcement learning; image interpretation	SELECTION	Adaptive image interpretation systems can learn optimal image interpretation policies for a given domain without human intervention. The policies are learned over an extensive generic image processing operator library. One of the principal weaknesses of the method lies with the large size of such libraries, which can make the machine learning process intractable. We demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to reduce the size of the operator library, thereby speeding Lip policy learning while still keeping human experts out of the development loop. Experiments in a challenging domain of forestry image interpretation exhibited a 95% reduction in the execution time, while maintaining the image interpretation quality of the full library.

High-accuracy peptide mass fingerprinting using peak intensity data with machine learning	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						ion suppression; mass spectrometry; peptide mass fingerprinting; protein identification; peak intensity	PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE DATABASES; SPECTROMETRY; TOOL; SUPPRESSION; RESIDUES; ARGININE	For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we show that the intensity of a peptide-ion peak is directly correlated with its sequence, with the residues M, H, P, R, and L having the most substantial effect on ionization. We developed a machine learning approach that exploits this relationship to significantly improve peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) accuracy based on training data sets from both true-positive and false-positive PMF searches. The model's cross-validated accuracy in distinguishing real versus false-positive database search results is 91%, rivaling the accuracy of MS/MS-based protein identification.

Personal Interaction in the Vegetative State A Data-Mining Study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						vegetative state; autonomic response; mother's voice; heart rate variability; machine-learning procedures	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; MOTHERS VOICE; OWN NAME; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; SYSTEMS; MUSIC; FMRI	Background and purpose: Brain processing at varying levels of functional complexity and emotional reactions to relatives are anecdotally reported by the caregivers of patients in a vegetative state. In this study, computer-assisted machine-learning procedures were applied to identify heart rate variability changes or galvanic skin responses to a relative's presence. Methods: The skin conductance (galvanic skin response) and heart beats were continuously recorded in 12 patients in a vegetative state, at rest (baseline) and while approached by a relative (usually the mother; test condition) or by a nonfamiliar person (control condition). The cardiotachogram (the series of consecutive intervals between heart beats) was analyzed in the time and frequency domains by computing the parametric and nonparametric frequency spectra. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to sort out the significant spectral parameter(s). For all patients, each condition (baseline, test, control) was characterized by the values of its spectral parameters, and the association between spectral parameters values and experimental condition was tested (WEKA machine-learning software). Results and comments: A galvanic skin response was obtained in two patients. The machine-learning procedure independently selected the nu_LF spectral parameter and attributed each nu_LF measure to any of the three experimental conditions. 69.4% of attributions were correct (baseline: 58%; test condition: 75%; control. 75%). In seven patients, attribution changed when the subject was approached by the test person; specifically, sequential shifts from baseline to test condition ("the Mom effect") to control condition were identified in four patients (30.0%); the change from test to control was attributed correctly in seven patients (58%). The observation of heart rate changes tentatively attributable to emotional reaction in a vegetative state suggest residual rudimentary personal interaction, consistent with functioning limbic and paralimbic systems after massive brain damage. Machine-learning proved applicable to sort significant measure(s) out of large samples and to control for statistical alpha inflation.

J	Uzuner, O; Goldstein, I; Luo, Y; Kohane, I				Uzuner, Oezlem; Goldstein, Ira; Luo, Yuan; Kohane, Isaac			Identifying patient smoking status from medical discharge records	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; CHIEF COMPLAINTS; LANGUAGE; CLASSIFICATION; AGREEMENT; SUMMARIES; RELIABILITY	The authors organized a Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenge on automatically determining the smoking status of patients from information found in their discharge records. This challenge was issued as a part of the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) project, to survey, facilitate, and examine studies in medical language understanding for clinical narratives. This article describes the smoking challenge, details the data and the annotation process, explains the evaluation metrics, discusses the characteristics of the systems developed for the challenge, presents an analysis of the results of received system runs, draws conclusions about the state of the art, and identifies directions for future research. A total of 11 teams participated in the smoking challenge. Each team submitted up to three system runs, providing a total of 23 submissions. The submitted system runs were evaluated with microaveraged and macroaveraged precision, recall, and F-measure. The systems submitted to the smoking challenge represented a variety of machine learning and rule-based algorithms. Despite the differences in their approaches to smoking status identification, many of these systems provided good results. There were 12 system runs with microaveraged F-measures above 0.84. Analysis of the results highlighted the fact that discharge summaries express smoking status using a limited number of textual features (e.g., "smok", "tobac", "cigar", Social History, etc.). Many of the effective smoking status identifiers benefit from these features.

J	Cohen, AM				Cohen, Aaron M.			Five-way smoking status classification using text hot-spot identification and error-correcting output codes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								We participated in the i2b2 smoking status classification challenge task. The purpose of this task was to evaluate the ability of systems to automatically identify patient smoking status from discharge summaries. Our submission included several techniques that we compared and studied, including hot-spot identification, zero-vector filtering, inverse class frequency weighting, error-correcting output codes, and post-processing rules. We evaluated our approaches using the same methods as the i2b2 task organizers, using micro- and macro-averaged F1 as the primary performance metric. Our best performing system achieved a micro-F1 of 0.9000 on the test collection, equivalent to the best performing system submitted to the i2b2 challenge. Hot-spot identification, zero-vector filtering, classifier weighting, and error correcting output coding contributed additively to increased performance, with hot-spot identification having by far the largest positive effect. High performance on automatic identification of patient smoking status from discharge summaries is achievable with the efficient and straightforward machine learning techniques studied here.

The extraction engine identifies smoking references; documents that contain no smoking references are classified as UNKNOWN. For the remaining documents, the extraction engine uses linguistic analysis to associate features such as status and time to smoking mentions. Machine learning is used to classify the documents based on these features. This approach shows overall accuracy in the 90s on all data sets used. Classification using engine-generated and word-based features outperforms classification using only word-based features for all data sets, although the difference gets smaller as the data set size increases. These techniques could be applied to identify other risk factors, such as drug and alcohol use, or a family history of a disease.

Optimisation of pattern recognition in textile field	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE			English	Article						cluster validity; optimal cluster number; overlapping cluster; image processing; unsupervised cluster; maximum entropy principle	VALIDITY INDEX; OPTIMAL NUMBER; CLUSTERS	We introduce in this article a new formulation of cluster validity index, which allows us to find the correct number of clusters with high degree of overlap and then solve many problems in pattern recognition, machine learning, data mining, and so on. This new index can be used for several applications in different fields like medicine, marketing and especially in textile where colour image segmentation, image analysis processing and printed pattern have an important role. This measure is based on maximum entropy principle. Our approach does not require any parameter adjustment; it is, thereby, completely automatic. Many simulated and real examples are presented, showing the superiority of our measure to the existing ones. We show also an extension of this method to non-Gaussian mixture and its application to different forms with or without overlap.

Most existing works use a past market data set, because they assume that each trader's individual decisions do not affect market prices at all. Meanwhile, there have been attempts to analyze economic phenomena by constructing virtual market simulators, in which human and artificial traders really make trades. Since prices in a market are, in fact, determined by every trader's decisions, a virtual market is more realistic, and the above assumption does not apply. In this work, we design several reinforcement learners on the futures market simulator U-Mart ( Unreal Market as an Artificial Research Testbed) and compare our learners with the previous champions of U-Mart competitions empirically.

J	Brank, J; Mladenic, D; Grobelnik, M; Milic-Frayling, N				Brank, Janez; Mladenic, Dunja; Grobelnik, Marko; Milic-Frayling, Natasa			Feature selection for the classification of large document collections	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						feature selection; text classification; machine learning; Support Vector Machines; information retrieval; knowledge representation; data preprocessing	TEXT CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	Feature selection methods are often applied in the context of document classification. They are particularly important for processing large data sets that may contain millions of documents and are typically represented by a large number, possibly tens of thousands of features. Processing large data sets thus raises the issue of computational resources and we often have to find the right trade-off between the size of the feature set and the number of training data that we can taken into account. Furthermore, depending on the selected classification technique, different feature selection methods require different optimization approaches, raising the issue of compatibility between the two. We demonstrate an effective classifier training and feature selection method that is suitable for large data collections. We explore feature selection based on the weights obtained from linear classifiers themselves, trained on a subset of training documents. While most feature weighting schemes score individual features independently from each other, the weights of linear classifiers incorporate the relative importance of a feature for classification as observed for a given subset of documents thus taking the feature dependence into account. We investigate how these feature selection methods combine with various learning algorithms. Our experiments include a comparative analysis of three learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds ratio, Information Gain, and weights from the linear SVM and Perceptron. We show that by regulating the size of the feature space (and thus the sparsity of the resulting vector representation of the documents) using an effective feature scoring, like linear SVM, we need only a half or even a quarter of the computer memory to train a classifier of almost the same quality as the one obtained from the complete data set. Feature selection using weights from the linear SVMs yields a better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves the classification performance.

Nowadays it is a lot easier to create, share and retrieve multimedia contents on the Web. However, with the increasing amount in contents retrieval becomes more challenging and often leads to inadequate search results. One main reason is that image clustering and retrieval approaches usually stick either solely to the images' low-level features or their user-generated tags (high-level features). However, this is frequently inappropriate since the "real" semantics of an image can only be derived from the combination of low-level and high-level features. Consequently, we investigated a more holistic view on image semantics based on a system called Imagesemantics. This system combines MPEG-7 descriptions for low-level content-based retrieval features and MPEG-7 keywords by a machine learning approach producing joined OWL rules. The rule base is used in Imagesemantics to improve retrieval results.

This paper discusses the results of two different hybrid methods, previously investigated, for the automatic generation of fuzzy rules from numerical data. One of the methods, named DoC-based, proposes the creation of Fuzzy Rule Bases using genetic algorithms in association with a heuristic for preselecting candidate rules based on the degree of coverage. The other, named BayesFuzzy, induces a Bayesian Classifier using a dataset previously granulated by fuzzy partitions and then translates it into a Fuzzy Rule Base. A comparative analysis between both approaches focusing on their main characteristics, strengths/weaknesses and easiness of use is carried out. The reliability of both methods is also compared by analyzing their results in a few knowledge domains.

A Standards-based Modelling Approach for Dynamic Generation of Adaptive Learning Scenarios	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AI-Ed 2005)	JUL 18-22, 2005	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Int Artificial Intelligence Educ Soc, European Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence Site, IOS Press, Amer Assoc Artificial Intelligence		Metadata and Learning; Learning Objects; Learning Activities; Learning Design; Semantic Web; Pedagogy guidelines; Educational standards; Design templates; Adaptive eLearning; User Modelling		One of the key problems in developing standard based adaptive courses is the complexity involved in the design phase, especially when establishing the hooks for the dynamic modelling to be performed at runtime. This is particularly critical when the courses are based on adaptation-oriented learning scenarios, where the full eLearning cycle (design, publication, use and auditing) is considered. Based on the problems we experienced in developing such scenarios with a reusable, platform independent, objective-based approach in the aLFanet project we have established an alternative framework in the ADAPTAPlan project, which focuses on dynamically generating learning design templates with the support of user modelling, planning and machine learning techniques. In particular, in this paper we describe the problems we are tackling and how we are relaxing the design work by automatically building the IMS learning design of the course from a simplified set of data required from the course authors.

This paper is to introduce a new approach to build topic navigation in the topic digital library using topic extraction and clustering. Topic digital library is an important application of knowledge service and it is a special domain digital library based on topic or concept features. Firstly, documents in a special domain are automatically produced by document classification approach. It integrates the rule-based and statistical method to classify the documents in the large-scale collection. Then, the keywords of each document are extracted using the machine learning approach. The keywords are used to cluster the documents subset. The clustered result. is the taxonomy of the subset. Lastly, the taxonomy is modified to the hierarchical structure for user navigation by manual adjustments. The topic digital library is constructed after combining the full-text retrieval and hierarchical navigation function. The construction method of topic digital library is significant to build the topic databases or special resource databases.

Here, we propose a central-URL extraction approach, which can automatically recognize effective information from the main segmentation on catalog-page. Our approach combines machine learning classification and DOM (Document Object Model) tree based analysis. For one page, we represent each block node, mainly DIV and Table, by a set of content-based and structure-based features, which can be used as the input of support vector machine to determine whether it belongs to "Main-Body" or not. After identifying the main semantic block a DOM tree based algorithm that utilizes catalog's heuristic rules is implemented to find the central URLs in the segmentation. The evaluation results show that our approach obtains encouraging results with a high recall/precision ratio. This can be applied in topic-specific search engine development and other Web applications.

This new method first does unsupervised learning on the data of the flights collected from the airport. The standard of each class of delay can be gotten after the learning process. With these classes of delay, the supervised learning method can be used on the data so that the alarm model could be built. Comparing with the recent manual alarm standard, this model synthesizes more factors to do alarm. Since the recent delay standard is only related to the number of flights, which is helpful only in serious delay case, the new model performs will be more practical value than recent ones.

Structural analysis of promoter sequences is important for successful gene prediction. Promoters can be recognized by certain patterns that are conserved within a species, but there are many exceptions which makes the structural analysis of promoters a complex problem. Grammar rules can he used for describing the structure of promoter sequences however, derivation of such rules is not trivial. In this paper, stochastic L-grammar rules are derived automatically from known drosophila and vertebrate promoter and non-promoter sequences using genetic programming. The fitness of grammar rules is evaluated using a machine learning technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is trained on the known promoter sequences to obtain a discriminating function which serves as a means of evaluating a candidate grammar (a set of rules) by determining the percentage of generated sequences that are classified correctly. The combination of SVM and grammar rule inference can ate the lack of structural insight in machine learning approaches such as SVM.

The only metric that had existed so far to determine the best algorithm for solving all ATSP instance is based on the number of cities: nevertheless, it is not sufficiently adequate for discriminating the best algorithm for solving an ATSP instance, thus the necessity for devising a flew metric through the use of data-mining techniques.

Therefore, an emerging trend of representing objects by graphs can be observed. This trend is intensified by the development of novel approaches in graph based machine learning, such as graph kernels or graph embedding techniques. These procedures overcome a major drawback of graphs, which consists in a serious lack of algorithms for classification and clustering. The present; paper is inspired by the idea of representing graphs by means of dissimilarities and extends previous work to the more general setting of Lipschitz embeddings. In all experimental evaluation we empirically confirm that classifiers relying oil the original graph distances call be outperformed by a classification system using the Lipschitz embedded graphs.

Recent advances in pattern recognition and machine learning brought automotive industry to the verge of direct AI applications in vehicles. They would continuously sense the external environment. monitor vehicle's internal systems and track drivers actions man attempt to support driver's decisions. making them better informed or even take over decision process if the reliability and confidence of perceived safety critical Situations outperform human performance. This work intend,, to contribute to the automated real-time classification methodology Suitable for applications in the realistic circumstances of driving, a vehicle. It proposes a coherent strategy to a fast extraction of simple but robust features Out of complex data structures like imagoes, continuous and discrete signals etc. It advocates the use genetic algorithm for feature selection paired with simple classifiers suitable for further combination at the decision level. The presented generic methodology is open for various data transformations, classifiers, features and scales well with the data size. It has been tested in two independent competitions: NISIS Competition 2007 concerned with automated classification of pedestrian images and Ford Classification Challenge 2008 dedicated to symptoms detection from high-frequency signal patterns. The model was announced the winner of the NISIS' 2007 Competition achieving pedestrian recognition rate exceeding 95% and is now under evaluation for the second challenge.

However, the brittleness of the logical approach still hinders its breakthrough into applications. Several proposals exist for making logic-based QA more robust against erroneous results of linguistic analysis and against gaps in the background knowledge: Extracting useful information from failed proofs, embedding the prover in a relaxation loop, and fusion of logic-based and shallow features using machine learning (ML). In the paper, we explore the effectiveness of these techniques for logic-based passage filtering in the LogAnswer question answering system. Ail evaluation on factual question of QA@CLEF07 reveals a precision of 54.8% and recall of 44.9% when relaxation results for two distinct provers are combined.

An important characteristic of this task is the high dimensionality of the involved data sets. In this study we apply several feature selection algorithms in order to reduce the complexity of the problem on two types of H-1-MRS spectral data: long-echo and short-echo time, which present considerable differences in the spectrum for the same cases. The obtained experimental results show that the feature selection algorithms enhance the classification performance of the final induced models both in terms of prediction accuracy and number of involved spectral frequencies. The results obtained using a fast algorithm based on entropic measures of subsets of spectral data are specially promising.

A deep understanding of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis can be reached focusing on deregulation of gene sets or pathways. We measure the amount of deregulation and assess the statistical significance of predefined pathways belonging to MSigDB collection in a colon cancer data set. To measure the relevance of the pathways we use two well-established methods: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [7] and Gene List Analysis with Prediction Accuracy (GLAPA) [8]. We found that pathways associated to different diseases are strictly connected with colon cancer. Our study highlights the importance of using gene sets genes for understanding the main biological processes and pathways involved in colorectal cancer. Our analysis shows that many of the genes involved in these pathways are strongly associated to colorectal tumorigenesis.

In this study, the proposed relearning and combining ensemble computations are an effective technique for improving accuracy. We develop a new approach to combine kNN classifier based on different distance functions with relearning and ensemble Computations. The proposed combining algorithm shows higher generalization accuracy, compared to our previous studies and other conventional algorithms by artificial intelligence techniques. First, to improve classification accuracy. a relearning method with genetic algorithm is developed. Second, ensemble computations are followed by the relearning.

Interactive communications with a teacher are important for education. However, an asynchronous, lecture type e-Learning system has some difficulty for keeping students' motivation and encouraging active learning. In this paper, we introduce a human-like e-Learning system based on machine learning techniques. This system has 3 kinds of subsystem. The fist is the detection of students' situation by patterning. The second is the automatic question answering. The third is to generate facial expressions of animations synchronized with pre-recorded audio data. Our human-like e-Learning system provides experimental contents for active learning and communicative functions such as chat. As a result, students can learn with a pleasant feeling.

We summarily present experiments that show how a reinforcement learning backbone coupled with neural networks for approximation can indeed serve as a mechanism of the acquisition of game playing skill and we derive game interestingness measures that are inexpensive and straightforward to compute, yet also capture the relative quality of the game playing engine. We draw direct analogues to classical genetic algorithms and we stress that evolutionary development should be coupled with more traditional, expert-designed paths. That way the teaming computer is exposed to tutorial games without having to revert to domain knowledge, thus facilitating the knowledge engineering life-cycle.

Most of these systems rely on general heuristics for finding mappings, hence are bound to fail in many situations. Consequently, automatically generated mappings often contain logical inconsistencies that hinder a sensible use of these mappings. In previous work, we presented an approach for debugging mappings between expressive ontologies that eliminates inconsistencies by means of diagnostic reasoning. A shortcoming of this method was its need for expressive class definitions. More specifically, the applicability of this method critically relies on the existence of a high-quality disjointness axiomatization. This paper deals with the application of the debugging approach to mappings between lightweight ontologies that do not contain any or very few disjointness axioms, as it is the case for most of today's practical ontologies. After discussing different approaches to deal with the absence of disjointness axioms we propose the application of supervised machine learning for detecting disjointness in a fully automatic manner. We present a detailed evaluation of our approach to learning disjointness and its impact on mapping debugging. The results show that debugging automatically created mappings with the help of learned disjointness axioms significantly improves the overall quality of these mappings.

This paper addresses the problem of making explicit the knowledge on individual clinical expertise which is implicit in the hospital databases as data about the daily treatment of patients. The EHRcom data model is used to represent the procedural data of the hospital to which a machine learning process is applied in order to obtain a SDA* clinical algorithm that represents the course of actions followed by the clinical treatments in that hospital. The methodology is tested with data on COPD patients in a Spanish hospital.

Having a large-scale Chinese sense tagged corpus seems to be very essential, but in fact, such large-scale corpus is the critical deficiency at the current stage. This paper is aimed to design a large-scale Chinese full text sense tagged Corpus, which contains over 110,000 words. The Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese (also named Sinica Corpus) is treated as the tagging object, and there are 56 full texts extracted from this corpus. By using the N-gram statistics and the information of collocation, the preparation work for automatic sense tagging is planned by combining the techniques and methods of machine learning and the probability model. In order to achieve a highly precise result, the result of automatic sense tagging needs the touch of manual revising.

The proposed algorithm for the Clustering Analysis, the Hybrid HBMO-GRASP, is a two phase algorithm which combines a HBMO algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP for the solution of the clustering problem. This paper shows that the Honey Bees Mating Optimization can be used in hybrid synthesis with other metaheuristics for the solution of the clustering problem with remarkable results both to quality and computational efficiency. Its performance is compared with other popular stochastic/metaheuristic methods like particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms and tabu search based on the results taken from the application of the methodology to data taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Improving Evolutionary Computation Based Data-Mining for the Process Industry: The Importance of Abstraction	LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS IN DATA MINING	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS	An Industrial Learning Classifier System (LCS) was developed a decade ago for the mining of information in process industries, specifically for a Steel Hot Strip Mill. Despite encouraging results, the prediction accuracy achieved and the effort required did not warrant adoption. The lessons learnt for applying Genetic-based Machine Learning to industrial data-mining applications are still relevant and are described here. After 10 years further research into LCS much innovation has occurred: messy encodings, rule-base reduction, pass-through rules and flexible encodings. However, this paper hypothesises that the biggest hurdle preventing LCS from wider industrial adoption is a lack of 'abstraction', i.e., after states have been linked to actions and generalised by removing irrelevant information, similarities between rules must be abstracted to form higher level rules. Initial results for a 'toy' problem demonstrate that LCS are capable of abstraction with powerful consequences.

The advantages of these techniques are: to provide rule-based models that represent human-readable patterns; to learn incrementally, capable of adapting quickly to any changes in dynamic environments; and some of them have linear 0(n) learning complexity in the size of data set. However, not too much effort has yet been put into investigating LCSs in distributed environments. This chapter will scrutinize several issues of LCSs in distributed environments such as knowledge passing in the system, knowledge combination methods at the central location, and the effect on the system's learning accuracy of having different numbers of distributed sites.

Initial experiments show that, for moderate and high class imbalances, XCS tends to evolve a large proportion of overgeneral classifiers. Theoretical analyses are developed, deriving an imbalance bound up to which XCS should be able to differentiate between accurate and overgeneral classifiers. Some relevant parameters that have to be properly configured to satisfy the bound for high class imbalances are detected. Configuration guidelines are provided, and an algorithm that automatically tunes these XCS's parameters is presented. Finally, XCS is tested on a large set of real-world problems, appearing to be highly competitive to some of the most well-known machine learning techniques.

The performance of the Learning Classifier System is compared to that of a Genetic Programming approach from the literature. The simple Learning Classifier System is able to achieve a positive excess return in simulated trading, but results are not yet fully competitive because the Learning Classifier System trades too frequently. However, the Learning Classifier System approach shows potential because returns are obtained with no offline training and the technique is inherently adaptive, unlike many of the machine learning methods currently employed for financial trading.

Five GBML systems which represent different learning methodologies and knowledge representations in the GBML paradigm are selected for the analysis: UCS, GAssist, SLAVE, Fuzzy AdaBoost, and Fuzzy LogitBoost. UCS and GAssist are based on a non-fuzzy representation, while SLAVE, Fuzzy AdaBoost, and Fuzzy LogitBoost use a linguistic fuzzy representation. The models evolved by these five systems are compared in terms of performance and interpretability to the models created by six highly-used non-evolutionary learners. Experimental observations highlight the suitability of GBML systems for classification tasks. Moreover, the analysis points out which systems should be used depending on whether the user prefers to maximize the accuracy or the interpretability of the models.

This is a significant problem both in terms of quality of service and financial loss through over payments. These errors also present challenges for machine learning programs using the data. In this paper we propose a way of addressing this problem by using a process of moderation, in which agents argue about the classification on the basis of data from distinct groups of assessors. Our agents employ an argument based dialogue protocol (PADUA) in which the agents produce arguments directly from a database of cases, with each agent having their own separate database. We describe the protocol and report encouraging results from a series of experiments comparing PADUA with other classifiers, and assessing the effectiveness of the moderation process.

Yet, the information contained in these experiments might have uses beyond their original intent and, if properly stored, could be of great use to future research. In this paper, we hope to stimulate the development of such learning experiment repositories by providing a bird's-eye view of how they can be created and used in practice, bringing together existing approaches and new ideas. We draw parallels between how experiments are being curated in other sciences, and consecutively discuss how both the empirical and theoretical details of learning experiments can be expressed, organized and made universally accessible. Finally, we discuss a range of possible services such a resource can offer, either used directly or integrated into data mining tools.

Sensitivity analysis of mapping local image features into conceptual categories	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						statistical analysis; sensitivity analysis	RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; ANNOTATION; MACHINES	Purpose - Image classification or more specifically, annotating images with keywords is one of the important steps during image database indexing. However, the problem with current research in terms of image retrieval is more concentrated on how conceptual categories can be well represented by extracted, low level features for an effective classification. Consequently, image features representation including segmentation and low-level feature extraction schemes must be genuinely effective to facilitate the process of classification. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect on annotation effectiveness of using different (local) feature representation methods to map into conceptual categories. Design/methodology/approach - This paper compares tiling (five and nine tiles) and regioning (five and nine regions) segmentation schemes and the extraction of combinations of color, texture, and edge features in terms of the effectiveness of a particular benchmark, automatic image annotation set up. Differences between effectiveness on concrete or abstract conceptual categories or keywords are further investigated, and progress towards establishing a particular benchmark approach is also reported. Findings - In the context of local feature representation, the paper concludes that the combined color and texture features are the best to use for the five tiling and regioning schemes, and this evidence would form a good benchmark for future studies. Another interesting finding (but perhaps not surprising) is that when the number of concrete and abstract keywords increases or it is large (e.g. 100), abstract keywords are more difficult to assign correctly than the concrete ones. Research limitations/implications - Future work could consider: conduct user-centered evaluation instead of evaluation only by some chosen ground truth dataset, such as Corel, since this might impact effectiveness results; use of different numbers of categories for scalability analysis of image annotation as well as larger numbers of training and testing examples; use of Principle Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis, or indeed machine learning techniques for low-level feature selection; use of other segmentation schemes, especially more complex tiling schemes and other regioning schemes; use of different datasets, use of other low-level features and/or combination of them; use of other machine learning techniques. Originality/value - This paper is a good start for analyzing the mapping between some feature representation methods and various conceptual categories for future image annotation research.

This problem has increased the demand for effective maintenance and renewal planning. In order to implement an appropriate management procedure for a structure, a wide array of corrective strategies must be evaluated with respect to not only the condition state of each defect but also safety, economy and sustainability. This paper describes a new performance evaluation system for existing concrete bridges. The system evaluates performance based on load carrying capability and durability from the results of a visual inspection and specification data, and outputs the necessity of maintenance. It categorizes both of the girder and slab as either unsafe, severe deterioration, moderate deterioration, mild deterioration, or safe. The technique employs an expert system with an appropriate knowledge base in the evaluation. A characteristic feature of the system is the use of neural networks to evaluate the performance and facilitate refinement of the knowledge base. Generally, although a neural network is a powerful machine-learning tool, the inference process becomes a "black box," which renders the representation of knowledge in the form of rules impossible. However, the neural network proposed in the present study has the capability to prevent an inference process and knowledge base from becoming a black box. It is very important that the system is capable of detailing how the performance is calculated since the road network represents a huge investment. The effectiveness of the neural network and machine learning method is verified by comparison of diagnostic results by bridge experts.

In this paper, we propose an approach to generate constraint solvers given the definition of the constraints that combines the advantages of generation by construction with generation by testing. In our proposed approach, semantically valid rules are constructed symbolically, then the constructed rules are used to prune the search tree of a generate and test method. The combined approach leads in general to more expressive and efficient constraint solvers. The generated rules are implemented in the language Constraint Handling Rules.

Dynamic Programming Algorithms as Products of Weighted Logic Programs	LOGIC PROGRAMMING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	24th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)	DEC 09-13, 2008	Udine, ITALY	Assoc Log Programming				Weighted logic programming. a generalization of bottom-up logic programming, is a successful framework for specifying dynamic programming algorithms. In this setting, proofs, correspond to the algorithm's Output space, Such as a path through a graph or a grammatical derivation, and arc given a weighted score, often interpreted as a probability, that depends oil the score of the base axioms used in the proof. The desired output is a function over all possible proofs. Such as a sum of scores or ail optimal score. We describe the PRODUCT transformation, which can merge two weighted logic programs into a new The resulting program optimizes a product of proof scores from the original programs, constituting a scoring function known in machine learning as a "product of experts." Through the addition of intuitive constraining side conditions, we show that several important dynamic programming algorithms can be derived by applying PRODUCT to weighted logic programs corresponding to simpler weighted logic programs.
