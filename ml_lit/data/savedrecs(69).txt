It is therefore recognized that the capability to automatically extract key concepts and their relationships from such data will allow systems to properly understand the content and knowledge embedded in the free text which can be of great value for applications such as information extraction and question & answering. This paper gives a brief presentation of such textual data and its semantic annotation, and discusses the set of semantic relations that can be observed between diseases and treatments in the sample. The problem is then designed as a supervised machine learning task in which the relations are tried to be learned using pre-annotated data. The challenges designing the problem and empirical results are presented.

Selecting a good restart strategy for a problem instance can enhance the performance of a solver. Inspired by recent Success applying machine learning techniques to predict the runtime of SAT solvers, we present a method which uses machine learning to boost solver performance through a smart selection of the restart strategy. Based on easy to compute features, we train both a satisfiability classifier and runtime models. We use these models to choose between restart strategies. We present experimental results comparing this technique with the most commonly used restart strategies. Our results demonstrate that machine learning is effective in improving solver performance.

The theory of supporting vector machine based on small-sample machine learning theory is introduced into dynamic prediction of groundwater level. A least square support vector machine groundwater level dynamic forecasting model based on chaos optimization peak value identification was proposed and applied in Hetao irrigation district in Inner Mongolia. The results show that the fitted values, the tested values and the predicted values of this model have little different from their real values. And they indicate that the model is feasible and effective. So the model proposed in this paper can provide a new tool for groundwater level dynamic forecasting.

In practice however, implementations of P2P based IPTV and VOD failed to provide a satisfying QoS as the characteristic fluctuational throughput of a peer's uplink leads to frequent annoying hiccups, substantial delays and latency for those who download from it. A significant factor for the unstable throughput of peers' uplink is the behavior of other processes running on the source peer that consume bandwidth resources. In this paper we propose Maxtream - a machine learning based solution that actively predicts load in the uplink of streaming peers and coordinates source peers exchanges between peers that seer from buffer underrun and peers that enjoy satisfactory buffer size for coping with future problems. Simulation and experiments have shown that the solution successfully predicts upcoming load in popular protocols and can improve the QoS in existing P2P streaming networks.

J	Miche, Y; Bas, P; Lendasse, A; Jutten, C; Simula, O				Miche, Yoan; Bas, Patrick; Lendasse, Amaury; Jutten, Christian; Simula, Olli			A Feature Selection Methodology for Steganalysis	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article							STEGANOGRAPHY; INFORMATION; MODEL	Steganography has been known and used for a very long time, as a way to exchange information in an unnoticeable manner between parties, by embedding it in another, apparently innocuous, document. Nowadays steganographic techniques are mostly used on digital content. The online newspaper Wired News, reported in one of its articles [2] on steganography that several steganographic contents have been found on web sites with very large image database such as eBay. Niels Provos [3] has somewhat refuted these ideas by analyzing and classifying two million images from eBay and one million from USENet network and not finding any steganographic content embedded in these images. This could be due to many reasons, such as very low payloads, making the steganographic images very robust and secure to steganalysis, The security of a steganographic scheme has been defined theoretically by Cachin in [1] but this definition is very seldomly usable in practice. It requires to evaluate distributions and measure the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. In practice, steganalysis is used as a way to evaluate the security of a steganographic scheme empirically: it aims at detecting whether a medium has been tampered with - but not to detect what is in the medium or how it has been embedded. By the use of features, one can get some relevant characteristics of the considered medium, and assess, by the use of machine learning tools, usually, whether the medium is genuine or not, This is only one way to perform steganalysis, but it remains the most common. One of the main issues with this scheme is that people tend to use more and more features extracted from the media (we consider only JPEG images in this article) in order to increase the performances of detection of modified images. This number of features corresponds to the dimensionality of the space in which are performed machine learning processes (typically, training of a classifier). This usually leads to very high dimensional spaces for which many problems arise (in comparison to low dimensional spaces): mainly, the required number of images to have an appropriate filling of the space in which the classifier is trained, is never reached. This filling is required for the classifier to train on properly distributed data among the feature space. Also, when the number of features is too high, interpretation of the most relevant features becomes very difficult if not to say impossible. In this article, some of the problems encountered because of the high dimensionality of the problem usually met in steganalysis, are presented, along with possible solutions. To the problem of the required number of images for filling the space, is proposed an evaluation of a sufficient number of images: a bootstrap algorithm is used to estimate the variance of the classifier's results for different amounts of images. Once the variance is low enough to have accurate results, the number of images required for that number of features is attained. With this sufficient number of images, feature selection is then performed, with a forward algorithm, in an attempt to decrease the dimensionality and also to gain interpretability over which features have been reacting the most. Hence, a knowledge of the steganographic's scheme can be inferred and its scheme could be modified accordingly to improve its security. These ideas are combined in a methodology, which is tested on 6 different steganographic algorithms, for different sizes of the embedded information. The result is an estimation of the sufficient number of images for obtaining results with low enough variance. Selected sets of features also enable to keep the same performances (within the small variance range) while providing insights on the weaknesses of each algorithm. These weaknesses are analyzed separately for each algorithm. In conclusion, the proposed methodology enabled to estimate the variance of typically given results for steganalysis, along with added interpretability. The proposed reduced sets of features have also made it possible to keep the same performances as for the full set,	[Miche, Yoan; Bas, Patrick; Lendasse, Amaury; Simula, Olli] Helsinki Univ Technol, Lab Comp & Informat Sci, FI-02015 Espoo, Finland; [Miche, Yoan; Bas, Patrick; Jutten, Christian] UJF, CNRS, INPG, GIPSA Lab Images & Signal Dept, Grenoble, France; [Miche, Yoan] INPG, Gipsa Lab, Grenoble, France; [Miche, Yoan] ICS Lab, Tkk, France; [Lendasse, Amaury] Helsinki Univ Technol, Adapt Informat Res Ctr, FI-02015 Espoo, Finland	Miche, Y (reprint author), Helsinki Univ Technol, Lab Comp & Informat Sci, POB 5400, FI-02015 Espoo, Finland.

It is a complex process that has been dominated by manual analytics. In this chapter, we explore the new method that combines computer vision, multi-physics simulation and human-computer interaction. The objective is to bridge the gap among the three with visual transformation algorithms for mapping the data from an abstract space to an intuitive one, which includes shape correlation, periodicity, cellular shape dynamics, and spatial Bayesian machine learning. We tested this approach with the case studies of tracking and predicting oceanographic objects. In testing, with 2,384 satellite image samples from SeaWiFS, we found that the interactive visualization increases robustness in object tracking and positive detection accuracy in object prediction. We also found that the interactive method enables the user to process the image data at less than 1 min per image versus 30 min per image manually. As a result, our test system can handle at least ten times more data sets than traditional manual analysis. The results also suggest that minimal human interactions with appropriate computational transformations or cues may significantly increase the overall productivity.

Automatically detecting these movements in real-time using comfortable, miniature wireless sensors could advance autistic research and enable new intervention tools for the classroom that help children and their caregivers monitor and cope with this potentially problematic class of behavior. We present activity recognition results for stereotypical hand flapping and body rocking using data collected from six children with ASD repeatedly observed in both laboratory and classroom settings. In the classroom, an overall recognition accuracy of 88.6% (TP: 0.85; FP: 0.08) was achieved using three sensors. Challenges encountered when applying machine learning to this domain, as well as implications for the development of real-time classroom interventions and research tools, are discussed.

ViridiScope: Design and Implementation of a Fine Grained Power Monitoring System for Homes	UBICOMP'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Proceedings Paper	11th ACM International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2009	Orlando, FL	ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGMOBILE		Adaptive Sensor Calibration; Machine Learning; Nonintrusive and Spatially Distributed Sensing		A key prerequisite for residential energy conservation is knowing when and where energy is being spent. Unfortunately, the current generation of energy reporting devices only provide partial and coarse grained information or require expensive professional installation. This limitation stems from the presumption that calculating per-appliance consumption requires per-appliance current measurements. However, since appliances typically emit measurable signals when they are consuming energy, we can estimate their consumption using indirect sensing. This paper presents ViridiScope, a fine-grained power monitoring system that furnishes users with an economical, self-calibrating tool that provides power consumption of virtually every appliance in the home. ViridiScope uses ambient signals from inexpensive sensors placed near appliances to estimate power consumption, thus no inline sensor is necessary. We use a model-based machine learning algorithm that automates the sensor calibration process. Through experiments in a real house, we show that ViridiScope can estimate the end-point power consumption within 10% error.

While this process is considered trivial and simple for environments where resources are ample (e.g. desktop computers connected to printers within a corporate network), it becomes complicated when applied in a mobile context. Contemporary mobile devices have the computational resources required for document processing and are affordable enough for an increasingly large number of users. Therefore, document printing using mobile devices is now both technically feasible and relevant to users' needs. In this study, we present an infrastructure for document printing using mobile devices. In order to realize the vision, we utilize an existing set of network protocols, a set of common programming languages, standard concepts of ubiquitous computing, and machine learning, in order to automate the printing process.

English	Proceedings Paper	6th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers and Workshops	MAY 18-20, 2009	Ischia, ITALY	ACM SIGMICRO		Application Acceleration; Clearspeed; GPGPU; Performance Comparision; Semi-Automatic Porting		Work involving the use of application acceleration devices is showing great, promise, however, there are still major obstacles preventing their widespread adoption. Currently the process of porting applications to an accelerator requires expertise in both the computer science and application domains, due to the lack of abstraction available. We present. our work associated with the development of a novel solution to this abstraction problem; an intelligent semi-automatic application porting system, that will allow a higher level of abstraction, to be presented to the end user, while maintaining reasonable performance levels. A prototype system has been constructed that can successfully port applications to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and shows promising results in terms of performance comparisons between CPU and GPU. We are presently extending our prototype to other application acceleration devices and to allow the automatic selection of the most appropriate device, for all application using Machine Learning techniques.

One possible solution is to allow end-users to train machine learning systems to identify desired concepts, a strategy known as interactive concept learning. A fundamental challenge is to design systems that preserve end-user flexibility and control while also guiding them to provide examples that allow the machine learning system to effectively learn the desired concept. This paper presents our design and evaluation of four new overview-based approaches to guiding example selection. We situate our explorations within CueFlik, a system examining end-user interactive concept learning in Web image search. Our evaluation shows our approaches not only guide end-users to select better training examples than the best-performing previous design for this application, but also reduce the impact of not knowing when to stop training the system. We discuss challenges for end-user interactive concept learning systems and identify opportunities for future research on the effective design of such systems.

However, it is somewhat challenging to routinely read trough all of the comments. The purpose of this study is to introduce some methods to classify the positive or negative review pertaining to the blog comments on a movie written in Korean. For this purpose, a variety of algorithms was used to classify the reviews and allow feature-selection by applying the traditional machine learning method for classifying literature.

Detection of moving targets from a moving ground platform	UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Unmanned Systems Technology XI	APR 17-17, 2009	Orlando, FL	SPIE		Person detection; moving platforms; machine learning; camera calibration		Semi-autonomous operation of intelligent vehicles may require that such platforms maintain a basic situational awareness with respect to people, other vehicles and their intent. These vehicles should be able to operate safely among people and other vehicles, and be able to perceive threats and respond accordingly. A key requirement is the ability to detect people and vehicles from a moving platform. We have developed one such algorithm using video cameras mounted on the vehicle. Our person detection algorithms model the shape and appearance of the person instead of modeling the background. This algorithm uses histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), which model shape and appearance using image edge histograms. These HOG descriptors are computed on an exhaustive set of image windows, which are then classified as person/non-person using a support vector machine classifier. The image windows are computed using camera calibration, which provides approximate size of people with respect to their location in the imagery. The algorithm is flexible and has been trained for different domains such as urban, rural and wooded scenes. We have designed a sensor platform that can be mounted on a moving vehicle to collect video data of pedestrians. Using manually annotated ground-truth data we have evaluated the person detection algorithm in terms of true positive and false positive rates. This paper provides a detailed overview of the algorithm, describes the experiments conducted and reports on algorithmic performance.

Yet people, having accumulated wide-ranging experience, have little trouble recognizing familiar terrain types and learning to recognize new, previously unfamiliar, terrains. Robots typically accumulate experience in "chunks" and do not have the luxury of years of training. This paper presents recent results in sequential learning methods applied to robot terrain recognition. In this paper we explore different sequential learning problem formulations and alternative machine learning algorithms. The investigations are based on the same data set. We report on the initial development of an incremental fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm capable of learning new information. We report on an approach to convert regression tree modeling, normally a batch learning method, to batch-incremental learning. We investigate issues in formulating the sequential learning problem and the performance of these algorithms. We also compare performance to four incremental learning classifiers. All investigations were conducted using the same set of image features, extracted from on-board video from a small robot traversing different terrains.

Given the large amount of data currently available from sensor-equipped environments, it is important to attempt characterization of the sensor data for automatically modeling users in a ubiquitous and mobile computing environment. As described herein, we propose a method that predicts a customer model using features based on customers' behavior in a shop. We capture the customers' behavior using various sensors in the form of the time duration and the sequence between blocks in the shop. Based on behavior data from the sensors, we design features that characterize the behavior pattern of a customer in the shop. We employ those features using a machine learning approach to predict customer attributes such as age, gender, occupation, and interest. Our results show that our designed behavior-based features perform with F-values of 70-90% for prediction. We also discuss the potential applications of our method in user modeling.

The detection of smiles, however, has received less attention. Its distinctive configuration may pose less problem than other, at times subtle, expressions. On the other hand, smiles can still be very useful as a measure of happiness, enjoyment or even approval. Geometrical or local-based detection approaches like the use of lip edges may not be robust enough and thus researchers have focused on applying machine learning to appearance-based descriptors. This work makes an extensive experimental study of smile detection testing the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) as main descriptors of the image, along with the powerful Support Vector Machines classifier. The results show that error rates can be acceptable, although there is still room for improvement.

During the training phase, important trajectory features are extracted which are then used to calculate a confidence value of trajectory. The positions at which objects are usually lost and found are clustered in order to construct the set of 'lost zones' and 'found zones' in the scene. Using these zones, we construct a triplet set of zones i.e. 3 zones: In/Out zone (zone where an object can enter or exit the scene), 'lost zone' and 'found zone'. Thanks to these triplets, during the testing phase, we can repair the erroneous trajectories according to which triplet they are most likely to belong to. The advantage of our approach over the existing state of the art approaches is that (i) this method does not depend on a predefined contextual scene, (ii) we exploit the semantic of the scene and (iii) we have proposed a method to filter out noisy trajectories based on their confidence value.

We propose a new method which extracts a sample of subwindows from a set of annotated images in order to train a subwindow annotation model by using the extremely randomized trees ensemble method appropriately extended to handle high-dimensional output spaces. The annotation of a pixel of an unseen image is done by aggregating the annotations of its subwindows containing this pixel. The proposed method is compared to a more basic approach predicting the class of a pixel from a single window centered on that pixel and to other state-of-the-art image annotation methods. In teens of accuracy, the proposed method significantly outperforms the basic method and shows good performances with respect to the state-of-the-art, while being more generic, conceptually simpler, and of higher computational efficiency than these latter.

The first one is Artificial Intelligence, while the second tool is Visual Complexity. A review of Artificial Intelligence techniques, which may be used to improve traditional methods in specific areas of Computer Graphics, is first presented in this chapter. After a definition of the main principles of Artificial Intelligence, three main areas of Artificial Intelligence are briefly described. Problem resolution gives general methods, which could be applied to resolve problems, especially heuristic search. Two specific sub-areas of problem resolution techniques are detailed: strategy computer games and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Expert Systems are able to advantageously replace human experts in various application areas. The main principles of Expert Systems are briefly presented. Finally, machine-learning techniques, mainly based on Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, are described.

This paper examines the visual texture classification in order to investigate how well it could be used for haptic texture search engine. In classifying the visual textures, feature extraction for a given image involving wavelet decomposition is used to obtain the transformation coefficients. Feature vectors are formed using energy signature from each wavelet sub-band coefficient. We conducted an experiment to investigate the extent in which wavelet decomposition could be used in haptic texture search engine. The experimental result, based on different testing data, shows that feature extraction using wavelet decomposition achieve accuracy rate more than 96%. This demonstrates that wavelet decomposition and energy signature is effective in extracting information from a visual texture. Based on this finding, we discuss on the suitability of wavelet decomposition for haptic texture searching, in terms of extracting information from image and haptic information.

The algorithm combines SVM with fuzzy clustering in order to improve the accuracy of SVM. Only samples that have weak relationships with all clusters are involved in SVM. Simulation experiment has been carried out to show that the algorithm based on the improved SVM may obtain better effectiveness than the normal SVM when it is applied for children abnormal gait analysis.

Most of existing IDs use all features in the network packet to look for known intrusive patterns. Some of these features are irrelevant or redundant. Rough Set Classification (RSC), a modern learning algorithm, is used to rank features extracted for detecting intrusions and generate intrusion detection models. In this paper a new hybrid model RSC-PGA (Rough Set Classification Parallel Genetic Algorithm) is presented to address the problem of identifying important features in building an intrusion detection system, increase the convergence speed and decrease the training time of RSC. Tests are done on KDD-99 dataset used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition. Results showed that the proposed model gives better and robust representation of rules as it was able to select features resulting in great data reduction, time reduction and error reduction in detecting new attacks.

It features many attractive characteristics, like entity-based link graph, abundant categorization and semi-structured layout, and can serve as an ideal data source to extract high quality and well-structured data. In this chapter, we first propose several Solutions to extract knowledge from Wikipedia. We do not only consider information from the relational summaries of articles (infoboxes) but also semi-automatically extract it from the article text using the structured content available. Due to differences with information extraction from the Web, it is necessary to tackle new problems, like the lack of redundancy in Wikipedia that is dealt with by extending traditional machine learning algorithms to work with few labeled data. Furthermore, we also exploit the widespread categories as a complementary way to discover additional knowledge. Benefiting from both structured and textural information, we additionally provide a suggestion service for Wikipedia authoring. With the aim to facilitate semantic reuse, our proposal provides users with facilities such as link, categories and infobox content suggestions. The proposed enhancements can be applied to attract more contributors and lighten the burden of professional editors. Finally, we developed an enhanced search system, which can ease the process of exploiting Wikipedia. To provide a user-friendly interface, it extends the faceted search interface with relation navigation and let the user easily express his complex information needs in an interactive way. In order to achieve efficient query answering, it extends scalable IR engines to index and search both the textual and structured information with an integrated ranking support.

The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content (UGC) have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of UGC that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this chapter, we intend to investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests for a recommender system. In order to achieve that goal, folksonomies have been included into ITR (ITem Recommender), a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari [7]. Specifically, static content consisting of the descriptions of the items in a collection have been enriched with dynamic UGC through social tagging techniques. The new recommender system, called FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), extends the original ITR system integrating UGC management by letting users to express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as to annotate rated items with free tags. The main contribution of the chapter is an integrated strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques, both on official item descriptions provided by a publisher and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests, often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the domain Of Cultural heritage personalization. Experiments involving 40 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one.

Since manual construction of taxonomies requires considerable efforts, automated methods for taxonomy construction should be considered. In this paper, an approach for automatic derivation of concept taxonomies from web search results is presented. The method is based on generating derivative features from web search data and applying the machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained with known concept hyponym-hypernym pairs and the obtained classification model is used to predict new hyponymy (is-a) relations. Prediction results are used to generate concept taxonomies in OWL. The results of the application of the approach for constructing colour taxonomy are presented.

B	Baeza-Yates, R			ACM	Baeza-Yates, Ricardo			User Generated Content: How Good is It?	WICOW 09			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd ACM Workshop on Information Credibility on the Web	APR 20, 2009	Madrid, SPAIN	Natl Inst Info & Commun Technol, Kyoto Univ Global COE		User generated content; Web 2.0; Web quality		User Generated Content (UGC) is one of the main current trends in the Web. This trend has allowed all people that can access the Internet to publish content in different media, such as text (e.g. blogs), photos or video. This data can be crucial for many applications, in particular for semantic search, as we argue in [2]. It is early to say which impact UGC will have and to what extent. However, the impact; will be clearly related to the quality of this content. Hence, how good is the content that people generate in the so called Web 2.0? Clearly is not as good as editorial content in the Web site of a publisher. However, histories of success such as the case of the Wikipedia, show that it can be quite good. In addition, the quality gap is balanced by volume, as user generated content is much larger than, say, editorial content. In fact, Ramakrishnan and Tomkins [7] estimate that UGC generates daily from 8 to 10GB while the professional Web only generates 2GB in the same time. How we can estimate the quality of UGC? One possibility is to directly evaluate the quality, but that is not easy as depends on the type of content and the availability of human judgments. One example of such approach is the study of Yahoo! Answers done by Agichtein et al. [1]. In this work they start from a judged question/answer collection where good questions usually have good answers. Then they predict good questions and good answers, obtaining an AUC (area under the curve of the precision-recall graph) of 0.76 and 0.88, respectively. A second possibility is obtaining indirect evidence of the quality. For example, use UGC for a given task and then evaluate the quality of the task results. One such example is the extraction of semantic relations done by Baeza-Yates and Tiberi [4]. To evaluate the quality of the results they used the Open Directory Project (ODP), showing that the results had a precision of over 60%. For the cases that; were not found in the ODP, a manually verified sample showed that the real precision was close to 100%. What happened was that the ODP was not specific enough to contain very specific relations, and every day the problem gets worse as we have more data. This example shows the quality of ODP as well as the semantic encoded in queries. Notice that we can define queries as implicit; UGC, because each query can be considered an implicit tag to Web pages that are clicked for that query, and hence we have an implicit taxonomy. A final alternative is crossing different UGC sources and infer from there the quality of those sources. An example of this case, is the work by Van Zwol et al. [5, 6] where they use collective knowledge (wisdom of crowds) to extend image tags, and prove that almost 70% of the tags can be semantically classified by using Wordnet and Wikipedia. This exposes the quality of both Flickr tags and Wikipedia. Our main motivation, summarized in [3], is that by being able to generate semantic resources automatically from the Web (and in particular the Web 2.0), even with noise, coupling that with open content resources, we can create a virtuous feedback circuit. In fact, explicit and implicit folksonomies can be used to do supervised machine learning without the need of manual intervention (or at least drastically reduce it) to improve semantic tagging. After that, we can feedback the results on itself, and repeat the process. Using the right conditions, every iteration should improve the output, obtaining a virtuous cycle. As a side effect, we can also improve Web search, our main goal.

We demonstrate how developing a concrete characterization of quality for web-based resources can make machine learning approaches to automating quality assessment in the realm of educational digital libraries tractable. Using data from several previous studies of quality, we gathered a set of key dimensions and indicators of quality that were commonly identified by educators. We then performed a mixed-method study of digital library quality experts, showing that our characterization of quality captured the subjective processes used by the experts when assessing resource quality. Using key indicators of quality selected from a statistical analysis of our expert study data, we developed a set of annotation guidelines and annotated a corpus of 1000 digital resources for the presence or absence of the key quality indicators. Agreement among annotators was high, and initial machine learning models trained from this corpus were able to identify some indicators of quality with as much as an 18% improvement over the baseline.

Gene expression programming (GEP) is a genotype/phenotype genetic algorithm that evolves computer programs of different sizes and shapes (expression trees) encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length. In this paper we propose a novel method for multiclass classification by using GEP, a new hybrid of genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP). Different to the common method of formulating a multiclass classification problem as multiple two-class problems, we construct a novel multiclass classification by using eigenvalue centroid of each class and eigenvalue-power function. Experimental results on two real data sets demonstrate that method is able to achieve a preferable solution.

Classification based on association rules is one of the most effective classification method, whose accuracy is higher and discovered rules are easier to understand comparing with classical classification methods. However, current algorithms for classification based on association rules is single table oriented, which means they can only apply to the data stored in a single relational table. Directly applying these algorithms in multi-relational data environment will result in many problems. This paper proposes a novel algorithm MrCAR for classification based on association rules in multi-relational data environment. MrCAR mines relevant features in each table to predict the class label. Close itemsets technique and Tuple ID Propagation method are used to improve the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results show that MrCAR has higher accuracy and better understandability comparing with a typical existing multirelational classification algorithm.			guyingqin@ruc.edu.cn; hyliu@tsinghua.edu.cn; hejun@ruc.edu.cn; erichu2006@ruc.edu.cn; duyong@ruc.edu.cn					DEHASPE L, 1997, P 7 INT WORKSH IND L, P125; Dong G., 1999, P 2 INT C DISC SCI, P30; Han J., 2007, DATA MINING CONCEPTS; HE J, 2007, J SOFTWARE, P2752; JENSEN VC, 2000, P PAC AS C KNOWL DIS, P49; Li W., 2001, P IEEE INT C DAT MIN, P369; Liu B., 1998, P 4 INT C KNOWL DISC, P80; MUGGLETON S, 1998, P 1 INT C DISC SCI, P326; Ng E.K.K., 2002, P 2002 IEEE INT C DA, P322; Nijssen S., 2001, P 17 INT JOINT C ART, P891; Pasquier N., 1999, P 7 INT C DAT THEOR, P398; Pei J., 2000, P ACM SIGMOD WORKSH, P21; WANG R, 2007, ICITM; XU L, 2006, J ZHEJIANG U ZHEJIAN, P216; Yin X, 2003, P SDM; Yin XX, 2004, PROC INT CONF DATA, P399; Zaki MJ, 2002, SIAM PROC S, P457; Zaki Mohammed J., 2003, P 9 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P326; Zhou S., 2000, P 6 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P265, DOI 10.1145/347090.347147	19	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3817-4				2009							256	260		10.1109/WISM.2009.60		5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BNX99	WOS:000275860800052

To explore such dynamics, we used a robotic setup to produce well-controlled stimuli consisting of two different textures (gratings of spatial period combinations 520+1920 mu m and 400+1920 mu m) which were moved across a subject's finger pad during electro-encephalograpy (EEG) acquisition. After decomposing the EEG signals with independent component analysis (ICA), a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied to each of the nonartifactual components to identify those where the temporal patterns encoded texture differences. In five of six subjects one such significant component was identified. Inverse source modeling revealed that in four of these subjects the components were located to the contralateral somatosensory cortex, consistent with previous research on tactile processing. In addition, components located to the ipsilateral somatosensory cortices not containing differentiating activity were identified. Thus, using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms we demonstrated that it is possible to decode and localize subtle differences in temporal brain processing patterns related to textures perceived through the finger pad.

Based on an integration of two machine learning techniques: a hybrid evolutionary algorithm which combines PSO and Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm Search approach based on test-sample error estimate criterion (PSO-AFSAS-TEE) and support vector regression (SVR), this paper proposes a novel evolutionary model for future electricity load forecasting. The proposed evolutionary model adopts an integrated architecture to optimize the prediction of time series. Firstly, the theory of Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) technique was used for nonlinear dynamic system analysis and prediction with the chaotic load series. Then, a PSO-AFSAS-TEE evolutionary system is proposed to choose the parameters of SVR automatically in time series prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with actual data taken from the Australia Power Grid.

One advantage of the Internet is the ease with which people can communicate online. The popularity of online communication has created an explosion of users who regularly access the internet to connect with others. Many people use email to stay in touch with relatives and friends who live far away geographically. We propose a new framework to help prioritised email better using machine learning techniques; an intelligent email reply prediction system. Our goal is to provide concise, highly structured and prioritised emails, thus saving the user from browsing through thousands of emails and help to reduce time spent on checking and reading email messages.

In this paper, we build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to find the relationship between object-oriented metrics given by Chidamber and Kemerer and fault proneness. The proposed model is empirically evaluated using public domain KC1 NASA data set. The performance of the SVM method was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on these results, it is reasonable to claim that such models could help for planning and performing testing by focusing resources on fault-prone parts of the design and code. Thus, the study shows that SVM method may also be used in constructing software quality models.

The investigation utilizes couple of intuitive feature sets and studies various parameters that affect the identification performance. Many studies manipulated the problem of authorship identification in manually collected corpora, but only few utilized real data from existing blogs. The complexity of the language model in personal blogs is motivating to identify the correspondent author. The main contribution of this work is at least three folds. Firstly, we utilize the LIWC and MRC feature sets together, which have been developed with Psychology background, for the first time for authorship identification on personal blogs. Secondly, we analyze the effect of various parameters, and feature sets, on the identification performance. This includes the number of authors in the data corpus, the post size or the word count, and the number of posts for each author. Finally, we study applying authorship identification over a limited set of users that have a common personality attributes. This analysis is motivated by the lack of standard or solid recommendations in literature for such task, especially in the domain of personal blogs. The results and evaluation show that the utilized features are compact while their performance is highly comparable with other larger feature sets. The analysis also confirmed the most effective parameters, their ranges in the data corpus, and the usefulness of the common users classifier in improving the performance, for the author identification task.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) were used to predict daily returns for ail FX carry basket. Market observable exogenous variables known to have a relationship with the basket along with lags of the basket's return were used as inputs into these methods. Combinations of these networks were used in a committee and simple trading rules based on this amalgamated output were used to predict when carry basket returns would be negative for a day and hence a trader should go short this long-biased asset. The effect of using the networks for regression to predict actual returns was compared to their use as classifiers to predict whether the following day's return would be up or dowry. Assuming highly conservative estimates of trading costs, over the 10.5 year (2751 trading day) rolling out of sample period investigated, improvements of 120% in MAR. ratio. 110% in Sortino and 80% in Sharpe relative to the 'Always In' benchmark were found.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model for program trees, named HS-Model, to deal with both the above issues. The HS-Model conducts statistic analysis of the current population and generates superior subtrees automatically with efficiency. The HS-Model leaves out the tedious operations to keep the promising subtrees for reusing and also omits updating the subtree library according to certain criterion. Experimental results on solving the classical artificial ant problem proved the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed method.

We first build word class ontology from the English corpus and calculate the weight of relation between words in the same or different ontologies by counting the frequency of co-occurrence. With our constructed ontologies, we introduce the MT system model including the syntactic and semantic translation module. Each module translates the source language in different way. The syntactic translation module transforms the structure of English into Korean structure. The semantic translation module extracts an exact meaning of a word using ontologies. Through the both translation modules the source language is naturally translated into a target language.			lovely603@icu.ac.kr; iseeyou@icu.ac.kr; ksk0314@icu.ac.kr; hjchoi@icu.ac.kr					CHOI S, 2007, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, V34, P95; HUANG J, 2008, KOREA I INFORM SCI E, V35; KANG SJ, 2004, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, V1; KIM S, 2006, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, P345; KIM S, 2006, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, P229; LEE S, 2008, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, V15; LEE S, 2008, KOREA INFORM PROCESS; MIN Y, 2007, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, V14; MIN Y, 2008, KOREA INFORM PROCESS, V15	9	0	0	ELECTRONICS TELECOMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH INST	TAEJON	161 KAJONG-DONG, YUSONG-GU, TAEJON, 305-350, SOUTH KOREA		978-89-5519-138-7				2009							2129	2132				4	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Telecommunications	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BKI82	WOS:000268233601126

Variable Interaction Structure Based Machine Learning Technique for Cancer Tumor Classification	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	AMTI, BES Technol, ESLSYS, VICON, INSTRON, Process Engn Publishing, Wiley Blackwell		Cancer; identification; DPCCM; VPMCD		Clinical diagnosis of disease samples largely benefits from multivariate statistical analysis, especially the machine learning techniques. One such example of medical application of statistical tools is the cancer tumor classification. In this study, Discriminating Partial Correlation Coefficient Metric (DPCCM) and Variable Predictive Model based Class Discrimination (VPMCD) are proposed as the new machine learning techniques for the same. Publicly available dataset Wisconsin Diagnose Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset and Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) dataset are analyzed to identify malignant cancer cells from benign cancer cells. Performance of the new classifiers are compared with the existing classifiers. The results based on the overall analysis indicate that DPCCM is potentially a better tool to identify and separate specific tumor samples. It achieves 100% accuracy of classification of test samples for WDBC dataset and 94% on WBC dataset. The performance of the approach is encouraging and its applicability to different cancer datasets (especially multi class problems) is being attempted further.

Prior studies have focused on cost-based evaluation of the models after the training process has completed. A software practitioner would appreciate the knowledge of which models are better when the different costs of misclassification are incorporated into the model-training process. This is in contrast to computing, post-training, the expected cost of misclassification of the software quality models. A case study of two high-assurance software projects illustrates the benefits of building a cost-sensitive software quality model. The C4.5 decision tree and Random Forests learners are used for building the classifiers, while the MetaCost technique is used for cost-sensitive learning. The benefit of cost-sensitive software quality modeling is clearly demonstrated by the case study results.

However, disassembly errors, e.g., arising from binary obfuscations, can render this assumption invalid. This work describes a machine-learning-based approach, using decision trees, for statically identifying possible errors in a static disassembly; such potential errors may then be examined more closely, e.g., using dynamic analyses. Experimental results using a variety of input executables indicate that our approach performs well, correctly identifying most disassembly errors with relatively few false positives.

The conventional shared cache scheme loses performance due to the blind distribution of data predominantly accessed by a single thread. SOS, our software-oriented distributed shared cache management approach, infers a program's data affinity hints through a novel machine learning based analysis of its L2 cache access behavior. The OS utilizes the hints to guide proper data placement in the L2 cache with page coloring. The derived hints are independent of the program input and can be used for multiple runs. By off-loading the cache management task onto software, SOS deviates substantially from previously proposed hardware-based strategies and opens up a new opportunity for the CMP cache optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SOS is very effective in reducing the number of remote cache accesses. By using the hints for guiding page coloring alone, SOS achieves an average speedup of 10% and up to 23% over the shared cache scheme. When hints are used to direct data replication, SOS secures an additional performance gain of 9%, performing 19% better than the shared cache scheme on average.

The most common treatment for children with ALL is chemotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop cell division. The drug and dosage combinations may vary for each child. Unfortunately, chemotherapy treatments may cause serious side effects. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as therapeutic agents for children with ALL for more than 50 years. Common and widely drugs in this class include prednisolone and dexamethasone. Childhood leukemia now has a survival rate of 80% (Pui, Robison, & Look, 2008). The key clinical question is identifying those children who will not respond well to established therapy strategies. GCs regulate diverse biological processes, for example, metabolism, development, differentiation, cell survival and immunity. GCs induce apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in lymphoid cells. In fact, not much is known about the molecular mechanism of GCs sensitivity and resistance, and GCs-induced apoptotic signal transduction pathways and there are many controversial hypotheses about both genes regulated by GCs and potential molecular mechanism of GCs-induced apoptosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this drug should lead to better prognostic factors (treatment response), more targeted therapies and prevention of side effects. GCs induced apoptosis have been studied by using microarray technology in vivo and in vitro on samples consisting of GCs treated ALL cell lines, mouse thymocytes and/or ALL patients. However, time series GCs treated childhood ALL datasets are currently extremely limited. DNA microarrays are essential tools for analysis of expression of many genes simultaneously. Gene expression data show the level of activity of several genes under experimental conditions. Genes with similar expression patterns could belong to the same pathway or have similar function. DNA microarray data analysis has been carried out using statistical analysis as well as machine learning and data mining approaches. There are many microarray analysis tools; this study aims to combine emergent clustering methods to get meaningful biological insights into mechanisms underlying GCs induced apoptosis. In this study, microarray data originated from prednisolone (glucocorticoids) treated childhood ALL samples (Schmidt et al., 2006) (B-linage and T-linage) and collected at 6 and 24 hours after treatment are analysed using four methods: Self-organizing maps (SOMs), Emergent self-organizing maps (ESOM) (Ultsch & Morchen, 2005), the Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) (Ernst & Bar-Joseph, 2006) and Fuzzy clustering by Local Approximation of MEmbership (FLAME) (Fu & Medico, 2007). The results revealed intrinsic biological patterns underlying the GCs time series data: there are at least five different gene activities happening during the three time points; GCs-induced apoptotic genes were identified; and genes active at both time points or only at 6 hours or 24 hours were determined. Also, interesting gene clusters with membership in already known pathways were found thereby providing promising candidate gens for further inferring GCs induced apoptotic gene regulatory networks.

EM uses machine learning and optimisation algorithms such as genetic programming. Stolk and Hanan (2007) used EM to discover genetic regulatory network models of branching in Pisum sativum (pea). Here EM is used to discover models of genetic and metabolic networks regulating flowering in pea. These models describe multiple levels and components in the whole plant complex system, including genes, intercellular signals, modules and phenotype. Flowering in pea is determined by genes and mobile signals, mediating environmental influences such as photoperiod. Models of biochemical mechanisms explaining flowering time of pea studied here incorporate modules such as a circadian clock, signal processors and switching mechanisms. Each module is a combination of chemical reactions. Three hierarchical system levels are involved: the top level of the whole plant (phenotype); a middle level of modules; a bottom level of chemical reactions. It was hypothesised that models describing each level could be automatically discovered by genetic programming, given data on the next higher level. Discovered models should predict experimental data on gene expression and flowering time of wild type and several mutant pea plants. The purpose of this research is a proof of principle of a computational method, so models were kept deliberately as simple as possible and no attempt was made to incorporate the latest biological insights. In three experiments it was attempted to discover models of a biochemical reactions network leading to a circadian clock, i.e. a time evolution with a periodicity of about 24 hours of at least one chemical substance in the network. Nodes of possible networks were concentrations of chemical substances. Connections were reactions between these substances. Possible reactions included activation, inhibition, synthesis, transformation and degradation. It was shown that genetic programming can successfully reverse engineer a circadian chemical clock, but that the exact solution found depends on the flexibility allowed by imposed constraints. In another experiment it was assumed that flowering time of the plant was determined by a network of modules. Nodes of possible networks were modules, each consisting of a set of chemical reactions performing a well-defined function. Modules were connected by reactions between chemical substances representing output and input signals. One module's input could be activated or inhibited by another module's output. Possible modules included: a circadian clock; a light sensing module; a long day signal module combining the clock and light signals to determine day length; a flowering signal module; a flowering switch module determining flowering time. Genetic programming, using as inputs possible modules and connecting activation and inhibition functions, produced parameters for these functions leading to a model with a good fit to the experimental data on flowering time of different pea mutants in different photoperiod conditions. In this research it has been shown how genetic programming can be used in a modular system at multiple levels. At the lowest level, possible mechanisms of a module can be inferred from the module's function. At a higher level, knowledge about the way modules fit together can be obtained from the behaviour of the whole system.

Dramatic steps were taken to reduce the total run-time per simulation of the selected complex model in the calibration phase: a model that takes a few seconds per run can be calibrated simply, but one with several minutes or hours of computer time per run offers limited scope for matching fitness criteria. Complex models are difficult to calibrate. A model can be calibrated for its particular objective or purpose, using either algorithmic approach. There are gains from machine learning, over GAs for some situations which we will enumerate. Coarse-grained parallelization offers a limited scope for increasing the number of simulations that can be run in acceptable elapsed wall-clock time, but some hard limits do exist. Our high-performance computer platforms are based on interconnecting clusters of processors, connected by high speed (gigabit) Ethernet. For a cluster of n processors, the hard lower bound on the fraction by the elapsed time can be reduced is 1/n, limiting the utility of increasing n for moderately complex models. Fortunately, the communication overhead in this class of architecture is demonstrably nearly constant with n for a moderately large number (< 100) of processors, and it has a relatively minor negative impact on speedup. Our parallelization of two well-known algorithms, Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) and Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) was relatively simple. The algorithms were run asynchronously on disjoint subsets of the parameter search space for a fixed number of steps on n-1 processors, after which they reported to a master node which determined the redistribution of computational effort depending on the current value of the fitness function being used to monitor the success of the calibration. Extensive experiments were performed using classical test functions and environmental models of different time-complexity, whose run times varied from a few seconds to significant fractions of an hour. Limiting the numbers of interprocessor communication steps required in this master-slave interaction may increase the overall numbers of simulations, but this compromise does not change the order of the speedup, for practical numbers of processors (N < 30). An alternative to a parallel GA is to apply machine learning using a "gridded" approach. This would appear at first glance to be a "brute force" approach, but we note that the required numbers of simulations to "learn" the behaviour of the parameter space in the calibration grows logarithmically with the size of that space, and that this class of approach has the potential to be competitive with GAs. The impact on multiple simultaneous calibrations of several watersheds can be significant, even to the point of making feasible a problem that, with other calibration schemes and GAs is often intractable. Since the calculation is derived from the fitness test, simulations cannot be easily reused in the GA approach; as a result, a lot of computation is discarded. By contrast, for machine learning approaches, every simulation is preserved in a database, and the comparison of the fitness function to observation is not required during simulation. If a fitness test is applied and it dictates a second or subsequent iteration is necessary, it is included in the database for potential future use. From this approach, we also hypothesize that a "table-top" agent for a specific watershed nonpoint source (NPS) model, for instance, is certainly worth the attempt to implement machine learning. This approach may be the only reasonable calibration strategy for multiply-connected models or for producing Bayesian Network model approximations for dealing with uncertain inputs. Practical tests of hypotheses on communication overhead that confirm our assertions have been conducted using SAC-SMA, WATFLOOD, AGNPS and SWAT using data from published test results and from typical Southern Canadian watersheds. Our test runs make use of the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computer Network (SHARCNET), located in several institutions in Southern Ontario, Canada.

SDMs can be used as a tool to solve some theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems. The success of their applications depends on the accuracy of the models. In this study we propose an approach to thoroughly assess the accuracy of species distribution models. This includes three aspects: First is to use several accuracy indices that not only measure model discrimination capability, but also those that measure model reliability. The former is the power of the model that differentiates presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the true probabilities that species occurs in individual locations. Previous studies have shown that some accuracy measures are sensitive to the prevalence of the test dataset, and that others are not. While all the reliability measures display this sensitivity to prevalence, only do some discriminatory measures fall into the latter group. Many researchers recommend the use of prevalence-insensitive measures in model accuracy assessment. However, using this approach the calibration power of the models cannot be assessed. We argue that calibration measures should also be provided in model accuracy assessments. The second aspect is to provide confidence intervals associated with the estimates of accuracy indices. Analytical methods, both parametric and nonparametric, have been introduced for constructing the confidence intervals for many accuracy indices. Computer-intensive methods (e.g. bootstrap and jackknife) can also be used to construct confidence intervals that are more attractive than the traditional analytical methods as (1) they have less statistical assumptions; and (2) they are virtually applicable to any accuracy measures. The third aspect is to provide an assessment of accuracy across a range of test data prevalence, since some accuracy indices are dependant on this quality of the test data. Test data with differing levels of prevalence will provide a range of results for the same accuracy index. Assessing the accuracy at only one level of prevalence will not provide a complete picture of the accuracy of the models. The range of test data prevalence can be set up by researchers according to their knowledge about the target species, or could be taken from the confidence interval of the population prevalence estimated from the sample data if the data can be considered as a random sample of the population. In this paper, we use an Australian native plant species, Forest Wire-grass (Tetrarrhena juncea), as an example to demonstrate our approach to more thoroughly assessing the accuracy of species distribution models. The accuracy of two models, one from a machine learning method (Random Forest, RF) and another from a statistical method (generalized additive model, GAM), were assessed using nine accuracy indices along a range of test data prevalence (i.e. the 95% confidence interval of the population prevalence estimated from the sample data using bootstrap percentile method), and a bootstrap method was used to construct the confidence intervals for the accuracy indices. With this approach, the species distribution models were thoroughly assessed.

Species distribution modeling can be used as a tool to solve many theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems, which include testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, assessing species invasion and climate change impact, and supporting conservation planning and reserve selection. The utility of SDM in real world applications requires the knowledge of the model's accuracy. The accuracy of a model includes two aspects: discrimination capacity and reliability. The former is the power of the model to differentiate presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the observed proportion of sites occupied by the subject species. Similar methodology has been used for model accuracy assessment in different fields, including medical diagnostic test, weather forecasting and machine learning, etc. Some accuracy measures are used in all fields, e.g. the overall accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; while the use of other measures is largely restricted to specific fields, e.g. F-measure is mainly used in machine learning field, or is referred to by different names in different fields, e.g. "true skill statistic" is used in atmospheric science and it is called "Youden's J" in medical diagnostic field. In this paper we review those accuracy measures typically used in ecology. Generally, the measures can be divided into two groups: threshold-dependent and threshold-independent. Measures in the first group are used for binary predictions, and those in the second group are used for continuous predictions. Continuous predictions may be transformed to binary ones if a specific threshold is employed. In such cases, the threshold-dependent accuracy measures can also be used. The threshold-dependent indices used in or introduced to SDM field include overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, odds ratio, true skill statistic, F-measure, Cohen's kappa, and normalized mutual information (NMI). However, since NMI only measures the agreement between two patterns, it cannot differentiate the worse-than-random models from the better-than-random models, which reduces its utility as an accuracy measure. The threshold-independent indices used in or introduced to the SDM field include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Gini index, and point biserial correlation coefficient. The proportion of explained deviance D(2) and its adjusted form have been also introduced into SDM field. But this adjusted metric has no theoretical foundation in the context of generalized linear modeling. Therefore, we provide another adjusted form, which was proposed by H. V. Houwelingen based on the asymptotic chi(2) distribution of the log-likelihood statistics. Its superiority over other related measures has been found through previous simulation studies. We also provide another analogous measure, the coefficient of determination R(2), which has had a long history in weather forecast verification and was also recommended for use in medical diagnosis. Though these measures D(2) and R(2) are routinely used to evaluate generalized linear models (GLMs), we argue that nothing prevents them from being applied to other GLM-like models. In SDM accuracy assessment, discrimination capacity is often considered, but model reliability is frequently ignored. The primary reason for this is that no reliability measure has been introduced into the ecological literature. To meet this need we also suggest that root mean square error be used as a reliability measure. Its squared form, mean square error, has been used in meteorology for a long time, and is called Brier's score. We also discuss the effect of prevalence dependence of accuracy measures and the precision of accuracy estimates.

Detailed process economic models were linked to models of the drug development pathway to predict the technical, financial and risk implications of alternative strategies for portfolios of biopharmaceutical drugs proceeding through development. Machine learning and evolutionary computation techniques were harnessed to evolve strategies to multi-objective optimality. An industrially-relevant case study is presented that focuses on the following decisions for a portfolio of therapeutic antibodies: the portfolio composition, the scheduling of critical development and manufacturing activities, and the involvement of third parties for these activities. The impact of budgetary constraints on the optimal set of solutions is also illustrated.

Previous efforts in this area have demonstrated the potential of determining the authorship of a disputed piece of source code automatically, This was achieved by using source code metrics to build a database of developer profiles, thus characterizing a population of developers. These profiles were then used to determine the likelihood that the unidentified source code was authored by a given developer. In this paper we evaluate the effect of discretizing source code metrics for use in building developer profiles. It is well known that machine learning techniques perform better when using categorical variables as opposed to continuous ones. We present a genetic algorithm to discretize metrics to improve source code to author classification. We evaluate the approach with a case study involving 20 open source developers and over 750,000 lines of Java source code.

Rough set theory is a relatively new soft computing tool to deal with vagueness and uncertainty. It has received much attention of the researchers around the world. Rough set theory has been successfully applied to many areas including pattern recognition, machine learning, decision support, process control and predictive modeling. Due to incompleteness and complexity of fault diagnosis for power transformer, a specific fault diagnostic model based on rough set theory is presented in this paper. After the statistical analysis of the collected fault examples of oil-immersed power transformer and the use of rough set theory to reduce result, diagnosis rules are acquired and they could be used to improve the condition assessment of power transformer. The fault diagnose inference model was built based on the advantage of effectively simple decision rules and easy reality of rough sets. It simplifies the diagnose rules with no affecting the effect of diagnose. The significant advantage of the new method is that it can discriminate the indispensable alarm signals from dispensable ones that would not affect the correctness of the diagnosis results even if they are missing or erroneous.

This paper tried to apply EMO to the parameters estimation problem of SVMs, and we investigated which combination of objectives is proper for this problem. We examined the performance of SVMs classifier with using not only cross-validation(CV) case, but also inverted CV which the ratios of training data and external test set is swapped.

SVM gained more and more importance for practical applications in the past years as they have excellent generalization abilities due to the principle of structural risk minimization. However, standard kernel functions for SVM are not able to compare time series of variable length appropriately, i.e., when we assume that these time series must be scaled in a non-linear way. Therefore, we use the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique as a kernel function. We demonstrate for two financial time series (FDAX and FGBL futures) that excellent results can be obtained with this approach.

Because an HO study is costly and time consuming, the development of a numerical observer (NO) surrogate is highly desirable. NO, like the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), typically uses some features, i.e. numerical values, extracted from images to predict HO performance. Recently, we proposed and successfully tested a supervised-learning approach for modeling HOs with a machine-learning algorithm (namely a support vector machine). In the supervised-learning approach the goal is to identify the relationship between measured image features and HO defect likelihood scores. In this work we further explore the proposed learning approach by evaluating the image feature selection. Our preliminary results use, as a starting point, the image features as those used in CHO methodology, namely the outputs of four constant-Q frequency-band filters intended to model the human visual system, indicating that the features have significant influence on the NO accuracy in predicting HO performance.

In the supervised-learning approach, the goal is to identify the mapping (regression) between measured image features and defect likelihood scores given to an image by an HO. To identify this mapping (training phase), the proposed methodology uses a number of images for which human observer scores are available. The number of images and reconstruction methods for which the HO scores are available are limited. Therefore, in this work we are evaluating the proposed machine-learning based numerical observer performance as a function of the number of different reconstruction methods used during the training phase. The results indicate, as would be expected, that the more reconstruction methods used, the better the NO performance, but, surprisingly, the improvement of having more than five or six reconstruction methods is not significant.

The main goal is to solve the problem of AR tracking in outdoor environment by only using vision and natural features. Instead of tracking fiducial markers, we track natural keypoints, during which the point correspondences are established from the classification perspective. The tracking range is able to be extended by employing many reference images. These results in a promising algorithm that successfully tested on a touring guide system, which provides views of virtual original appearance superimposed to ruins of Yuanmingyuan archaeological site of China. Comparisons are also made between ARToolkit and the proposed algorithm in indoor environment. Experimental results demonstrated that our algorithm is characterized by fairly robustness and high time efficiency in both indoor and outdoor application.

There has already been significant research into this endeavor for historical text; however, in this work we consider the problem of adding hyperlinlcs among graphic elements. While such a system would not have the ubiquitous utility of text-based hyperlinks, as we will show, there are several domains where it can significantly augment textual information. While OCR of historical text is known to be a difficult problem, the actual words themselves are inherently discrete. Thus, two words are either identical or not. This means that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, including semi-supervised learning, can be easily used. However, as we shall demonstrate, semi-supervised learning does not work well with images, because we cannot expect binary matching decisions. Rather we must deal with degrees of matching. In this work we make the novel observation that this "degree of matching" biased algorithms make overly confident predictions about simple shapes. We show that a simple technique for correcting this bias, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method significantly improves accuracy on diverse historical image collections.

One exception is Allmusic.com which offers browsing by musical emotion, using human experts to classify several thousand songs into 183 moods. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used instead of human experts to extract emotions in Music. The classification is based on a psychological model of emotion that is extended to 23 specific emotion categories. Our results for mining the lyrical text of songs for specific emotion are promising, generate classification models that are human-comprehensible, and generate results that correspond to commonsense intuitions about specific emotions. Mining lyrics focused in this paper is one aspect of research which combines different classifiers of musical emotion such as acoustics and lyrical text.

This paper focuses on the detection and tracking of multiple vehicles present in the field of view of a camera. Until now, the vehicle detection has been mainly performed by the widely used technique called background subtraction, which is based on detecting changes in an image sequence. While there has been long research on this technique, it still faces many challenges. We present in this paper a new framework to detect vehicles, based on a hierarchy of features detection and fusion. The first layer of the hierarchy extract image features. The next layer fuses image features to detect vehicle features such as headlights or windshields. A last layer fuses the vehicle features to detect a vehicle with more confidence. This approach is thus road illumination agnostic and allows vehicles to be detected day and night. The vehicle features are tracked over frames. We use a constant acceleration tracking model augmented with traffic-domain rules to handle the occlusions challenges.

Image processing views this problem at a much lower level as compared to machine learning and linear algebraic analysis which focus on the overall statistics of object classes given sufficient data. A good algorithm uses both these approaches to its advantage. It is important to define and choose the features of an image suitably, so that the classification algorithm can perform at its best in distinguishing object classes. In this paper we investigate the performance of different types of texture-based features when used with a support vector machine. Their performance was evaluated on standardized image datasets and compared. The objective of this study was to come up with a suitable algorithm to distinguish bicycles from pedestrians in locations such as bicycle paths and trails in order to estimate their traffic. The models developed during this study were applied in practice to traffic videos and the results are summarized here. For better application in practice other cues derived from motion were utilized to improve the performance of the classification and hence the accuracy of the counts.

We examine the use of boosting, a machine learning technique in travel time prediction, and combine boosting and neural network models to increase prediction accuracy. In addition, Quality of Service (QoS) factors such as bandwidth play an important role in travel time prediction, so we also explore the relationship between the accuracy of travel time prediction and the frequency of traffic data collection with the long term goal of minimizing bandwidth consumption. Finding a lower bound on the data collection frequency is also an important preliminary step for the boosting-based approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted three sets of experiments that show the boosting neural network approach outperforms other predictors.

The agent has a set of resources to generate its action policy: road and vehicle features and a knowledge base containing conduct rules. The perception of the agent is ensured by a set of sensors, which provide the agent with data such as speed, position and conditions of the brakes. The main agent behaviour is to carry out action plans involving: increase, maintain or reduce speed. The main effort of this research was the induction of conduct rules from data of previous trips. These rules form a classifier used for the selection of actions forming the conduction plan. Results observed with the experiments have showed that the proposed classifier increases the efficiency throughout the conduction of vehicles.

A well planned data classification system makes essential data easy to find. An object is classified into one of the categories called classes according to the features that well separated the classes. Actually, classification maps an object to its classification label. Many researches used different learning algorithms to classify data; neural networks, decision trees, etc. In this paper, a new classification approach based on cooperative game is proposed. Cooperative game is a branch of game theory consists of a set of players and a characteristic function which specifies the value created by different subsets of the players in the game. In order to find classes in classification process, objects can be imagine as the players in a game and according to the values which obtained by these players, classes will be separated. This approach can be used to classify a population according to their contributions. In the other words, it applies equally to different types of data. Through out this paper, a special case in medical diagnosis was studied. 304 samples taken from human leukemia tissue consists of 17 attributes which determine different CD markers related to leukemia were analyzed.

We will show how a physics-based methodology can be adapted to provide relative illumination information on real images. More specifically, we use the inverse-intensity chromaticity representation and show how the analysis of the histograms of illumination-chromaticity candidates provides information about the type of illumination(s) present in a scene. Experiments indicate that the estimate is quite robust towards noise, and that simple measurements on the histogram peak can be used to counter-check the reliability of the estimate.

These rules are defined as associations between different object likelihood maps and are learned from given examples. The contextual rules can be used to prime regions where a target object category occurs in an image given areas of other object categories. The principal idea is to locate several basic object categories in an image and then use this information to infer object likelihood maps for other object categories. The proposed framework itself is general and not limited to specific object categories. For demonstrating our approach, we use likely occurrences of pedestrians and windows in urban scenes, extracted by a technique employing visual context, and use them to prime for shop logos.

To be effective, an active learning system must be fast and efficient using as few (relevance) feedback iterations as possible. Scalability is the major problem for such an on-line learning method, since the complexity of such methods on a database of size n is in the best case O(n * log(n)). In this article we propose a strategy to overcome this limitation. Our technique exploits ultra fast retrieval methods like Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), recently applied for unsupervised image retrieval. Combined with active selection, our method is able to achieve very fast active learning task in very large database. Experiments on VOC2006 database are reported, results are obtained four times faster while preserving the accuracy.

Due to the wide availability of JPEG images, a JPEG 2-D array formed from the magnitudes of quantized block DCT coefficients is deemed a feasible input; however, a difference JPEG 2-D array tells a better story about image statistics with less influence from image content. Characterized by transition probability matrix (TPM), Markov process, widely used in digital image processing, is applied to model the difference JPEG 2-D arrays along horizontal and vertical directions. We resort to a thresholding technique to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors formed from TPM. YCbCr color system is selected because of its demonstrated better performance in computer graphics classification than RGB color system. Furthermore, only Y and Cb components are utilized for feature generation because of the high correlation found in the features derived from Cb and Cr components. Finally, boosting feature selection technique is used to greatly reduce the dimensionality of features without sacrificing the machine learning based classification performance.

Recent work on this topic [1] has presented some promising initial results. Our reexamination of some of these recently successful experiments shows that variations in image clarity in the experimental datasets were correlated with authenticity, and may have acted as a confounding factor, artificially improving the results. To determine the extent of this factor's influence on previous results, we provide a new "ground truth" data set in which originals and copies are known and image acquisition conditions are uniform. Multiple previously-successful methods are found ineffective on this new confounding-factor-free dataset, but we demonstrate that supervised machine learning on features derived from Hidden-Markov-Tree-modeling of the paintings' wavelet coefficients has the potential to distinguish copies from originals in the new dataset.

A reduced two-field feature extraction scheme for integral image calculation is proposed. Based on this scheme, the required memory for storing integral images is reduced from 400Kbits to 2.016Kbits for a 160x120 gray scale image. The range of the feature size and location is also reduced so the learning time of the classifier decreases around 10%. In addition, input data are mapped into parallel memories to enhance processing speed in classifier evaluations. This boosted cascade face detection hardware consumes only 0.992 mm(2) under the UMC 90 nm technology and runs at 100 MHz. The experimental results show this face detector can achieve 91% face detection rate for processing 160x120 gray scale images at the speed of 190 fps.

Its detection helps the localization of other anatomical parts and also the detection of possible vascular disorders. State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are reported to have good performance in this field. However, with the spatial resolution of the fundus images growing, it is necessary to decrease the number of training pixels to save computations. In this paper, we investigate several subsampling strategies with the motivation to find the best segmentation results with involving fewer pixels into the analyses. Besides checking the computational advantages, we demonstrate how the segmentation accuracy drops with the level of subsampling.

CONTEXT RANKING MACHINE AND ITS APPLICATION TO RIGID LOCALIZATION OF DEFORMABLE OBJECTS	2009 16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-6			English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	NOV 07-10, 2009	Cairo, EGYPT	IEEE		Image segmentation; Object detection; Biomedical image processing		In this paper, we exploit the context information embodied in an image to develop a machine learning method called context ranking machine (CRM). Specifically, we leverage two kinds of context information: identity context and metric context. The identity context of an image patch refers to its origin (e.g., from which image it is cropped), and the metric context refers to its distance to the exact surrounding box of the target object inside the image. We use these context information in two ways. First, for object localization, instead of learning classifiers to separate the whole negative pool from all positives, we separate each positive from its own negatives sharing the same identity context. Second, we rank image patches according to their resemblance to the ground truth by establishing a connection between appearance based features and metric properties of the image. The CRM learns an image-based ranking algorithm via boosting and achieves an improved localization accuracy. We performed tests on echocardiogram images to localize heart chambers, and face images for eye band localization.

The techniques developed in the field allow many real-life applications with great societal value. For instance, urban monitoring, fire detection or flood prediction can have a great impact on economical and environmental issues. To attain such objectives, the remote sensing community has turned into a multidisciplinary field of science that embraces physics, signal theory, computer science, electronics, and communications. From a machine learning and signal/image processing point of view, all the applications are tackled under specific formalisms, such as classification and clustering, regression and function approximation, image coding, restoration and enhancement, source unmixing, data fusion or feature selection and extraction. This paper serves as a survey of methods and applications, and reviews the last methodological advances in remote sensing image processing.

Taking advantage on the general concept of binary filters and machine learning theory, this proposed approach, is based on the concept of a new filter structured, called support vector machine filter (SVMF) and statistical data analysis. This proposed filter approach, is used as an impulsive noise image denoising. The results obtained for the application at hand show that the proposed filter outperforms a new algorithm for elimination of impulsive noise recently reported and Center Weighted Median in the image denoising task. The proposed filter can be successfully applied for the processing of images corrupted with impulsive noise while maintaining the visual quality and a low reconstruction error.

The difficulty with the conventional unsupervised segmentation lies in finding appropriate features that discriminate a meaningful region from the others. In this paper, the appropriate features are automatically learnt by machine learning with boosting scheme. At the initial step, the image is split into many small regions (blocks at first) and strong classifiers for every region, which discriminate the region from the others, are found by AdaBoosting. Each strong classifier so obtained is the weighted sum of several popular weak classifiers (features), which best describes the coherence of the region and thus well discriminates the region from the others. The output of this classifier is used in designing the energy function for the labeling, in the form of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Minimization of the energy function produces the labeling result which reflects the property learnt by the classifier. For the labeling result, the machine learning is again performed and the process iterates until some conditions are met. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive result compared to the conventional feature based methods.

The proposed approach focuses on social aspects of gaming and the use of humans in a widely distributed fashion through a process of human-based computation. It aims at motivating people towards image tagging while entertaining themselves.

It is the most successful realization of statistical learning theory. To testify the validity of SVM, this study chose the data set of hyperspectral images sensed by AVIRIS, with the band selected by Bhattacharya distance. And it added different scales of texture information as the origin information of image for classification. The main difficulty of texture recognition was the lack of effective tools to characterize different scales of textures. To improve the problem, the wavelet co-occurrence parameters, mean, homogeneity, and standard deviation of different level discrete wavelet transform images were used as texture features. In this paper, the texture features combined with PCA band of image were adopted as the characteristic vector of training samples for SVM, and Decision Tree classification. Finally, traditional classification schemes of Maximum Likelihood were comparatively studied. The effectiveness of the classification including texture measures was also analyzed. The experimental results showed that SVM method gave the highest correct classification rate within all of these three methodologies while Maximum Likelihood gave the lowest rate. Adding texture feature information by the proposed approach to images improved classification accuracy for all of SVM, Decision Tree, and Maximum Likelihood classification.

The cause of this increase can be attributed to a variety of factors including global climatic change, an increase in global population, and a related increase in the use of lands more vulnerable to natural disaster events. Timely monitoring and warning of natural disaster events is critical to our ability to respond to and recover from these disasters. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is the next generation of environmental satellites to study the Earth and its climate. It will provide a significant increase in the ability to monitor and respond to disaster events by increasing temporal resolution and decreasing the timeline required for information to be accessible to ground stations. This paper will present an introduction to NPOESS and discuss its potential utility in natural disaster monitoring and response efforts in combination with state of the art data mining techniques. NPOESS is a constellation of low orbiting polar satellites capable of achieving near global coverage and is supplemented with a next generation METSAT capability. Its primary mission is the observation of Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere, including the troposphere, stratosphere and the near space boundary. This system, due to come online in approximately 2013, will replace the United States' current constellation of environmental and weather satellites. NPOESS will revolutionize the way remote sensing is used in natural hazard monitoring and response efforts. It will allow simultaneous or near-simultaneous collection of atmospheric phenomena by multiple sensors. This capability will increase our understanding of atmospheric phenomena by reducing time between collections of data from multiple sensors and by providing a common platform for data distribution and analysis. The new sensor types flown in NPOESS will also increase our collection capabilities. Increased data collection capability allows for advanced analysis of the atmosphere and will lead to better forecasting of natural hazard formation, development, and evolution. These increases in technical capability and bandwidth provide significantly more data for data mining algorithms. These algorithms have the ability to quickly interpret remotely sensed data and provide timely products to the natural disaster response community. While the NPOESS data provide a new testing ground for existing algorithms, it will also lead to the development of new algorithms driven by the need to efficiently exploit the volume of data produced by this system. The combination of new capabilities within NPOESS and the development of new advanced data mining applications will provide the disaster response community with the tools it needs to face the challenges of the new century.

Yet, the characteristic fluctuational throughput of source peers affect the QOS of such applications which might be reflected by a reduced download rate in file sharing or even worse - annoying freezes in a streaming service. A significant factor for the unstable supply of source peers is the behavior of other processes running on the source peer that consume bandwidth resources. In this paper we present Collabrium - a collaborative solution that employs a machine learning approach to actively predict load in the uplink of source peers and alert their clients to replace their source. Experiments on home machines demonstrated successful predictions of upcoming loads and Collabrium learned the behavior of popular heavy bandwidth consuming protocols such as eMule & BitTorrent correctly with no prior knowledge.

Corpus which is the plural form of 'corpora' is nothing but the collection of linguistic data. And here the proposed work is based on a corpus of reviews: more specifically product reviews. The reviews are in the html files which are easily available in popular review sites like Cnet.com. The revolution in information and technologies has given a new era in the development of language industries. The versatility in technological development, along with the translations available in different languages has lead to use of this corpus for specific machine learning mechanism as well as various automatic translation applications. But the prime objective of researchers as well as the naive users is to give a fast developing technique of machine learning systems that should be both exact and effective. Most of the time it becomes a veiy tedious job to create exact dataset for the work due to the crisis of accurate corpus regarding respective research work. And that is why; we have proposed an algorithm for creating a corpus for opinion mining research field.

On Prediction Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms for Characterizing Shared L2 Cache Behavior of Programs on Multicore Processors	2009 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS(CICSYN 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	JUL 23-25, 2009	Indore, INDIA	Asia Modelling & Simulation Soc, UK Simulation Soc, European Simulat Council, European Council Modelling & Simulat, Verkant Inst Technol & Management, Malwa Inst Technol & Management, Univ Technol, Norway Univ Sci & Technol, Nottingham Trent Univ				Information on a particular behavioral aspect of a program can be useful to know about the performance bottlenecks and can be utilized further to improve the performance of the system. It is observed that contention for shared L2 cache between programs running on a Multi-Core Processor (MCP) is one of the performance bottlenecks. The utilization of the L2 cache by a program, while sharing it with others on a MCP is a metric of interest to frame policies that reduce contention. In this work we investigate the ability of some of the machine learning algorithms to predict the solo run L2 cache stress of a running program on Intel quad-core Xeon X5482 processor. Data collected from hardware performance counters of Intel quad-core Xeon X5482 processor were utilized to derive the attributes to train the machine learning algorithms. We observed that the best performing machine learning algorithm in this context is Model tree (M5'), followed by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The coprocessor functional units, consisting of parallel 2D convolution primitives and programmable units performing sub-sampling and non-linear functions specific to CNNs, implement a "meta-operator" to which a CNN may be compiled to. The coprocessor is serviced by distributed off-chip memory banks with large data bandwidth. As a key feature, we use low precision data and further increase the effective memory bandwidth by packing multiple words in every memory operation, and leverage the algorithm's simple data access patterns to use off-chip memory as a scratchpad for intermediate data, critical for CNNs. A CNN is mapped to the coprocessor hardware primitives with instructions to transfer data between the memory and coprocessor. We have implemented a prototype of the CNN coprocessor on an off-the-shelf PCl FPGA card with a single Xilinx Virtex5 LX330T FPGA and 4 DDR2 memory banks totaling 1GB. The coprocessor prototype can process at the rate of 3.4 billion multiply accumulates per second (GMACs) for CNN forward propagation, a speed that is 31x faster than a software implementation on a 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron processor. For a complete face recognition application with the CNN on the coprocessor and the rest of the image processing tasks on the host, the prototype is 6-10x faster, depending on the host-coprocessor bandwidth.

There is a significant amount of genes that do not influence the final classification. One of the reasons to eliminate such genes is the increasing computational complexity of supervised machine learning methods, especially in modern microarray experiments with hundreds of samples. This empirical study aims to measure differences in classification performance when different numbers of gene expression measurements are removed in a preprocessing phase. Simple unsupervised gene selection based on variance level of genes across all samples was used to remove genes with extremely low level of variance. This study shows the importance of combining unsupervised and supervised feature selection techniques along with classification algorithm. It was shown that gene expression values removed using simple unsupervised gene selection method are not of significant importance to the final results of supervised gene selection followed by classification.

Automated Image-Based Phenotypic Screening for High-Throughput Drug Discovery	2009 22ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS	IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	AUG 03-04, 2009	Albuquerque, NM	IEEE			MEAN-SHIFT; TRACKING	At the state-of-the-art in drug discovery, one of the key challenges is to develop high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques that can measure changes as a continuum of complex phenotypes induced in a target pathogen. Such measurements are crucial in developing therapeutics against diseases like schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis, which impact millions worldwide. These diseases are caused by parasites that can manifest a variety of phenotypes at any given point in time in response to drugs. Consequently, a single end-point measurement of 'live or death' (e.g., ED(50) value) commonly used for lead identification is over-simplistic. In our method to address this problem, the parasites are tracked during the entire course of (video) recorded observations and changes in their appearance-based and behavioral characteristics quantified using geometric, texture-based, color-based, and motion-based descriptors. Subsequently, within the on-line setting, machine learning techniques are used classify the exhibited phenotypes into well defined categories. Important advancements introduced as a consequence of the proposed approach include: (1) ability to assess the interactions between putative drugs and parasites in terms of multiple appearance and behavior-based phenotypes, (2) automatic classification and quantification of pathogen phenotypes. Experimental data from lead identification studies against the disease Schistosomiasis validate the proposed methodology.

There is a growing need for understanding the risk of these complications, which has led to the development of simple statistical models. In this work, we have developed a predictive model based on Support Vector Machines on a real world live dataset consisting of clinical variables of patients being treated at a cardiac care facility to predict the risk of complications at 12 months following a DES procedure. A significant challenge in this work, common to most clinical machine learning datasets, was imbalanced data, and our results showed the effectiveness of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address this issue.

These are among some of the most challenging and important tasks in the area and solutions to them are eagerly sought after. Genetic Programming (GP) is a powerful and flexible machine learning technique that has been successfully applied to many binary classification tasks. However, the traditional form of GP performs poorly on multiclass classification problems. Linear GP (LGP) is an alternative form of GP where programs are represented as sequences of instructions like Java and C++. This paper discusses results which demonstrate the superiority of LGP as a technique for multiclass classification. It also discusses a new extension to LGP which results in a further improvement in the performance on multiclass classification problems.

This paper proposes a novel automatic method to address the challenge of parameter tuning for level set methods. It analyses the energy impact on the objects of interest during construction of the final contours, using a supervised machine learning approach. The method allows level set methods to automatically choose optimal values of the model parameters and extract objects at different granularities based on the training data. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the method for accurate parameter tuning.

Feature selection (FS) is an avenue to dimensionality reduction. Evolutionary search techniques have been very promising in finding solutions in the exponentially growing search space of FS problems. This paper proposes a genetic programming (GP) approach to FS where the building blocks are subsets of features and set operators. We use bit-mask representation for subsets and a set of set operators as primitive functions. The GP search, then combines these subsets and set operations to find an optimal subset of features. The task we study is a highly imbalanced face detection problem. A modified version of the Naive Bayes classification model is used as the fitness function. Our results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in dimensionality and processing time. Using the GP-selected features, the performance of certain classifiers can also be improved.

In order to extract sentences which form a summary with an extensive coverage of main content of the text and less redundancy, we use the features such as term frequency, key phrase, centrality, title similarity and position of the sentence in the original text. Sentence rank is computed using a score function that uses its feature values and the weights of the features. The best feature weights are learned using machine learning techniques with the help of human constructed summaries. Performance evaluation is conducted by comparing summarization outputs with manual summaries generated by 25 independent human evaluators. This paper presents one of the first Turkish summarization systems, and its results are promising.

Collective classification algorithms, like ICA (Iterative Classification Algorithm), determine labels for the unlabeled nodes based on the contents and/or labels of the neighboring nodes. Feature selection algorithms have been shown to improve classification accuracy for traditional machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we use a recent and successful feature selection algorithm, mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, Ding and Peng, 2003), on content features. On two scientific paper citation data sets, Cora and Citeseer, when only content information is used, we ahow that the selected features may result in almost as good performance as all the features. When feature selection is performed both on content and link information, even better classification accuracies are obtained. Feature selection considerably reduces the training time for both content only and ICA algorithms.

Two necessary components of fault prediction models, software metrics and fault data, are collected from the software projects developed with object-oriented programming paradigm. We proposed an outlier detection algorithm based on these kinds of metrics thresholds. We used Random Forests machine learning classifier on two software measurement datasets collected from jEdit open-source text editor project and experiments revealed that our outlier detection approach improves the performance of fault predictors based on Random Forests classifier.

Spatio-temporal data sets contain data objects that move in space over time. Traditional data clustering algorithms work well on static data sets that contain well separated clusters. Traditional techniques breakdown when they are applied to spatio-temporal data sets. They are not capable of tracking clusters when the moving objects intersect the space occupied by objects from another cluster. This work aims to improve the accuracy of traditional data clustering algorithms on spatio-temporal data sets. Many clustering algorithms create clusters based on the distance between the objects. We extend this distance measure to be a function of the position history of the objects. We show through a series of experiments that the use of the history based distance measures greatly improves the accuracy of existing data clustering algorithms on spatio-temporal data sets. In random data sets we achieve up to a 90% improvement in cluster accuracy. To evaluate the clustering algorithms we created 100 spatio-temporal data sets. We also defined a set of metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms on the spatio-temporal data sets.

CLIQUE: Role-Free Clustering with Q-Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks	2009 29TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	JUN 22-26, 2009	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE				Clustering and aggregation inherently increase wireless sensor network (WSN) lifetime by collecting information within a cluster at a cluster head, reducing the amount of data through computation, then forwarding it. Traditional approaches, however, both spend extensive communication energy to identify the cluster heads and are inflexible to network dynamics such as those arising from sink mobility, node failure, or dwindling battery reserves. This paper presents CLIQUE, an approach for data clustering that saves cluster head selection energy by using machine learning to enable nodes to independently decide whether or not to act as a cluster head on a per-packet basis. We refer to this lack of actual cluster head assignment as being role-free, and demonstrate through simulations that, when combined with learning dynamic network properties such as battery reserves, up to 25% less energy is consumed in comparison to a traditional, random cluster head selection approach.

We propose Iustitia, a tool for identifying flow nature on the fly. The key observation behind Iustitia is that text flows have the lowest entropy and encrypted flows have the highest entropy, while the entropy of binary flows stands in between. The basic idea of Iustitia is to classify flows using machine learning techniques where a feature is the entropy of every certain number of consecutive bytes. The key features of Iustitia are high speed (10% of average packet inter-arrival time) and high accuracy (86%).

RST is adopted in the first phase with the aim to eliminate the insignificant features and prepared the reduce features to the next phase. In the second phase, the reduced features are optimized using the new evolutionary computation method, DPSO. The optimum features from this two methods were mined using Support Vector Machine Classifier with the optimum RBF's kernel parameters. These methods have greatly reduced the features and achieved higher classification accuracy across the selected datasets compared to full features and RST alone. The results also demonstrate that the integration of RST and DPSO is capable of searching the optimal features for protein classification and applicable to different classification problem.

For visual patterns, extracting robust and discriminative features from image is the most difficult yet the most critical step. Several typical and advanced approaches of feature extraction from image are explored, some of which are analyzed in depth. Various techniques of feature extraction from image are organized in four categories: human expert knowledge based methods, image local structure based approaches, image global structure based techniques and machine learning based statistical approaches.

TOA on RVM has O(M-3) time and O(M-2) space complexity, where M is the training set size. It is thus computationally infeasible on very large data sets. We propose CBA. it decomposed large datasets to subdata blocks by sampled homogeneously and getted solution by chain iteration taking TOA as basis algorithm,. Regression experiments with synthetical large sbenchmark data set demonstrates CBA yielded state-of-the-art performance: its time complexity is linear in M and space complexity is independent of M,keeping high accuracy and sparsity at the same time. Document shows that CBA is also much better than TFA on time complexity and sparsity.

In the study, support vector machine(SVM) classifiers combined with the form of binary tree are applied to construct diagnostic model of power transformer,and the diagnostic system structure of power transformer is presented on the basis of the model. SVM is a novel machine learning method based on SLT. It is powerful for the practical problem with small sampling, nonlinear and high dimension, which is very suitable for online fault diagnosis of transformer. The test results show that SVM has higher diagnostic accuracy than BP,IEC three ratios in fault diagnosis of power transformer.

Incorporating 3D information is useful in such applications. The optical profilometries and interforometric techniques provide 3D information in an implicit form. Typically phase unwrapping process, which is often hindered by the presence of noises, spots of low intensity modulation, and instability of the solutions, is applied to retrieve the proper depth information. In certain applications such as pattern recognition problems, the goal is to classify the 3D objects in the image, rather than to simply display or reconstruct them. In this paper we present a technique for constructing kernels on the measured data directly without explicit phase unwrapping. Such a kernel will naturally incorporate the 3D depth information and can be used to improve the systems involving 3D object analysis and classification. It avoids possible phase unwrapping errors introduced during object reconstruction.

An ontology-based portal for credit risk analysis	2009 2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 5			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology	AUG 08-11, 2009	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		machine learning; ontologies; credit rating	NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELS	Credit risk analysis is an important topic in the financial risk management. Due to recent financial crises, credit risk analysis has been the major focus of financial and banking industry. An accurate estimation of credit risk could be transformed into a more efficient use of economic capital. Existing models for estimating credit risk are not semantics-based. The objective of this work was to design an intelligent web portal to serve as service provider for credit risk analysis. The portal has been conceived to help users (e.g. credit managers working in banks) to detect bad payers. For this purpose, the knowledge of the financial domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. The reasoning engine of the proposed system executes logic rules related with well-established financial variables. These rules characterize that a payer tends to become a bad one or not.			sotos@math.upatras.gr; dkanellop@teipat.gr; vaskar@teipat.gr; tampakas@teipat.gr	kotsiantis, sotiris/C-5640-2009	kotsiantis, sotiris/0000-0002-2247-3082			ALONSO JL, 2003, 2 INT SEM WEB C ISWC; CARAGEA D, 2004, 3 INT C ONT DAT APPL; CASTELLS P, 2004, 1 EUR SEM WEB S ESWS; Chen MC, 2003, EXPERT SYST APPL, V24, P433, DOI 10.1016/S0957-4174(02)00191-4; COATES AB, 2001, XML C EXP 2001 ORL F; Eschenbach C, 1995, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V43, P723, DOI 10.1006/ijhc.1995.1071; Fisher RA, 1936, ANN EUGENIC, V7, P179; Geerts G.

However, occasionally such simple structure does not extend across an entire database and might be confined more locally within subsets of the data. Nonparametric regression normally involves local averaging. In this study, local averaging estimator is coupled with a machine learning technique Rotation Forest. In more detail, we propose a technique of local rotation forest of decision stumps.

It has been proven that Kalman filter gives a good estimation when tested on various tracking systems. However, unsatisfying tracking results may be produced due to different real-time conditions. These conditions include: inter-object occulusion and separation which are observed when objects are being tracked in real-time. Thus, it is challenging to handle for the classical Kalman filter. In this paper, we proposed an idea of intelligent feature-guided tracking using Kalman filtering. A new method is developed named Correlation-Weighted Histogram Intersection (CWHI), in which correlation weights are applied to Histogram Intersection (HI) method. We focus on multi-object tracking in traffic sequences and our aim is to achieve efficient tracking of multiple moving objects under the confusing situations. The proposed algorithm achieves robust tracking with 97.3% accuracy and 0.07% covariance error in different real-time scenarios.

One important property of such systems is agent autonomy. An aspect of agent autonomy, enactive knowledge, is investigated here through a Bayesian extension called TAN that supports learning through interactions with the environment. Finally, various scenarios are simulated for an appropriate modelling environment with suggestions for future work.			adelinat@sunway.edu.my					ARNBORG S, 1987, SIAM J ALGEBRA DISCR, V8, P277, DOI 10.1137/0608024; BOLEY H, 2007, IN IEEE INT C DIG EC, P398; CHICKERING DM, 1996, LEARNING DATA ARTIFI, V5; COOPER GF, 1990, ARTIF INTELL, V42, P393, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(90)90060-D; Duda R.

With the growing availability of online resources on web and popularity of fast and rich resources of opinion sharing such as online review sites and personal blogs, Opinion Mining has become an interesting area of research. World Wide Web is a fastest medium for opinion collection from users. Human perception and user opinion has greater potential for knowledge discovery and decision support. In this paper we have presented a survey which covers techniques and methods that promise to enable us to get opinion oriented information from text. This research effort deals with techniques and challenges related to sentiment analysis and Opinion Mining. We have followed systematic literature review process to conduct this survey. Our focus was mainly on machine learning techniques on the basis of their usage and importance for opinion mining. We have tried to identify most commonly used classification techniques for opinionated documents to assist future research in this area.

However, it is still unclear which features are most relevant to the quality of tandem mass spectra. In this paper, a sparse logistical regression method is proposed for selecting the most relevant features from those features found in the literature. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two datasets. The results show the sparse logistical regression model can effectively select a small number of highly relevant features for tandem mass spectrum quality assessment.

Accurately identifying the motifs is thus an important problem in bioinformatics. However, exhaustively enumerating all possible locations for a motif in a set of sequences is computationally intractable. Many heuristic or approximation algorithms and machine learning based approaches have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we develop a novel approach that can efficiently explore all possible locations of TFBS motifs in a set of sequences with high accuracy. Our approach constructs an ensemble of k Hidden Markov Models (HMM) through local alignments of two sequences in the set and then progressively aligns each HMM in the ensemble to other sequences in the set and update the parameters of the k HMMs. Our experimental results showed that our approach could achieve higher accuracy with satisfying efficiency than previous state-of-art approaches.

Machine learning techniques have been employed to predict protein-protein interactions. One of such approaches is Naive Bayes approach which assumes conditional independence between features. And such problems as suffering from the missing value problems or being prohibitively time-consuming prevent them from being applied to predict PPI as readily as NB. In this work, we frame predicting PPI as a communication problem, and we train a classifier based on channel model (CBCM) to discriminate between pairs of proteins that are co-complexed and pairs that are not. We theoretically demonstrate that NB can be unified into CBCM in certain condition and also experimentally validate that CBCM is an effective approach for predicting co-complexed protein pairs from integrating diverse biological data. Our study suggests that PPI prediction problem can be effectively solved from the point view of communication problem.

In this paper, a K-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (HKNN) classifiers with symmetrical encoding scheme is proposed to predict protein-protein interactions. Moreover, a new sample encoding scheme, named symmetrical encoding scheme (SYES), for protein pair is developed by which a single protein-protein pair is mapped to two symmetrical points in the sample space. To evaluate the prediction performance of this encoding scheme, the ten-fold cross validation has been employed on two real data sets. The results indicate that this encoding scheme outperforms the sum encoding scheme to some extent, and the method proposed is comparable to other methods.

With the number of protein sequences entering into data banks rapidly increasing, we are confronted with a challenge: how to develop an automated method to identify the quaternary attribute for a new polypeptide chain (i.e., whether it is formed just as a monomer, or as a dimer, trimer or any other oligomer). This is important, because the functions of proteins are closely related to their quaternary attribute. In this report, using machine learning approach, the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) and Covariant-Discriminant Algorithm (CDA), we developed a prediction system for protein quaternary structural type in which we incorporated functional domain composition (FunD) and pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAA). To compare, we adopted a benchmark dataset, which had been studied time after time. The overall accuracy achieved by this system is more than 89% in the Jack-knife test. Such a technique should improve the success rate of structural biology projects.

The exponential rise in sequences of new enzymes has necessitated developing methods that accurately predict their function. To address this problem, approaches that cluster enzymes based on their sequence and structural similarity have been applied, but are known to fail for dissimilar proteins that perform the same function. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to accurately predict the main function class of enzymes based on a unique set of 73 sequence-derived features. Our features can be extracted using freely available online tools. We used different multi-class classifiers to categorize enzyme protein sequences into one of the NC-IUBMB defined six main function classes. Amongst the classifiers, Random Forest reported the best results with an overall accuracy of 88% and precision and recall in the range of 84% to 93% and 82% to 93% respectively. Our results compare favorably with existing methods, and in some cases report better performance. Random Forest has been proven to be a very efficient data mining algorithm. This paper is first in exploring their application to enzyme function prediction. The datasets can be accessed online at the location: http://cholera.ece.northwestern.edu/EnzyPredict.

The abnormalities of producing thyroid hormones are divided into two categories. Hypothyroidism which is related to production of insufficient thyroid hormone and hyperthyroidism related to production of excessive thyroid hormone. Separating these two diseases is very important for thyroid diagnosis. Therefore Support Vector Machines and Probabilistic Neural Network are proposed to classification. These methods rely mostly on powerful classification algorithms to deal with redundant and irrelevant features. In this paper feature selection is argued as an important problem via diagnosis and demonstrate that GAs provide a simple, general and powerful framework for selecting good subsets of features leading to improved diagnosis rates. Thyroid disease datasets are taken from UCI machine learning dataset.

Three kinds of models are designed using the multiple regression statistical (MRS) method, the back propagation artifical neural nerivork (BP ANN) and the support vector machine (SVM). The model validation shows that the machine learning models, BP ANN model and SVM model, work better than the linear MRS model, and the SVM presents the best performance in terms of root mean square error. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the concentration of chlorophyll-a is very sensitive to the changes of water temperature, water depth, and total nitrogen, but does not show significant changes to phosphorous variables such as total phosphorus and orthophosphate. It implies that algae blooms are more likely decided by physical parameters and accumulated at shallow areas by wind.

Speech feature extraction constitutes the front end module of any speech decoder: it plays an essential role and has a strong impact on the recognition performance. The research community is aggressively searching for more powerful solutions which combine the existing feature extraction methods for a better and more reliable information capture from the analog speech signal. In this research work, we propose new approaches to combining phoneme recognizers' output in order to provide better recognition performance and improved robustness with respect to noise and channel distortions. Machine learning tools such as the Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines have been used in the combination of hypotheses. Experiments under different SNR levels have proven that our proposed approach outperforms the two most common feature extraction techniques, namely Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Perceptual Linear Prediction(PLP) with Cepstral Mean Subtraction (CMS) and RASTA respectively, for channel normalization.

In machine learning, this is frequently achieved using, as a penalty term, the L(p) norm of the model parameters, with p <= 1 for efficient dilution. Here we propose a statistical-mechanics analysis of the problem in the setting of perceptron memorization and generalization. Using a replica approach, we are able to evaluate the relative performance of naive dilution (obtained by learning without dilution, following by applying a threshold to the model parameters), L(1) dilution (which is frequently used in convex optimization) and L(0) dilution (which is optimal but computationally hard to implement). Whereas both L(p) diluted approaches clearly outperform the naive approach, we find a small region where L(0) works almost perfectly and strongly outperforms the simpler to implement L(1) dilution. In the second part we propose an efficient message-passing strategy in the simpler case of discrete classification vectors, where the norm L(0) norm coincides with the L(1). Some examples are discussed.

However, creating a tractable mathematical mapping model from environmental variables to transmitter parameters that allows the latter to be optimized in any sense, presents serious challenginges due to the large number of variables involved, as well as the complexity required in any model with the ability to accurately capture and explain all factors that affect performance. Machine learning algorithms, which make no mathematical assumptions and use only past observations to model the input-output relationship, have recently been explored for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM systems. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning algorithm based on multi-class support vector machines (SVMs). Our algorithm has considerably smaller operational overhead (including storage requirements) and better performance for link adaptation. With IEEE 802.11n simulations we show that our new algorithm outperforms existing machine-learning based algorithms. Moreover, we show that our algorithm is (asymptotically) consistent, in the sense that as the number of training data used increases, our algorithm obtains the performance-optimal classifier.

The distributed nature of the framework allows each cell to autonomously decide (by means of machine learning procedures) the best frequencies to use in order to maximize spectral efficiency, preserve quality-of-service, and generate spectrum gaps, so that secondary cognitive radio networks can improve overall spectrum usage. The proposed distributed framework has been validated over a downlink multicell OFDMA radio access network, showing comparable performance results with respect to its centralized counterpart and superior performance with respect to fixed frequency planning schemes.

DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) MODEL FOR REAL- TIME APPLICATIONS USING DSP PROCESSORS	2009 4TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	APR 29-MAY 02, 2009	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE, EMBS		Brain- Computer Interface; DSP Processor; Neural Networks; Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)		Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that provide translation of the electrical activity of the brain into commands which can control devices in real-time. It is known that most BCI based application involves non-invasive EEG signals in combination with machine learning algorithms for control of devices. Although there has been some real- time implementation of BCI including cursor movements controlled by a person's thoughts, they have not been done as a portable device, but rather as a laboratory experiment controlled using multi- core processors and computers. This paper focuses on real- time implementation of BCI for motor imagery tasks using a floating point DSP processor (TMS320C6713DSK). The proposed work involves FIR based preprocessing Filter to remove extraneous noise including Electrooculogram (EOG) and Electromyographic (EMG) signals followed by feature extraction using time-frequency domain features. The implications of this kind of a development in Brain- Computer Interface would be tremendous since the whole system can be made into a portable device or a System on a Chip (SoC).

Instead of taking the physical properties of the signal propagation int o account directly, an method based on a machine learning framework is presented. This method employs a multivariable Gauss distribution model and consists of an offline training phase and a real time locating phase. In the offline phase the received signal strength of many training locations are recorded and the parameters of the Gauss distribution are calculated, and in the real time phase a user location is determined by matching the received signal strength patterns against the training patterns. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has lower locating errors and is feasible to locate user in a WLAN.

It focuses on three specific contributions: (i) It continuously updates the normal profile by keeping the dynamic window size. (ii) The dynamic window adjustment through a concept drift learning algorithm which helps to keep relevant patterns and get rid of the outdated patterns. (iii) The dynamical normal profiling approach makes it a possible way for real-time anomaly detection.

In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithms(HGA) was proposed to solve the problem. The proposed HGA incorporates simulated annealing into a basic genetic algorithm that enables the algorithm to perform genetic search over the subspace of local optima.

One of the most important problems that must be addressed for implementing efficient SNNs is the information encoding. In this paper, an implementation of a high-performance hardware architecture for population information coding based on Gaussian Receptive Fields (GRFs) is proposed This architecture can be useful for data classifying and clustering applications, because this coding scheme has been used in the past, and an efficient mapping of this technique in hardware can improve the actual performance of these applications. The GRFs information coding can be efficiently implemented on FPGA technology, because it contains several operations that can be computed in parallel like the exponential function. The proposed hardware architecture was implemented, tested and validated with several random datasets. The proposed hardware core is the first step for implementing successfully classifiers like SpikeProp algorithm. Synthesis and timing results for the proposed hardware architecture are presented.

In this paper, we address the problem of TCP throughput prediction for opportunistic networks. Applications of opportunistic networking can benefit from such predictions by adapting to prevailing network conditions. Our approach is different from prior efforts to model wireless network throughput in that only the two communicating endpoints participate in the prediction, and no information about network topology or traffic loads generated by interfering sources is required. Our goal is to understand how accurate throughput predictions can be under the above assumptions. The physical environment considered in our study includes varying degrees of interference, indoor and outdoor networks, and nodes that are stationary or moving at walking or driving speeds. We use throughput predictors based on time series analysis and machine learning techniques, as they are well-suited to predicting phenomena with unknown variables. The prediction accuracy that our methods yield is cause for cautious optimism. We find that 80% to 100% of predictions are within a factor of two of actual throughput. This bound on accuracy means that predictions are useful for certain applications, because this bound (a) can be achieved by measurements lasting for as little as 0.3 seconds, and (b) holds even when nodes are driving at speeds of 15-25 mph.

And then, these files will be monitored to find which processes will access them by capturing and analyzing the IRPs (I/O Request Packets). The processes of Trojans will be distinguished from regular ones by evaluating their API-calls with several machine-learning models, rather than traditional signature-based mechanism. Testing results show that this prototype could detect and defend the unknown Trojans quickly and accurately.

The "ELM 7 point checklist" defines a set of seven features, based on colour and texture parameters, which describe the malignancy of a lesion. It has been revealed as faster and with the same accuracy than the traditional ABCD criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma. A preliminary approach to the automated diagnosis of melanocytic skin lesions, based on ELM 7 point checklist is proposed. In particular, the image processing algorithms and classification techniques involved in the automatic detection of the occurrence of two criteria (Blue-whitish Veil and Regression structures) are introduced and the experimental results are reported.

In this paper, an evolutionary multi-objective selection method of RBF Networks structure is discussed. The candidates of RBF Network structure are encoded into the particles in PSO. Then, they evolve toward Pareto-optimal front defined by several objective functions concerning with model accuracy and model complexity. This study suggests an approach of RBF Network training through simultaneous optimization of architectures and weights with PSO-based multi-objective algorithm. Our goal is to determine whether Multi-objective PSO can train RBF Networks, and the performance is validated on accuracy and complexity. The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The results show that our proposed method provides an effective means for training RBF Networks that is competitive with other evolutionary computational-based methods.

The proposed method includes an ensemble feature selecting classifier and a data mining classifier. The former consists of four classifiers using different sets of features and each of them employs a machine learning algorithm named fuzzy belief k-NN classification algorithm. The latter applies data mining technique to automatically extract computer users' normal behavior from training network traffic data. The outputs of ensemble feature selecting classifier and data mining classifier are then fused together to get the final decision. The experimental results indicate that hybrid approach effectively generates a more accurate intrusion detection model on detecting both normal usages and malicious activities.

Artificial Metaplasticity is a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training algorithm that gives more relevance to less frequent training patterns and subtracts relevance to the frequent ones during training phase, achieving a much more efficient training, while at least maintaining the MLP performance. In this paper, we test Metaplasticity MLP (MMLP) algorithm on an image standard data set: the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD). WBCD is a well-used database in Machine Learning, ANN and Signal Processing. Experimental results show that MMLPs reach better accuracy than any other recent results.

However, people are sometimes unable to access an appropriate application due to the complexity and depth of the menu structure. This paper focuses on a feasibility study of operation prediction using observable attributes to realize self-optimization functionality in the mobile phones that can automatically and adaptively change their user interface (UI) according to user characteristics and circumstances. Machine learning (ML) is a promising technology for enhancing UI. However, few studies have been conducted for the operation prediction using the ML framework. We analyzed the real usage data collected by practical mobile phones and found that ML-based prediction methods were feasible to estimate future operations, and to provide context-aware UI.

The central challenge in optimizing various measures of ranking loss is that the objectives tend to be non-convex and discontinuous. To make such functions amenable to gradient based optimization procedures one needs to design clever bounds. In recent years, boosting, neural networks, support vector machines, and many other techniques have been applied. However, there is little work on directly modeling a conditional probability Pr(y vertical bar x(q)) where y is a permutation of the documents to be ranked and xq represents their feature vectors with respect to a query q. A major reason is that the space of y is huge: n! if is documents must be ranked. We first propose an intuitive and appealing expected loss minimization objective, and give an efficient shortcut to evaluate it despite the huge space of ys. Unfortunately, the optimization is non-convex, so we propose a convex approximation. We give a new, efficient Monte Carlo sampling method to compute the objective and gradient of this approximation, which can then be used in a quasi-Newton optimizer like LBFGS. Extensive experiments with the widely-used LETOR dataset show large ranking accuracy improvements beyond recent and competitive algorithms.								BERGER, 1996, COMPUTATIONAL LINGUI, V22; Bishop C.

These methods specifically exploit the statistical dependencies among instances in order to improve classification accuracy. However there has been little focus on how these same dependencies affect our ability to draw accurate conclusions about the performance of the models. More specifically, the complex link structure and attribute dependencies in network data violate the assumptions of many conventional statistical tests and make it difficult to use these tests to assess the models in an unbiased manner In this work, we examine the task of within-network classification and the question of whether two algorithms will learn models which will result in significantly different levels of petformance. We show that the commonly-used form of evaluation (paired t-test on overlapping network samples) can result in an unacceptable level of Type I error Furthermore we show that Type I error increases as (I) the correlation among instances increases and (2) the size of the evaluation set increases (i.e., the proportion of labeled nodes in the network decreases). We propose a method for network cross-validation then combined with paired t-tests produces more acceptable levels of Type I error while still providing reasonable levels of statistical power (i.e., Type II error).

The former tries to reuse knowledge in labeled out-of-domain instances while the later attempts to exploit the usefulness of unlabeled in-domain instances. In this paper, we bridge the two branches by pointing out that many semi-supervised learning methods can be extended for inductive transfer learning, if the step of labeling an unlabeled instance is replaced by re-weighting a diff-distribution instance. Based on this recognition, we develop a new transfer learning method, namely COITL, by extending the co-training method in semi-supervised learning. Experimental results reveal that COITL can achieve significantly higher generalization and robustness, compared with two state-of-the-art methods in inductive transfer learning.

Unsupervised learning approaches can avoid these biases. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to learning for Relation Detection, based on the use of massive clustering ensembles.

However, this assumption may not hold in some situations because of data uncertainty arising from measurement errors, data staleness, and repeated measurements, etc. With uncertainty, the value of each data item is represented by a probability distribution function (pdf). In this paper, we propose a novel naive Bayes classification algorithm for uncertain data with a pdf. Our key solution is to extend the class conditional probability estimation in the Bayes model to handle pdf's. Extensive experiments on UCI datasets show that the accuracy of naive Bayes model can be improved by taking into account the uncertainty information.

We analyzed the data from an EEG experiment consisting of affective picture stimuli presentation, and tested automatic recognition of the individual emotional states from the EEG signal using Bayes classifier. The mean accuracy was about 75 percent, but we were not able to select universal features for classification of all subjects, because of inter-individual differences in the signal. We also identified correlation between the classification error and the extroversion-introversion personality trait measured by EPQ-R test.

One critical issue is the overall inability of most state-of-the-art classifiers to identify out-of-class samples, i.e., samples that do not belong to any of the available classes. This paper shows a possible explanation for this problem and suggests how, by analyzing the distribution of the class probability estimates generated by a classifier, it is possible to build decision rules able to significantly improve its performances.

These views may have sufficient or partial information about the target concept. In this paper, a method that we called parallel interacting multiview learning (NW) is proposed in which the views interact during the training process using the predictions of each other together with their original features. This way, the views are expected to strengthen the prediction accuracies of the other views feeding their predictions to the others even during the training process. This technique avoids the way of simply merging features of all views and reaches higher accuracy than its counterparts that do not interact during learning but only combine their predictions after the learning process. PIML is demonstrated on a real bioinformatics dataset for predicting protein sub-nuclear locations.	[Sakar, C.

The base of detection is to classify the motion flow vectors of object and scene at two video sequences from a mobile monocular CCD camera. For this purpose, we introduce a method to extract robust features from fuzzified edges at first frame. Then, correspondence features are approximated at second video frame by a multi resolution feature matching processing based on edge Gaussian pyramids. In next stage, the estimated motion flow vectors classify into two object and scene classes using a supervised machine learning method based on MLPs neural network. In final step, the flying vehicle localize by approximating the contour of object based on a convex hull algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has proper stability and reliability especially for the detection of aerial vehicle in applications with mobile camera.

Many approaches have been focused in the induction of ensemble to increase learning accuracy of individual classifiers. Recently, new approaches, different to those that look for accurate and diverse base classifiers, are emerging. In this paper we present a system made up of two layers: in the first layer, one ensemble classifier process every example and tries to classify them; in the second layer, one individual classifier is induced using the examples that are not unanimously classified by the ensemble. In addition, the examples that reach to the second layer incorporate new information added in the ensemble. Thus, we can achieve some improvement in the accuracy level, because the second layer can do more informed classifications. In the experimental section we present some results that suggest that our proposal can actually improve the accuracy of the system.

The methodology proposed is tested using six benchmark classification datasets from well-known machine learning problems.

This paper describes a content-based recommender system, called FIRSt, that integrates user generated content (UGC) with semantic analysis of content. The main contribution of FIRSt is an integrated strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques, both on official item descriptions provided by a publisher and on freely keywords which users adopt to annotate relevant items. Static content and dynamic content are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests, often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the domain of cultural heritage personalization.

HIROFILOS-II is a prototype hybrid intelligent system for diagnosis and treatment of all prostate diseases based on symptoms and test results from patient health records. It is in contrast to existing efforts that deal with only prostate cancer. The main part of HIROFILOS-II is constructed by extracting rules from patient records via machine learning techniques and then manually transforming them into fuzzy rules. The system comprises crisp as well as fuzzy rules organized in modules. Experimental results show more than satisfactory performance of the system. The machine learning component of the system, which operates off-line, can be periodically used for rule updating, given that enough new patient records have been added to the database.

To solve this machine learning problem, we consider a Memetic Pareto Evolutionary approach based on the NSGA2 algorithm (MPENSGA2), where we defined two objectives for determining the goodness of a classifier: the cross-entropy error function and the variation coefficient of its sensitivities, because both measures are continuous functions, making the convergence more robust. Once the Pareto front is built, we use an automatic selection methodology of individuals: the best model in accuracy (upper extreme in the Pareto front).

The proposed method improves the Kernel Orthogonal Subspace Projection (KOSP) by deforming the kernel through the approximation of the marginal distribution using the unlabeled samples. The good performance of the proposed method is illustrated in a hyperspectral image target detection application for thermal hot spot detection. An improvement is observed with respect to the linear and the non-linear kernel-based OSP, demonstrating good generalization capabilities when low number of labeled samples are available, which is usually the case in target detection problems.

The EU funded OASIS project, a Large Scale Integrated Project, is aimed to develop an open and innovative reference architecture, based upon ontologies and semantic services, that will allow plug and play and cost-effective interconnection of existing and new services in all domains required for the independent and autonomous living of the elderly and their enhanced quality of life. Among other technological advances, in OASIS we are developing a smart multisensorial platform for monitoring the lower limbs movements, as well as the muscular activations. We are using unobtrusive integrated sensors to transduce posture and kinematic variables and to acquire surface Electromiography (sEMG). The platform is able to analyze and merge the sEMG signals and kinematics variables to provide a single coherent dynamic information of the acquired movements. A Predictive Dynamic Model (PDM) based on machine learning techniques assesses the physiological muscular recruitments as well as muscular fatigue and physiological conditions.

ANNs imitate the structure and workings of the human brain by means of mathematical models able to adapt several parameters. ANNs learn the input/output behavior of a system through a supervised or an unsupervised learning algorithm. In this work, we present and demonstrate a new pre-processing algorithm able to improve the performance of an ANN in the processing of biomedical datasets. The algorithm was tested analyzing lung function and fractional exhaled nitric oxide differences in the breath in children with allergic bronchial asthma and in normal population. Classification obtained using non linear PCA based on the new algorithm shows a better precision in separating asthmatic and control subjects.

Recently, researchers have focused on applying machine learning in higher education to support both the students and the instructors getting better in their performances. Some previous papers have introduced this problem but the prediction results were unsatisfactory because of the class imbalance problem, which causes the degradation of the classifiers. The purpose of this paper is to tackle the class imbalance for improving the prediction/classification results by over-sampling techniques as well as using cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The paper shows that the results have been improved when comparing with only using baseline classifiers such as Decision Tree (DT), Bayesian Networks (BN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the original data sets.

Previous work has shown that it is advantageous to optimize general Euclidean distances (GED). In this paper, we optimize data transformations, which is equivalent to searching for GEDs, but can be applied to any learning algorithm, even if it does not use distances explicitly. Two optimization techniques have been used: a simple Local Search (LS) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES is an advanced evolutionary method for optimization in difficult continuous domains. Both diagonal and complete matrices have been considered. The method has also been extended to a quadratic non-linear transformation. Results show that in general, the transformation methods described here either outperform or match the classifier working on the original data.

Using machine learning techniques, the algorithm named Smart Sampling was tested in hard known benchmark functions, and was able to find promising regions with solutions very close to the global optimum, significantly decreasing the number of evaluations needed by a metaheuristic to finally find this global optimum, when heuristically started inside a promising region. Results show favorable agreement with theories which state the importance of an adequate starting population. The results also present significant improvement in the efficiency of the tested metaheuristic, without adding any parameter, operator or strategy. Being a technique which can be used by any populational metaheuristic, the work presented here has profound implications for future studies of global optimization and may help solve considerably difficult optimization problems.

B	Waltinger, U			IEEE	Waltinger, Ulli			Polarity Reinforcement: Sentiment Polarity Identification By Means Of Social Semantics	2009 AFRICON, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE Africon Conference	SEP 23-25, 2009	Nairobi, KENYA	IEEE				We propose a combination of machine learning and socially constructed concepts for the task of sentiment polarity identification. Detecting words with polarity is difficult not only due to limitations in current sentiment dictionaries but also due to the colloquial terms that are often used. Current approaches disregard the dynamics of language, i.e. that new words are often created comprising different polarities. In fact, the online community is very creative in coining terms about certain subjects such as "tweetup" (a request by a user to meet with friends via Twitter) or "whack" (Street slang, meaning bad). Our approach utilizes a user generated dictionary of urban term definitions as a resource for polarity concepts. Therefore, we are not only able to map newly created words to their respective polarity but also enhance common expressions with additional features and reinforce the polarity, strengthening our initial finding.

Communicative elements from different modalities "routinize into" cross-modal "super-signs", which we call multimodal ensembles. Computational models of human communication are in need of expressive models of multimodal ensembles. In this paper, we exemplify semiotic alignment by means of empirical examples of the building of multimodal ensembles. We then propose a graph model of multimodal dialogue that is expressive enough to capture multimodal ensembles. In line with this model, we define a novel task in machine learning with the aim of training classifiers that can detect semiotic alignment in dialogue. This model is in support of approaches which need to gain insights into realistic human-machine communication.

However, as opposed to other fields of machine learning such as supervised learning, the effect of finite sample has not been thoroughly addressed within the reinforcement learning framework. In this paper we propose to use L-2 regularization to control the complexity of the value function in reinforcement learning and planning problems. We consider the Regularized Fitted Q-iteration algorithm and provide generalization bounds that account for small sample sizes. Finally, a realistic visual-servoing problem is used to illustrate the benefits of using the regularization procedure.

A machine learning approach to k-step look-ahead prediction of gait variables from acceleration data	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				This paper investigates the use of machine learning to predict a sensitive gait parameter based on acceleration information from previous gait cycles. We investigate a k-step look-ahead prediction which attempts to predict gait variable values based on acceleration information in the current gait cycle. The variable is the minimum toe clearance which has been demonstrated to be a sensitive falls risk predictor. Toe clearance data was collected under normal walking conditions and 9 features consisting of peak acceleration and their normalized occurrences times were extracted. A standard least squares estimator, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and a support vector regressor (SVR) were trained using 60% of the data to estimate the minimum toe clearance and the remaining 40% was used to validate the model. It was found that when the training data contained data from all subjects (inter-subject) the best GRNN model provided a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8mm, the best SVR had RMSE of 2.7mm while the standard least squares linear regression method obtained 3.3mm. When the training and test data consisted of different subject examples (inter-subject) data, the linear SVR demonstrated superior generalization capability (RMSE=3.3mm) compared to other competing models. Validation accuracies up to 5-step look-ahead predictions revealed robust performances for both GRNN and SVR models with no clear degradation in prediction accuracy.	[Lai, Daniel T.

Using the machine learning method for this classification is effective, but constructing feature vectors with all data points might result in very high-dimensional data. Because such redundant features are undesirable from the viewpoint of computation and classification performance, EEG has been downsampled in several studies. In the present study, we propose a new downsampling method aiming at the improvement of P300 classification accuracy. In particular, each single trial EEG is segmented at non-uniform intervals and then averaged in each segment. The segmentation is decided in such a way that the degree of separating two classes from training data is increased by applying a time series segmentation algorithm. Our experiment using the BCI Competition III P300 Speller paradigm data set demonstrated that our method resulted in higher accuracy than traditional downsampling methods.

This paper presents the data obtained from six subjects (n=6) with SCI performing three activities, including wheelchair propulsion, arm-ergometer exercise and deskwork. The analysis presented here compares the EE estimated from the SenseWear and the RT3 with respect to the EE measured from a portable metabolic cart. It was found that the SenseWear overestimated EE for resting (+5.78%), wheelchair propulsion (+88.20%, +46.20%, and +138.21% for the three trials at different intensities, respectively), arm-ergometer exercise (+55.05%, +26.91%, and +39.17% for the three trials at different intensities, respectively) and deskwork (+13.11%). The results also indicate that RT3 underestimated EE for resting (-3.06%), wheelchair propulsion (-24.23%, -19.42%, and -9.98% for the three trials at different intensities, respectively), arm-ergometer exercise (-49.06%, -53.69% and -52.08 for the three trials at different intensities, respectively) and measured EE relatively accurate for deskwork. Good and moderate Intraclass correlations were found between EE measured by metabolic cart and EE estimated by SenseWear (0.787, p<0.0001) and RT3 (0.705, p<0.0001). Weka, machine learning software, was used to select attributes and model EE equations for the SenseWear and the RT3. Excellent and good Intraclass correlations were found between the EE measured by the metabolic cart and the estimated EE based on the models for SenseWear (0.944, p<0.0001) and RT3 (0.821, p<0.0001). Future work will test more subjects to refine the model and provide manual wheelchair users with a valid tool to gauge their daily physical activity and EE.

Recently, the rhythmic component extraction (RCE) method has been proposed to extract features of multi-channel EEG. RCE can extract a signal component with a certain frequency from multi-sensor signals. In this paper, we applied RCE to extract a feature corresponding to hand movement imagery tasks from signals measured by EEG. This feature from a single trial EEG signal is classified between imaginary left/right hand movement EEG using machine learning. On two subjects, our experiment shows that the combination of RCE and fisher discriminant analysis outperforms common spatial patterns (CSP) in classification accuracy. It is also reported that other major classifiers together with RCE give better performance than CSP. Additionally, we consider the relationship between data length and classification accuracy. It is shown that the accuracy tends to decrease as the data length becomes small.

We examine a 0.5 s epoch of EEG data using machine learning techniques that, unlike most previous studies, analyze the data in a holistic manner and extracts discriminative spatio-temporal filters. The analysis of the filters suggest sparse feature representation spatially as well as temporally. The filters reveal that the neural activity that discriminates individuals is spatially localized to occipital electrodes located on the scalp above the visual cortex and temporally localized in the interval of 120-200 ms after presentation of the visual stimulus.

The existing screens require either a parent-report questionnaire and/or direct observation by a trained practitioner. Although an automatic tool would benefit parents, clinicians and children, there is no automatic screening tool in clinical use. This study reports a fully automatic mechanism for autism detection/screening for young children. This is a direct extension of the LENA (TM) (Language ENvironment Analysis) system, which utilizes speech signal processing technology to analyze and monitor a child's natural language environment and the vocalizations/speech of the child. It is discovered that child vocalization composition contains rich discriminant information for autism detection. By applying pattern recognition and machine learning approaches to child vocalization composition data, accuracy rates of 85% to 90% in cross-validation tests for autism detection have been achieved at the equal-error-rate (EER) point on a data set with 34 children with autism, 30 language delayed children and 76 typically developing children. Due to its easy and automatic procedure, it is believed that this new tool can serve a significant role in childhood autism screening, especially in regards to population-based or universal screening.

Upper limb movements like reach-and-throw seem to be helpful in early identification of children affected by autism. Nevertheless few works investigate the application of classifying methods to upper limb movements. In this study we used a machine learning approach Support Vector Machine (SVM) for identifying peculiar features in reach-and-throw movements. 10 pre-scholar age children with autism and 10 control subjects performing the same exercises were analyzed. The SVM algorithm proved to be able to separate the two groups: accuracy of 100% was achieved with a soft margin algorithm, and accuracy of 92.5% with a more conservative one. These results were obtained with a radial basis function kernel, suggesting that a non-linear analysis is possibly required.

Thus, it is highly desirable to maximize the survival rate in cases of blood loss by predicting the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock with biomedical signals. Since analyzing one physiological signal may not enough to accurately predict blood loss severity, two types of physiological signals - Electrocardiography (ECG) and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) - are used to discover the degree of severity. In this study, these degrees are classified as mild, moderate and severe, and also severe and non-severe. The data for this study were generated using the human simulated model of hemorrhage, which is called lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The analysis is done by applying discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The wavelet-based features are defined using the detail and approximate coefficients and machine learning algorithms are used for classification. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement when analyzing ECG and TCD physiological signals together to classify the severity of blood loss. The results of this study show a prediction accuracy of 85.9% achieved by support vector machine in identifying severe/non-severe states.

These biomarkers can potentially improve the accuracy of cancer subtype prediction and subsequently, the success of therapy. In this paper, we describe emerging technology for enabling translational bioinformatics by improving biomarker identification. Specifically, we present an application that uses prior knowledge to identify the most biologically relevant gene ranking algorithm. Identification of statistically and biologically relevant biomarkers from high-throughput data can be unreliable due to the nature of the data e.g., high technical variability, small sample size, and high dimension size. Furthermore, due to the lack of available training samples, data-driven machine learning methods are often insufficient without the support of knowledge-based algorithms. As a case study, we apply these knowledge-driven methods to renal cancer data and identify genes that are potential biomarkers for cancer subtype classification.

However, detecting seizures is challenging due to significant intracranial EEG signal variability across patients. In this paper, we illustrate how a machine-learning based, patient-specific seizure detector provides better performance and lower power consumption than a patient non-specific detector using the same seizure library. The machine-learning based architecture was fully implemented in the micropower domain, demonstrating feasibility for an embedded detector in implantable systems.

As a pilot study the rules extraction algorithm applied for two of mentioned machine learning approaches (NN & SVM) was used. This was made to extract and transform the representation of knowledge gathered in Black Box parameters during classifier learning phase to be better and natural understandable for human user/expert. Proposed system was tested on the set of ECG signals of 20 atrial fibrillation (AF) and 20 control group (CG) patients, divided into learning and verifying subsets, taken from MIT-BiH database. Obtained results showed, that the ability of generalization of created system, expressed as a measure of sensitivity and specificity increased, due to extracting and selectively choosing only the most representative features for analyzed AF detection problem. Classification results achieved by means of constructed matched wavelet, created for given AF detection features were better than indicators obtained for standard wavelet basic functions used in ECG time-frequency decomposition.

Clinical decision support systems are especially instrumental in quickly assessing the criticality of pregnancy as it involves interpreting multiple maternal and fetal parameters. We propose a machine learning approach for early determination of the risk category of pregnancy based on patterns gleaned from profiles of known clinical parameters.

Predicting Cardiovascular Disease from Real-Time Electrocardiographic Monitoring: An Adaptive Machine Learning Approach on a Cell Phone	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				To date, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures the electrical activities of the heart from the body surface. However, heart rhythm irregularities cannot always be detected on a standard resting ECG machine, since they may not occur during an individual's recording session. Common Ho her-based portable solutions that record ECG for up to 24 to 48 hours lack the capability to provide real-time feedback. In this research, we seek to establish a cell phone-based real-time monitoring technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous on-line ECG processing, generating a personalized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting and classifying abnormal CVD conditions, all in real time. Specifically, we developed an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both an individual's cardiac characteristics and information from clinical ECG databases, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification on cell phones.

Numbers of multi-class SVM have been proposed. Compared with other multi-class SVM, Binary Tree of SVM (BTS) takes a good advantage of lower time consuming. However, there is some unnecessary data reassignment during constructing a binary tree, which makes BTS can't resolve the high-dimensional multi-class classification problem accurately. In this paper, a bayesian-based BTS classification algorithm (b-BTS) has been proposed. Experiments demonstrated that b-BTS is superior to BTS in resolving classification problem, such as image classification problem.

Here we propose an improved relevance model to solve image annotation problem. Unlike the classical approaches including classification. and translation model, the improved model is capable of discovering the correlation between blobs (segmented regions) and textual keywords so as to automatically generate keywords for un-annotated image according to joint probabilities. Moreover, it has the ability to detect and remove false keyword(s) by considering the co-occurrence of keywords through machine learning. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous algorithms for image annotation.

Most of the studies on feature selection techniques concern the classification in supervised learning. Very few studies Focus on unsupervised classification. However, selecting the relevant features in unsupervised learning is more difficult than supervised learning since the topology of the given data space must be strongly preserved. These are a few proposed techniques, especially filter technique based on Laplacian score, for unsupervised feature selection. However, these techniques concern only local topology of the data clusters. In this paper, a new univariate filtering technique, called Laplacian++, is proposed and based on the strong constraint on the global topology of the data space. We apply Laplacian++ to several public datasets of UCI repository of machine learning databases and compare its performance with Laplacian score. The experimental results signify that the performance of our proposed technique is obviously better than those from the other techniques.

Rotors are the critical component of steam turbines, the assessment of rotor degradation is of great significance to ensure the safe and economic operation of the power plants. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM), a new machine learning technique, is applied to assess rotor life loss severity. Comparing to traditional mechanism methods for rotor residual life evaluation, the SVM model has no limits of the dimension of inputs and less time is spent on computation. Furthermore, the method provides a feasible tool for online rotor condition monitoring and even life prediction based on future operation schedules.

In this paper we present an in situ fully automatic method for detecting constituent elements in a sample specimen using computer vision and machine learning techniques on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) spectra. This enables the development of a compact and portable spectrometer on a high resolution video camera. In the traditional classification problem, classes are mutually exclusive by definition. However, in spectral analysis a spectrum could contain emissions from multiple elements such that the disjointness of the labels is no longer valid. We cast the metal detection problem as a multi-label classification and enable detection of elemental composition of the specimen. Here, we apply both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to multiple metal classification and compare the performance with a simple template matching technique. Both machine learning approaches yield correct identification of metals to an accuracy of 99%. Our method is useful in instances where accurate elemental analysis is not required but rather a qualitative analysis. Experiments on the simulation data show that our method is suitable for LIBS metal detection.

However, this tremendous growth has brought on an accumulating complexity in management tasks, thus undercutting the Internet's manageability and proving detrimental to further development. To address this predicament, the concept of a capacity for autonomic operation was proposed and later extended with artificial intelligence features to thus converge on the vision of a self-managed Future Internet. The capacity for self-management builds on specific technological enablers, including a network monitoring infrastructure, mechanisms for decision making and decision appraisal as well as advanced artificial intelligence features (e.g., machine learning). This paper establishes the role of these capacities in realizing a self-managed mode of operation for wireless Internet systems. We present a case study where self-management features resulting from the combined application of device and network monitoring and decision making are employed in a solution of a well-known planning and management problem in wireless networking.

Despite that, the nature of chunks still remains very elusive, especially with understanding chunks in procedural knowledge. Our attempt is to show the existence of chunks in procedural knowledge, define them, and describe their characteristics. With this purpose in mind, we use data mining techniques. We chose the game of chess as an experimental domain, due to its complexity, well defined rules, and a standardized measure of chess-players' knowledge. Results could contribute to the understanding of human information processing and cognitive architecture. They could be beneficial for tutoring and student modeling, and may serve as a framework for knowledge-based driven AI agents.

Management costs require a technically skilled human intellect, amounting to a substantial part of total cost of ownership. Self-management is positioned as a key capacity towards a scalable Future Internet architecture. Herein we present key technological enablers for self-manageable Future Internet systems, namely monitoring, decision-making and machine learning. We survey the state-of-the-art in network management aspects of these thematic areas and present a use case where their synergetic capacities render solutions to a known transport problem in wireless settings.

This paper examines the visual texture classification in order to investigate how well it could be used for haptic texture search engine. In classifying the visual textures, feature extraction for a given image involving wavelet decomposition is used to obtain the transformation coefficients. Feature vectors are formed using energy signature from each wavelet sub-band coefficient. We conducted an experiment to investigate the extent in which wavelet decomposition could be used in haptic texture search engine. The experimental result, based on different testing data, shows that feature extraction using wavelet decomposition achieve accuracy rate more than 96%. This demonstrates that wavelet decomposition and energy signature is effective in extracting information from a visual texture. Based on this finding, we discuss on the suitability of wavelet decomposition for haptic texture searching, in terms of extracting information from image and haptic information.

There are a number of techniques proposed to perform classification. Neural network is one of the artificial intelligent techniques that has many successful examples when applying to this problem. This paper presents a comparison of neural network techniques for binary classification problems. The classification performance obtained by five different types of neural networks for comparison are Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Complementary Neural Network (CMTNN). The comparison is done based on three benchmark data sets obtained from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that CMTNN typically provide better classification results when comparing to techniques applied to binary classification problems.	[Jeatrakul, P.; Wong, K.

The main function of the system is to extract information related to terrorism events found in Thai news articles. The terrorism events can then be classified and presented to intelligence officers who can further analyze and predict terrorism events. This paper compares three named entity feature selection techniques provided by terrorism gazetteer, terrorism ontology and terrorism grammar rules, for entity recognition. The machine learning algorithms use for event extraction include Naive Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DTREE) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each term feature is weighted by using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Finite State Transduction is applied for learning feature weights. Experimental results show that the SVM algorithm with a terrorism ontology feature selection yields the best performance with 69.90% for both precision and recall.

An important characteristic of this task is the high dimensionality of the involved data sets. In this work we apply filter feature selection methods on three types of (1)H-MRS spectral data: long echo time, short echo time and an ad hoc combination of both. The experimental findings show that feature selection permits to drastically reduce the dimension, offering at the same time very attractive solutions both in terms of prediction accuracy and the ability to interpret the involved spectral frequencies. A linear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves the class discrimination capabilities is additionally used for visualization of the selected frequencies.

Recently, many such classifiers are trained with WebPages which are labeled manually or extracted from the Open Directory Project (ODP), and then the classifiers judge the topical relevance of WebPages pointed to by hyperlinks in the crawler frontier. Though one can obtain labeled WebPages with comparative ease, however, training the classifiers with WebPages violates the overall hypothesis of machine learning about i.i.d (Independent and Identical Distribution) between training and testing sets because the classification instances are hyperlinks (URLs) instead of WebPages. For the reason, this paper investigates and proposes a novel method based on templates for automatically labeling the positive URLs to develop classifier-guided topical crawlers. A series of off-line and on-line experiments are performed extensively. The results demonstrate that the classifier-guided topical crawler trained with labeled URLs has higher recall than the one trained with labeled WebPages. The results also prove that the classifier using immediate vicinity of hyperlinks and the corresponding anchor texts leads the crawler to attain harvest rate of about 87%.

This work describes an approach to learning cue phrase patterns in radiology reports that utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) as the learning method. The approach described here successfully learned cue phrase patterns for two distinct classes of radiology reports. These patterns can then be used as a basis for automatically categorizing, clustering, or retrieving relevant data for the user.

In this paper an artificial data generator called GLOR is presented, which is based on a Monte Carlo method and designed for the training of machine learning classifiers for glaucoma diagnosis. The generated population is characterized by the functional and structural data of eyes. In this study, these parameters are provided by High Definition Optical Coherence Tomography (HD-OCT) and by Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) instruments. A Naive-Bayes classifier trained by using an artificial population comprising of 4500 normal and 500 glaucomatous subjects, obtained a rate of 77% for sensibility and 93% for specificity, during a classification performance evaluation using real patient data. The area under a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve was 0.9308.

ABML is a recent method that combines argumentation and machine learning from examples, and its main idea is to use arguments for some of the learning examples. Arguments are usually provided by a domain expert. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, where arguments used in ABML are automatically extracted from text with a technique for relation extraction. We demonstrate and evaluate the approach through a case study of learning to classify animals by using arguments automatically extracted from Wikipedia.

To overcome these disadvantages, this study presents an efficient and simple classifier based on the cerebellar model articulation controller NN (CMAC NN), which has the advantages of very fast learning, reasonable generalization ability and robust noise resistance. The performance of the proposed CMAC NN classifier is measured using PROBEN1 benchmark data sets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for diabetes and glass, each of which include, respectively, three permutations of the available patterns. Numerical results show that the proposed CMAC NN classifier was efficient for tested data sets. Therefore, the CMAC NN classifier can be considered as a data mining tool to classification.

Simulated annealing heuristic is employed to effectively investigate the large search space usually associated with classification problem. Here, two criteria are used to evaluate the proposed method. The first criterion is accuracy of extracted fuzzy if-then rules, and the other is comprehensibility of obtained rules.

Two common types of learning that are often mentioned are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. One often understands that in supervised learning, the system is given the desired output, and it is required to produce the correct output for the given input, while in unsupervised learning the system is given only the input and the objective is to find the natural structure inherent in the input data. We, however suggest that even with unsupervised learning, the information inside the input, the structure of the input, and the sequence that the input is given to the system actually make the learning "supervised" in some way. Therefore, we recommend that in order to make the machine learn, even in a "supervised" manner we should use an "unsupervised learning" model together with an appropriate way of presenting the input. We propose in this paper a simple plasticity neural network model that has the ability of storing information as well as storing the association between a pair of inputs. We then introduce two simple unsupervised learning rules and a framework to supervise our neural network.

However, this task is very complex as it must be performed according to service contracts between users and operators, network's infrastructure and workload. Knowledge Plane is a recently proposed concept to address this complexity by using cognitive tools (learning and reasoning). In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Plane including a distributed and collaborative machine learning method based on inductive logic programming(iLP). The main objective is to achieve distributed self-configuring by learning collaboratively best configuration strategies. We apply it in a practical context (DiffServ) and evaluate effects of this proposal on network's performances and occupation rate.

Nowadays, the most commonly used techniques are either based on the well-known TCP or UDP port numbers, or on the inspection of the packet payloads. Since an increasing number of applications adopt random port numbers or employ payload encryption, there is a growing interest for new techniques that exploit statistical features of the packet flows, which are difficult to conceal. These features include the length of the packets, the interarrival times, and other parameters that capture temporal correlations in the flow. In this paper, we propose to collect a new class of features based on the process of connection requests from the different traffic sources. These features are then used to help in the classification of traffic flows coming from those sources. Experimental results with real traffic traces show that there are some notable cases in which these features result in an increased classification performance.

Each of these three linear methods is then extended to its corresponding nonlinear kernel version. The well-known Reed-Xiaoli (RX) anomaly detector and its kernel version (kernel RX) are also implemented. Comparisons between all linear and non-linear anomaly detectors are made using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for several hyperspectral imagery.

Although the application of standard supervised learning techniques to HSI data has previously been explored, several aspects of hyperspectral data collection and ground truth labeling make some of the assumptions underlying standard machine learning techniques invalid. For example, HSI is highly dependent upon local environmental conditions, and pixel-by-pixel labels for HSI data are often not available. As a result, data from hyperspectral sensing under various scenarios is not typically i.i.d., and correct data labels must be inferred from training data while learning decision boundaries. In this work we explore two possible solutions to these problems: context-dependent learning for overcoming variations between collections, and multiple instance learning for simultaneously inferring local target labels and global target decision boundaries. Results are compared to standard logistic discriminant classification approaches.

To deal with high dimensional spaces (image cubes present 256 bands), two methods are proposed. The first method is the support vectors machines regression (SVM-R) which applies the structural risk minimization to perform a non-linear regression. Several kernels are investigated in this work. The second method is the Gaussian regularized sliced inverse regression (GRSIR). It is a two step strategy; the data are map onto a lower dimensional vector space where the regression is performed. Experimental results on simulated data sets have showed that the SVM-R is the most accurate method. However, when dealing with real data sets, the GRSIR gives the most interpretable results.

In this paper, RS and SVM theories have been discussed, a new hybrid RS-SVM model was proposed based on the attribute reduction of RS and the classification principles of SVM, which has been analyzed its possibility of application in competency assessment and has been applied in competency assessment. Firstly, the attribute reduction of RS has been applied as preprocessor to delete redundant attributes and conflicting objects without losing efficient information. Then, an SVM classification model is built to make a forecast. Finally,compared the RS-SVM model with neural network model or grade regression model. Empirical results shown that RS-SVM model obtains good classification performance, and it highly reduces the complexity in the process of SVM classification and prevents the over-fit of training model in a certain extent.

This paper addresses the general research question of evaluating the effectiveness of applying machine learning and text mining techniques to building predictive models with annual reports. More specifically, we focus on these two questions: 1) can the advantages of the ranking algorithm help achieve better predictive performance with annual reports? and 2) can we integrate meta semantic features to help support our prediction? We compare models built with different ranking algorithms and document models. We evaluate our models with a simulated investment portfolio. Our results show significantly positive average returns over 5 years with a power law trend as we increase the ranking threshold. Adding meta features to document model has shown to improve ranking performance. The SVR & Meta-augemented model outperforms the others and provides potential for explaining the textual factors behind the prediction.

The proposed approach is based on a set of lexical resources constructed for our purposes (e.g., journal titles, conference names) and on a traditional machine-learning classifier that assigns one category to each document based on identified core features. The system is evaluated on a real-world data set and the influence of different feature combinations and settings is studied. Although the available information is limited, the results show that the approach is capable to efficiently classify data items representing documents.

SentiWordNet scores are exploited together with additional features to assign a polarity to a text using machine learning. On the other hand, a rule-based approach is studied based on sentiment scores. The introduced methods are tested on single domains of a real-world data set consisting of documents in six different domains, but also in cross-domain settings. The results show that for cross-domain sentiment analysis rule-based approaches with fix opinion lexica are unsuited. For machine-learning based sentiment classification a mixture of documents of different domains achieves good results.

An automatic bug triage system may reduce the software maintenance time and improve its quality by correct and timely assignment of new bug reports to the appropriate developers. In this paper, we present the techniques behind an automatic bug triage system, which is based on the categorization of bug reports. In order to obtain an automatic bug triage system we used these techniques and performed comparative experiments. We downloaded 1,983 resolved bug reports along with the developer activity data from the Mozilla open source project. We extracted the relevant features like report title, report summary etc., from each bug report, and extracted developer's name who resolved the bug reports from the developers activity data. We processed the extracted textual data, and obtained the term-to-document matrix using parsing, filtering and term weighting methods. For term weighting methods we used simple term frequency and TF x IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) methods. Furthermore, we reduced the dimensionality of the obtained term-to-document matrix by applying feature selection and latent semantic indexing methods. Finally we used seven different machine learning methods for the classification of bug reports. The best obtained bug triage system is based on latent semantic indexing and support vector machine having 44.4% classification accuracy. The average precision and recall values are 30% and 28%, respectively.

However, building up and maintaining a set of user preferences for an individual user is a nontrivial exercise. Relying on the user to input preferences has been found not to work and the use of different forms of machine learning are being investigated. This paper as concerned with the problem of updating a set of preferences when a new aspect of an existing preference is discovered. A basic algorithm (with variants) is given for handling this situation. This has been developed for the Daidalos and Persist pervasive systems. Some research issues are also discussed.

IDSes can be categorized according to the nature of detection into two major categories: signature-based and anomaly-based. In this paper we present KBIDS, a kernel-based method for an anomaly-based IDS that tries to cluster the training data to be able to classify the test data correctly. The method depends on the K-Means algorithm that is used for clustering. Our experiments show that the accuracy of detection of KBIDS increases exponentially with the number of clusters. However, the time taken to classify the given test data increase linearly with the number of clusters. It can be derived from the results that 16 clusters are sufficient to achieve an acceptable error rate while keeping the detection delay in bounds.

While the traditional TCP-Friendly Rate Control protocol attributes all the packet losses to congestion, and in turn takes congestion control actions to reduce the sending rate, that causes the channel utilization of MANET network extremely low. This paper proposes an end-to-end machine learning algorithm to cognize the loss reasons. Through extracting the statistical characteristics of the lost packet the receiver can train a support vector machine (SVM) model, which can be used to discriminate the three major loss reasons: congestion, route change and wireless error. The unique merit of our solution is that it can cope with this puzzled problem intelligently without subjective or artificial thresholds to been determined. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the differentiation scheme performs effectively under most scenarios.

The most common approach in AD neuroimaging studies has been of univariate nature, where individual brain regions/voxels are analyzed separately. In many cases these techniques prove to be effective. However, they could not shed light on inter brain region connectivity associated with the brain function or disease of interest. Indeed, human brain is a very complex organ anatomically and the functional interactions between its regions are even more. As a result, there is a need to understand this interdependency or inter-connection of brain regions. There are several existing techniques to address this issue. They include principal component analysis (PCA), PCA based scaled subprofile modeling (SSM), Bayesian network approach and independent component analysis (ICA). In this study, we propose a machine learning technique called "Sparse Inverse Covariance Analysis" to learn the brain region interactivity, with minimal computational cost and appropriate degree of sparsity. Under Gaussian assumption, each element of the inverse covariance matrix represents conditional dependence between the constituent pair. of variables, given all other variables. By introducing sparsity constraint, unnecessary/noisy functional dependencies are eliminated by setting the constituent element to zero, resulting into conditional independence between the variable pairs. Using functional FDG-PET data acquired from 49 AD and 67 normal subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) project, we evaluate this technique in terms of distinct brain region connectivity pattern in patients with AD compared to that in normal control subjects. It was found that the patients with AD had disconnections that are not present in the normal controls. This different connectivity pattern is potentially usable for clinical diagnosis and for establishing sensitive markers for the disease progression and treatment evaluation.

This paper introduces a BCI instant messaging system (i.e. BCI messenger), which is further work of the P300-based Chinese typewriter developed in the preceding research. The BCI messenger can serve as a daily communication tool, with which the patients can type and send messages to either computer clients or cell phones. The typewriter interface is implemented following the design of modern cell phone keypad, where every key can act as a specific element in different input modes and multiple input modes including Chinese, English, numbers and symbols are integrated. Since P300 potentials exhibit various amplitudes and latencies on different individuals, some intensification parameters (e.g. variable stimulus round, inter-stimulus interval), and even some advanced intensification methods (e.g. stimulus size enhancement) could be customized to reinforce the elicitation of P300. Six subjects participated in the experiments of the BCI system above. A short training period is requested to allow task completion, and after about one hour's practice, most of the subjects learned to operate the typewriter. All participators showed a gradual performance increase across sessions and average accuracy in the best condition for each subject surpassed 80%. Besides, effect of different electrode configurations and machine learning algorithms on classification accuracy is tested. The experiment results demonstrate that BCIs can provide locked-in patients with effective communication.

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively monitor and assess the changes that occur in microcirculation during resuscitation period. The results assist physicians in making diagnostically and therapeutically important decisions such as determination of the effectiveness of the resuscitation process. The proposed algorithm applies advanced digital image processing methods to provide quantitative assessment of video signals for detection and characterization of capillaries. The objective of the algorithm is to segment capillaries, estimate the presence and velocity of Red Blood Cells (RBCs), and identify the distribution of blood flow in capillaries for a variety of normal and abnormal cases. The algorithm first, stabilizes each frame to follow the variations in the consecutive frames. Then, time-averaging techniques are applied to the frames to reduce the motion artifact. Histogram equalization, wavelet transform, and median filtering are the subsequent steps applied to accurately detect the blood vessels in each frame. In order to estimate the velocity of RBCs, space time diagrams are obtained through cross-correlation calculations. This study aims to reduce the human interaction as well as the computation time.

In this study, novel features based on discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) were used to analyze physiological signals for prediction of central hypovolemia severity in humans. These features were defined based on approximate and detailed DWT coefficients extracted from physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and thoracic impedance (IZT and DZT) signals, collected on healthy humans exposed to a hemorrhage model called lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The LBNP protocol consisted of applying 0, -15, -30, 45,-60,-70 mm Hg pressure to the lower half of the body, for 5 minutes at each stage. These LBNP levels were divided into three classes: mild, moderate, and severe. Machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the severity of blood loss based on the features extracted from the physiological signals. One of the objectives of this study was to compare the utility of using multiple physiological signals in prediction of the severity of hypovolemia as opposed to only using ECG. The classification results indicate that SVM has the highest accuracy at 82%. SVM's average precision and recall for all three classes are 79.2% and 79.8%, respectively. This shows that the wavelet-based method using multiple signals has the ability of rapidly determining the degree of volume loss, providing a potential tool for real-time remote triage and decision making in victims of trauma.

Research has identified significant costs linked to a very high rate of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) associated with poor ergonomic positioning in dentists. The annual costs of WMSDs across all occupations are estimated to be between 13 and 54 billion dollars. Little research has been done to explore the design of portable, inexpensive, non-invasive and unobtrusive real-time systems to measure posture. This paper details the design and testing of our proposed system that applies signal processing and robust machine learning techniques to improve the ergonomics of dental practitioners. We outline a number of different signal processing and classification techniques tested and analytically compared with our proposed system. Our system makes use of commercial inclinometers embedded into a standard laboratory coat. The ability of the system to measure posture accurately in practical settings, without needing exact and obtrusive placement of sensors or extensive calibration, is demonstrated through a set of experiments with human subjects.

Human Detection Using Partial Least Squares Analysis	2009 IEEE 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV)	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2009	Kyoto, JAPAN	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc				Significant research has been devoted to detecting people in images and videos. In this paper we describe a human detection method that augments widely used edge-based features with texture and color information, providing us with a much richer descriptor set. This augmentation results in an extremely high-dimensional feature space (more than 170,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs are nearly intractable with respect to training. Furthermore, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space, by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the extraction of features from a densely sampled grid structure leads to a high degree of multicollinearity. To circumvent these data characteristics, we employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, one which preserves significant discriminative information, to project the data onto a much lower dimensional subspace (20 dimensions, reduced from the original 170,000). Our human detection system, employing PLS analysis over the enriched descriptor set, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on three varied datasets including the popular INRIA pedestrian dataset, the low-resolution gray-scale DaimlerChrysler pedestrian dataset, and the ETHZ pedestrian dataset consisting of full-length videos of crowded scenes.

This work extends the usage of Random Forests to Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) problems. We show that traditional decision trees are optimizing multi-class margin maximizing loss functions. From this intuition, we develop a novel multi-class margin definition for the unlabeled data, and an iterative deterministic annealing-style training algorithm maximizing both the multi-class margin of labeled and unlabeled samples. In particular, this allows us to use the predicted labels of the unlabeled data as additional optimization variables. Furthermore, we propose a control mechanism based on the out-of-bag error, which prevents the algorithm from degradation if the unlabeled data is not useful for the task. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning performance in typical machine learning problems and constant improvement using unlabeled data for the Caltech-101 object categorization task.

A local learning based approach and a global learning based approach are then produced, to fit better the scribble based matting and the trimap based matting, respectively. Our approaches are easy to implement because only some simple matrix operations are needed. They are also extremely accurate because they can efficiently handle the nonlinear local color distributions by incorporating the kernel trick, that are beyond the ability of many previous works. Our approaches can outperform many recent matting methods, as shown by the theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The new insights may also inspire several more works.

However, since these algorithms scale with data size, pruning the data is sometimes necessary. The pruning procedure must be statistically valid and a representative subset of the data must be selected without introducing selection bias. Information theoretic measures have been used for sampling the data, retaining its original information content. We propose an efficient Renyi entropy based subset selection algorithm. The algorithm is first validated and then applied to two sample applications where machine learning and data pruning are used. In the first application, Gaussian process regression is used to learn object pose. Here it is shown that the algorithm combined with the subset selection is significantly more efficient. In the second application, our subset selection approach is used to replace vector quantization in a standard object recognition algorithm, and improvements are shown.

Recently machine learning methods are widely applied to tracking, and some online and semi-supervised algorithms are developed to handle these difficulties. In this paper, we consider tracking as a classification problem and present a novel tracking method based on boosting in a co-training framework. The proposed tracker can be online updated and boosted with multi-view weak hypothesis. The most important contribution of this paper is that we find a boosting error upper bound in a co-training framework to guide the novel tracker construction. In theory, the proposed tracking method is proved to minimize this error bound. In experiments, the accuracy rate of foreground/background classification and the tracking results are both served as evaluation metrics. Experimental results show good performance of proposed novel tracker on challenging sequences.

The focus of past literature is dominated by segmenting the complete coronary artery system as trees by computer. Though the labeling of different vessel branches (defined by their medical semantics) is much needed clinically, this task has been performed manually. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical machine learning approach to tackle the problem of tubular structure parsing in medical imaging. It has a progressive three-tiered classification process at volumetric voxel level, vessel segment level, and inter-segment level. Generative models are employed to project from low-level, ambiguous data to class-conditional probabilities; and discriminative classifiers are trained on the upper-level structural patterns of probabilities to label and parse the vessel segments. Our method is validated by experiments of detecting and segmenting clinically defined coronary arteries, from the initial noisy vessel segment networks generated by low-level heuristics-based tracing algorithms. The proposed framework is also generically applicable to other tubular structure parsing tasks.

In this paper we apply one of the most successful ones Maximum Variance Unfolding on a big sample of the well known speech benchmark TIMIT. Although MVU is not generally scalable, we managed to apply to 1 million 39-dimensional points and successfully reduced the dimension down to 15. In this paper we apply some of the state-of-the-art techniques for handling big datasets. The biggest bottleneck is the local neighborhood computation. For 300K points it took 9 hours while for I M points it took 3.5 days. We also demonstrate the weakness of MFCC representation under the k-nearest neighborhood classification since the error rate is more than 50%.

A major weakness of conventional modulation recognition algorithms is their reliance on high SNR environments and favorable statistics. In this paper an algorithm is developed using elements of cyclo-spectral analysis, ICA and SVM algorithms to distinguish between different modulation types. By first estimating the cyclic spectrum and then analyzing statistical features of the spectrum using machine learning techniques, the particular modulation type can be determined over a wide range of SNR values. This can further be enhanced by employing ICA algorithms to remove feature redundancy. To demonstrate this; simulations are constructed which illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm using digital phase and amplitude modulation. The algorithm's performance is tested over a wide range of SNR values.

Often times, the large number of features that comprise this high-dimensional pattern are themselves vector valued, corresponding to sampled values in a time-series. Here, we present a classification methodology to accommodate multiple time-series using boosting. This method constructs an additive model by adaptively selecting basis functions consisting of a discriminating feature's full time-series. We present the necessary modifications to Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis and Least-Squares, as base learners, to accommodate the weighted data in the proposed boosting procedure.

This method is a kind of multi-systems collaborative signal processing through iteration: several independent systems work in rotation, and each system takes feedback information from the other systems as a priori condition. We have applied such a Turbo iterative signal processing (TISP) method on speech signal enhancement, and on SAR (synthetic aperture radar) image filtering, segmentation and fusion. Some practical results presented in this article show that the Turbo iterative algorithm converges after 5-10 iterations and it improve greatly the signal processing performance. The TISP also shows an effective machine-learning method, that is making a discussion between several independent systems through Turbo iteration.

Entropy based feature selection algorithms such as MRMR . Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance and FCBF , Fast Correlation Based Filter are preferred feature selection methods because they are very fast and produce sets of features that result in quite accurate classifiers. Besides accuracy stability is another measure of goodness for a feature selection algorithm. A feature selection algorithm is said to be stab le if changes in the identity of data points available for feature selection still result in the same or similar sets of features. In this study we first developed a net stability measurement and performed accuracy and stability measurements of MRMR when it is used on different data sets. We found out that the two feature selection methods within MRMR MID and MIQ result in features with similar accuracy off On the other hand, MD results in more stable feature sets than MIQ and therefore should be referred over MIQ specially for small number of available samples.

Research has found that segmentation results are a dominant factor that drives iris recognition matching performance. This work proposes techniques based on probabilistic intensity features and geometric features to arrive at scores indicating the success of both pupil and iris segmentation. The technique is fully automated and therefore requires no human supervision or manual evaluation. This work also presents a machine learning approach which utilizes the pupil and iris scores to arrive at an overall iris segmentation result prediction. We test the techniques using two iris segmentation algorithms of varying performance on two publicly available iris datasets. Our analysis shows that the approach is capable of arriving at segmentation scores suitable for predicting both the success and failure of pupil or iris segmentation. The proposed machine learning approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.45% across the four combinations of algorithms and datasets tested when predicting overall segmentation results. Finally, we present one potential application of the technique specific to iris match score performance and outline many other potential uses for the algorithm.

A far more difficult scenario for eye detection is the unconstrained face recognition problem, where we do not have any control over the environment or the subject. In this paper, we take a look at two different approaches for eye detection under difficult acquisition circumstances, including low-light, distance, pose variation, and blur. A new machine learning approach and several correlation filter approaches, including a new adaptive variant, are compared. We present experimental results on a variety of controlled data sets (derived from FERET and CMU PIE) that have been re-imaged under the difficult conditions of interest with an EMCCD based acquisition system. The results of our experiments show that our new detection approaches are extremely accurate under all tested conditions, and significantly improve detection accuracy compared to a leading commercial detector. This unique evaluation brings us one step closer to a better solution for the unconstrained face recognition problem.

Finding the best learning strategy for a new domain/problem can prove to be an expensive and time-consuming process even for the experienced analysts. This paper presents a new meta-learning system, designed to automatically discover the most reliable learning schemes for a particular dataset, based on the knowledge the system acquired about similar datasets. The novelty of the approach consists in combining dataset characterization with landmarking to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The proposed architecture is aiming to resolve the problem of selecting the best classifier for a dataset while minimizing the work done by the user but still offering flexibility.

State-of-the-art approaches for contour mapping, however, are neither energy-optimized, nor capable of handling heterogeneous user requests. In this paper, we develop a novel energy-efficient On-demand Active Contour Service (OACS) for power-constrained WSNs. OACS regresses the field intensity function with kernel Support Vector Regression (SVR), a novel machine learning tool that flexibly handles both contour line and contour map requests. OACS also adaptively accommodates a wide range of contour line/map precision requirements: (I) For applications of low precision, only a minimum set of nodes are scheduled in working mode while others are sleeping for conserving energy. (2) For applications of high precision, through an active and progressive learning algorithm, OACS determines the best set of nodes that should be turned on for improving the contour line/map precision. Evaluation based on diverse realistic models demonstrates that OACS provides quality and seamless contour services for various application requirements yet significantly conserves energy.

The classifier is first trained on software history data, and then used to predict bugs. Two drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction are potentially insufficient accuracy for practical use, and use of a large number of features. These large numbers of features adversely impact scalability and accuracy of the approach. This paper proposes a feature selection technique applicable to classification-based bug prediction. This technique is applied to predict bugs in software changes, and performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is characterized.	[Shivaji, Shivkumar; Whitehead, E.

Software Reliability Prediction Using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm	2009 IEEE/ACS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	7th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA-09)	MAY 10-OCT 13, 2009	Rabat, MOROCCO	ACS, IEEE			CONNECTIONIST MODELS	Software reliability models are very useful to estimate the probability of the software fail along the time. Several different models have been proposed to predict the software reliability growth (SRGM); however, none of them has proven to perform well considering different project characteristics. The ability to predict the number of faults in the software during development and testing processes. In this paper, we explore Genetic Algorithms (GA) as an alternative approach to derive these models. GA is a powerful machine learning technique and optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of well known reliably growth models. Moreover, machine learning algorithms, proposed the solution overcome the uncertainties in the modeling by combining multiple models using multiple objective function to achieve the best generalization performance where. The objectives are conflicting and no design exists which can be considered best with respect to all objectives. In this paper, experiments were conducted to confirm these hypotheses. Then evaluating the predictive capability of the ensemble of models optimized using multi-objective GA has been calculated. Finally, the results were compared with traditional models.

S	Ma, ZS			IEEE	Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)			Cognitive Ecology and Social Learning Inspired Machine Learning: with Particular Reference to the Evolving of Resilient Airborne Networks (AN)	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT				INNOVATION; TRANSMISSION; NAVIGATION; STARLINGS; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; PIGEONS; MEMORY; BIRDS; ANTS	This paper tries to bring together three seemingly only remotely related fields: animal cognition in biology, machine learning in computer science, and the planning and deployment of resilient Airborne Networks. The underlying motivation is that the latest advances in animal behavior ecology such as social learning, innovation, and cognitive ecology may offer some meaningful insights for computational intelligence such as machine learning. Motivated by this expectation, I first review some of the latest advances in the field of animal cognition, with focusing on social learning, teaching, innovation and cognitive ecology. The justification for this focus is not only because they are interesting and are among the most actively studied topics in behavior biology, but also because the existing machine learning research, which from time to time takes cues from cognitive science, seems to only incorporate the traditional learning theory such as associative learning and reinforcement learning. After a briefly review of the major advances in animal learning and cognitive ecology, I look into the possibility to incorporate the principles and mechanisms from social learning and cognitive ecology into a typical machine learning architecture. By examining the Gadanho's (2001, 2003) ALEC (Asynchronous Learning by Emotion and Cognition) architecture, I propose to add a high layer to the ALEC architecture, and the resulting CEML (Cognitive Ecology and social lean-ling inspired Machine Learning) offers a framework that uses a population of agents and can readily consider social learning, teaching, and innovation as well as the influences of environment in a comprehensive manner. Finally, I consider the problem of planning and deployment of Airborne Networks (AN) and suggests that the new CEML should be ideal for tackling the AN problem.

Due to the large parameter space, and the complex, highly coupled nonlinear nature of the different system components, analysis is complicated and time consuming. Thus, such systems are generally validated only in regions local to anticipated operating points rather than through characterization of the entire feasible operational envelope of the system. We have addressed the factors deterring such a comprehensive analysis with a tool to support parametric analysis and envelope assessment: a combination of advanced Monte Carlo generation with n-factor combinatorial parameter variations and model-based testcase generation is used to limit the number of cases without sacrificing important interactions in the parameter space. For the automatic analysis of the generated data we use unsupervised Bayesian clustering techniques (AutoBayes) and supervised learning of critical parameter ranges using the treatment learner TAR3. This unique combination of advanced machine learning technology enables a fast and powerful multivariate analysis that supports finding of root causes.

Hierarchical Fault Diagnosis and Health Monitoring in Multi-platform Space Systems	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT				POWER-SYSTEMS; DESIGN; VTB	Current spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis practices that involve around-the-clock limit-checking and trend analysis on large amount of telemetry data, do not scale well for future multi-platform space missions due to the presence of larger amount of telemetry data and an increasing need to make the long-duration missions cost-effective by limiting the size of the operations team. The need for efficient utilization of telemetry data by employing machine learning and rule-based reasoning has been pointed out in the literature in order to enhance diagnostic performance and assist the less-experienced personnel in performing monitoring and diagnosis tasks. In this research we develop a systematic and transparent fault diagnosis methodology within a hierarchical fault diagnosis framework for multi-platform space systems. Our proposed Bayesian network-based hierarchical fault diagnosis methodology allows fuzzy rule-based reasoning at different components in the hierarchy. Due to the unavailability of real formation flight data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by using synthetic data of a leader-follower formation flight. Our proposed methodology is likely to enhance the level of autonomy in ground support based spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Our aim is to design strategies that are interpretable by human operators, that comply with real-time constraints and that cover the major disturbances that may appear during the next day. To this end we propose a new framework using supervised learning to infer such recourse strategies from simulations of the system under a sample of conditions representing possible deviations from the forecast. This framework is validated on a realistic generation system of medium size.

In the proposed method the voltage security index for every operating point is calculated off-line. As a result, the system security status is determined for every operating point. Then the decision tree is trained using the database obtained from the previous stage. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method comparing to other available methods such as artificial neural networks.	[Mahmoodianfard, F.; Mohammadi, M.; Gharehpetian, G.

Learning to Segment Using Machine-Learned Penalized Logistic Models	2009 IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION WORKSHOPS (CVPR WORKSHOPS 2009), VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-Computer-Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops	JUN 20-25, 2009	Miami Beach, FL	IEEE Comp Soc			IMAGE SEGMENTATION; ULTRASOUND IMAGES	Classical maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) segmentation uses generative models for images. However creating tractable generative models can be difficult for complex images. Moreover; generative models require auxiliary parameters to be included in the maximization, which makes the maximization more complicated. This paper proposes an alternative to the MAP approach: using a penalized logistic model to directly model the segmentation posterior This approach has two advantages: (1) It requires fewer auxiliary parameters, and (2) it provides a standard way of incorporating powerful machine-learning methods into segmentation so that complex image phenomenon can be learned easily from a training set. The technique is used to segment cardiac ultrasound images sequences which have substantial spatio-temporal contrast variation that is cumbersome to model. Experimental results show that the method gives accurate segmentations of the endocardium in spite of the contrast variation.

Recognizing spontaneous facial actions, however is very challenging due to subtle facial deformation, frequent head movements, and ambiguous and uncertain facial motion measurements. As a result, current research in facial action recognition is limited to posed facial actions and often in frontal view. Spontaneous facial action is characterized by rigid head movements and nonrigid facial muscular movements. More importantly, it is the spatiotemporal interactions among the rigid and nonrigid facial motions that produce a meaningful and natural facial displays Recognizing this fact, we introduce a probabilistic facial action model based on a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to simultaneously and coherently capture rigid and nonrigid facial motions, their spatiotemporal dependencies, and their image measurements. Advanced machine learning methods are introduced to learn the probabilistic facial action model based on both training data and prior knowledge. Facial action recognition is accomplished through probabilistic inference by systemically integrating measurements of facial motions with the facial action model. Experiments show that the proposed system yields significant improvements in recognizing spontaneous facial actions.

Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure of higher-order probabilistic relations of data. The problem we tackle concerns the prediction of price movements (up/down) on stock markets. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method discovers a large population of variable subpatterns, i.e. local and global patterns, using a novel evolutionary hypernetwork. An output is obtained from combining these patterns. In the paper, we describe two methods for assessing the prediction quality of the hypernetwork approach. Applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index data, the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively learns and predicts the time series information. In particular, the hypernetwork approach outperforms other machine learning methods such as support vector machines, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptrons, and k-nearest neighbors.

This paper explores the use of genetic-based machine learning to assign priority dynamically, to improve performance of a team of agents without unduly impacting individual agents' performance. A decoupled heuristic approach is used for flexibility, whereby individual XCS agents learn to optimise their behaviour first, and then a high-level planner agent is introduced and trained to resolve conflicts by assigning priority. The approach is designed for Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments and demonstrated on a problem in 30 aircraft path planning.

Discovering Classification Rules for Email Spam Filtering with an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm	2009 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	MAY 18-21, 2009	Trondheim, NORWAY	IEEE				The cost estimates for receiving unsolicited commercial email messages, also known as spam, are threatening. Spam has serious negative impact on the usability of electronic mail and network resources. In addition, it provides a medium for distributing harmful code and/or offensive content. The work in this paper is motivated by the dramatic increase in the volume of spam traffic in recent years and the promising ability of ant colony optimization in data mining. Our goal is to develop an ant-colony based spam filter and to empirically evaluate its effectiveness in predicting spam messages. We also compare its performance to three other popular machine learning techniques: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes and Ripper classifiers. The preliminary results show that the developed model can be a remarkable alternative tool in filtering spam; yielding better accuracy with considerably smaller rule sets which highlight the important features in identifying the email category.

The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to determine how many and which individuals move between subpopulations at each site adaptively. In addition, we present a method to help individuals from other subpopulations not be weeded out but adapt to the new subpopulation. We apply our distributed genetic algorithm to the feature subset selection task which has been one of the active research topics in machine learning. We used six data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository to compare the performance of our approach with that of the single, centralized genetic algorithm. As a result, the proposed algorithm produced better performance than the single genetic algorithm in terms of the classification accuracy with the feature subsets.

One of the most important components of AIRS is resource competition. The goal of resource competition is the development of the fittest individuals. Resource competition phase removes weakest individuals and selects strongest (seemly good) individuals. This type of selection has high selective pressure with a loss of diversity. It may generate premature memory cells and decrease the accuracy of classifier. In this study, the Real World Tournament Selection (RWTS) method is incorporated in resource competition phase of AIRS to prevent this issue and experiments are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of new algorithm (RWTSAIRS). The combination of cross validation and t test is used as evaluation method. Algorithms tested on benchmark datasets of the UCI machine learning repository show that RWTSAIRS obtained higher accuracy than AIRS in all cases and that the difference between accuracies of two algorithms was significant in majority of cases.

The most important features of the approach are: i) The use of data mining techniques to perform knowledge extraction from biological sequences. Specifically an association analysis process is proposed as a methodology for discovering interesting relationships hidden in biological data sets; and ii) Some learning classifiers are proposed to be trained using binary profiles obtained from the association analysis process. These learning methods were applied over a sequence structure layer of secondary structure predictors to analyze the performance of association rules as a pattern extraction method. Some experiments were carried out to validate the proposed approach obtaining very promising results.			dcbecerrar@unal.edu.co; dmvanegaspi@unal.edu.co; gacantorm@unal.edu.co; lfninov@unal.edu.co					Alpaydin E, 2004, INTRO MACHINE LEARNI; Birzele F, 2006, BIOINFORMATICS, V22, P2628, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl453; BIRZELE F, 2005, THESIS TU MUNCHEN; Bishop C., 1996, NEURAL NETWORKS PATT; BORGELT C, 2003, EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTA; CHOU PY, 1974, BIOCHEMISTRY-US, V13, P222, DOI 10.1021/bi00699a002; Cuff JA, 1999, PROTEINS, V34, P508, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(19990301)34:4<508::AID-PROT10>3.0.CO;2-4; Frishman D, 1996, PROTEIN ENG, V9, P133, DOI 10.1093/protein/9.2.133; GAMIER J, 1978, J MOL BIOL, V120, P97; Jones DT, 1999, J MOL BIOL, V292, P195, DOI 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3091; Meiler J, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P12105, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1831973100; Nelson D.

The methods considered are selected carefully as they are the foremost approaches exploiting the linguistic representations in ANFIS, connectionist representations in MLP and machine learning based on structural risk minimization in SVM. The comparison metrics are the computational complexity measured by the propagation delay, realization performance and design simplicity. It is seen that SVM algorithm performs better in terms of providing an accurate fit to the desired dynamics but a very close performance result can also be obtained with ANFIS with significantly lower computational cost. Performance with MLP is comparably lower that the other two algorithms yet MLP structure has the lowest computational complexity.

The use and resulting interaction of multiple power electronic components in mesh-like power distribution architectures possibly result in the effects of faults being detectable throughout the system, for example, line-to-hull faults on DC systems with high resistive grounding. This paper reports on the initial results of investigations into the use of a number of different machine learning techniques for locating faults based on local measurements taken from power electronic components. These techniques include: decision trees; radial basis function networks; Bayesian networks; nearest neighbour classifiers; and support vector machines. Comparative testing of, the techniques above is used to identify the most appropriate approach. Initial results from this testing, and what these results indicate in terms of which techniques show the most promise, are discussed.	[Mair, A. J.; Davidson, E. M.; McArthur, S. D.

In being able to predict the types of traffic that nodes might generate, preference can be given to high priority, latency sensitive traffic. Traditionally, a home had a single computer utilizing a link to the Internet. In recent years this single computer was replaced by a multitude of smart devices with the same ultimate goal: embedding the user into the social fabric of the Internet. With the home still connected via a single link, these nodes are all contending for bandwidth and a novel QoS scheme is needed. In this paper, various models characterizing packet flow on a network will be developed. These are subsequently used to predict as accurately as possible, the immediate future traffic classes to be expected from nodes. This will eventually be used as a dynamic QoS criteria for pre-emptively assigning transmission slots to specific hosts. A number of techniques to accomplish this important task of node traffic pattern prediction, are presented. Lastly, evaluation of our approach, based on an 802.11b/g SOHo implementation, is also covered.

The performance of WMNs depends on the joint effect of both routing algorithms and rate adaptive algorithms. The performance of various routing algorithms has been studied extensively in the literature. However, little work has been done to evaluate the cross-layer impact of rate adaptive algorithms in WMN environments. In this paper, we compare the performance of several rate adaptive algorithms to exploit the multi-hop performance in WMN environments. In addition, a novel rate adaptive algorithm is proposed via the machine learning approach to robustly reflect the channel information. The goal of our design is to maximize the spectral efficiency.

All the aircrafts have a PID controller for Autopilot control system for pitch, yaw and roll. The PID [6 12] controllers are associated with their PID gains which can either be tuned manually or by optimized methods like genetic algorithms to get better control and enhancement in the performance. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are the powerful tool in the field of global optimization to various problems. Genetic algorithms are the models of machine learning which are based on the process of natural evolution. Here genetic algorithms are successfully applied for three axis autopilot (Pitch, Roll and Yaw) control of an aircraft using MATLAB simulation for tuning of PID controller and thus optimized values of PID gains for the controller are derived. Further the autopilot system has been validated using FlightGear software [1]. In this software the PID gains evaluated using genetic algorithms have been fed as an input in the autopilot program for the Boeing 747-400 (the model used here for autopilot system is Boeing 747-00).

B	Mitra, R; Bandyopadhyay, S			IEEE	Mitra, Ramkrishna; Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra			Improvement of MicroRNA Target Prediction Using An Enhanced Feature Set: A Machine Learning Approach	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference	MAR 06-07, 2009	Patiala, INDIA	IEEE				MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by base-pairing to mRNAs. Prediction of microRNA (miRNA)target transcript pair is now in the forefront of current research. A number of experimental and computational approaches have already detected thousands of targets for hundreds of human miRNAs. However, most of the computational target prediction methods suffer from high false positive and false negative rate. One reason for this is the marked deficiency of negative examples or non-target data. Current machine learning based target prediction algorithms suffer from lack of sufficient number of negative examples to train the machine properly because only a limited number of biologically verified negative miRNA-target transcripts have been identified with respect to true miRNA-target examples. Hence researchers have to rely on artificial negative examples. But, it has been observed that these artificially generated negative examples can not provide a good prediction accuracy for the independent test data set. Therefore it is necessary to generate more confident artificial negative examples. In the proposed article we have predicted potential miRNAtarget pairs with higher sensitivity and specificity based on a new way of generating negative examples. Firstly, artificial miRNAs are generated that are believed not to be a true miRNA. In this regard, we use a novel approach K-mer exchange between key and non-key regions of the miRNA. Based on the false miRNAs we search their potential targets by scanning entire 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) using the target prediction algorithm miRanda. Based on the newly generated negative examples and a set of biologically verified positive examples we trained the classifier SVM and classify a set of independent test samples. In this regard we have generated a set of 90 experimentally verified context specific features. Our prediction algorithm has been validated with an independent experimental data and we obtained a much higher prediction accuracy. The robust performance of the proposed method is mainly the result of using a large high-quality artificial negative examples and the integration of many biologically verified known and novel context specific features.

The increasing use of Artificial Neural Networks and machine learning has led to a huge amount of research and making in of large data sets that are used for training purposes. Handwriting recognition, speech recognition, speaker recognition, face recognition are some of the varied areas of applications of artificial neural networks. The larger training data sets are a big boon to these systems as the performance gets better and better with the increase in data sets. The higher training data set although drastically increases the training time. Also it is possible that the artificial neural network does not train at all with the large data sets. This paper proposes a novel concept of dealing with these scenarios. The paper proposes the use of a hierarchical model where the training data set is first clustered into clusters. Each cluster has its own neural network. When an unknown input is given to the system, the system first rinds out the cluster to which the input belongs. Then the input is processed by the individual neural network of that system. The general structure of the algorithm is similar to a hybrid system consisting of fuzzy logic and artificial neural network being applied one after the other. The system has huge applications in all the areas where Artificial Neural Network is being used extensively. The huge amount of research over these times has resulted in the creation of big databases, which are impractical for a single artificial neural network to train. Also the system takes us closer to the imitation of the human brain which has specialized segments for all sorts of scenarios. In order to test the working of the proposed system, we applied it over a synthetic dataset. The dataset was built by random inputs. We also applied the algorithm to the problem of face recognition. In both the cases, we got a better learning and a higher efficiency using our system. The time required to train the system was also much less than the original single neural network structure. This shows the impact of the algorithm.

The effortless ability exhibited by a two year kid for the same needs immense computation power for the computing machines. Many people attempted this problem by using different psychological characteristics such as handwriting, speech recognition, query response etc. These computational intensive techniques are application based and classification efficiency is limited. Some of the face identification systems have used the pixel based information, Eigen faces and geometrical relations of the facial features. We present a neural network-based upright invariant frontal face detection system which can classify the Gender based on the facial information.

Hepatitis B Diagnosis Using Logical Inference And Generalized Regression Neural Networks	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference	MAR 06-07, 2009	Patiala, INDIA	IEEE		Medical Diagnosis; Artificial Intelligence; Neural Networks; Hepatitis B; Generalized regression neural network; Hepatitis B virus (HBV); Hepatitis B DNA; Spleen Palpable; Spiders; Hepatitis B surface Antigen (AgHBs)	PARTICLES; PROTEIN; RISK	Medical diagnosis is considered an art regardless of all standardization efforts made, which is greatly due to the fact that medical diagnosis necessitates an expertise in coping with uncertainty simply not found in today's computing machinery. The researchers are encouraged by the advancement in computer technology to develop soft-ware to assist doctors in making decision without necessitating the direct consultation with the specialists. Comprehensibility is very significant for any machine learning technique to be used in computer-aided medical diagnosis. Since an artificial neural network ensemble is composed of multiple artificial neural networks, its comprehensibility is worse than that of a single artificial neural network. For medical problems, a reasonably high-quality solution could be given by the neural network algorithms. In this paper, application of artificial intelligence in typical disease Hepatitis B diagnosis has been investigated. In this research, an intelligent system based on logical inference along with a generalized regression neural network is presented for the diagnosis. An expert system based on logical inference is used to decide what type of hepatitis is possible to appear for a patient, whether it is Hepatitis B or not. Then artificial neural networks will be used in order to do the predictions regarding hepatitis B. The Generalized regression neural network is applied to hepatitis data for predictions regarding the Hepatitis B which gives severity level on the patient. Results obtained show that generalized regression neural network can be successfully used for diagnosing hepatitis B. The role of effective diagnosis and the advantages of data training on neural networks-based automatic medical diagnosis system are suggested by the outcomes.

In this paper, we present the first attempt to classify audio signals automatically according to their cultural styles, which are characterized by timbre, rhythm, wavelet coefficients and musicology-based features. Machine learning algorithms are employed to investigate the effectiveness of various features on a data set of 1300 music pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an overall accuracy of 86% for six cultural styles, which shows the feasibility of integrating cultural style classification into music retrieval systems.

There are two representative criterions for feature extraction, i.e. Fisher Criterion and Maximum Margin Criterion. In this paper, we propose a new criterion, called Regular Simplex Criterion. This criterion requires that samples from the same class are projected to the same point, while samples from different classes have unit distance. Under this criterion, we present a novel dimensionality reduction method, namely Linear Simplex Analysis (LSA). LSA is solved by multivariate linear regression with a specific definition of class indicator matrix which has a strong geometrical interpretation, i.e. each column of this matrix corresponds to a vertex of a regular simplex. Several variants of LSA, e.g. Regularized Simplex Analysis (RSA) and Kernel Simplex Analysis (KSA), are also proposed. Encouraging experimental results on UCI machine learning database indicate that the new criterion as well as the proposed methods are very effective.

SINGING VOICE DETECTION IN MUSIC TRACKS USING DIRECT VOICE VIBRATO DETECTION	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1- 8, PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	APR 19-24, 2009	Taipei, TAIWAN	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Singing voice detection; vibrato detection; voice segmentation; vibrato and tremolo parameters extraction; feature extraction		In this paper we investigate the problem of locating singing voice in music tracks. As opposed to most existing methods for this task, we rely on the extraction of the characteristics specific to singing voice. In our approach we suppose that the singing voice is characterized by harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo. In the present study we deal only with the vibrato and tremolo characteristics. For this, we first extract sinusoidal partials from the musical audio signal. The frequency modulation (vibrato) and amplitude modulation (tremolo) of each partial are then studied to determine if the partial corresponds to singing voice and hence the corresponding segment is supposed to contain singing voice. For this we estimate for each partial the rate (frequency of the modulations) and the extent (amplitude of modulation) of both vibrato and tremolo. A partial selection is then operated based on these values. A second criteria based on harmonicity is also introduced. Based on this, each segment can be labelled as singing or non-singing. Post-processing of the segmentation is then applied in order to remove short-duration segments. The proposed method is then evaluated on a large manually annotated test-set. The results of this evaluation are compared to the one obtained with a usual machine learning approach (MFCC and SFM modeling with GMM). The proposed method achieves very close results to the machine learning approach : 76.8% compared to 77.4% F-measure (frame classification). This result is very promising, since both approaches are orthogonal and can then be combined.

We focus on the regime where out of a large number of possible sounds, a small but unknown number are combined and overlapped to yield the observed signal. To infer which sounds are present, we attempt to decompose the observed signal as a linear combination of a small number of sources. To encourage sparse solutions with this property, we balance the modeling errors from individual sources against an l(1)-norm penalty of the type used in basis pursuit and regularized linear regression with grouped variables. Our approach can be viewed as a novel generalization of basis pursuit in two ways: first, with a dictionary of fixed size, we attempt to model acoustic waveforms of potentially variable duration; second, for dictionary entries, we do not store basis vectors representing static templates, but the coefficients of autoregressive models that characterize the acoustic variability of individual sources. We derive the required optimizations in this framework and present experimental results on combinations of periodic and aperiodic sources.

Earlier research have used side-information as pre-filter before visual analysis is performed, and we design a machine learning algorithm to model the join statistics of the content and the side information. Our algorithm, Diverse-Density Contextual Clustering (D(2)C(2)), starts by finding unique patterns for each sub-collection sharing the same side-info, e.g., scenes from winter. It then finds the common patterns that are shared among all subsets, e.g., persistent scenes across all seasons. These unique and common prototypes are found with Multiple Instance Learning and subsequent clustering steps. We evaluate D(2)C(2) on two web photo collections from Flickr and one news video collection from TRECVID. Results show that not only the visual patterns found by D(2)C(2) are intuitively salient across different seasons, locations and events, classifiers constructed from the unique and common patterns also outperform state-of-the-art bag-of-features classifiers.

For this purpose low level acoustic and visual features are extracted from audio and video capture devices. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used for the segmentation and classification of activity levels for each participant. Additionally, more semantic features are applied in a two-layer HMM approach. The experiments show that the acoustic feature is the most important one. The early fusion of acoustic and global-motion features achieves nearly as good results as the acoustic feature alone. All the other early fusion approaches are outperformed by the acoustic feature. More over, the two-layer model could not achieve the results of the acoustic features.

We show that a combination of an early metric learning method and a recent unsupervised dimensionality reduction method empirically outperforms previous methods. In our method, the Riemannian distance metric measures local change of class distributions, and the dimensionality reduction method makes a rigorous tradeoff between precision and recall in retrieving similar data points based on the reduced-dimensional display. The resulting supervised visualizations are good for finding (sets of) similar data samples that have similar class distributions.

Motivated by the bridge between compressed sensing and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma [2], this paper introduces a related application of SRMs regarding to realizing a fast and highly efficient embedding. In particular, it shows that a SRM is also a promising dimensionality reduction transform that preserves all pairwise distances of high dimensional vectors within an arbitrarily small factor E, provided that the projection dimension is on the order of O(epsilon(-2) log(3) N), where N denotes the number of d-dimensional vectors. In other words, SRM can be viewed as the suboptimal Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding that, however, owns very low computational complexity O(d log d) and highly efficient implementation that uses only O(d) random bits, making it a promising candidate for practical, large scale applications where efficiency and speed of computation are highly critical.

In this paper, we utilize several signal processing and machine learning techniques such as hierarchical clustering and support vector machines (SVM) to process multisensor acoustic emission (AE) data generated by the inception and propagation of cracks. We present preliminary laboratory results that explore the pairwise event correlation of A-E waveforms generated in the process of controlled crack propagation, and use these characteristics for clustering AE. By averaging the AE events within each cluster obtained from hierarchical clustering, we compute super-acoustics with higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) and use them in the second step of our analysis for calculating the time of arrival information (TOA) for crack localization. We utilize a SVM classifier to recognize the so called P-waves in the presence of noise by using features extracted from the frequency domain for accurate earliest arrival detection. Preliminary results show that our method has the potential to be a component of a structural health monitoring system based on acoustic emissions for instance for bridges.	[Ince, N.

Based on a few selected sensors, target tracking is performed distributively without any information about the observation model. Tracking under such conditions is possible if one exploits the information collected from extra inter-sensor RSSI measurements. The target tracking problem is formulated as a kernel matrix completion problem. A probabilistic kernel regression is then proposed that yields a Gaussian likelihood function. The likelihood is used to derive an efficient and accelerated. version of the variational filter without resorting to Monte Carlo integration. The proposed data-driven algorithm is, by construction, robust to observation model deviations and adapted to non-stationary environments.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular analysis technique used to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability. Although this technique is widely used in many applications, it suffers from overfilling when the number of training examples is on the same order as the dimension of the original data space. When overfilling occurs, the direction of the LDA solution can be dominated by low-energy noise and therefore the solution becomes non-robust to unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, energy-constrained discriminant analysis (ECDA), that overcomes the limitations of LDA by finding lower dimensional projections that maximize inter-class separability, while also preserving signal energy. Our results show that the proposed technique results in higher classification rates when compared to comparable methods. The results are given in terms of SAR image classification, however the algorithm is broadly applicable and can be generalized to any classification problem.

In this paper, we propose a systematic scheme to improve significantly the monotone approximation ability, of the subgradient projection, to the level set of a convex function. The proposed scheme is based on a simple observation: the level set of a convex function does not change by composing any zero-crossing monotonically increasing function. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in an application to a simple boosting problem.

In this paper, a new simple and efficient algorithm for solving this rank minimization problem with linear constraints is proposed. By using gradient projection method to optimize S while consecutively updating matrices U and V (where X = USV(T)) in combination with the use of an approximation function for l(0)-norm of singular values [1], our algorithm is shown to run significantly faster with much lower computational complexity than general-purpose interior-point solvers, for instance, the SeDuMi package [2].

We analyze tonal patterns as sparse target points (tonal F(0) peaks and valleys) and represent them in parametric form within the framework of a functional F(0) model. The relationships between the target points and underlying linguistic features are trained using classification and regression tree analysis (CARTs), and this functional model is used to trace the F(0) trajectories when training the CARTs and to synthesize a tonal pattern from the target points predicted by the CARTs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method has low F(0) prediction errors. Utilization of the F(0) ranges measured from training samples could significantly reduce the influences of differences in voice ranges on training a speaker-independent model. Furthermore, the most important roles in characterizing tonal patterns were played by a few linguistic features such as lexical tone context and the distinction between voiced from unvoiced initials.

In this paper, we improve by 7% the accuracy of comma prediction in English broadcast news by introducing syntactic features inspired by the role of commas as described in linguistics studies. We conduct an analysis of the impact of those features on other subsets of features (prosody, words...) when combined through CRFs. The syntactic cues can help characterizing large syntactic patterns such as appositions and lists which are not necessarily marked by prosody.

LEARNING THE BASIC UNITS IN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE USING DISCRIMINATIVE SEGMENTAL FEATURE SELECTION	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1- 8, PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	APR 19-24, 2009	Taipei, TAIWAN	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Machine Learning; American Sign Language; Feature Selection		The natural language for most deaf signers in the United States is American Sign Language (ASL). ASL has internal structure like spoken languages, and ASL linguists have introduced several phonemic models. The study of ASL phonemes is not only interesting to linguists, but also useful for scalability in recognition by machines. Since machine perception is different than human perception, this paper learns the basic units for ASL directly from data. Comparing with previous studies, our approach computes a set of data-driven Units (fenemes) discriminatively from the results of segmental feature selection. The learning iterates the following two steps: first apply discriminative feature selection segmentally to the signs, and then tie the most similar temporal segments to re-train. Intuitively, the sign parts indistinguishable to machines are merged to form basic units, which we call ASL fenemes. Experiments on publicly available ASL recognition data show that the extracted data-driven fenemes are meaningful, and recognition using those fenemes achieves improved accuracy at reduced model complexity.

In our QSAR task, we represent each molecule by a formal string representation (SMILES and Inch!), and utilize an NGN instance to associate each with a real-value that describes the degree of binding, inhibition or affinity a given molecule has with a target protein. We find that the NGN can on average outperform previous work in regression tasks, yielding performances of up to 0.79 (sd = 0.23) in predictive r-squared scores and up to 74.8 (sd = 1.63) percent concordance in classification tasks.

Two pairs of electrodes have been used along the arm, one for injecting the current, and one for sensing the voltage. After filtering, the frequency components and other signal features have been extracted using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to detect the breath-holding state. Frequency components and signal features of the parts of the signal that are detected to be representing the breathing state are then fed into another SVM model that extracts the respiratory rate and reduces the effect of motion artifacts. A similar method has been applied to the signal taken from end-tidal CO2 respiratory measurement device as the reference signal. This signal has been used as the ground truth for training of the SVM model and for validation of the method. The results are validated using 5-fold cross-validation method.

One method is to use the low-level electrical signals associated with forearm muscle movement, or electrogmyograms (EMGs). This paper describes an experiment in which supervised learning, or classification, was used to build a model that decides which of a set of hand gestures was made by a subject based on forearm EMGs. Several techniques were employed to optimize the process. A neurological study was consulted to optimize sensor placement. Several classification algorithms were tried and those with the highest accuracy used. Finally, ANOVA was used to reduce the number of features while maintaining classifier accuracy. The results showed accuracies exceeding 90%, even with a reduced feature set, and that supervised learning has promise as a technique to control a prosthetic hand.

Prompt and accurate medical treatment is therefore vital. Computer-aided decision-making systems can assist physicians in this task, but none of those proposed so far incorporate features extracted from medical images. The study in this paper uses demographic information, standard medical measurements, and features extracted from X-ray images to predict a patient's length of stay in ICU via rules extracted from decision trees generated by the CART algorithm. The X-ray features are extracted by using a spline/ASM segmentation technique to detect structure position, then calculating measures of displacement. The results are promising and compare well with SVM and C4.5 algorithms, indicating that the rules represent true data patterns. Significantly, an X-ray feature is selected as highly important to injury severity, indicating that medical image features are important in providing accurate recommendations and predictions.

Hadoop is an open-source implementaty of the MapReduce programming model. Hadoop is used by many companies including Yahoo!, Amazon, and Facebook to perform various data mining on large-scale data sets such as user search logs and visit logs. In these cases, it is very common to share the same computing resources by multiple users due to practical considerations about cost, system utilization, and manageability. However, Hadoop assumes that all cluster nodes are dedicated to a single user, failing to guarantee high performance in the shared MapReduce computation environment. In this paper, we propose two optimization schemes, prefetching and pre-shuffling, which improve the overall performance under the shared environment while retaining compatibility with the native Hadoop. The proposed schemes are implemented in the native Hadoop-0.18.3 as a plug-in component called HPMR (High Performance MapReduce Engine). Our evaluation on the Yahoo!Grid platform with three different workloads and seven types of test sets from Yahoo! shows that HPMR reduces the execution time by up to 73%.

The multihoming feature of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol is used to transfer user data parallel over several end-to-end paths. The work focuses on the selection of the actual best path, where the capacities of the present paths are not necessarily known in advance. The path selection is adapted in an autonomic and flexible way by a new network component, the so called intelligent network placed at the network layer. Using this adaptive mechanism it is possible to implement applications like long-distance medicine in mobile scenarios.

Mobility-Aware Routing Protocol For Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION WORKSHOPS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2009)	JUN 14-18, 2009	Dresden, GERMANY	IEEE		mobility aware; machine learning; mobile ad-hoc network; prediction		This paper introduces a novel mobility-aware routing protocol (MARP) for mobile, cognitive ad-hoc networks. Traditional routing protocols trigger the routing updates after the nodes detect the route failure. Even if the link condition is getting worse which means the link is likely to break in the future, the nodes will still transmit the packets along the current path. MARP uses cognitive techniques to predict when the link is likely to break so that it can inform the previous hop to trigger the routing updates before the link breaks. In this way, the nodes are aware of the physical topology changes. Based on simulation results, MARP can increase overall performance of the network significantly.

Cognitive radio (CR) technology can bring significant network improvements by providing awareness to the surrounding radio environment, exploiting previous network knowledge and optimizing the use of radio resources using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Cognitive radio can also co-exist with legacy equipment thus acting as a bridge among heterogenous communication systems. In this paper, we present a hybrid cognitive radio engine for 3G wireless networks. The engine is designed using case-based reasoning (CBR) and decision tree (DT) searches, as the main blocks to the engine's reasoning, learning and optimization functions. The engine model was implemented and tested via simulation, it was applied to improve coverage in the network.

Towards this end, we first investigate a Markov-based stochastic scheme for modeling and estimation of bandwidth and delay on heterogenous wireless networks. Borrowing clustering techniques from machine learning literature for intelligent state quantization, we demonstrate that the performance of the Markov model is enhanced significantly. We implement a measurement tool Zeus on smartphones and collect real-world data on 802.11g, 2.5G, and 36 wireless networks. The accuracy of the developed model is evaluated through simulation studies based on the collected data. Furthermore, a distributed rate-control scheme leveraging the predictions of our model is developed and observed to be much more efficient than a baseline additive-increase multiplicativedecrease scheme.

Performance of the traditional SVM algorithm is very sensitive to uncertainties. The noises in input space will cause uncertainties of the mapping in feature space. The traditional SVM algorithm may not be effective when uncertainty is large. A new probabilistic optimization is proposed to determine the decision boundary. The minimal distance is described probabilistically by its probability distribution function. Finally an artificial dataset and a real life dataset from UCI machine learning database are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSVM.

Several methods are used to cut down on the required simulation time. Typically, however, existing approaches fail to capture true program behaviour accurately and require a non-negligible number of training simulations to be run. We address these problems by developing a machine learning model that predicts the mean of any given metric, e.g. cycles or energy, across a range of programs, for any microarchitectural configuration. It works by combining only the most representative programs from the benchmark suite based on their behaviour in the design space under consideration. We use our model to predict the mean performance, energy, energy-delay (ED) and energy-delay-squared (EDD) of the SPEC CPU 2000 and MiBench benchmark suites within our design space. We achieve the same level of accuracy as two state-of-the-art prediction techniques but require five times fewer training simulations. Furthermore, our technique is scalable and we show that, asymptotically, it requires an order of magnitude fewer simulations than these existing approaches.

The transcoding results reported in the literature are based on a reference implementation and may not reflect the true performance gains obtained in real world systems. We have developed low complexity transcoding algorithms and have implemented these solutions using highly optimized encoder and decoder implementations available from Intel. The transcoding algorithms are based on exploiting the mode decision knowledge inherent in the decoded MPEG-2 data. Machine learning techniques are used to make accurate and low-complexity H.264 MB encoding mode decisions. The results show that the proposed transcoder reduces the complexity by 50% without a significant loss in PSNR. This performance improvement in production quality transcoders, and demonstrates the practicality of machine learning based video transcoding algorithms.

During mammography screening, radiologists use a strict lexicon (BI-RADS) to describe and report their findings. Mammography records are then stored in a well-defined database format (NMD). Lately, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these databases. They successfully built breast cancer classifiers that can help in early detection of malignancy. However, the validity of these models depends on the quality of the underlying databases. Unfortunately, most databases suffer from inconsistencies, missing data, inter-observer variability and inappropriate term usage. In addition, many databases are not compliant with the NMD format and/or solely consist of text reports. BI-RADS feature extraction from free text and consistency checks between recorded predictive variables and text reports are crucial to addressing this problem. We describe a general scheme for concept information retrieval from free text given a lexicon, and present a BI-RADS features extraction algorithm for clinical data mining. It consists of a syntax analyzer, a concept finder and a negation detector. The syntax analyzer preprocesses the input into individual sentences. The concept finder uses a semantic grammar based on the BI-RADS lexicon and the experts' input. It parses sentences detecting BI-RADS concepts. Once a concept is located, a lexical scanner checks for negation. Our method can handle multiple latent concepts within the text, filtering out ultrasound concepts. On our dataset, our algorithm achieves 97.7% precision, 95.5% recall and an F(1)-score of 0.97. It outperforms manual feature extraction at the 5% statistical significance level.

Bautext requires a small amount of seed words as supervised data and uses a bootstrapping mechanism to progressively collect new member for each category Learning new category, members and the category-specific terms for each category at the same time is the unique and featured classification mechanism of Bautext. Category-specific terms are terms that play important roles for properly extracting new category members. Furthermore, we proposed to use an additional Trash category to filter non-purpose aspects, thus led to a significant improvement in precision score but could constrain the trade-off in decreasing recall score. Experimental results, conducted on a Japanese hotel review dataset, showed that Bautext outperforms the alternative techniques in all terms of precision, recall score and significantly in running time. And in the further comparison to Adaboost (as the state-of-the-art machine learning technique for semantic term classification task), we found that Adaboost require about 50% training data to deliver a similar performance as Bautext does with less than ten selective seed words for each category.

A number of methods have been developed for CRF training. However, even with state-of-the-art algorithms, the training of CRF is still very time and space consuming. This make it infeasible to use CRFs in large-scale data analysis tasks. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm, HOCT, for CRF training on modern computer architectures. First, software prefetching techniques are utilized to hide cache miss latency. Second, we exploit SIMD to process data in parallel. Third, when dealing with large data sets, we let HOCT instead of operating system to manage swapping operations. Our experiments on various real data sets show that HOCT yields a fourfold speedup when the data can fit in memory, and over a 30-fold speedup when the memory requirement exceeds the physical memory.

It differs from the classical supervised learning setting in that, training samples are packed into bags with only the aggregate outputs (labels for classification or real values for regression) provided. This problem is associated with several kinds of application background. We focus on the aggregate outputs classification problem in this paper, and set up a framework based on kernel K-means to solve it. Two concrete algorithms based on our framework are proposed, each of which can cope with both binary and multi-class scenarios. The experimental results suggest that our algorithms outperform the state-of-art technique. Also, we propose a new setting for patch extraction in the Content Based Image Retrieval procedure by using the algorithm.

Its main objective is to transfer knowledge across domains, tasks and distributions that are similar but not the same. Currently, almost all of the transfer learning methods are designed to deal with the traditional single instance learning problems. However, in many real-world applications, such as drug design, Localized Content Based Image Retrieval (LCBIR), Text Categorization, we have to deal with multiple instance problems, where training patterns are given as bags and each bag consists of some instances.

B	Boongoen, T; Shen, Q			IEEE	Boongoen, Tossapon; Shen, Qiang			Semi-Supervised OWA Aggregation for Link-Based Similarity Evaluation and Alias Detection	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	AUG 20-24, 2009	Jeju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE			DECISION-MAKING; OPERATORS	Within the past decades, many fuzzy aggregation techniques, ordered weighted averaging (OWA) in particular, have proven effective for a wide range of information processing tasks, such as decision making, image analysis, database and machine learning. Despite reported successes, their potentials have yet to be explored for the emerging problem of link analysis, which aims to discover similarity and relations amongst objects through their associations. Recently, several link-based similarity methods have been put forward to identifying similar objects in the Internet and publication domains. However, these techniques only take into account the cardinality property of a link structure that is highly sensitive to noise and causes a great number of false positives. In light of such challenge, this paper presents a novel OWA aggregation model that is capable of efficiently deriving a similarity measure through the integration of multiple link properties. The underlying approach is based on the methodology of stress function by which the aggregation behavior can be easily interpreted and modeled. In addition, a semi-supervised method is introduced to assist a user in designing a stress function, i.e. the weighting scheme of link properties, appropriate for a particular link network. The application of the OWA aggregation approach to alias detection is demonstrated and evaluated, against state-of-art link-based techniques, over datasets specifically related to terrorism, publication and email domains.

CpG islands play a fundamental role in genome analysis and annotation and contribute to increase the accuracy of promoter prediction. Recently, some approaches rely on large parameter space algorithms of predicting the CpG islands have been proposed in the literature. The goal of our proposed method was that using the evolutionary algorithms with fuzzy system and machine learning to identify CpG islands. A fuzzy expert system was implemented to dynamically adapt the crossover rate and mutation rate in GA for identify significant of CpG islands in human genome, and reinforcement learning sever as extend operation for combined the best subset of islands. In this study, three public tools for identification CpG islands were used to compare with FGA-CGI for the assessment of five prediction performance and statistically analysis. Experimental results reveal that our method can adjust the two variables to escape local optimal by fuzzy system and identify more number of CpG islands. In addition, FGA-CGI had capable of higher performance and precisely predicting statistically significant CpG islands in target sequences than these previous tools.

The human cerebellum is a vital part of the brain system that possesses the capability to accurately model highly nonlinear physical dynamics. We can exploit our increasing knowledge of the human cerebellum to construct an intelligent computational model to effectively handle the complexity of nonlinear dynamic systems in the real world. This paper presents a novel brain-inspired computational model of the human cerebellum named the kernel density-based CMAC with Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference model (KCMAC-TSK) for fast and accurate nonlinear system identification. The structure of the KCMAC-TSK model is inspired by the neurophysiological aspects of cerebellar learning and development process. By incorporating a fuzzy model in KCMAC-TSK using kernel density estimation, we enhance the modeling capability, accuracy, and interpretability of the system. We applied the proposed KCMAC-TSK model in a challenging highway traffic flow modeling and prediction problem. Experimental results showed that KCMAC-TSK outperformed current modeling techniques, demonstrating the learning accuracy and effectiveness of KCMAC-TSK in handling complex nonlinear dynamic real-world systems.

This research area is often referred to as multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems where EMO algorithms are used to search for a number of non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems with respect to their accuracy and interpretability. The main advantage of the use of EMO algorithms for fuzzy system design over single-objective optimizers is that multiple alternative fuzzy rule-based systems with different accuracy-interpretability tradeoffs are obtained by their single run. The decision maker can choose a single fuzzy rule-based system according to their preference. There still exist several important issues to be discussed in this research area such as the definition of interpretability, the formulation of interpretability measures, the visualization of tradeoff relations, and the interpretability of the explanation of fuzzy reasoning results. In this paper, we discuss the ability of EMO algorithms as multiobjective optimizers to search for Pareto optimal or near Pareto optimal fuzzy rule-based systems. More specifically, we examine whether EMO algorithms can find non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems that approximate the entire Pareto fronts of multiobjective fuzzy system design problems.

In recent years, the development of high-throughput technologies has provided the scientific community with exciting new opportunities for systematically studying biological networks on a whole-genome scale. One of the great challenges currently confronting scientists in systems biology research is how to computationally model and elucidate the function and the mechanisms of the complex biological networks from these high-throughput biological data sets. In this talk, I will discuss some machine learning methods recently developed in my group for uncovering genes involved in the same pathways and for predicting protein-protein interactions and protein functions.

A typical application is to discover communities of joint interests in social network, such as Facebook and Twitter. The network can be simply modeled as a graph in which the nodes are the people while the links show relationship between the people. There may exist many relationships between a pair of nodes, such as classmates, collaborators, playmates and so on. it is important to consider how to use these graphs together rather than a single graph if we want to understand the network and their participants effectively. Motivated by the fact, we present a clustering algorithm using spectral analysis in which multiple graphs are considered to get the clusters. Our study can also be considered as an instance of multi-views learning. The experimental results on UCI data set and Corel image data demonstrate the promising results that validate our proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we give out a novel definition of Granular Computing which can be easily treated by neural network. Perception learning as granular computing tries to study the machine learning from perception information sampling to dimensional reduction and samples classification in a granular way, and can be summaries as two kind approaches: (1) covering learning, (2) svm kind learning. We proved that although there are tremendous algorithms for dimensional reduction and information transformation, their ability can't transcend wavelet kind nested layered granular computing which are very easy for neural network processing.

Related works reported that efficiency and availability depend heavily on high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the intelligent fault detection system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Machine learning techniques are at the core of such intelligent systems and can greatly influence their performance. Applying these techniques to fault detection makes it possible to shorten shutdown maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment. Therefore, this work applies Back-propagation Neural Networks (BPN) to analyze the failures of turbines in thermal power facilities. Finally, a real case from a thermal power plant is provided to evaluate the effectiveness.

Despite all attempts carried out so far in both academia and industry, real world applications are far remote. The purpose of this paper is to modify and adopt a recently developed modeling paradigm for System of Systems and then employ it to model a generic Baggage Handling System of an airport complex. In a top-down design approach, we start modeling process by definition of some modeling goals that guide us in selection of some High Level Attributes. Then Functional Attributes are defined which act as ties between High Level Attributes (the first level of abstraction) and low level metrics/measurements. Since the most challenging issues in developing models for System of Systems are identification and representation of dependencies amongst constituent entities, a machine learning technique is adopted for addressing these issues.

We discuss the role of soil texture classification within our multi-agent irrigation control system and then conduct a preliminary experiment with soil water retention data from the UNSODA database. The system is evaluated with respect to six classifiers. A maximum classification rate of 85.11% was achieved with a MLP neural network, although performance was relatively consistent across all classifiers.			daniel.v.smith@csiro.au; w.peng@rmit.edu.au	Smith, Daniel/B-3664-2011				Asquith G.B, 1982, BASIC WELL LOG ANAL; Bhattacharya B, 2006, NEURAL NETWORKS, V19, P186, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2006.01.005; Chang DH, 2003, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V41, P664, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2003.809935; ENDSLEY MR, 1995, HUM FACTORS, V37, P32, DOI 10.1518/001872095779049543; FAYAD U, 1992, MACH LEARN, V8, P87; Hall D.

SVM is powerful for the problem with small samples, non linear and high dimension. A multi-class SVM classifier is applied to predict the coal and gas outburst in the paper. In this model, the dominant factors are the input vectors and the degree of outburst danger is divided into four types: heavy outburst, common outburst, outburst warning and no existing outburst. Through a special data dealing process, the multi-class SVM classifier, trained with the sampling data, identifies out the four types of coal and gas outburst states. An empirical analysis shows that some perfect computing conclusions have been acquired by the proposed model.

To deal with the hybrid information systems which including the numerical attributes and the missing value attributes, a generalized incomplete rough set model is proposed based on neighborhood relations. The model approximates an arbitrary subset in the universe with neighborhood granules, and the generalized neighborhood relations are the generalization of the asymmetry similarity relations and the tolerance relations. It overcomes the shortcoming that the classical rough set can not deal with numerical attributes directly and can deal with the generalized incomplete system which has the missing values both include the lost and the unrelated. The discrimination methods of the missing value and a hybrid reduction algorithm are proposed also. The discrimination methods of the lost or the unrelated conditions are proposed based on the assumption of the consistency classification, and the influence of the noise samples and the neighborhood values to the classification accuracy is presented as well. The validity and feasibility of the reduction algorithm are demonstrated by the results of experiments on five UCI machine learning databases.

In order to analyze the acoustic emission signals emitted by polluted insulator discharge effectively and estimate the contamination discharge status on the insulator surface rightly, the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is produced, which is a new machine learning tool. By using LS-SVM, the assessment model of insulator surface contamination is built. In the assessment model, the multiple variables come from the acoustic emission signals are chosen as the input variables and then the degree of contamination as the output variable. And the feasibility of model is proved by some data in the laboratory simulation. Simulation results show that the LS-SVM classifiers are capable of learning quite well from the raw data samples while processing good classification and generalization ability. The assessment model can meet the actual need of insulator surface contamination automation monitoring.

This system tries to be robust by using techniques for coping with noise and hard environment characteristics, specially changing lighting conditions. This system has to be run with a processor with low processing resources and therefore it has to be simple and efficient. The vision system uses the 8 colour filters that are hardware already implemented in the robots. These filters can be easily established and they are used to carry out the recognition of the relevant elements in the given scenario. The final goal of the proposed adaptive vision is to improve the performance of well-known self-localization algorithms.

A breath gas sensing system is designed by using a quartz crystal resonator with a plasma-polymer film as a sensor. For computational experiment of emotion recognition, the machine learning-based approach, such as artificial neural network and support vector machine, is investigated. In emotion recognition experiments by using gathered breath gas data under psychological experiments, the obtained average emotion recognition rate is 70% for two emotions: relaxation / comfortableness (positive emotion) and stress / displeasure (negative emotion). Experimental results show that using breath gas information is feasible and the neural network or support vector machine is suited for this task.

However, the capacity limitation of corporate knowledge bases prevents online support centers from effectively resolving user problems. In addition, traditional textual search techniques employed by most online support centers fall short from accurately interpreting user queries due to the ambiguity of user requests and the heterogeneity of technical problems. In this paper, we present SolutionFinder, an autonomous framework, which dynamically integrates online resources to enrich the knowledge base for IT support systems. SolutionFinder provides context-aware search support to remove the textual ambiguity embedded in user queries. Furthermore, SolutionFinder transforms solution documents into solution paths to analyze their similarity to provide high-quality solution recommendations. Evaluation results suggest by leveraging our proposed algorithms, a support service can accurately locate Web solution resources and provide high-quality services.

How to detect network intrusions effectively becomes an important techniques. This paper presents a novel fuzzy class association rule mining method based on Genetic Network Programming(GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as genes instead of strings(Genetic Algorithm) or trees(Genetic Programming), leading to creating compact programs and implicitly memorizing past action sequences. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database which contains both discrete and continuous attributes. And it can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in Network Intrusion Detection Problem. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DAPRA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides a competitively high detection rate compared with other machine learning techniques.

In real-world Systems, a human is the ultimate determinant of relevance and must be integrated symbiotically into the control structures. We report on a hybrid, Human-Assisted Computer Classification system that opportunistically pairs processes of Active Learning and User Modeling to produce a high-Q computational engine. Top-down human goals are impedance-matched with bottom-up corpus analysis utilizing critical control loops. The System contributions of humans and machines as 'Proxy,' Assessor,' and `Classifier' elements are blended through inter-related 'Model,' Match,' and `Measure' processes (M(3)) to achieve consistently high precision IR with high recall. We report results for over a dozen topics, with confirmation of internal measures from topic 103 of the 2008 TREC legal track's interactive task.

In this model, a network enhances its state by itself, and this enhanced state is to be imitated by another state of the network. We set up an enhanced and a relaxed state, and the relaxed state tries to imitate the enhanced state as much as possible by minimizing the free energy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we apply information enhancement learning to the SOM. For this purpose, we introduce collectiveness, in which all neurons collectively respond to input patterns, into an enhanced state. Then, this enhanced and collective state should be imitated by the other non-enhanced and relaxed state. We applied the method to an artificial data and three data from the well-known machine learning database. Experimental results showed that the U-matrices obtained were significantly similar to those produced by the conventional SOM. However, better performance could be obtained in terms of quantitative and topological errors. The experimental results suggest the possibility for self-supervised learning to be applied to many different neural network models.

The candidates of REF Network structures are encoded into particles in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). These particles evolve toward Pareto-optimal front defined by several objective functions with model accuracy and complexity. The problem of unsupervised and supervised learning is discussed with Adaptive Multi-Objective PSO (AMOPSO). This study suggests an approach of REF Network training through simultaneous optimization of architectures and weights with Adaptive PSO-based multi-objective algorithm. Our goal is to determine whether Adaptive Multi-objective PSO can train REF Networks, and the performance is validated on accuracy and complexity. The experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets obtained from the machine learning repository. The results show that our proposed method provides an effective means for training REF Networks that is competitive with PSO-based multi-objective algorithm.

We investigate and adopt linear projection techniques such as Locality Preserving Projections (LPP), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which are more widespread in face recognition and other pattern recognition tasks. We analyze the relations between LPP and LDA and show experimentally that using LPP in a supervised manner effectively yields very similar results as LDA, implying that LPP may be regarded as a generalization of LDA. Features for offline training and online classification are created by adopting common image processing techniques such as background-subtraction and blob detection to the time-of-flight data.

Compared with single model fully connected neural networks, NNTrees are more suitable for structural learning, and faster for decision making. To increase the realizability of the NNTrees, we have tried to induce more compact NNTrees through dimensionality reduction. So far, we have used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and confirmed that in most cases the LDA based approach can result in very compact NNTrees without degrading the performance. One drawback in using the LDA based approach is that the cost for finding the transformation matrix can be very high for large databases. To solve this problem, in this paper we investigate the efficiency and efficacy of two centroid based approaches for NNTree induction. One is to map each datum directly to the class centroids; and the other is to find the least square error approximation of each datum using the centroids. Experimental results show that both approaches, although simple, are comparable to the LDA based approach in most cases.

The analysis uses the actual stock market data, collected on a weekly basis in a common time-series interval for the active and dead companies in each of the three sectors. The basic idea is to apply the concept of Fisher kernels and visualization to reduce the data from a time-series format to two-dimensional plots that can be visually inspected and potentially segregate the 'collapse' class from the 'survival' one. From our experiments we observe that our method fits well for the Technology and Banking sectors, but is not able to provide a visually clear classification for the Pharmaceuticals sector. Depending on the range of data we use as input, and its distribution, the classification pattern varies from an ideally separable case to a non separable one, in a two dimensional feature space.

Based on real questions collected from on-line question answering communities, this paper proposes a three-level question type taxonomy to model user information need. The three levels are based on interrogative patterns, hidden user intentions and specific answer expectations. One question can have multiple types in level 2&3. Question type assignment of level 2&3 is subjective-orientated, and may vary between different users. Shallow lexical, syntactic and semantic features are used to model the inherent subjectivity of user intentions. Classification experiments are conducted on a corpus of real questions collected from the web. Different machine learning methods are employed. Experimental results are promising. This indicates the capability of modeling user information need and subjectivity statistically, and that strong correlations exist between question types of the same level.

An Adaptive Ant-Based Clustering Algorithm with Improved Environment Perception	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2009), VOLS 1-9	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	OCT 11-14, 2009	San Antonio, TX	IEEE		Adaptive Ant Colony; Swarm Intelligence; Clustering; Optimization		Data clustering plays an important role in many disciplines, including data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and other fields. When there is a need to learn the inherent grouping structure of data in an unsupervised manner, ant-based clustering stand out as the most widely used group of swarm-based clustering algorithms. Under this perspective, this paper presents a new Adaptive Ant-based Clustering Algorithm (AACA) for clustering data sets. The algorithm takes into account the properties of aggregation pheromone and perception of the environment together with other modifications to the standard parameters that improves its convergence. The performance of AACA is studied and compared to other methods using various patterns and data sets. It is also compared to standard clustering using a set of analytical evaluation functions and a range of synthetic and real data collection. Experimental results have shown that the proposed modifications improve the performance of ant-colony clustering algorithm in term of quality and run time.

Further, the supervised model strongly depends on the huge training data. Active learning is a different way rather than relying on a large amount random sampling. However, random sampling constructively participates in the optimal choosing training examples. Based on different query strategies, active learning can combine with other machine learning methods to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining the accuracy. This paper proposes a new active learning strategy based on Information Density (ID) integrated with CRFs for Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER). On Sighan bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER corpus, an F1 score of 77.2% is achieved by using only 10,000 labeled training sentences chosen by the proposed active learning strategy.

It is to rapidly analyze and identify the abnormal events among the extreme volume data. Using correlation graph representation to correlate the events generated by sensor networks is capable to find the intentional dependency behavior's insight for detecting home sensor network abnormal events. In this study, we proposed an anomaly detection mechanism based on correlation graphs of sensor networks for rapidly identifying abnormal home events. The proposed mechanism which makes the following contributions: (a) it is automatically identify the abnormal event under home sensor network environment (b) it eliminates irrelevant events for saving the computation power (c) it is easily to apply on different machine learning classifiers for enhancement. The evaluation from Intel Berkeley Research lab sensor network data set. The proposed mechanism performs well in sensor events elimination and abnormal event detection.

Design of a Modified One-Against-All SVM Classifier	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2009), VOLS 1-9	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	OCT 11-14, 2009	San Antonio, TX	IEEE		SVM; Support Vectors; OAA; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition; Isolated Digit Recognition	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RECOGNITION	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the state of-the-art tools for linear and nonlinear pattern classification. One of the design issues in SVM classifier is reducing the number of support vectors without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel technique which requires only a subset of the support vectors is proposed. The subset is obtained by including only those support vectors for which Lagrange multiplier is greater than a threshold. In order to find the subset which yields the highest classification accuracy with the least number of support vectors in the subset, the recognition performance corresponding to subsets with different threshold values are to be evaluated and compared. The proposed technique is applied for SVM based isolated digit recognition system and is studied using speaker dependent as well as multispeaker dependent TI46 database of isolated digits. Two feature extraction techniques, one using LPC and another using MFCC are applied to the speech from the above database and the features are mapped using SOFM. This in turn is used by the SVM classifier to evaluate the recognition accuracy. The proposed technique is applied to One-Against-All (OAA) scheme and is denoted as Modified One-Against-All (M-OAA) approach in this paper. Based on this study, it is found that for MFCC feature input, the proposed M-OAA based SVM classifier approach results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.86 to 18.3 with no compromise in recognition accuracy. For LPC feature input, the M-OAA based SVM classifier results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.59 to 2.52 without any compromise in recognition accuracy for some cases and with a maximum of 1% degradation in recognition accuracy for some cases. The proposed approach is also applicable for other schemes such as Half-Against-Half (HAH) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) based SVM classifiers as well as for any other classification problem such as face recognition, fingerprint recognition, target recognition, speaker recognition and speaker verification.			jmanikandan.nitt@gmail.com; bvenki@nitt.edu					BENGOLD, 2000, SPEECH AUDIO SIGNAL; Burges C.

So this paper proposes the multi-agent based distributed energy system, which incorporates traditional central power plant and different DER by using Multi-agent system (MAS) technology. A new three layered MAS architecture with good generality is designed, which can be used in small, medium and large scale multi-agent based distributed energy system (MAS-DES). The cluster and super cluster are defined to work as virtual power plants in the medium and large scale case. It also presents the novel architecture for single agent system with learning ability. Moreover, the reliability of Multi-agent system is assessed by Bayesian Statistics. The proposed MAS-DES uses the traditional and renewable resources in a more reasonable way and provides a better solution for the power supply considering the cost, pollution index and reliability.

However, there exists much harmful information on the internet, such as pornographic content and prohibited drugs' information. Thus, how to filter harmful web pages on the internet is quite an important issue. In general, the problem of harmful web page filtering is converted to that of web page classification, which needs plenty of well labeled training samples. However, the cost of labeling a large set of web pages is very expensive. To address this problem, we adopt a semi-supervised framework for web page filtering. In this framework, each web page is represented by bags of different features, extracted using its HTML structure. Then a semi-supervised learning strategy is taken for efficiently obtaining well labeled training samples. Finally, a boosting classifier is utilized for harmful web page filtering. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework.

Each agent of MP-Draughts is a neural network which learns almost without human supervision (distinctly from the world champion agent Chinook). MP-Draughts issues from a continuous activity of research whose previous product was the efficient agent VisionDraughts.Despite its good general performance, VisionDraughts frequently does not succeed in final phases of a game, even being in advantageous situation compared to its opponent (for instance, getting into endgame loops). In order to try to reduce this misbehavior of the agent during endgames, MP-Draughts counts on 25 agents specialized for endgame phases, each one trained such as to be able to deal with a determined cluster of endgame board-states. These 25 clusters are mined by a Kohonen Network from a Data Base containing a large quantity of endgame board-states. After trained, MP-Draughts operates in the following way: first, VisionDraughts is used as IIGA; next, the endgame agent that represents the cluster which better fits the current endgame board-state will replace it up to the end of the game. This paper shows that such a strategy significantly improves the general performance of the player agents.

Data with large amount of attributes usually cause a system freezes or shuts down. The proposed method combines large amount attributes to smaller number ones by the way of Boolean method. Three data sets are used to compare the learning accuracies and efficiencies by Bayesian networks (BN), C4.5 decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy neural network (FNN, neuro-fuzzy), and Megafuzzification learning methods. Results indicate that the proposed BC method can improve the efficiency of machine learning and the accuracy is not worse.

Our first and foremost objective is to study the feasibility of the practical use of an intelligent prediction system exclusively based on the history of daily stock closing prices and volumes. To this end we propose a technique that consists of a combination of a nearest neighbor classifier and some well known tools of technical analysis, namely, stop loss, stop gain and RSI filter. For assessing the potential use of the proposed method in practice we compared the results obtained to the results that would be obtained by adopting a buy-and-hold strategy. The key performance measure in this comparison was profitability. The proposed method was shown to generate considerable higher profits than buy-and-hold for most of the companies, with few buy operations generated and, consequently, minimizing the risk of market exposure.

Color stereo vision is mostly used for UGVs, but the present stereo vision technologies and processing algorithms are limited by cameras' field of view and maximum range, which causes the vehicles to get caught in cul-de-sacs that could possibly be avoided if the vehicle had access to information or could make inferences about the terrain well beyond the range of the vision system. The philosophy underlying the proposed strategy in this paper is to use the near-field stereo information associated with the terrain appearance to train a classifier to classify the far-field terrain well beyond the stereo range for each incoming image. To date, strategies based on this concept are limited to using single model construction and classification per frame. Although this single-model-per-frame approach can adapt to the changing environments concurrently, it lacks memory or history of past information. The approach described in this study is to use an online, self-supervised learning algorithm that exploits multiple frames to develop adaptive models that can classify different terrains the robot traverses. Preliminary but promising results of the paradigm proposed is presented using real data sets from the DARPA-LAGR project, which is the current gold standard for vision-based terrain classification using machine-learning techniques.

The traditional tensor representation only includes the intensity values, which is sensitive to illumination variation. For this purpose, a weighted tensor subspace (WTS) is defined as object descriptor by combining the Retinex image with the original image. Then, an incremental learning algorithm is developed for WTS to adapt to the appearance change during the tracking. The proposed method could learn the lightness changing incrementally and get robust tracking performance under various luminance conditions. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual tracking Scheme.

In this paper, a three-layer hierarchy multi-classifier intrusion detection architecture is proposed to promote the overall detection accuracy. For making every individual classifier is independent from others, each uses a diverse soft computing technique as well as different feature subset. In addition, the performances of a variety of combination methods that fuse the outputs from classifiers are studied. In the experiments, DARPA KDD99 intrusion detection data set is chosen as the evaluation tools. The results show that our approach achieves a better performance than that of a single classifier.

AMP is a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training algorithm inspired on the biological metaplasticity property of neurons and Shannon's information theory. During training phase, AMP training algorithm gives more relevance to less frequent patterns and subtracts relevance to the frequent ones, claiming to achieve a much more efficient training, while at least maintaining the MLP performance. AMP is specially recommended when few patterns are available to train the network. We implement an Artificial Metaplasticity MLP (AMMLP) on standard and well-used databases for Machine Learning. Experimental results show the superiority of AMMLPs when compared with recent results on the same databases.

The issue is related to the stability of an EMG-based prosthesis control. Traditional EMG recognition systems receive EMG patterns and send them into classifiers directly, which generally results in unstable situations if the classes of some of the input EMG patterns are not included in the training of the classifiers. The EMG patterns whose class labels are not defined in the training phase are called non-target patterns. There should be a filter and this filter should be able to reject all non-target EMG patterns. As such, only target EMG patterns are fed into classifier, thus achieving a high-accuracy EMG classification. To this end, we propose in this paper a one-class classification-based non-target EMG pattern filtering scheme. By introducing a novel one-class classifier, called support vector data description (SVDD), into the filtering scheme, the goal mentioned above can easily be achieved. SVDD is a powerful machine learning technique. It can be built on a single class and find a flexible boundary to enclose the target class by using the so-called kernel trick. In experiments, we will show that if the filtering scheme is not performed, the traditional EMG classification system suffers from unstable situations. Contrarily, the whole classification system will achieve satisfactory and stable performance no matter what the input EMG patterns are target or non-target ones, if the proposed filtering scheme is embedded.

In this paper, we develop an automated Chinese female facial beauty classification system through the application of machine learning algorithm of SVM (Support Vector Machine). We present a simple but effective feature extraction for facial beauty classification. 17 geometric features are designed to abstractly represent each facial image. The experiment is based on 510 facial images, high accuracy of 95.3% is obtained for 2-level classification (beautiful or not), but the accuracy of 4-level classification is 77.9% by SVM. The results clearly show that the notion of beauty perceived by human can also be learned by machine through the employment of supervised learning techniques. Furthermore, the finding of big gap between the accuracy of 2-level classification and 4-level classification is interesting and surprising: the high accuracy naturally leads to the conclusion that there indeed exists simplicity and objectiveness underlying the judgment of aesthetical ideal facial attractiveness; In contrast, the relatively low accuracy for 4-level classification indicates that the presented simple feature vectors is not sufficient for the classification of other levels of facial attractiveness.

Due to the fact that a web page can be associated with multiple tags, previous research on tag recommendation mainly focuses on improving its accuracy or efficiency through multi-label learning algorithms. However, as a web page can also be split into multiple sections and be represented as a bag of instances, multi-instance multi-label learning framework should fit this problem better. In this paper, we improve the performance of tag suggestion by using multi-instance multi-label learning. Each web page is divided into a bag of instances. The experiments on real-word data from Del.icio.us suggest that our framework has better performance than traditional multi-label learning methods on the task of tag recommendation.

Previous research mainly exploits visual information between images while rarely uses the text information surrounding the images on the Web pages. In this paper, we consider the relevance feedback as a machine learning problem. We proposed a novel relevance feedback framework for Web image search, which exploit both text and image modalities information with semi-supervised learning techniques. In each round of relevance feedbacks, the framework trains two classifiers for the two modalities by using the feedback information collected from the user. Then, it uses the unlabeled search result to improve these two classifiers. Finally, the ranked results list produced by image and text modality classifiers are combined to get the final rank. Experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed framework.

Building on our initial work in [11], we adopt logic-based as well as text similarity, service selection for model references and add a structural approach from [14], which operates on the pure syntactic description of WSDL elements. The integration of these matching variants is accomplished using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with non-linear kernel, thus automatically adapting an aggregation function based on previously experienced training data. Results of our performance evaluation based on the standard measures recall and precision over the SAWSDL-TC1 test collection as well as an exhaustive example for all basic matching variants are also given.

Our aim is to achieve the classification performance of the nonlinear support vector machines (SVM) by using only the support vectors of the linear SVM. The proposed method does not require any type of kernels, and requires less computation time compared to the nonlinear SVM The SVSA algorithm has two steps. selection and adaptation. In the first step, some of the support vectors obtained from linear SVM are selected. Then the selected support vectors are adapted iteratively in the traning algorithm. The proposed method are compared against the linear and nonlinear SVM on sythetic and real remote sensing data.

This study is important because we processed the ALOS Palsar mosaic, which is made freely available within K&C initiatives project and will be updated regularly We first used 38 sample plots collected on the ground during dry season in September 2004, to develop a tree diameter (dbh) - biomass model. The HH, HV, HV/HH and HH-HV backscatters of ALOS Palsar data allowed the empirical estimation of forest above ground biomass (AGB). Each band of Palsar data was separately used to estimate the biomass, and we found HV band resulted in better correlation with the AGB compared to other SAR bands. Validation of the prediction results was carried out by comparing the biomass estimates with those predicted from an existing allometric equation. Optical data are sensitive to the physical properties of the reflectors whereas SAR data are more influenced by the geometric properties of the scatterers Therefore, the second part of this study concerned the integration of mosaic SAR textures and ETM data for land cover classification. The classification was conducted using ETM data and variations of ETM, SAR bands, and SAR textures calculated using GLC Matrix. The image classifications were carried out using a Machine Learning based classifier, so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a conventional Maximum Likelihood method. An ensemble of neural networks method using Kalman Filter and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm was applied. The classification accuracy was assessed using confusion matrices and Kappa Statistics We show that the Introduction of SAR textures significantly enhanced the classification accuracies. This study showed that the joint processing of SAR and multispectral data increased the accuracies of biomass estimation and landuse classifications. The efficiency of the method at medium spatial resolutions allows its application of global datasets.

The proposed method exploits a query function for the inclusion of batches of unlabeled samples in the training set, which is based on the evaluation of two criteria: uncertainty and diversity. This query function adopts a stochastic approach to the selection of unlabeled samples, which is based on a function of uncertainty estimated from the distribution of errors on the validation set (which is assumed available for the model selection of the SVM classifier) Experimental results carried out on a very high resolution image confirm the effectiveness of the proposed active learning technique, which results more accurate than standard methods.

SENSOR WEB AND DATA MINING APPROACHES FOR HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM DETECTION AND MONITORING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 12-17, 2009	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	IEEE		Harmful algal bloom; machine learning; support vector machines; K.brevis; Gulf of Mexico	KARENIA-BREVIS; OCEAN; WATERS	Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) pose an enormous threat to the U.S. marine habitation and economy in the coastal waters. Federal and state coastal administrators have been working in devising a state-of-the-art monitoring and forecasting system for these HAB events. These modernized HAB systems provide useful and forewarning information to a varied user community. However, the lack of standardization in the data exchange mechanism with the current available systems causes an impediment to the wide area coastal observation and management. Hence, there is a need for the system to adapt the services oriented architecture and the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) sensor web enablement framework. We propose a HAB monitoring system by adopting the standardized OGC sensor web and using machine learning approaches for the detection of HAB events in the region of Gulf of Mexico Various feature extraction techniques have been used in obtaining features of both HAB and Non-HAB data. Kernel based Support vector machines have been used as a classifier in the detection of HAB's. The performance of this approach is analyzed by accuracy measures like Kappa Coefficient, N-fold cross validation average and Confusion Matrix on a considerable test data.

We propose combining machine learning techniques and hybrid image statistics to perform branching node inference, using a support vector machine as a probabilistic inference framework. Then, we use local image statistics at different image scales for feature representation, including the Harris cornerness, the Laplacian, and the eigenvalues of the Hessian. The proposed approach is applied to a breast imaging dataset. Despite the challenge of the task, our approach achieves very encouraging results, which are helpful for further analysis of the breast ducts and other branching structures.

Statistical learning methods have been used to build generative shape models based on reconstructive shape parameters extracted from microscope image collections. However, such parametric modeling approaches are usually limited to simple shapes and easily-modeled parameter distributions. Moreover, to maximize the reconstruction accuracy, significant effort is required to design models for specific datasets or patterns. We have therefore developed an instance-based approach to model biological shapes within a shape space built upon diffeomorphic measurement. We also designed a recursive interpolation algorithm to probabilistically synthesize new shape instances using the shape space model and the original instances. The method is quite generalizable and therefore can be applied to most nuclear, cell and protein object shapes, in both 2D and 3D.

Subsequently, an ellipse-shaped deformable model is fitted using the inner-outer vessel wall and calcium classification, and plaque components within the wall are characterized using HU ranges. The method is quantitatively evaluated on 5 carotid arteries. Vessel and plaque segmentation are compared to the interobserver variability. Furthermore, correlation of slice-based plaque component quantification with the ground truth values is determined. The accuracy of our method is comparable to the interobserver variability.

In this work, we present an automated approach for processing and classifying major subcellular patterns in the Atlas images. We demonstrate that two different classification frameworks (support vector machine and random forest) are effective at determining subcellular locations; we can analyze over 3500 Atlas images with a high degree of accuracy, up to 87.5% for all of the samples and 98.5% when only considering samples in whose classification assignments we are most confident. Moreover, the features obtained in both of these frameworks are observed to be highly consistent and generalizable. Additionally, we observe that the features relating the proteins to cell markers are especially important in automated learning approaches.

One of the necessary tasks is to segment the individual neurons. For this purpose, we propose a supervised learning approach to detect the cell membranes. The classifier was trained using AdaBoost, on local and context features. The features were selected to highlight the line characteristics of cell membranes. It is shown that using features from context positions allows for more information to be utilized in the classification. Together with the nonlinear discrimination ability of the AdaBoost classifier, this results in clearly noticeable improvements over previously used methods.

Due to acquisition limitations, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of the most frequently used supervised and unsupervised detection methods for this purpose. Experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations for comparison, revealed that for very low SNRs (approximate to 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall, closely followed by the detectors based on the so-called h-dome transform from mathematical morphology and the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform, which do not require a learning stage. At high SNRs (>5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.

SVMs can separate the data into two categories optimally so SVMs suit to spam filtering. With used into spam filtering, the standard support vector machine involves the minimization of the error function and the accuracy of the SVM is very high, but the degree of misclassification of legitimate emails is high. In order to solve that problem, this paper proposed a method of spam filtering based on weighted support vector machines. Experimental results show that the algorithm can enhance the filtering performance effectively.

According to this approach, the sequences of features generated by a program during its execution are considered as time series and are processed with signal processing techniques both for feature extraction and statistical pattern matching. In the feature extraction phase we used spectral analysis for describing the sequence and to retain the important information. In the pattern matching phase we used a simplified form of bidimensional Hidden Markov Model, called pseudo2D-HMM, as Statistical Machine Learning Algorithm. Several processes of the same workload are necessary to obtain a 2D-HMM model of the workload. In this way, the models are obtained in an initial training phase; we developed techniques for on-line workload classification of a running process and for synthetic traces generation. The proposed algorithms is evaluated via trace-driven simulations using the SPEC 2000 workloads. We show that pseudo2D-HMMs accurately describe memory references sequences; the classification accuracy is about 92% with six different workloads.

Using this definition of genetic diversity for GP we test several different GP based system identification algorithms for analyzing real world measurements of a BMW Diesel engine as well as medical benchmark data taken from the UCI machine learning repository.

It allows the biologist to inspect thousands of gene activities simultaneously. Machine learning approaches are suited and used to discovering the complex relationships between genes under controlled experimental conditions and classify microarray data by identifying a subset of informative genes embedded in a large data set that involves multiple classes and is infected with the high dimensionality noise. In this paper, a hybrid system integrates genetic algorithms and decision tree is proposed for genes expression analysis and prediction to their functionality for cancer classification. The learning capacity of decision trees used in the base learning systems is boosted by feature selection method. Experiments present preliminary results to demonstrate the capability of hybrid system to mine accurate classification rules for classifying prediction in comparable to traditional machine learning algorithms.

Our approach to solve the problem is based upon the hypothesis that in the low-dimensional manifolds of laser scanning data, there lies an eigenvector which corresponds to the free configuration space of the high order geometric representation of the environment. The vectorial combination of all these eigen-vectors at discrete time scan-frames manifest a trajectory, and once followed and mapped onto the two control signals of mobile robot will enable it to build an efficient and accurate online environment map. We demonstrate this process in robotic simulation and applied a probabilistic machine-learning aspect to find the free area likelihood which consequently builds the trajectory leading to improved map.

However, geographic scope is a concept that can be interpreted in many different ways, ranging from the expected target scope of a specific content to the country where the content originated. The latter; in particular; albeit difficult to address, is of great importance for many reasons, such as, for example, market inquiries or anytime estimates on content production in specific countries are needed. Search engines may also be affected by the knowledge of the various kinds of geographic scopes, to better tune their responses to queries, e.g. according to (hut not restricted to) the geographic proximity with the user location. However that information is rarely available and must be inferred in the vast majority of the cases. In this paper we propose a technique, grounded into the machine learning theory, to estimate source geography of web pages by means of a classifier learned on a specially constructed training set. The training set, consisting of a number of features extracted from web pages and the corresponding source-geography label (i.e. the country of origin of the web page) is automatically built by exploiting the wide number of pages with contents licensed under a localized Creative Commons (CC) license. The model thus learned is then used to classify unlabeled records and our tests showed a mean accuracy of 81% with a standard deviation of 0.9.	[Bardone, Davide; Carotti, Elias S.

It is the most important step that affects the performance of a pattern recognition system. This paper presents a novel feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The algorithm is applied to coefficients extracted by two feature extraction techniques: the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed PSO-based feature selection algorithm is utilized to search the feature space for the optimal feature subset where features are carefully selected according to a well defined discrimination criterion. Evolution is driven by a fitness function defined in terms of maximizing the class separation (scatter index). The classifier performance and the length of selected feature vector are considered for performance evaluation using the ORL face database. Experimental results show that the PSO-based feature selection algorithm was found to generate excellent recognition results with the minimal set of selected features.

Recent high-throughput experimental technology has produced datasets capturing physical and genetic interactions among various components of the cell, which contain clues about systems-level organization. While the analysis of physical interaction networks has received significant attention from the bioinformatics community, relatively little attention has been devoted to analysis of the more general phenomenon of genetic interaction. Genetic interactions are generally defined as cases where simultaneous mutations in multiple genes result in a surprising phenotype, and are highly complementary to information in the physical interaction network. In collaboration with a yeast genetics lab, we have developed a strategy for highly quantitative characterization of interactions from Synthetic Genetic Arrays (SGA), and are now getting our first view of a large fraction of the yeast genetic interaction network. We will introduce several fundamental concepts supporting the emerging direction of genetic interaction networks and describe several striking properties revealed by mining the structure of such networks. For example, we will discuss the connection between modularity and genetic interactions, and describe the potential of these data for global characterization of network structure and robustness. We will highlight several open problems in the interpretation of such networks and discuss where innovations in machine learning and data mining are particularly relevant.

In particular, the early detection of HF related signs and symptoms and the appropriate identification and acquisition of biomedical data from myocardial tissue and organ, may contribute to delay the hospitalization and to improve both the quality of life and survival in pathologic patients. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex cardiovascular syndrome whose management requires a complex clinical program involving the acquisition, integration and interpretation of heterogeneous biomedical data and information. Within the EU FP6 project HEARTFAID, a set of services has been developed to assist CHF stakeholders in their routine workflow and to provide an optimal management of CHF patients, by exploiting the most advanced technologies and instruments for diagnostic data processing. Innovative results on computational modelling, knowledge discovery methodologies, visualization and imaging techniques, and the medical knowledge of the relevant domain is appropriately integrated to design and develop an effective and reliable Clinical Decision Support System: the HEARTFAID CDSS, corresponding to the core of HEARTFAID intelligence. This system is able to process clinical knowledge and patient-related information, intelligently filtered, processed and presented at appropriate times, to enhance patient care. It is devised as a service of the HEARTFAID platform for providing an effective support to the daily practice of the clinicians, by implementing adequate data processing algorithms, by providing guidelines to medical protocols as well as access to the knowledge base, by sending alarms in case of critical situations, and by supplying diagnostic suggestions. Two peculiar issues are involved in the development of the HEARTFAID CDSS for supporting medical decision making, i.e. innovative approaches for biomedical signal and image processing; robust and reliable reasoning approaches, based on Machine Learning and inference methodologies on declarative and procedural domain knowledge.

VARIATIONAL SEQUENCE LABELING	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE				Sequence labeling is concerned with processing an input data sequence and producing an output sequence of discrete labels which characterize it. Common applications includes speech recognition, language processing (tagging, chunking) and bioinformatics. Many solutions have been proposed to partially cope with this problem. These include probabilistic models (HMMs, CRFs) and machine learning algorithm (SVM, Neural nets). In practice, the best results have been obtained by combining several of these methods. However, fusing different signal segmentation methods is not straightforward, particularly when integrating prior information. In this paper the sequence labeling problem is viewed as a multi objective optimization task. Each objective targets a different aspect of sequence labelling such as good classification, temporal stability and change detection. The resulting optimization problem turns out to be non convex and plagued with numerous local minima. A region growing algorithm is proposed as a method for finding a solution to this multi functional optimization task. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real data (BCI dataset). Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on these datasets.

Training data in HMMs have two possible formats: a large set of time-dependent sequential data and an infinitely long sequence. The learning process is one of the main concerns in machine learning. For a large set of time-dependent sequential data, the generalization ability can be determined based on algebraic geometry. However, there has been no theoretical analysis for the case of an infinitely long sequence. Therefore, the present paper experimentally determines a number of unique properties of the likelihood function and explains these properties theoretically. The results indicate that the likelihood function implicitly includes a local maximum factor, which can make the learning process slow, and that this slow learning enables high performance in a stationary state evaluation.

Cross-validation is a common technique by which to evaluate the generalization error and to select the optimal model. However, the calculation required for sequential data processing by cross-validation is expensive in some generative models, such as hidden Markov models, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), and Bayesian networks. Therefore, the present paper proposes a fast approximation of the generalization error, by which the computational cost of the cross-validation can be reduced considerably. The results of experiments revealed that the proposed method accurately approximated the error and was successful in a model selection task for SCFGs.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT SVM FOR REMOTE SENSING IMAGE CLASSIFICATION	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE			ACCURACY	In the recent years, kernel methods have revealed very powerful tools in many application domains in general and in remote sensing image classification in particular. The special characteristics of remote sensing images (high dimension, few labeled samples and different noise sources) are efficiently dealt with kernel machines. In this paper, we propose the use of structured output learning to improve remote sensing image classification based on kernels. structured output learning is concerned with the design of machine learning algorithms that not only implement input-output mapping, but also take into account the relations between output labels, thus generalizing unstructured kernel methods. We analyze the framework and introduce it to the remote sensing community. Output similarity is here encoded into SVM classifiers by modifying the model loss function and the kernel function either independently or jointly. Experiments on a very high resolution (VHR) image classification problem shows promising results and opens a wide field of research with structured output kernel methods.

Classifying Paintings by Artistic Genre: An Analysis of Features & Classifiers	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING (MMSP 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	OCT 05-07, 2009	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE			CLASSIFICATION	This paper describes an approach to automatically classify digital pictures of paintings by artistic genre. While the task of artistic classification is often entrusted to human experts, recent advances in machine learning and multimedia feature extraction has made this task easier to automate. Automatic classification is useful for organizing large digital collections, for automatic artistic recommendation, and even for mobile capture and identification by consumers. Our evaluation uses variable-resolution painting data gathered across Internet sources rather than solely using professional high-resolution data. Consequently, we believe this solution better addresses file task of classifying consumer-quality digital captures than other existing approaches. We include a comparison to existing feature extraction and classification methods as well as an analysis of our own approach across classifiers and feature vectors.

HeartToGo: A Personalized Medicine Technology for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Detection	2009 IEEE/NIH LIFE SCIENCE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/NIH Life Science Systems and Applications Workshop	APR 09-10, 2009	Bethesda, MD	IEEE, NIH				To date, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the first leading cause of global death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. The mainstream resting ECG machines for CVD diagnosis and supervision can be ineffective in detecting abnormal transient heart activities, which may not occur during an individual's hospital visit. Common Holter-based portable solutions offer 24-hour ECG recording, containing hundreds of thousands of heart beats that not only are tedious and time-consuming to analyze manually but also miss the capability to provide any real-time feedback. In this study, we seek to establish a cell phone-based personalized medicine technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous monitoring and recording of ECG in real time, generating individualized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting abnormal CVD conditions and classifying them at any place and anytime. Specifically, we propose to develop an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both individualized medical information and clinical ECG database data, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification results.

For this reason, the application of SVMs in fault classification and diagnosis field has becomes one growing reach focus. In this paper a new approach to real-time fault detection and classification is presented for high speed protective relaying in power transmission systems using SVMs. The integration with an online wavelet-based pre-processing stage [1,2,3] enhances the SVM learning capability and classification power. The classification criterion is based on using only the phase angles between the three line currents in the transmission line. The paper begins with the exploration of classifying different fault types (LG, LL, and LLG) using the SVMs. It proceeds with the classification concepts of the nine types of faults. Extensive theoretical studies and simulations using ATP and MATLAB-SVM Toolbox on an EHV transmission line model have proved that the veracity of the SVM classifier is very significant for fault classification.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory is an important branch of the Machine Learning in the field of artificial intelligence, which is also the general method to deal with Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems. RL takes learning as trial and error process and maximizes the reward value function by choosing an action depending on the state. In recent years, RL and its application are received increasing attention of international academia. The paper presents two PSS design based on the Q-learning algorithm. One uses Q-learning to optimize the control gain of PSS. The other uses a novel Q-learning controller to replace the conventional PSS completely.

For example, these approaches can take place in an interactive process where a user iteratively expresses new constraints to refine previous clustering results. In this paper, we propose three new variants of the Leader Ant Clustering with Constraint algorithm (MCLA, MELA and CELA) that implements the following constraints: the must-link, cannot-link constraints and c-constraints. These algorithms have been compared to other constraint based clustering algorithms such as K-Means clustering with constraints and the original Leader Ant clustering algorithm. Our experiments show that, on UCI machine learning and artificial data sets, our approach compares well to the other algorithms.

However, learning process requires much time for exploration and computation. In this paper, we propose a method of sensorimotor learning which explores the learning domain actively. Our approach discovers that the embodied learning system can design its own learning process actively, which is different from the conventional passive data-access machine learning. The proposed model is characterized by a function we call the "confidence", and is a measure of the reliability of state control. The confidence for the state can be a good measure to bias the exploration strategy of data sampling, and to direct its attention to areas of learning interest. We consider the confidence function to be a first step toward an active behavior design for autonomous environment adaptation. The approach was experimentally validated in typical sensorimotor coordination such as arm reaching and object fixation, using the humanoid robot James and the iCub simulator.

From a machine learning point of view, this process is an active learning approach. In this paper, we present a new robot learning framework for reproducing this ability in robot grasping. For doing so, we chose a straightforward approach: first, the robot observes a few good grasps by demonstration and learns a value function for these grasps using Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, it chooses grasps which are optimal with respect to this value function using a mean-shift optimization approach, and tries them out on the real system. Upon every completed trial, the value function is updated, and in the following trials it is more likely to choose even better grasping points. This method exhibits fast learning due to the data-efficiency of the Gaussian process regression framework and the fact that the mean-shift method provides maxima of this cost function. Experiments were repeatedly carried out successfully on a real robot system. After less than sixty trials, our system has adapted its grasping policy to consistently exhibit successful grasps.

Much research has focused on various "black box" approaches, in which the synthesized or learned control algorithms perform well when tested, but are difficult or impossible to analyze and understand. This paper presents the use of the ADATE system to evolve a control algorithm based on a racing car simulator. The system evolved compact and analyzable yet sophisticated control algorithms capable of driving millions of randomly generated tracks at high speeds without ever driving off the road. The approach presented is likely to be applicable to most automatic control problems, given a set of training examples and a suitable software simulator.

In such cases, machine learning methods offer a promising alternative for approximating such models using measured data. To date, high computational demands have largely restricted machine learning techniques to mostly offline applications. However, making the robots adaptive to changes in the dynamics and to cope with unexplored areas of the state space requires online learning. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the support vector regression (SVR) by sparsification based on the linear independency of training data. As a result, we obtain a method which is applicable in real-time online learning. It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression techniques, such as nu-SVR, Gaussian process regression (GPR) and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR).

Machine learning is a popular approach to find controllers that are tailored exactly to the system without any prior model. In this paper, we propose a semi-decentralized reinforcement learning control approach in order to position and convey an object on a contact-free MEMS-based distributed-manipulation system.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the altitude of a UAV from top-down aerial images taken from a single on-board camera. We use a semi-supervised machine learning approach to solve the problem. The basic idea of our technique is to learn the mapping between the texture in formation contained in an image to a possible altitude value. We learn an over complete sparse basis set from a corpus of unlabeled images capturing the texture variations. This is followed by regression of this basis set against a training set of altitudes. Finally, a spatio-temporal Markov Random Field is modeled over the altitudes in test images, which is maximized mer the posterior distribution using the MAP estimate by solving a quadratic optimization problem with L1 regularity constraints. The method is evaluated in a laboratory setting with a real helicopter and is found to provide promising results with sufficiently fast turnaround time.

For the last decade, significant progress in computer vision and machine learning literatures has increased the recognition performance of well localized objects. However, the performance of these techniques is still far from human performance, especially in cluttered environments. We believe that the performance gap between robots and humans is due in part to humans' use of an attention system. According to cognitive psychology, the human visual system uses two stages of visual processing to interpret visual input. The first stage is a pre-attentive process perceiving scenes fast and coarsely to select potentially interesting regions. The second stage is a more complex process analyzing the regions hypothesized in the previous stage. These two stages play an important role in enabling efficient use of the limited cognitive resources available. Inspired by this biological fact, we propose a visual attentional object categorization approach for robots that enables object recognition in real environments under a critical time limitation. We quantitatively evaluate the performance for recognition of objects in highly cluttered scenes without significant loss of detection rates across several experimental settings.

The techniques described in this paper cover those methods that are robust and relevant to semiconductor data, sufficiently simple for use by non-statisticians, and proven effective in yield modeling. We first apply the classification and regression tree (CART) technique to detect the source of yield variations from electrical parameters and process equipment. Yield prediction models, including multinomial logistic regression (MNL) and the random forest (RF) method, will also be discussed. Case studies demonstrate the strength of combining traditional regression with machine learning techniques.

The originality is to extract time-frequency features from a set of stationarized surrogate signals, and to use them for defining the null hypothesis of stationarity. Our paper is a further contribution that explores a general framework embedding techniques from machine learning and time-frequency analysis, called time-frequency learning machines. Based on one-class support vector machines, our approach uses entire time-frequency representations and does not require arbitrary feature extraction. Its relevance is illustrated by simulation results, and spherical multidimensional scaling techniques to map data to a visible 3D space.

While several estimators of divergence measures have been proposed in literature, the performance of these estimators is not known. We propose a simple kNN density estimation based plug-in estimator for estimation of divergence measures. Based on the properties of kNN density estimates, we derive the bias, variance and mean square error of the estimator in terms of the sample size, the dimension of the samples and the underlying probability distribution. Based on these results, we specify the optimal choice of tuning parameters for minimum mean square error. We also present results on convergence in distribution of the proposed estimator. These results will establish a basis for analyzing the performance of image registration methods that maximize divergence.

Specifically, we consider sensor nodes which can measure only a part of the feature vector and whose communication capabilities are limited to only their neighbouring nodes. We formulate a distributed classification algorithm that learns the optimal (large-margin) hyperplane separating the two classes, using the projected-gradient approach. The sensor nodes reach a consensus on the gradient to be used for weight update at each step of the optimization algorithm. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and provide a joint calibration and signature learning method for acoustic sensor networks as an application.

In addition the biological immune system (IS) is a learning system in its own right. In this work, we design an artificial immune system (AIS) that is based on observations of the natural immune system to predict MHC-II binding peptides. Our strategy simulates the mutable receptors of T lymphocytes as well as their selection during life time. We model the receptor specificity and binding mode as well as the lymphocyte's influence during an inflammatory response. Finally, our implementation uses the pathogen specificity of T cells to model the prediction problem.

Gaussian kernel is the most commonly used kernel function. However, model selection including setting the width parameter a in kernel function and the regularization parameter C is essential to generalization performance of SVM. In this paper we proposed a new parameter selection method for Support Vector Machine. The key idea of our method MSKD in selecting the gaussian kernel parameter is that convergent character between pattern's similarity measurement in feature space will decrease the classification ability of SVM. In addition, We combined MSKD algorithm with one-dimension search strategy based on cross-validation and developed a complex parameters selection method named MSKD-GS. Experiments on eight real world data sets from UCI have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.			tyaohua@hnepri.com; gweimin@hnepri.com					Bengio Y, 2000, NEURAL COMPUT, V12, P1889, DOI 10.1162/089976600300015187; Blake C.

Practical Fuzzy Decision Trees	2009 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	MAR 30-APR 02, 2009	Nashville, TN	IEEE				Decision-tree algorithms are one of the most popular applications in machine learning. The ID3 algorithm is an efficient method for building decision trees that form the basis for many decision tree programs. Fuzzy ID3 is an extension of the existing ID3 algorithm; it integrates fuzzy set theory and ID3 to overcome the effects of spurious precision in the data, to treat uncertainties in the data and to reduce the decision tree sensitivity to small changes in attribute values. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of fuzzy, ID3 algorithm that integrates information gain and classification ambiguity to select the test attribute. The modified algorithm achieves better accuracy than the original Fuzzy ID3 as well as crisp programs such C4.5 on a wide range of datasets. We also introduce a new machine learning software tool based on fuzzy decision trees.

First of all, a quick recall of the state of the art related to ensembles of (fuzzy) decision trees in Machine Learning is presented. Afterwards, a new approach to construct a forest of fuzzy decision trees is proposed. Two experiments are described, one with forests of fuzzy decision trees, and the other with bagging of fuzzy decision trees. The results highlight the interest of using fuzzy set theory in this kind of approaches.

Addressing this problem requires predicting reusability based on information that exists when a script is created To provide such a model for web macro scripts, we identified script trails that might plausibly predict reuse, then used IBM CoScripter repository logs to statistically test how well each corresponded to reuse. We then built a machine learning model that combines the useful traits and evaluated how, well it can predict four different types of reuse that we saw in the repository logs. Our model was able to predict reuse from a surprisingly small set of traits It is simple enough to be explained in only 6-11 rules, making it potentially viable for integration in repository search engines for end-user programmers	[Scaffidi, Chris; Myers, Brad; Shaw, Mary] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA	Scaffidi, C (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.	cscaffid@cs.cmu.edu; bogart@eecs.oregonstate.edu; burnett@eecs.oregonstate.edu; acypher@us.ibm.com; bam@cs.cmu.edu; mary.shaw@cs.cmu.edu					BIGGERSTAFF T, 1987, IEEE SOFTWARE, V4, P41, DOI 10.1109/MS.1987.230095; BIKHCHANDANI S, 1992, J POLIT ECON, V100, P992, DOI 10.1086/261849; BOETTICHER G, 2008, 4 INT WORKSH PRED MO, P1061; BOGART C, 2008, 2008 IEEE S VIS LANG; Cubranic D, 2003, PROC INT CONF SOFTW, P408, DOI 10.1109/ICSE.2003.1201219; Frank E., 1998, 15 INT C MACH LEARN, P144; GUI G, 2006, 2006 INT WORKSH MIN, P18; GULLEY N, 2006, 2 WORKSH END US SOFT, P8; Johansson U., 2004, Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion; LEACH RJ, 1997, SOFTWARE REUSE METHO; LESHED G, 2008, 26 SIGCHI C HUM FACT, P1719; LITTLE G, 2007, 25 SIGCHI C HUM FACT, P943; MCCAREY F, 2005, ARTIF INTELL REV, P253; MENZIES T, 2007, T SOFTWARE ENG, P637; MOSER R, 2008, 30 INT C SOFTW ENG, P181; ROBILLARD M, 2005, 10 EUR SOFTW ENG C, P11; STUMPF S, 2007, 12 INT C INT US INT, P82; Suryanarayana G., 2006, 28th International Conference on Software Engineering Proceedings, DOI 10.1145/1134285.1134295; Walpole RA, 1997, IEEE VISLANG, P68; Witten I.

Based on the Wikipedia XML Corpus, we present a three-tiered framework for extracting topic ontologies in quick time and a modeling environment to refine these ontologies. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other Machine Learning (ML) techniques along with a very rich document corpus, this system proposes a solution to a task that is generally considered extremely cumbersome. The initial results of the prototype suggest strong potential of the system to become highly successful in ontology extraction and modeling and also inspire further research on extracting ontologies from other semi-structured document corpora as well.

The proposed machine learning approach exploits the best efficiency of the components associated with the roadway type and traffic congestion level to reduce the overall fuel consumption.

The concept of Beyond the Third Generation Systems (B3G) emerged in an attempt to exploit the variety of the available access standards to the benefit of end-users, operators and manufacturers. In this context, a key topic in the research area of B3G/4G networks is related to mechanisms and strategies to efficiently realize the complementary use of the diverse Radio Access Technologies (RATs), through their convergence into one composite radio environment. One of the most important features of these evolving systems is the availability of multiple access technologies, which will allow users to enjoy wireless services at any time, at any place. Evidently in order to truly enhance the experience of all users, even technology agnostic ones, functionality is required, on both the network and the user-device side, for providing the "always best connection" in a transparent manner. The focus of this paper is more on the end-user side. The target is to realize management functionality that takes into account user requirements, environment characteristics, configuration policies and experience established so as to dynamically configure the user terminal in a seamless and transparent manner, through machine learning mechanisms. This can be achieved with the help of Bayesian Networks, a technique used for encoding and learning probabilistic relationships.

The detection probability is a probability that any of two APs (AP(i) and AP(j)) are found at the same time under the condition when APi is found. By using this method, terminals can omit to scan some of channels which are apparently lower in probability that available APs are found. Our simulation results show that the scan time has been reduced by more than 40% compared with a RSSI based AP selection method. The proposed method is expected to improve the quality of service of real-time applications on mobile terminals.

Time series analysis methods are usually utilized to deal with this task. In this paper, we propose to combine news mining and time series analysis to forecast inter-day stock prices. News reports are automatically analyzed with text mining techniques, and then the mining results are used to improve the accuracy of time series analysis algorithms. The experimental result on a half year Chinese stock market data indicates that the proposed algorithm can help to improve the performance of normal time series analysis in stock price forecasting significantly. Moreover, the proposed algorithm also performs well in stock price trend forecasting.

This leads to consumers purchasing the most popular product of a category, although perhaps that is neither the best suited for their requirements nor at the best cost. In this paper, a methodology to develop a recommender system is proposed. Our proposal is based on a supervised learning approach to infer knowledge that allows consumers to unveil what the existing patterns among the features that describe the searched product are. Such knowledge allows consumers to learn what they can buy and at what cost.	[Lopez-Lopez, L. M.; Castro-Schez, J.

To select keywords, existing methods make a decision based on keywords' statistic information deriving from TF and DF in local acquired records, thus work well only in textual databases providing full text search interfaces, whereas not well in structured databases of multi-attribute or field-restricted search interfaces. This paper proposes a novel Deep Web crawling method. Keywords are encoded as a tuple by its linguistic, statistic and HTML features so that a harvest rate evaluation model can be learned from the issued keywords for the un-issued in future. The method breaks through the assumption of plain-text search made by existing methods. Experimental results show that the method outperforms the state of the art methods.

Evaluating web sites is a significant task for web service because evaluated web sites provide useful information for users to estimate sites' validation and popularity. Although many practical approaches have been taken to present a measuring stick for web sites, their evaluation functions are set up manually. Thus, we develop a method to obtain evaluation function using Ranking SVM and automatically rank web sites with the learned classifier. Also we conducted experiments and confirmed the effectiveness of our approach and its potential in performing high quality web site evaluation.

In this paper, we adopt methods of machine learning, choose the appropriate characteristic, and use the highly efficient classifying models of RFR_SUM, CRF, NaiveBayes, KNN, and RBF to resolve combinational ambiguity. Four combining strategies of ensembles of classifiers - product, average, max, majority voting - are applied in our experiment. 20 typical combinationany ambiguous words are tested by using a half year corpus of the 1998 "People's Daily", and the best average F-score achieved was 98.02%. The result shows that the methods of ensemble, which make full use of various contextual information such as word, frequency, part-of-speech and so on, can effectively improve disambiguation accuracy.

The inner structures of these web objects are highly heterogeneous that web objects from different web sites cover different subsets of useful attributes. The complete set of attributes can be mined from web pages through attribute extraction algorithms. However, to construct high quality web object schema, some mined attributes should be merged since they are synonyms for the same concepts. Our empirical study shows that features used by traditional schema matching and deep web integration methods are usually domain specific, so they are not applicable to match attributes extracted from the Web. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes new features to depict attribute distribution characteristics and uses machine learning techniques to combine attribute distribution characteristics with attribute similarity features. We empirically compare the proposed method with existing methods use other features, and the results show the effectiveness of our method.

The system is specialized for high-security tasks, e.g. controlling entry to a headquarter and for scenarios including terrorist attacks or kidnapping, when the attackers formally bypass the existing sensors, but fail to imitate normal movement of an employee. An experimental setup was implemented to verify the successfulness of the approach.

Vietnamese is a different language with different features and it is not clear whether the standard methods will work on the categorization of Vietnamese documents. This paper describes morphological level document representtations that are appropriate for Vietnamese text documents and investigates the effectiveness of several standard learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (ICNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with four different kernel functions. The results show that it is possible to build effective and efficient classifiers for Vietnamese text categorization using our representations and the standard algorithms, and demonstrate that the performance can be improved by using infogain for feature selection and using an external dictionary for filtering the vocabulary.

To classify the wireless systems, we utilize two features that typify spectrum use-center frequency and the frequency spread-and cluster the measurement data in this space. Since the systems are unknown prior to clustering, we use an unsupervised clustering method that uses the Chinese restaurant process implemented using Gibbs sampling. The system identification is divided into two parts: training and online classification. In the training phase, we assign wireless systems present in the surrounding to the clusters while the online classification uses this trained data to perform classification. By means of an extensive measurement campaign, we show that the proposed machine learning process achieves up to 90% correctness in classifying the wireless systems considered here.

The cost of PDR represents a substantial part of operational costs, and faster, more effective PDR can contribute to a substantial reduction in system administration costs. In this paper, we propose to automate the process of PDR by leveraging machine learning methods. The main focus is to effectively categorize the problem a user experiences by recognizing the problem specificity leveraging all available training data such like the performance data and the logs data. Specifically, we transform the structure of the problem into a hierarchy which can be determined by existing taxonomy in advance. We then propose an efficient hierarchical incremental learning algorithm which is capable of adjusting its internal local classifier parameters in real-time. Comparing to the traditional batch learning algorithms, this online learning framework can significantly decrease the computational complexity of the training process by learning from new instances on an incremental fashion. In the same time this reduces the amount of memory required to store the training instances. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by learning hierarchical problem patterns for several issues occurring in distributed web applications. Experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms previous methods.

This paper presents hand gesture recognition applied human-computer interaction (HCI) system. It presents new method to automatic gesture area segmentation and orientation normalization of the gesture. It is not mandatory for the user to keep upright gestures in the regular position, the system segments and normalizes the gestures automatically. The method is an unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach that utilizes the local linearity to discover the low dimensional manifold embedded in the high dimensional space. This suggests that the method may preserve the neighborhood configuration for the nonlinear structure of the multi-view hand shape data distribution. The experiment shows this method is very accurate. The gesture pointing accuracy of our system is measured by 80 times of pointing recognition test, the success rate above 90%.

In prior work, mathematical input/output models along with system performance expressions have been used to perform the parameter selection. In practice, however, impairments such as interference and analog circuit nonlinearities are difficult to model in a simple and tractable framework. Moreover, these impairments are in flux due to environmental factors. This paper summarizes an online machine learning approach to parameter selection through the real-time capturing of performance related data. Online learning is advantageous, not only because changes in the system model can be captured in the data observations, but also for its ability to learn system operation details not provided by current system models. A modified version of k-nearest neighbor is developed to enable both the real-time capture of training data and the performance criterion for physical layer adaptation.

The problem domain, a freeway integration control application, is formulated as a distributed reinforcement learning problem. The DRL approach was implemented via a multi-agent control architecture where the decision agent was assigned to each of the on-ramp or VMS. The return of each agent is simultaneously updating a single shared policy. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the simple freeway network. Analyses of simulation results using this approach show significant improvement over traditional local control, especially for the case of large traffic demand. Using the DRL approach, the TTS of the Network has been reduced by 20% under the heavy demands.

While simple fuzzy systems with high interpretability are usually not accurate, complicated fuzzy systems with high accuracy are usually not interpretable. Recently evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been used to search for simple and accurate fuzzy systems. The main advantage of EMO-based approaches over single-objective techniques is that a number of alternative fuzzy systems with different accuracy-complexity tradeoffs can be obtained by their single run. We have already proposed a multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML) algorithm for pattern classification problems. In our GBML algorithm, multiple fuzzy partitions with different granularities are simultaneously used. This is because we usually do not know an appropriate fuzzy partition for each input variable. However, the use of multiple fuzzy partitions significantly increases the size of the search space.

Recently due to the vast improvement in machine learning and pattern recognition methods many computer scientists have applied these methods to solve this problem. However, protein folding problem is much more complicated than ordinary machine learning problems because of its natural complexity imposed by the high dimensionality of feature space and diversity of different protein fold classes. To deal with such a challenging problem, we use an ensemble classifier model by applying MLP and RBF Neural Networks and Bayesian ensemble method. Also we have used the Laplace estimation method in order to smooth confusion matrices of the base classifiers. Experimental results imply that RBF Neural Network holds better Correct Classification Rate (CCR) compared to other common classification methods such as MLP networks. Our experiments also show that the Bayesian fusion method can improve the correct classification rate of proteins up to 20% with the final CCR of 59% by reducing both bias and variance error of the RBF classifiers, on a benchmark dataset containing 27 SCOP folds.

Application of FSAs in the bioinformatics domain has become a necessity due to enormous growth of public sequence databases. This paper provides an experimental framework on the use of Rough Set Theory (RST) as FSAs in finding minimal feature subsets for classifying protein function. In experimenting RST, three different recent models are explored; Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), FCBF (Fast Correlation-Based Filter) and Artificial Immune System (AIS). The experimental study for these FSAs are based on four criteria: the accuracy (AC), the area under ROC graph (ROC), the length of the reducts (ARL), and the time taken (TT). Classification was performed on the reduced feature set using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. The results demonstrate that CFS and FCBF performs better if the main objectives are to measure the accuracy and ROC, however in terms of duration and rule length, RST is a better choice.

This paper discusses a method for digital watermarking using artificial neural networks to realize secure copyright protection of visual information without any damage. The discussed watermark extraction keys and feature extraction keys identify the secure and unique hidden patterns for proper digital watermarks. In the experiments, we have shown that the proposed method is robust to high pass filtering and JPEG compression of visual information, only for those watermark extraction keys which were able to identify the proper hidden bit patterns from original visual information using corresponding feature extraction keys. The proposed method is to contribute to secure visual digital watermarking without damaging or losing any detailed data of visual information.

We want to determine different types responsible for different profiles of cancer onset thanks to machine learning programs. The prognostic will rely on polymorphisms of a gene, BRCA1, but on family history as well. The machine learning sofiware(s) will be used as a tool by doctors as a help for diagnosis.

The objective of this study is to provide tools for driving behaviour identification with the associated risk as regards of handling loss. This study aims to take into account the infrastructure, driver and the vehicle interactions, which are useful to evaluate this risk accurately. We propose in this paper a vehicles trajectories analysis in bend within a suitable Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm framework. At first, we will be interested on vehicle trajectory definition and experimental data acquisition. Then, we will make an experimental trajectories classification in order to determine several classes of trajectories. Afterwards, we will make a vehicle trajectories stability analysis in order to identify safe and unsafe fields of the observed trajectories. Lastly, one will use machine learning methods to predict failure trajectories.

Morphological analysis is concerned with retrieving the structure, the syntactic and morphological properties or the meaning of a morphologically complex word. The morphology structure of agglutinative language is unique and capturing its complexity in a machine analyzable and generatable formal is a challenging job. Generally rule based approaches are used for building morphological analyzer system. In rule based approaches what works in the forward direction may not work in the backward direction. This new and state of the art machine learning approach based on sequence labeling and training by kernel methods captures the non-linear relationships in the different aspect of morphological features of natural languages in a better and simpler way. The overall accuracy obtained for the morphologically rich agglutinative language (Tamil) was really encouraging.	[Dhanalakshmi, V; Anandkumar, M.; Rekha, R. U.; Arunkumar, C.; Soman, K.

We have developed our own tagset for annotating the corpus, which is used for training and testing the POS tagger generator and the chunker. The present tagset consists of thirty tags for POS and nine tags for chunking. A corpus size of two hundred and twenty five thousand words was used for training and testing the accuracy of the Chunker. We found that CRF++ affords the most encouraging result for Tamil chunker.

In our work, we describe an approach to CBIR for various database images that relies on human input machine learning and computer vision. More specifically we apply expert level human interaction for solving that aspect of the problem and we employ machine learning algorithms to allow the system to be adapted to new image domains. We present empirical results for the domain of high resolution computed image of flowers. Our results illustrate the efficacy of loop approach to image characterization and the ability of our approach to adapt the retrieval process image domain through the application of machine learning algorithms.

Generalised and Channel Independent SVM based Robust Decoders for Wireless Applications	2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN RECENT TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING (ARTCOM 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing	OCT 27-28, 2009	Kerala, INDIA			Hamming codes; Convolutional codes; Error Correction Codes; Support Vector Machines; Viterbi decoder	MACHINES	Emerging applications in wireless communications and Software Defined Radio require robust and generalized decoders with a very good efficiency. This paper aims at introducing a novel and powerful method of implementing a decoder using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to exhibit good performance irrespective of the channel model. The method proposed also ensures a generalization in the design of decoder, which can be easily adaptable for any type of coding technique used. In addition, this method overcomes the demerits of the traditional decoders like Viterbi and other decoders using Neural Networks. The error correction codes like Hamming and Convolutional codes are considered for experimentation. Using SVM, which is a class of machine learning algorithm, this process is viewed as a multi-class classification problem and error correction is achieved in a simpler way. An extensive analysis with regard to the effect of channel and modulation techniques is also made and presented. The proposed SVM model is sufficiently cross validated and found to be an effective replacement for the existing counterparts.	[Ramanathan, R.; Valliappan, N.; Mathavan, S.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new method that combines Support Vector Machine with clustering algorithm, based on analyzing the relation between boundary support vectors and KKT condition. In the method, firstly, presents incremental support vector machine learning algorithm based on clustering, and describes the running process of the algorithm detailedly; then give the intrusion detection model based on incremental SVM learning; finally, the performance of the model is tested by computer simulation with KDD CUP1999 data set. The experimental results show it has higher detection accuracy rate and improves the speed of SVM training and classification, as keeping the generalization ability of incremental SVM learning algorithm.

The need of retrieving 3D models is constantly emerging. Especially, how to reduce the 'semantic gap' between the low-level features and high-level semantics, becomes one of the most hot topic. This paper gives a deep survey about the state of the art on semantic processing in content-based 3D model retrieval. Firstly, a framework of contend-based 3D model retrieval system integrated with high-level semantics is presented. Secondly, this paper concludes existing researches and divides the way of high-level semantic processing into three main categories: (1) using relevance feedback based on-line learning to integrate effectively users' high level semantic knowledge; (2) using off-line machine learning methods to narrow the gap between high-level semantic knowledge and low-level object representation; (3) using object ontology to define high-level concepts. Finally, the paper recommends some challenges in this field.

However, like most machine learning algorithms, SVMs is a supervised learning which is based on the assumption that it is straightforward to obtain labeled data, but in reality labeled data can be scarce or expensive to obtain. Active learning (AL) is a way to deal with the above problem by asking for the labels of the most "informative" data points. To reduce the amount of human labeling effort while maintaining the SVMs performance, in this work we propose an uncertainty sampling-based active learning approach for SVMs to annotate the most uncertain unlabeled instances, i.e., an algorithm to select the most informative instances for SVMs learning process. During the SVMs active learning process, to reduce annotation effort while maintaining the SVMs classification performance, we firstly employ the decision margin of SVMs output as the initial uncertainty measure to select the most uncertain instances, to further reduce the number of unlabeled instances to be annotated, we employ the Ratio of Center-Distance to select the boundary vectors of SVMs. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency, we have applied the proposed method on several standard UCI datasets. The experimental results show that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce learning cost while achieving the desired performance.

In this paper, we put forward a genetic algorithm approach for pruning decision tree. Binary coding is adopted in which an individual in a population consists of a fixed number of weight that stand for a solution candidate. The evaluation function considers error rate of decision tree over the test set. Three common operators for genetic algorithm such as random mutation and single-point crossover is applied for the population. Finally the algorithm returns an individual with the highest fitness as a local optimal weight. Based on four databases from UCI, we compared our approach with several other traditional decision tree pruning techniques including cost-complexity pruning, Pessimistic Error Pruning and Reduced error pruning. The results show that our approach has an better or equal effect with other pruning method.

An ensemble in the context of machine learning can be broadly defined as a machine learning system that is constructed with a set of individual models working in parallel and whose outputs are combined with a decision fusion strategy to produce a single answer for a given problem.

It is an effective tool to deal with limited samples. This paper proposes a model of the dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of transformer based on Multi-class SVM. Firstly, with the combination of SVM multi-class classification methods one-versus-rest (1-v-r) and one-versus-one (1-v-1), the normal state and fault state of transformers are diagnosed. Then the fault data is diagnosed in detail with 1-v-1 method. The grid search method based on cross-validation, which is effective in solving the problem of designing SVM parameters, is used to determine model parameters. The results of case study show that the model ensures a very high accuracy	[Zhang Zhe; Zhu Yong-Li; Wu Zhong-Li; Han Kai] N China Elect Power Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Baoding, Peoples R China	Zhang, Z (reprint author), N China Elect Power Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Baoding, Peoples R China.	zhang20082008@163.com					DUAN K, 2005, 6 INT WORKSH SEAS CA; HSU CW, 2002, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V13, P425; SHANG Y, 2002, CHIN SOC ELEC ENG, V22, P115; SUN X, 2001, CHIN SOC ELEC ENG, V21, P37; Vapnik V.

It, however, has not drawn much attention of Vietnamese researchers all over the world. In this paper, we present an experimental study on Vietnamese POS tagging. Motivated from Chinese research and Vietnamese characteristics, we present a new kind of features based on the idea of word composition. We call it morpheme-based features. To verify the effectiveness of these features, we use three powerful machine learning techniques - MEM, CRF and SVM. In addition, we also built a Vietnamese POS-tagged corpus with approximately 8000 sentences of different genres to conduct experiments. Experimental results showed that morpheme-based features always give higher precision in comparison with previous approaches - usually word-based features. We achieved the precision of 91.64% by using these morpheme-based features.

Semantic Role based Tamil Sentence Generator	2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Asian Language Processing	DEC 07-09, 2009	Singapore, SINGAPORE					A Machine learning technique called memory based bigram models are developed for a system that generate a simple sentence for Tamil language from a set of concept terms and their semantic role. This system consists of a learner to learn how to realize a sentence from the content of semantic role information. This learner has been designed as a statistical model that is formulated from a preprocessed corpus of sentences. This preprocessing work is handled by annotating the corpus using part of speech tagging, chunking and semantic role labeling processes. This collective annotated corpus is statistically analyzed and developed the memory based bigram models. These models thus obtained are capable of producing the appropriate sequence of semantic roles of the concept terms for realizing sentence. A phrase generator has been developed to generate the appropriate phrases involved in sentence generation.	[Pandian, S. Lakshmana; Geetha, T.

Despite emerging technologies, reviewing capsule endoscopic video is a labor intensive task and very time consuming. Computational tools which automatically detect informative frames and tag abnormal conditions such as bleeding, ulcer or tumor will dramatically reduce the clinician's effort. In this paper, we explored various machine-learning methodologies based on different feature extraction and selection criteria, and developed an optimized classification method. The experiment results shows that, comparing to texture feature, using color feature for classification achieved better accuracy, regardless of machine-learning method chosen. The proposed method has been applied in real data taken from capsule endoscopic exams. For informative frames detection, classification method using color feature gives an accuracy of 94.10% and 93.44% for support vector machines (SVM) and neural network (NN) classifiers respectively. For the bleeding detection using color feature, the accuracy achieved 99.41% and 98.97% for SVM and NN respectively. In addition, we also investigated the computational time required for feature extraction and classification. In our experiments, color feature significantly outperformed texture feature in WCE image classification. The overall computational time (per frame) using color feature is 0.7125s (informative frame with SVM), 1.0329s (informative frame with NN), 0.51s (bleeding frame with SVM) and 1.2163s (bleeding frame with NN). Classifiers for more gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases detection will be developed based on this work subsequently.

In particular product features extraction and sentiment scoring on extracted features are fundamental steps. Opinion knowledge extraction often involves extensive application of natural language processing, manual labeling and machine learning methods. In this paper we focus on developing fine-grained product feature extractions with minimal tailor build language models and labeling. A threshold-normalized sentence-level word model is proposed for opinion feature mining. The opinion feature extraction is then solved via matrix factorization technique. Evaluation on feature-entropies, sentence-entropies and human evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our approach. Highly relevant and fine-grained opinion features are extracted automatically.

Firstly, words are segmented front inputted scripts and also normalized in size. Secondly, three different feature extraction methods are applied to each segmented word namely the discrete cosine transform (DCT), moment invariants, and absolute mean value of overlapping blocks. Finally, theses features are utilized to train a neural network jot classification. This approach has been tested using the IFN/ENIT database which consists of 32492 Arabic words.

Detecting social engineering is important because it attempts to secure organisations, consumers and systems from attempts to gain unauthorized access or to reveal some secrets by manipulating employees. The aim of this work is to introduce a new technique for detecting social engineering using neural networks. In this work we have used benchmark data and developed a new technique to extract features that can be used for neural network testing and training. Initial results are encouraging and indicate that machine learning can add an extra layer of security to protect individuals and organisations from social engineering attacks. Future work includes expanding the data set to include additional attack scenarios and benchmark data.

In coping with this issue, many methods have been proposed for selecting important features. Among them. is feature selection that selects a subset of discriminative features or attribute for model building due to its ability to avoid overfitting issue, improve model performance, provide faster and producing reliable model. This paper proposes a new method based on Rough Set algorithms, which is a rule-based data mining method to select the important features in bioinformatics datasets. Amino acid compositions are used as conditional features for the classification task. However, our results indicate that all amino acid composition features are equally important thus selecting the features are unnecessary. We do confirm the need of having a balance classes in classifying the protein function by demonstrating an increase of more than 15% in accuracy.

MorphoSyntactic disambiguation (part of speech tagging) is the process of classifying every word in a given context to its appropriate part of speech. In this paper, we first review all the supervised machine learning approaches that have been used in the part of speech tagging. Then we review all the Arabic works to compare and to confirm our need to develop an accurate and efficient Arabic MorphoSyntactic Disambiguation system.

The first is a neural network based approach. where an algorithm of multi resolution technique based on Haar basis functions was used to obtain an image with different scales. Thereafter a classification was carried out with the multilayer feed forward neural network. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used as a dimension reduction technique to make the classification process much more efficient. The second approach is based on boosting which also yields very good detection rates. In general, boosting is one of the most important developments in classification methodology. It works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighed versions of the training data, followed by taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For this work, a strong classifier was trained by the adaboost algorithm. The results of comparing the two methodologies vis-a-vis shows the effectiveness of the methods that have been used.

In particular, the paper addresses the retention of visual features in the field of view of the camera, which is an important robustness issue in visual servoing. First, the classical approach of Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) for fixed-base manipulators is extended to wheeled mobile robots. Second, in order to guarantee visibility of visual features, an innovative controller with machine learning using Q-learning is proposed, which can learn its behavior policy and autonomously improve its performance. Third, a hybrid controller for robust mobile manipulation is developed to integrate the IBVS controller and the Q-learning controller through a rule-based arbitrator. This is thought to be the first work that integrates Reinforcement Learning or Q-learning with visual servoing to achieve robust operation. Experiments are carried out to validate the approaches developed in this paper. The experimental results show that the new hybrid controller developed here possesses the capabilities of self-learning and fast response, and provides a balanced performance with respect to robustness and accuracy.

The objective of this work was to design an intelligent web portal to serve as service provider for bankruptcy prediction. The portal has been conceived to help users (e.g. loan managers working in banks) to detect bankruptcy. For this purpose, the knowledge of the financial domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. Additionally, the ontological component allows for defining an ontology-guided search engine. The reasoning engine of the proposed system executes logic rules related with well-established financial variables. These rules characterize that a firm tends (or does not tend) to bankruptcy.

Local Random Subspace Method for Constructing Multiple Decision Stumps	2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL ENGINEERING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Information and Financial Engineering	APR 17-20, 2009	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat Technol		machine learning; classification; classifier	LEARNING ALGORITHMS	We propose a technique of localized multiple decision stumps. The ensemble consists of multiple decision stumps constructed locally by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, decision stumps constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The idea of the local ensemble is that although no single function works well globally, in any local region a function should be capable of doing the classification. We performed a comparison with other well known combining methods using decision stump as based learner, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed method gave better accuracy.

Keyword-based spam email filtering techniques fall short to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes tactics to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are themselves patterns that can be modeled to combat spam. It has been observed that both Naive Bayes and ANN are best suitable for modeling spammer common patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that both of them achieve a promising detection rate of around 92%, which is considerably an improvement of performance compared to the keyword-based contemporary filtering approaches.

A SVM classifier based on RS reducts is researched in order to enhance the predicting performance in this paper. We firstly get all the attribute reducts; Then, every element is chosen from the set of all reducts and relevant SVM Classifiers are constructed respectively; Finally an enhanced SVM classifier based on RS reducts is obtained from them, which make great use of the advantages of RS in eliminating redundant information and take full advantage of SVM to train and test the data.

This paper proposes an intelligent model that can predict and control software development risks from an overall project perspective rather than focusing only on the single factor, project output. In this study, we first constructed a formal model for risk identification, and then collected actual cases from software development companies to build a risk prediction model. In order to evaluate the performance of our model, two machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are compared. The experiments show that our risk prediction model based on SVM achieves better performance in prediction.

But the threat level should be classified scientifically before a safety decision could be given. In this paper, a new machine learning method suitable for small-sample pattern recognition, called least squares support vector machine, is studied, and the optimization method for selecting the parameters of least squares support vector machines is presented. Then we built a security detection multi-class classifier for networked manufacturing and tested the model by classifying new security detections. The simulation results show that this method is efficient and feasible.

Supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, but the data labeling process can be expensive and time consuming. In this paper we present a kernel-based weakly supervised machine learning algorithm for relation extraction. It takes a small set of target relations as input. The goal is to automatically extract arbitrary binary relations from Web documents in the domain of football games. Bootstrapping is used to improve the performance of the system. We also compare the performances on different input example sizes. Experimental results show the effectiveness and benefits of our approach.

Landslide activity is quite notorious in this region, especially along the Danube's right river bank, and recently intensified seismicity coupled with atmospheric precipitation might be critical for triggering new landslide occurrences. Hence, it is not a moment too soon for serious landslide susceptibility assessment in this region. State-of-the-art approaches had been taken into consideration, cutting down to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, trained upon expert based model of landslide susceptibility (a multi-criteria analysis). The latter involved Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weighting influences of different input parameters. These included elevation, slope angle, aspect, distance from flows, vegetation cover, lithology, and rainfall, to represent the natural factors of the slope stability. Processed in a GIS environment (as discrete or float raster layers) trough AHP, those parameters yielded susceptibility pattern, classified by the entropy model into four classes. Subsequently the susceptibility pattern has been featured as training set in SVM and k-NN algorithms. Detailed fitting involved several cases, among which SVM with Gaussian kernel over geo-dataset (coordinates and input parameters) reached the highest accuracy (88%) outperforming other considered cases by far.

With the help of FCM clustering, the initial antibodies that image features of data set are extracted effectively, and then a clonal selection algorithm named CLONALG is adopted for each training instance to constitute the memory cells. Finally, classification is performed in a K-Nearest Neighbor approach with the developed set of memory cells. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm as a classification technique. Compared with general CLOALG algorithm for classification, the hybrid classifier not only decrease the computational time, but also can generate less memory cells without sacrificing classification accuracy.

The representative motion poses of an aircraft in the air are analyzed. Unfolding results of aircraft images in different poses show LLE has a natural connection to clustering.

Through the prediction of functional genes from amino sequence information, the experimental cost for new gene finding could be reduced. Results: We propose an effective machine-learning approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN), to assess the chance of a protein in rice to be disease resistant or not. Through feature reduction, 30 important feature correlated to disease-resistance are discovered. The feature selection approach results in 92.86% reduction of number of features. Afterwards, we construct a feature reduced classifier. The accuracy of the new classifier achieves 100% in resubstitution test and 72.13% in Jackknife test, and the Matthews correlation coefficient achieves 0.4419. Eventually, top 10 possible Xoo-resistant genes are found.

This paper brings in a new architecture which makes the control center smarter. This architecture uses real time data from EMS and WAMS to describe the current state of power grid. Upon the current state, different intelligent engines will be triggered. The triggered intelligent engine will tell the operator which is happening, how it happened, and how to do with it. The intelligent engines will be produced by both online modern and off line machine learning. And they form a growing knowledge warehouse makes control centre clever. The control centre becomes smart is an important part of smart grid.

This new pruning algorithm uses two or more post-pruning algorithms to prune a decision tree that has been built on training set by different orders, and the "best" tree is selected based either on separate test set accuracy or cross-validations from trees coming from result of the above step. The algorithm is theoretically based on occam's razor that is a simpler model is chosen if two models have the same performance on the training set. An experiment is implemented on three databases in UCI machine learning repository and the new algorithm is employed to compares with two well-known post-pruning algorithms. The results show that the hybrid pruning algorithm effectively reduces the complexity of decision trees without sacrificing accuracy.
