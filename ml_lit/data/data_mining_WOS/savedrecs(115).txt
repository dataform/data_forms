In this paper we primarily examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm to preprocess data before it is classified using the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. Genetic Programming is used to construct new features from those available in the data, a potentially significant process for data mining since it gives consideration to hidden relationships between features. A Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which such features are the most predictive. Using ten well-known datasets we show that our approach, in comparison to C4.5 alone, provides marked improvement in a number of cases. We then examine its use with other well-known machine learning techniques.

It is the same problem for health information retrieval. We propose in this paper to combine three knowledge-based methods to enhance information retrieval using query expansion in the context of the CISMeF project (Catalogue and Index of French-speaking Medical Sites) in which the resources are indexed according to a structured terminology of the medical domain and a set of metadata. The first method consists of building and using morphological knowledge of the terms. The second method consists of extracting association rules between terms by applying a data mining technique over the indexed resources. The last method consists of formalizing the terminology using the OWL-DL language to benefit from its powerful reasoning mechanisms. We describe how these methods could be used conjointly in the KnowQuE prototype (Knowledge-based Query Expansion) and we give some preliminary results.

Associative classification builds the classifier rules using association rules and it is more accurate compared to previous methods. In this paper, a new method named CSFP that builds a classifier from strong frequent patterns without the need to generate association rules is presented. We address the rare item problem by using a partitioning method. Rules generated are stored using a compact data structure named CP-Tree and a series of pruning methods are employed to discard weak frequent patterns. Experimental results show that our classifier is more accurate than previous associative classification methods as well as other state-of-the-art non-associative classifiers.

Visualization techniques are needed to analyse, explore, and enhance insight into these vast amounts of multidimensional data. There is an increasing need to discover correlations, relationships. outliers, or hidden phenomena within data sets. This is often difficult if data sets are represented in text form as spreadsheets. data tables, or as simple graphs or charts. In this paper, we present a short overview of visual data mining and focus on a new visualization technique integrating data mining. called a Hierarchical Dynamic Dimensional Visualization (HDDV) technique, for analysing and exploring large amounts of multidimensional data. Our technique overcomes screen clutter and the occlusion problem. The visualization technique enables visual feedback and direct interaction for analysts to generate queries and examine their hypotheses.

It was shown experimentally and theoretically that in order for an ensemble to be effective, it should consist of classifiers having diversity in their predictions. A number of ways are known to quantify diversity in ensembles, but little research has been done about their appropriateness. In this paper, we compare eight measures of the ensemble diversity with regard to their correlation with the accuracy improvement due to ensembles. We conduct experiments on 21 data sets from the UCI machine learning repository, comparing the correlations for random subspacing ensembles with different ensemble sizes and with six different ensemble integration methods. Our experiments show that the greatest correlation of the accuracy improvement, on average, is with the disagreement, entropy, and ambiguity diversity measures, and the lowest correlation, surprisingly, is with the Q and double fault measures. Normally, the correlation decreases linearly as the ensemble size increases. Much higher correlation values can be seen with the dynamic integration methods, which are shown to better utilize the ensemble diversity than their static analogues.

Queryball, which is a translucent ball, has search conditions, and two types of display methods. By locating a Queryball on the region of interest, users can observe just the objects they are interested in with emphasizing them and having other objects disappear. Users can change the region of interest by changing the area specification of the Queryball interactively. Although Queryball is useful for interactive analyze of various kinds of data, we need to consider and provide various usage of Queryball. In this paper, as the first step for providing such examples, we visualize seismic wave data and the underground structure of the earth. We apply some Queryballs to the results which are obtained by a volume rendering technique and an appropriate transfer function by examining the data distribution.

A data mining process oriented to model discovery using a combination of neuro-fuzzy neural networks and genetic algorithms, is combined with the estimation of probability distributions and error functions associated with the set of best discovered models. The analysis of this information allows the identification of changes in the internal structure of the process, associated with the alternation of steady and transient states - zones with abnormal behavior - instability and other situations. This approach is rather general, and its potential is revealed by experiments with simulated and real world data.

But in web environment, the user activities become much more complex because of the complex web structure. So user behaviours recovery and pattern definition play more important roles in web mining than other applications. In this paper, we gave a new view on behaviour recovery and complicated pattern definition. We used several methods to recover different user behaviours, such as simple behaviour, sequence visiting, tree structure behaviour, acyclic routing behaviour and cyclic routing behaviour. Based on various recovered behaviours, we raised how to define complicated usage patterns. These usage patterns include constraint association rules, constraint sequential patterns, deepest access paths, shortest access paths, tree structure accessing patterns, parallel visiting patterns, circle visiting patterns and so on.

In the process of constructing a tree, the criteria of selecting partitional attributes will influence the classification accuracy of the tree. In this paper, we present a new concept, weighted mean roughness, which is based on rough set theory, for choosing attributes.

J	Chen, TS				Chen, TS			Mining traversal patterns on the Internet	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; Internet; proxy servers; trip traversal patterns; user access patterns; World Wide Web	DISCOVERY	Mining traversal patterns on the Internet is one of critical issues for exploring the user access behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new data mining scheme for mining frequent trip traversal patterns on the Internet. First, we define a trip traversal as a historical contiguous sequence of web sites or web pages, which were surfed or visited on an information-providing system by one user. Next, we derive all of the maximal trip traversals by analyzing and filtering these collected trip traversals. For mining the large trip traversals from the maximal trip traversals, we present a data mining scheme integrated with the schemes presented in [4]. Here, the extracted large trip traversals can be thought of as the realistic frequent browsed behaviors for most of users either on a web site or on an information-providing system, such as a proxy server. Finally, we implement and design a data mining system to explore the large trip traversal patterns in order to capture user access patterns to some proxy server.

MVL functions are applied in logic design of multi- valued circuits and machine learning applications. Bi- decomposition is a method to decompose a function into two decomposition functions that are connected by a two- input operator called gate. Each of the decomposition functions depends on fewer variables than the original function. Recursive bi- decomposition represents a function as a structure of interconnected gates. For logic synthesis, the type of the gate can be chosen so that it has an efficient hardware representation. For machine learning, gates are selected to represent simple and understandable classification rules. Algorithms are presented for non- disjoint bi- decomposition, where the decomposition functions may share variables with each other. Bi- decomposition is discussed for the min- and max- operators. To describe the MVL bi- decomposition theory, the notion of incompletely specified functions is generalized to function intervals. The application of MVL differential calculus leads to particular efficient algorithms. To ensure complete recursive decomposition, separation is introduced as a new concept to simplify non- decomposable functions. Multi- decomposition is presented as an example of separation. The decomposition algorithms are implemented in a decomposition system called YADE. MVL test functions from logic synthesis and machine learning applications are decomposed. The results are compared to other decomposers. It is verified that YADE finds decompositions of superior quality by bi- decomposition of MVL function sets.

J	Mani, M				Mani, M			Understanding the semantics of sensor data	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article								Our system architecture to manage sensor data is described. Our data mining applications require past history of the sensor data. Therefore, unlike most present systems that focus on streaming data, and cache a small window of historic data, we store the entire historic data. Several interesting problems arise in these scenarios. We study two of them: (a) Given that a sensor can send data corresponding to its current configuration at any particular instant, how do we define the data that should be stored in the database? (b) Sensors try to minimize the amount of data transmitted. Also there could be data loss in the network. So the data stored will have lots of "holes". In this case, how can an application make sense of the stored data? In this paper, we describe our approach to solve these problems that enables an application to recreate the environment that generated the data as precisely as possible.

J	Popel, DV				Popel, DV			Conquering uncertainty in multiple-valued logic design	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						decision diagrams; discretization; information theory; knowledge representation; machine learning; multiple-valued logic		In modern science, significant advances are typically made at cross- roads of disciplines. Thus, many optimization problems in Multiple- valued Logic Design have been successfully approached using ideas and techniques from Artificial Intelligence. In particular, improvements in multiple- valued logic design have been made by exploiting information/ uncertainty measures. In this paper, we review well- known information measures in the multiple- valued domain and consider some methods of finding information measures for completely or incompletely specified functions with multiple- valued and continuous attributes. In this respect, the paper addresses the problem known as discretization and introduces a method of finding an optimal representation of continuous data in the multiple- valued domain. We also propose a technique for efficient calculation of different information measures using Multiple-valued Decision Diagrams. As one application of our technique, we outline an approach to synthesizing digital circuits derived from decision diagrams that can yield to reduction in power dissipation. The paper also shows the impact in several important areas of multiple-valued system design including ( i) fuzzy logic, ( ii) quantum computing systems, and ( iii) data mining.

To investigate the interaction between urinary calcium, oxalate, and citrate as major risk factors for calcium stones formation, their 24-h urinary excretion was determined in 30 children with urolithiasis and 15 normal healthy children. The cutoff points between children with urolithiasis and healthy children, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each risk factor alone as well as for all three taken together were determined. OneR and J4.8 classifiers as parts of the larger data mining software Weka, based on machine learning algorithms, were used for the determination of the cutoff points for differentiation of the children. The decision tree based on J4.8 classifier analysis of all three risk factors together proved to be the best for differentiating stone formers from normal children. In comparison to the accuracy of the differentiation after calcium and oxalate of 80% and 75.6%, respectively, the decision tree showed an accuracy of 97.8%. Even when its stability was tested by the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the accuracy remained at a very acceptable percentage of 93.2% correctly classified patients. J4.8 classifier analysis gave a look inside urinary calcium, oxalate, and citrate interaction. Urinary calcium excretion was shown as the most informative in discrimination of the children with urolithiasis from healthy children. However, it was shown that oxalate and citrate excretions might influence the stone formation in a subpopulation of the stone formers. In patients with low urinary calcium, a major role in lithogenesis belongs to oxalate, in some of them alone and in others in conjunction with citrate.

To acquire adaptation knowledge from cases in case base, comparable cases are selected. This paper also propose a similarity method for the selection of comparable cases. For simulation, the case of deciding automobile price is considered to look into how much the acquired adaptation rules through case comparison are effective in improving the precision of problem solving. Simulation results show that a system using the extracted adaptation knowledge provided higher precision of solution than a system supporting only case extraction, and even when the loss value of case attributes and case solutions were inaccurate, the acquired adaptation rules could improve the precision.

Nevertheless, there are cases in which a user is not allowed to access the database and can deal only with a provided fraction of knowledge. Still, the user hopes to find new interesting relationships. Surprisingly, a small number of patterns can be augmented into new knowledge so considerably that its analysis may become infeasible. In the article, we offer a method of inferring the concise lossless and sound representation of association rules in the form of maximal covering rules from a concise lossless representation of all derivable patterns. The respective algorithm is offered as well.

Accessing information of interest presents a challenge to scientists and analysts, particularly if the desired information is structural in nature. Our goal is to design a structural search engine that uses the hyperlink structure of the Web, in addition to textual information, to search for sites of interest. Our structural search engine, called WebSUBDUE, searches not only for particular words or topics but also for a desired hyperlink structure. Enhanced by WordNet text functions, our search engine retrieves sites corresponding to structures formed by graph-based user queries. We hypothesize that this system can form the heart of a structural query engine, and demonstrate the approach on a number of structural web queries.

This paper describes a machine learning approach to analyzing mutations associated to Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease. We apply SORCER, a second-order rule induction system to predict clinical phenotypes of OI from mutation and neighboring amino acid sequences in the COLIA1 gene. On the average, over ten 10-fold cross-validations, SORCER gives more accurate results than C4.5 with average accuracy of about 81.2%. The paper discusses the advantages and limitations of SORCER and demonstrates its use to provide initial exploration of biological sequences.

J	Zhang, H; Ling, CX				Zhang, H; Ling, CX			Numeric mapping and learnability of naive bayes	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								In data-mining applications, it is common to transform (or map) nominal attributes into numeric ones in order to apply a specific model. However, a nominal attribute has typically no specific order in its values and no geometric meaning. An interesting issue is, does such a transformation change the property of a nominal function? How do you measure the geometric complexity of a nominal function independent of the mapping? This paper discusses the issue of converting a nominal function into a numeric one. We propose a three-layer measure for the geometric linearity of a nominal function and explore the geometric property of a nominal function independent of the mapping. Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive-learning algorithms for data mining. It is well known that Naive Bayes is linear in the binary domain; that is, it can learn only linearly separable functions. We show that Naive Bayes is actually nonlinear in the nominal domain, a general case of the binary domain, by exploring the geometric property of Naive Bayes. We investigate the geometric property of Naive Bayes based on the three-layer linearity measure that we propose. Our work helps researchers to understand the influence of numeric mapping on the property of a nominal function, and how numeric mapping affects the learnability of Naive Bayes.

J	Cao, YY; Lim, EP; Ng, WK				Cao, YY; Lim, EP; Ng, WK			Data model for warehousing historical Web information	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						temporal Web data model; Web warehousing; Web operations	QUERY LANGUAGE	In this paper, we present a temporal web data model designed for warehousing historical data from World Wide Web (WWW). As the Web is now populated with large volume of information, it has become necessary to capture selected portions of web information in a data warehouse that supports further information processing such as data extraction, data classification, and data mining. Nevertheless, due to the unstructured and dynamic nature of Web, the traditional relational model and its temporal variants could not be used to build such a data warehouse. In this paper, we therefore propose a temporal web data model that represents web documents and their connectivities in the form of temporal web tables. To represent web data that evolve with time, a visible time interval is associated with each web document. To manipulate temporal web tables, we have defined a set of web operators with capabilities ranging from extracting WWW information into web tables, to merging information from different web tables. We further illustrate the use of our temporal web data model using some realistic motivating examples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Baranauskas, JA; Monard, MC				Baranauskas, JA; Monard, MC			Combining symbolic classifiers from multiple inducers	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						combining classifiers; machine leaming; data mining		Classification algorithms for large databases have many practical applications in data mining. Whenever a dataset is too large for a particular learning algorithm to be applied, sampling can be used to scale up classifiers to massive datasets. One general approach associated with sampling is the construction of ensembles. Although benefits in accuracy can be obtained from the use of ensembles, one problem is their interpretability. This has motivated our work on trying to use the benefits of combining symbolic classifiers, while still keeping the symbolic component in the learning system. This idea has been implemented in the XRULER system. We describe the XRULER system, as well as experiments performed to evaluate it on 10 datasets. The results show that it is possible to combine symbolic classifiers into a final symbolic classifier with increase in the accuracy and decrease in the number of final rules.

The features are based on resolution scale, invariant frequency information, entropy, and energy. They allow mixtures of beverages to be very precisely placed in principal component plots used for the data analysis. To show this we make use of data sets resulting from optical/near-infrared and ultrasound sensors. Our liquid "fingerprinting" is a relatively open analysis framework in order to cater for different practical applications, in particular, on one hand, discrimination and best fit between fingerprints, and, on the other hand, more exploratory and open-ended data mining,	Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Comp Sci, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; Inst Technol Carlow, Carlow, Ireland; Kingston Univ, Fac Sci, Kingston upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England	Kokuer, N (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Comp Sci, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.

A smoothness prior modeling approach (Smoothness Prior Analysis of Time Series, Lecture Notes in Statistics, vol. 116, Springer, New York, 1996.) is taken. In this approach, the observed series are decomposed into several components each of which are expressed by smoothness priors models. In the analysis of POS and GPS data, various useful information were extracted by this decomposition, and result in discoveries in these areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kudoh, Y; Haraguchi, M; Okubo, Y				Kudoh, Y; Haraguchi, M; Okubo, Y			Data abstractions for decision tree induction	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Discovery Science	DEC, 2000	KYOTO, JAPAN			data mining; machine learning; abstraction; classification		When descriptions of data values in a database are too concrete or too detailed, the computational complexity needed to discover useful knowledge from the database will be generally increased. Furthermore, discovered knowledge tends to become complicated. A notion of data abstraction seems useful to resolve this kind of problems, as we obtain a smaller and more general database after the abstraction, from which we can quickly extract more abstract knowledge that is expected to be easier to understand. In general, however, since there exist several possible abstractions, we have to carefully select one according to which the original database is generalized. An inadequate selection would make the accuracy of extracted knowledge worse. From this point of view, we propose in this paper a method of selecting an appropriate abstraction from possible ones, assuming that our task is to construct a decision tree from a relational database. Suppose that, for each attribute in a relational database, we have a class of possible abstractions for the attribute values. As an appropriate abstraction for each attribute, we prefer an abstraction such that, even after the abstraction, the distribution of target classes necessary to perform our classification task can be preserved within an acceptable error range given by user. By the selected abstractions, the original database can be transformed into a small generalized database written in abstract values. Therefore, it would be expected that, from the generalized database, we can construct a decision tree whose size is much smaller than one constructed from the original database. Furthermore, such a size reduction can be justified under some theoretical assumptions. The appropriateness of abstraction is precisely defined in terms of the standard information theory. Therefore, we call our abstraction framework Information Theoretical Abstraction. We show some experimental results obtained by a system ITA that is an implementation of our abstraction method. From those results, it is verified that our method is very effective in reducing the size of detected decision tree without making classification errors so worse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of auto-administrative systems is to administrate and adapt themselves automatically without loss (or even with a gain) in performance. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for some years. However little research has been achieved. This idea nevertheless remains a very promising approach, notably in the field of data warehousing, where queries are very heterogeneous and cannot be interpreted easily. The aim of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data themselves to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent item-sets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.

Our approach is to find variables we believe to be useful in the information logged by the tutor, and then to derive models that relate those variables to student's scores on external, paper-based tests of reading proficiency. Once the relationship between the recorded variables and the paper tests is discovered, it is possible to use information recorded by the tutor to assess the student's current level of proficiency. The major results of this work were the discovery of useful features available to the Reading Tutor that describe students, and a strong predictive model of external tests that correlates with actual test scores at 0.88.

In order to find relevant knowledge for decision-making, the user needs to really rummage through the rules. Visualization can be very beneficial to support him/her in this task by improving the intelligibility of the large rule sets and enabling the user to navigate inside them. In this article, we propose to answer the association rule validation problem by designing a human-centered visualization method for the rule rummaging task. This new approach based on a specific rummaging model relies on rule interestingness measures and on interactive rule subset focusing and mining. We have implemented our representation by developing a first experimental prototype called ARVis.

Most algorithms designed for finding association rules start with searching for frequent itemsets. Typically, in these algorithms, counting phases and pruning phases are interleaved. In the counting phase, partial information about the frequencies of selected itentsets is gathered. In the pruning phase as much as possible of the search space is pruned, based on the counting information. We introduce frequent set expressions to represent (possible partial) information acquired in the counting phase. A frequent set expression is a pair containing an itemset and a fraction that is a lower bound on the actual frequency of the itemset. A system of frequent sets is a collection of such pairs. We give an axiomatization for those systems that are complete in the sense that they explicitly contain all information they logically imply. Every system of frequent sets has a unique completion that actually represents all knowledge that can be derived. We also study sparse systems, in which not for every frequent set an expression is given. Furthermore, we explore the links with probabilistic logics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Wrapper agents may automate these tasks for the user. However, developing these wrapper agents for automating tasks on the Web is rather expensive, and they usually require a lot of maintenance effort since Web pages are not strongly structured. This paper introduces two programming languages for automating tasks on the legacy Web developing low cost, robust wrapper agents that may navigate the Web emulating browsers and may process data from the Web automating some user's behaviours. These languages are based on formal methods and W3C standards and are suitable for the legacy deep Web, automating tasks like data mining or information integration from different sources. A platform providing execution support to agents developed in these languages has been provided.

They generalize foreign keys, which are very popular constraints in practice. However, one seldom knows the set of satisfied INDs in a database. The IND discover), problem in existing databases can be formulated as a data-mining problem. We underline in this article that the exploration of IND expressions from most general (smallest) INDs to most specific (largest) INDs does not succeed whenever large INDs have to be discovered. To cope with this problem, we introduce a new algorithm, called Zigzag, which combines the strength of levelwise algorithms (to find out some smallest INDs) with an optimistic criteria to jump more or less to largest INDs. Preliminary tests, on synthetic databases, are presented and commented on. It is worth noting that the main result of this paper is general enough to be applied to other data-mining problems, such as maximal frequent itemsets mining.

Many practical and useful combination techniques work by using the output of several classifiers as the input of a second layer classifier. The problem of this and other multi-classifier approaches is that huge amounts of memory are required to store a set of multiple classifiers and, more importantly, the comprehensibility of a single classifier is lost and no knowledge or insight can be acquired from the model. In order to overcome these limitations, in this work we analyse the idea of "mimicking" the semantics of an ensemble of classifiers. More precisely, we use the combination of classifiers for labelling an invented random dataset, and then, we use this artificially labelled dataset to re-train one single model. This model has the following advantages: it is almost similar to the highly accurate combined model, as a single solution it requires much fewer memory resources, no additional validation test must be reserved to do this procedure and, more importantly, the resulting model is expressed as a single classifier in terms of the original attributes and, hence, it can be comprehensible. First, we illustrate this methodology using a popular data-mining package, showing that it can spread into common practice, and then we use our system SMILES, which automates the process and takes advantage of its ensemble method.

The core problem of distributed data mining and decision making technology does not concerns particular data mining techniques, because the respective library of classes can be extended when necessary. Instead of this, its core problem is development of an infrastructure and protocols supporting coherent collaborative work of distributed software components (agents) responsible for data mining and decision making. The paper is focused on architecture of multi-agent distributed data mining and decision making system, on its design technology, software tool and on the protocols of software tool agents' interaction, mainly, in distributed data mining and decision making processes. The presented software tool is implemented and validated on the basis of several case studies from data fusion scope.

Does this mean that they are useful and applicable in these areas only? Or, can they also be applicable in the other more traditional areas of science and engineering? What characterize the systems for which these paradigms are suitable? What are the goals of these paradigms? How do they relate to the traditional body of knowledge that has been developed throughout the centuries in the areas of mathematics, statistics, systems science and engineering? Where, how and to what extent can we leverage the conventional wisdom that has been accumulated in the aforementioned disciplines to develop a foundational basis for the above paradigms? The goal of this paper is to address these questions at the foundational level. We argue that the paradigms of OLAP, multidimensional modeling and data mining can also be applied successfully to complex engineering systems, such as membrane-based water/wastewater treatment plants, for example. We develop mathematically-based axiomatic definition of the concepts of 'dimension', 'dimension level', 'dimension hierarchy' and 'measure' using set theory and equivalence relations.

Three different data decomposition schemes and their impact on the pruning of distance calculations in tree-based k-means algorithm have been studied. Random pattern decomposition has good load balancing but fails to prune distance calculations effectively. Compact spatial decomposition of patterns based on space filling curves outperforms random pattern decomposition even though it has load imbalance problem. In both cases, parallel tree-based k-means clustering runs significantly faster than the traditional parallel k-means.

WebGuard uses Web crawler to extract relevant data from the Web, combines the textual content, the image content, and the URL name of a Web page to construct its feature vector. WebGuard uses data mining techniques to classify URLs into two classes: suspect URLs and normal URLs. The suspect URLs are stored in a database, which is constantly and automatically updated in order to reflect the highly dynamic evolution of the Web. When working, WebGuard simply captures a user's URL, matches it with the suspect URLs stored in the database and takes an appropriate action - filtering or blocking - according to the result of the analysis. Our preliminary results show that it can detect and filter adult content effectively.	Ecole Cent Lyon, Lyon, France	Hammami, M (reprint author), Ecole Cent Lyon, Lyon, France.

This new approach for maintenance, not only includes various on- and off-line diagnostic procedures, but also a "library of experience" represented by multiple design know-how, generator fleet experience, unit history, operational characteristics and OEM records. The capability for advanced diagnostic trending and assessment will be obtained by providing expert analysis of stator winding, rotor winding, and generator bearings through rapid remote communication with local stations and a remote server. The system comprises a so-called virtual working environment providing intelligent software agents to support human experts in diagnostic pattern visualization, analysis, trending and assessment.

The proposed method uses only publicly available data to train neural networks for predicting the outcome of greyhound racing. Several different betting formats are evaluated, including Win, Quinella and Exacta. The betting strategy based on the trained neural networks is as simple as possible, but still the suggested approach constantly beats the market (i.e. returns a positive result) for the harder formats. The presented technique could be used as a base for a more refined prediction tool for greyhound racing and similar domains. More generally, the paper serves as a demonstration of the power of neural networks when applied to hard and unusual data mining tasks.

This paper considers the problem of mining privacy sensitive distributed multi-party data. It specifically considers the problem of computing statistical aggregates like the correlation matrix from privacy sensitive data where the program for computing the aggregates is not trusted by the owner(s) of the data. It presents a brief overview of a random projection-based technique to compute the correlation matrix from a single third-party data site and also multiple homogeneous sites.

This has triggered the development of many privacy-preserving data mining techniques. A large fraction of them use randomized data distortion techniques to mask the data for preserving the privacy of sensitive data. This methodology attempts to hide the sensitive data by randomly modifying the data values often using additive noise. This paper questions the utility of the random value distortion technique in privacy preservation. The paper notes that random objects (particularly random matrices) have "predictable" structures in the spectral domain and it develops a random matrix-based spectral filtering technique to retrieve original data from the dataset distorted by, adding random values. The paper presents the theoretical foundation of this filtering method and extensive experimental results to demonstrate that in many cases random data distortion preserve very little data privacy The paper also points out possible avenues for the development of new privacy-preserving data mining techniques like exploiting multiplicative and colored noise for preserving privacy in data mining applications.

Spatial data mining is the branch of data mining that deals with spatial (location) data. Analyzing the huge amount (usually tera-bytes) of spatial data obtained from large databases such as credit card payments, telephone calls, environmental records, census demographics etc. is, however, a very difficult task. Visual data mining applies human visual perception to the exploration of large data sets. Presenting data in an interactive, graphical form often fosters new insights, encouraging the formation and validation of new hypotheses to the end of better problem-solving and gaining deeper domain knowledge. In this paper we give a short overview of visual data mining techniques, especially the area of analyzing spatial data. We provide some examples for effective visualizations of spatial data in important application areas such as consumer analysis, e-mail traffic analysis, and census demographics.

This paper presents implementation of these techniques for searching regularities in tables of context features of DNA sequences involved in transcription regulation. The goal is to discover regularities that interrelate nucleotide sequences with the functional class of these sequences. The search for regularities is implemented in a software system "Gene Discovery" which is based on first-order probabilistic logic. The "Gene Discovery" system provides a general scenario of functional annotation of an arbitrary nucleotide sequence. This system accepts molecular-genetical data retrieved from the database using SQL queries. Sequences of non-homologous gene promoters extracted from the TRRD database have been analysed using this system. Several regularities have been detected. These regularities relate the context of regulatory DNA nucleotide sequence and its location relative to transcription start with the functional class. Our approach based on Data Mining methods selects a specific oligonucleotide pattern for description of the functional class of a gene. The method relies to original Knowledge Discovery approach that can be used for wide variety of complex bioinformatics problems.

Elsewhere, we presented the Protein Mutant Resource (PAM), an online tool that systematically identified related mutants in the Protein DataBank (PDB), inferred mutant Gene Ontology classifications using data-mining, and allowed intuitive exploration of relationships between mutant structures. Here, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of PAM mutants. Although the PAM contains spectacular conformational changes, generally there is a counter-intuitive inverse relationship between conformational change and the number of mutations. That is, PDB mutations contrast naturally evolved mutations. We compare the frequencies of mutations in the PMP/PDB datasets against the PAM250 natural mutation frequencies to confirm this. We make available morph movies from PAM structure pairs, allowing visual analysis of conformational change and the ability to distinguish visually between conformational change due to motions (e.g., ligand binding) and mutations. The PAM is at http://pmr.sdsc.edu.

Response time is an important metric for data intensive e-services such as data mining, data analysis and querying/information retrieval from large databases where the focus is on the time taken to present results to clients. A key component of response time in such data intensive services is the time taken to perform the computation, namely, the time taken to perform either data mining, analysis or retrieval. In this paper we present a novel approach for accurately estimating the computation times of data intensive e-services.

These data concern the resistance or susceptibility of bacteria to tested antibiotics. Almost all microbiology laboratories follow standard antibiotic testing guidelines which suggest antibiotic test execution methods and result interpretation and validation (among them, those annually published by NCCLS2,3)). Guidelines basically specify, for each species, the antibiotics to be tested, how to interpret the results of tests and a list of exceptions regarding particular antibiotic test results. Even if these standards are quite assessed, they do not consider peculiar features of a given hospital laboratory, which possibly influence the antimicrobial test results, and the further validation process. In order to improve and better tailor the validation process, we have applied knowledge discovery techniques, and data mining in particular, to microbiological data with the purpose of discovering new validation rules, not yet included in NCCLS guidelines, but considered plausible and correct by interviewed experts. In particular, we applied the knowledge discovery process in order to find (association) rules relating to each other the susceptibility or resistance of a bacterium to different antibiotics. This approach is not antithetic, but complementary to that based on NCCLS rules: it proved very effective in validating some of them, and also in extending that compendium. In this respect, the new discovered knowledge has lead microbiologists to be aware of new correlations among some antimicrobial test results, which were previously unnoticed. Last but not least, the new discovered rules, taking into account the history of the considered laboratory, are better tailored to the hospital situation, and this is very important since some resistances to antibiotics are specific to particular, local hospital environments.

The study was performed using two nonlinear, nonparametric approaches, namely neural network and CART, to model the relationship between the qualities of the coating and machine readings. Furthermore, neural network sensitivity analysis and CART variable rankings were used to gain insight into the coating process. Our initial results show the promise of data mining techniques to improve the production.

We argue that the problem of finding salient features among all the possible ones is equivalent to finding outliers in a high-dimensional data set. We apply outlier detection techniques used in data mining to devise a linear time algorithm to extract the salient features. This yields a definition of saliency which rests on a more principled basis and also produces more reliable feature correspondences between images than the more conventional ones.

So, we put forward the concept of knowledge prescribing. Knowledge prescribing means that obtaining the theme information that enterprises need, offering the documents related to the theme to enterprises regularly, realizing the automatic classification and content analysis to the documents and sending the results to the enterprises regularly. Knowledge prescribing system consists of three parts: input-initializing module, web mining module, suggestion concluding module. This article introduces the input-initializing module of knowledge prescribing system, and discusses how to realize this module.

Database mining performs mining directly on data stored in (relational) database management systems (RDBMSs). The type of underlying database can vary and should not be a constraint on the mining process. Irrespective of the database in which data is stored, we should be able to mine the data. Several SQL92 approaches (such as K-way join, Query/Subquery, and Two-group by) have been studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on the K-way join approach. We study several additional optimizations for the K-way join approach and evaluate them using DB2 and Oracle RDBMSs. We evaluate the approaches analytically and compare their performance on large data sets. Finally, we summarize the results and indicate the conditions for which the individual optimizations are useful. The larger goal of this work is to feed these results into a layered optimizer that chooses specific strategies based on the input dataset characteristics.

To achieve this, we propose a method based on iterative rule learning using a fizzy rule based genetic classifier. Our approach involves two stages. First, a large number of candidate rules are generated for each class using fuzzy association rules mining and pre-screened using two rule evaluation criteria in order to reduce the fuzzy rule search space. Candidate rules, obtained after pre-screening, are used in genetic fuzzy classifier to generate rules for the classes specified in HDS, namely Normal, PRB-probe, DOS-denial of service, U2R-user to root and R2L- remote to local. During the second stage, boosting genetic algorithm is employed respectively for each class to find its fuzzy rules required to classify data; each time a fuzzy rule is extracted and included in the system. The boosting mechanism evaluates the weight of each data item to help the rule extraction mechanism focus more on data having relatively more weight, i.e., uncovered less by the rules extracted until the current iteration. Each extracted fuzzy rule is assigned a weight. Weighted fuzzy rules in each class are aggregated to find the vote of each class label for each data item. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Categorical attributes abound in databases. The Car Make, Gender, Occupation, etc. fields in a automobile insurance database are very informative. Sadly, categorical data is not easily amenable to similarity computations. A domain expert might manually specify some or all of the similarity relationships,. but this is error-prone and not feasible for attributes with large domains, nor is it useful for cross-attribute similarities, such as between Gender and Occupation. External similarity functions define a similarity between, say, Car Makes by looking at how they co-occur with the other categorical attributes. We exploit a rich duality between random walks on graphs and electrical circuits to develop REP, an external similarity function. REP is theoretically grounded while the only prior work was ad-hoc. The usefulness of REP is shown in two experiments. First, we cluster categorical attribute values showing improved inferred relationships. Second, we use REP effectively as a nearest neighbour classifier.

Traditional anomaly detection techniques focus on detecting anomalies in new data after training on normal data. To detect anomalous behavior, precise normal pattern is necessary. For this, the understanding of the characteristics of data on network is inevitable. In this paper we propose to use clustering and association rules as the basis for guiding anomaly detection in mobile environment. We present dynamic transaction for generating more effectively detection patterns. For applying entropy to filter noisy data, we present a technique for detecting anomalies without training on normal data.

This approach has a serious drawback. It cannot protect against novel types of attacks. Thereby there is a growing interest to application of data mining and machine learning methods to intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method for mining outliers designed for application in network intrusion detection systems. This method involves kernel-based fuzzy clustering technique. Network audit records are considered as vectors with numeric and nominal attributes. These vectors are implicitly mapped by means of a special kernel function into a high dimensional feature space, where the possibilistic clustering algorithm is applied to calculate the measure of "typicalness" and to discover outliers. The performance of the suggested method is evaluated experimentally over KDD CUP 1999 data set.

Many modern frequent pattern mining algorithms such as FP-growth adopt tree structure to compress database into on-memory compact data structure. Recent studies show that the tree structure can be efficiently mined using frequent pattern growth methodology. Higher level of performance improvement can be expected from parallel execution. In particular, PC cluster is gaining popularity as the high cost-performance parallel platform for data extensive task like data mining. However, we have to address many issues such as space distribution on each node and skew handling to efficiently mine frequent patterns from tree structure on a shared-nothing environment. We develop a framework to address those issues using novel granularity control mechanism and tree remerging. The common framework can be enhanced with temporal constrain to mine web access patterns. We invent improved support counting procedure to reduce the additional communication overhead. Real implementation using up to 32 nodes confirms that good speedup ratio can be achieved even on skewed environment.

This is the case of the prediction of harmful algae blooms. Though it's rare, the occurrence of these blooms has a strong impact in river life forms and water quality and turns out to be a serious ecological problem. In this paper, we describe a data mining method whose main goal is to predict accurately this kind of rare extreme values. We propose a new splitting criterion for regression trees that enables the induction of trees achieving these goals. We carry out an analysis of the results obtained with our method on this application domain and compare them to those obtained with standard regression trees. We conclude that this new method achieves better results in terms of the evaluation statistics that are relevant for this kind of applications.

The analysis of Web site usage, which was performed using different data-mining methods, revealed an increasing interest among the Slovene biomedical community. Patrons have often complained to librarians about information overload and difficulty in following all the Web site's enhancements. This situation called for a dynamic restructuring of the CMK Web site. Such problems are often solved with customisable and personalised library portals. Having limited financial and human resources, it was decided to customise and extend an existing library portal software solution (MyLibrary from North Carolina State University). The MyLibrary portal for the CMK was not only customised, but some important new functionality, most notably multilingual support, was added. This experience of developing a personalised library portal could be of interest to most libraries that offer information in at least two languages.

Such approaches are not suitable for applications where fresh data should be collected instantly since it reflects changes to customer preferences over some products. This paper targets those e-commerce environments in which knowledge of customer preferences may change frequently. But due to the very large size of past datasets the preference models cannot be updated instantly in response to the changes. We present an approach to making real time online recommendations based on an up-to-moment dataset which includes not only a gigantic past dataset but the most recent data that may be collected just moments ago.

It is difficult to cluster high-dimensional data objects, when they are sparse and skewed. Updations are quite common in dynamic databases and they are usually processed in batch mode. In very large dynamic databases, it is necessary to perform incremental cluster analysis only to the updations. We present a incremental clustering algorithm for subspace clustering in very high dimensions, which handles both insertion and deletions of datapoints to the backend databases.

A security policy server in the management layer should be able to generate new policy, delete, update the existing policy and decide the policy when security policy is requested. Therefore the security policy server must analyze and manage alert messages received from policy enforcement system. In this paper, we propose an alert analyzer with data mining engine. It is a helpful system to manage the fault users or hosts. The implemented mining system supports the alert analyzer and the high level analyzer efficiently for the security policy management.

Real-world applications of data mining require a dynamic and resilient model that is aware of a wide variety of diverse and unpredictable contexts. Contexts consist of circumstantial aspects of the user and domain that may affect the data mining process. The underlying motivation is mining datasets in the presence of context factors may improve performance and efficacy of data mining as identifying the factors, which are not easily detectable with typical data mining techniques. This paper proposes a context-aware data mining framework, where context will (1) be represented in an ontology, (2) be automatically captured during data mining process, and (3) allow the adaptive behavior to carry over to powerful data mining. We have shown that the different behaviors and functionalities of our context-aware data mining framework dynamically generate information in dynamic, uncertain, and distributed medical applications.

We have analyzed IHD data from 65 patients to provide an aid for decision-making. Decision trees give potent structural information about the data and thereby serve as a powerful data mining tool. Support Vector Machines serve as excellent classifiers and predictors and can do so with high accuracy. Our tree based classifier uses non-linear proximal support vector machines (PSVM). The accuracy is very high (100% for training data) and the tree is small and precise.

In general this diagnostic problem can be divided in many sub problems, each one dealing either with one morphological characteristic of the heart sound or with difficult to distinguish heart diseases. The sub problems of the discrimination of Aortic Stenosis from Mitral Regurgitation and the discrimination between the second heart sound split, opening snap and third heart sound, are used as case studies. Using signal-processing methods, we extracted the heart sound feature vector. Relevance analysis was performed using the Uncertainty Coefficient. Then for each heart sound diagnosis sub problem, a Specific Decision Tree (DT) was constructed. Decision Tree pruning was also investigated. Finally, a General Decision Support System Architecture for the Heart Sound Diagnosis problem, is proposed. The partial diagnosis, given by these DT, can be combined using arbitration rules to give the final diagnosis. These rules can be implemented by another DT, or can be based on different methods, algorithms, or even on expert knowledge. All these can lead to an Integrated Decision Support System Architecture for Heart Sound Diagnosis.

In many real applications, however, events are often grouped into different types, and not all types are of equal importance. In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient mining of temporal event sequences which lead to an instance of a specific type of event. Temporal constraints are used to ensure sensibility of the mining results. We will first generalise and formalise the problem of event-oriented temporal sequence data mining. After discussing some unique issues in this new problem, we give a set of criteria, which are adapted from traditional data mining techniques, to measure the quality of patterns to be discovered. Finally we present an algorithm to discover potentially interesting patterns.

Typically, association rules discovery is based on two criteria: support and confidence. In this paper we will briefly discuss the insufficiency on these two criteria, and argue the importance of including interestingness/dependency as a criterion for (association) pattern discovery. From the practical computational perspective, we will show how the proposed criterion grounded on interestingness could be used to improve the efficiency of pattern discovery mechanism. Furthermore, we will show a probabilistic inference mechanism that provides an alternative to pattern discovery. Example illustration and preliminary study for evaluating the proposed approach will be presented.

These feature patterns were originally extracted by sequence alignment algorithms, which measure similarity between an unseen protein sequence and identified protein sequences. Neural network approaches, while reasonably accurate at classification, give no information about the relationship between the unseen case and the classified items that is useful to biologist. In contrast, in this paper we use a generalized radial basis function (GRBF) neural network architecture that generates fuzzy classification rules that could be used for further knowledge discovery.

In support of the third generation of data mining systems on distributed and massive data, we proposed an efficient distributed and mobile algorithm for global association rule mining, which does not need to ship all of local data to one site thereby not causing excessive network communication cost. The algorithm is implemented in PL/SQL for coupling association rule mining with relational database system, well-used in organizations and communities. The experiments show that this algorithm implemented in PL/SQL beats classic Apriori algorithm for large problem sizes, by factors ranging from 2 to more than 20, and this gap grows wider when the volume of transactions further grows up.

This paper describes a fuzzy rule extraction method based on the mining generalized association rules from database. The objectives of the method are to improve the computational time of mining and the accuracy of the extracted rules for the actual application. In our approach, we construct a hierarchical taxonomic fuzzy sets structure in each attribute. Two algorithms are shown based on the structure and the Apriori algorithm. We propose a multistage fuzzy rule extraction algorithm and a multiscan algorithm. From the results of numerical experiments, our methods are found to be effective in terms of computational time.

The important contribution of this model is its ability to transfer local knowledge to a central knowledge base referred to as a central controller where the data is clustered and analyzed to identify similarities and variations. Central controller has the capability of transferring back its global knowledge to the distributed sources.

A more general k-means clustering procedure is developed that is suitable for use with very large datasets, such as arise in data mining and survey analysis. An exact assignment test guarantees that the algorithm will converge, and the detection of outliers allows the densest regions of the sample space to be mapped by tessellations of tightly-specified spherical clusters. A summary tree is obtained for the resulting k-cluster partition.

The data mining system should take advantage of overlapping of the mined datasets. In this paper we focus on frequent itemset mining and we discuss and experimentally evaluate the implementation of the Common Counting method on top of the Apriori algorithm. The general idea of Common Counting is to reduce the number of times the common parts of the source datasets are scanned during the processing of the set of frequent pattern queries.

In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting doughnut-shaped and smooth objects in 2-D medical images. Image objects of these shapes are often studied in medical applications. We present an O(IJU(U - L) log J log(U - L)) time algorithm, where the size of the input 2-D image is I x J, M is the smoothness parameter with 1 less than or equal to M less than or equal to J, and L and U are the thickness parameters specifying the thickness between two border contours of a doughnut-shaped object. Previous approaches for solving this segmentation problem are computationally expensive and/or need a lot of user interference. Our algorithm improves the straightforward dynamic programming algorithm by a factor of O (J(U-L)M-2/U log J log(U-L)). We explore some interesting observations, which make possible to apply the divide-and-conquer strategy combined with dynamic programming. Our algorithm is also based on computing optimal paths in an implicitly represented graph.

We keep track and remain the original user traversal paths in a web log, and apply the proposed data mining techniques to discover the complete traversal path which is traversed by a sufficient number of users, that is, non-simple frequent traversal patterns, from web logs. The non-simple frequent traversal patterns include forward and backward references, which are used to suggest potentially interesting traversal path to the users. The experimental results show that the discovered patterns can present the complete browsing paths traversed by most of the users and our algorithm outperforms other algorithms in discovered information and execution times.

Recognizing the importance of providing fast access to a variety of read-only applications in today's e-business world, we introduce the systems architecture for developing and implementing a flexible database system to achieve considerable gains in processing times of read queries. The key component of a flexible database system is query mining, the concept of determining relationships among query properties, alternative database structures, and query processing times. We validate the flexible database system concept through extensive laboratory experiments, where we embed learning tools to demonstrate the implementation of query mining.

Those query patterns can act as cache of the search engine, improving its performance. The cache of the generalized query patterns is more advantageous than the cache of the most frequent user queries since our patterns are generalized, covering more queries and future queries - even those not previously asked. Our method is unique since query patterns discovered reflect the actual dynamic usage and user feedbacks of the search engine, rather than the syntactic linkage structure of web pages (as Google does). Simulation shows that such generalized query patterns improve search engine's overall speed considerably. The generalized query patterns, when viewed with a graphical user interface, are also helpful to web editors, who can easily discover topics in which users are mostly interested.

Surprisingly, little or no relational technology has yet been significantly exploited in data mining even though data often reside in relational tables. Consequently, no relational optimization has yet been possible for data mining. We exploit the transitive nature of large item sets and the so called anti-monotonicity property of support thresholds of large item sets to develop a natural least fixpoint operator for set oriented data mining from relational databases. The operator proposed has several advantages including optimization opportunities, and traditional candidate set free large item set generation. We present an SQL3 expression for association rule mining and discuss its mapping to the least fixpoint operator developed in this paper.

Otherwise, a contiguous cluster could become split into separate clusters. We introduce a new algorithm for monitoring the degree of topology preservation of kernel-based maps during learning. The algorithm is applied to a real-world example concerned with the identification of 3 musical instruments and the notes played by them, in an unsupervised manner, by means of a hierarchical clustering analysis, starting from the music signal's spectrogram.

To meet such demands, a multimedia data mining framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed multimedia data mining framework analyzes the traffic video sequences using background subtraction, image/video segmentation, vehicle tracking, and modeling with the multimedia augmented transition network (MATN) model and multimedia input strings, in the domain of traffic monitoring over traffic intersections. The spatio-temporal relationships of the vehicle objects in each frame are discovered and accurately captured and modeled. Such an additional level of sophistication enabled by the proposed multimedia data mining framework in terms of spatio-temporal tracking generates a capability for automation. This capability alone can significantly influence and enhance current data processing and implementation strategies for several problems vis-a-vis traffic operations. Three real-life traffic video sequences obtained from different sources and with different weather conditions are used to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multimedia data mining framework by demonstrating how the proposed framework can be applied to traffic applications to answer the spatio-temporal queries.

A method is presented that can discover recurrent patterns from multiple flows of events, such as alarms and configuration events, as well as discrete information, such as traffic and usage, taking into account static and dynamic information concerning observed objects and their environments. This method can filter out theoretically useless patterns, using a novel technique for detecting chaos in sequences of events. The prediction accuracy of the discovered patterns has been measured using objects with dynamic behavior controlled by known and complex differential equations. The proposed mining method has been used for discovering and predicting alarms in a computer network composed of several Internet servers taking into account the alarm and configuration events history, as well as static information about these servers.

J	Parthasarathy, S; Dwarkadas, S				Parthasarathy, S; Dwarkadas, S			Shared state for distributed interactive data mining applications	DISTRIBUTED AND PARALLEL DATABASES			English	Article							SYSTEM	Distributed data mining applications involving user interaction are now feasible due to advances in processor speed and network bandwidth. These applications are traditionally implemented using ad-hoc communication protocols, which are often either cumbersome or inefficient. This paper presents and evaluates a system for sharing state among such interactive distributed data mining applications, developed with the goal of providing both ease of programming and efficiency. Our system, called InterAct, supports data sharing efficiently by allowing caching, by communicating only the modified data, and by allowing relaxed coherence requirement specification for reduced communication overhead, as well as placement of data for improved locality, on a per client and per data structure basis. Additionally, our system supports the ability to supply clients with consistent copies of shared data even while the data is being modified. We evaluate the performance of the system on a set of data mining applications that perform queries on data structures that summarize information from the databases of interest. We demonstrate that providing a runtime system such as InterAct results in a 10-30 fold improvement in execution time due to shared data caching, the applications' ability to tolerate stale data (client-controlled coherence), and the ability to off-load some of the computation from the server to the client. Performance is improved without requiring complex communication protocols to be built into the application, since the runtime system uses knowledge about application behavior (encoded by specifying coherence requirements) in order to automatically optimize the resources utilized for communication. We also demonstrate that for our benchmark tests, the quality of the results generated is not significantly deteriorated due to the use of more relaxed coherence protocols.

In this paper we present a methodology, together with its computational implementation, for the automated extraction of data-defining CNF symbolic rules from medical data-sets comprising both annotated and un-annotated attributes. We propose a hybrid approach for symbolic rule extraction which features a sequence of methods including data clustering, data discretization and eventually symbolic rule discovery via rough set approximation. We present a generic data mining workbench that can generate cluster/class-defining symbolic rules from medical data, such that the resultant symbolic rules are directly applicable to medical rule-based expert systems.

We investigate this problem within the framework of Temporal Data Mining. The concept of Precursor Rule is defined in terms of events and sequences of events. Precursor Rules relate Precursor Events extracted from input time series with Phenomenon events extracted from output time series. A methodology is proposed for extracting Precursor Rules from databases containing time series related to different regimes of a system. Given a fixed output time series containing one or more Phenomenon events, a key contribution of this paper is to show that the Granger Causality Test (GCT) can be used for ranking candidate time series according to the likelihood that Precursor Rules exist. Time Series Quantization is performed for extracting Phenomenon events and Precursor events, but GCT is applied to the raw time series, before Quantization and the definition of Event Types. The paper presents an analytic investigation of the utilization of the GCT for time series pairs containing impulsive time-localized structure. Following a number of approximations, the Granger Causality Index is related with the confidence of the Precursor Rules extracted from these time series pairs. An example from Network Security illustrates the effectiveness of the methodology. Using MIB (Management Information Base) datasets collected from real experiments involving Distributed Denial of Service Attacks, it is shown that Precursor Rules relating activities at Attacking Machines with Traffic Floods at Target Machines can be extracted by the method.

All information that we have at hand usually consists of more or less precise models of different parts of the process, some rules obtained on the basis of experience, and typically a great amount of high-dimensional data coming from numerous sensors and variables of process computers which convey a lot of information about the process state. We suggest in this paper the use of a continuous version of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to project a high dimensional vector of process data on a 2D visualization space in which different process conditions are represented by different regions. Later, all sorts of information resulting from the fusion of knowledge obtained from data, mathematical models and fuzzy rules can be described in a graphical way in this visualization space.

The incremental multiplexer problem is an extended version of the multiplexer problem, a well-known test problem for data mining systems that do classification. The multiplexer problem has been one of the testbed problems driving the development of classifier systems in the last 15 years, but it has one drawback: the number of different multiplexer problems that are interesting and solvable with current computers is very small. This paper describes a generalization of the multiplexer problem that has many instances that are accessible to today's researchers. The paper contains results showing how the performance of a classifier system with fixed parameter settings changes as the size of the message generated by incremental multiplexers increases, suggesting that the incremental multiplexer provides machine learning problems that "fill in the gaps" between the standard multiplex er problems.

One of the earliest inductive logic programming systems was Ehud Shapiro's Model Inference System [90], which could synthesise simple recursive programs like append/3. Many of the techniques devised by Shapiro, such as top-down search of program clauses by refinement operators, the use of intensional background knowledge, and the capability of inducing recursive clauses, are still in use today. On the other hand, significant advances have been made regarding dealing with noisy data, efficient heuristic and stochastic search methods, the use of logical representations going beyond definite clauses, and restricting the search space by means of declarative bias. The latter is a general term denoting any form of restrictions on the syntactic form of possible hypotheses. These include the use of types, input/output mode declarations, and clause schemata. Recently, some researchers have started using alternatives to Prolog featuring strong typing and real functions, which alleviate the need for some of the above ad-hoc mechanisms. Others have gone beyond Prolog by investigating learning tasks in which the hypotheses are not definite clause programs, but for instance sets of indefinite clauses or denials, constraint logic programs, or clauses representing association rules. The chapter gives an accessible introduction to the above topics. In addition, it outlines the main current research directions which have been strongly influenced by recent developments in data mining and challenging real-life applications.

Traditionally, relevance has been defined mainly by keywords and user profiles. In this paper we discuss a fairly untouched dimension to relevance: location. Any navigational information sought by a user at large on earth is evidently governed by his location. We believe that task oriented data mining of the web amalgamated with location information is the key to providing relevant information for personal navigation. We explore the existential hurdles and propose novel approaches to tackle them. We also present naive, task-oriented data mining based approaches and their implementations in Java, to extract location based information. Ad-hoc pairing of data with coordinates (x, y) is very rare on the web. But if the same co-ordinates are converted to a logical address (state/city/street), a wide spectrum of location-based information base opens up. Hence, given the coordinates (x, y) on the earth, the scheme points to the logical address of the user. Location based information could either be picked up from fixed and known service providers (e.g. Yellow Pages) or from any arbitrary website on the Web. Once the web servers providing information relevant to the logical address are located, task oriented data mining is performed over these sites keeping in mind what information is interesting to the contemporary user. After all this, a simple data stream is provided to the user with information scaled to his convenience. he scheme has been implemented for cities of Finland.

Such an estimation allows effective use of the testing resources to improve the modules of the software system that need it most and achieve high reliability. To achieve high reliability, by the means of predictive methods, several tools are available. Software classification models provide a prediction of the class of a module, i.e., fault-prone or not fault-prone. Recent advances in the data mining field allow to improve individual classifiers (models) by using the combined decision from multiple classifiers. This paper presents a couple of algorithms using the concept of combined classification. The algorithms provided useful models for software quality modeling. A comprehensive comparative evaluation of the Boosting and Cost-Boosting algorithms is presented. We demonstrate how the use of boosting algorithms (original and cost-sensitive) meets many of the specific requirements for software quality modeling. C4.5 decision trees and Decision Stumps were used to evaluate these algorithms with two large-scale case studies of industrial software systems.

To apply the "learning-from-data" paradigm to typhoon analysis, we built the collection of more than 34,000 well-framed typhoon images to be used for spatio-temporal data mining of typhoon cloud patterns with the aim of discovering hidden and unknown regularities contained in large image databases. In this paper, we deal with the problem of visualizing and classifying typhoon cloud patterns using kernel methods. We compare preliminary results with baseline algorithms, such as principal component analysis and a k-NN classifier, and discuss experimental results with the future direction of research.

Common approach in the extraction process is to represent a page as a "bag of words" and then to perform additional processing on such a flat representation. In this paper we propose, a new, hierarchical representation that includes browser screen coordinates for every HTML object in a page. Using visual information one is able to define heuristics for the recognition of common page areas such as header, left and right menu, footer and center of a page. We show in initial experiments that using our heuristics defined objects are recognized properly in 73% of cases. Finally, we show that a Naive Bayes classifier, taking into account the proposed representation, clearly outperforms the same classifier using only information about the content of documents.

We present two new algorithms for discovering temporal relationships: one is to preprocess an algorithm for the generalization of temporal interval data and to transform timestamp data into temporal interval data; and the other is to use a temporal relation algorithm for mining temporal relation rules and to discover the rules from temporal interval data. This technique can provide more useful knowledge in comparison with other conventional data mining techniques.

So data mining uses the same terms as database. This is an "incorrect" or confusing approach; though the syntax is the same, their semantics are very different. This paper presents a series of critique, and analyzes the current status and proposes a data model for data mining in both traditional relational and semantically richer databases.

We exploit clustering techniques for grouping structured and unstructured information extracted from e-mail messages in an unsupervised way, and exploit the resulting algorithm in the process of folder creation (and maintenance) and e-mail redirection. Some initial experimental results show the effectiveness of the technique, both from an efficiency and a quality-of-results viewpoint.

With SKSI, the Cyc knowledge base will be able to draw upon information obtained from multiple knowledge sources when answering complex queries, to assimilate (transform and store) the contents of the knowledge sources directly into the Cyc knowledge base, and to mediate between several semantically similar knowledge sources. These capabilities will extend the flexibility and power of the Cyc product to serve as the universal ontology and knowledge repository in any application requiring knowledge based reasoning. This article discusses some of the main technical issues of knowledge source integration, reviews some of the literature on the subject, describes some elements of the SKSI approach, illustrates two example Cyc queries that use two structured knowledge sources already mapped into Cyc, and proposes a Schema Modeling Toolkit of applications we are designing to leverage the core SKSI development.

This paper reports on an Army-sponsored study conducted to research the applicability of data mining for processing such data. The study focused on three aspects: (1) understanding the aviation operations, maintenance environment, and data collection system; (2) investigating data analysis approaches with the purpose of identifying promising methods pertinent to aircraft health management; and (3) defining requirements for a tool to support the aviation maintenance planners and fleet managers. Results of preliminary analyses of two maintenance data and flight data sets are presented. An architecture for managing and mining aviation maintenance data and using results to update models used by diagnostic modules for fault isolation during maintenance activity is also presented.

A version of the subgroup mining algorithm is described that searches for deviation patterns directly in a spatial database, automatically incorporating spatial information stored in a GIS into the hypothesis space of a data mining search. We discuss results obtained on a multi-relational biodiversity data set recorded in Niger. Vegetation records are georeferenced and associated with a set of environmental parameters. Further data provide information on climate, soil conditions, and location of spatial objects like rivers, streets and cities. The subgroup mining finds dependencies of a plant species on other species, on local parameters and non-local environmental parameters.

Special attention will be given to particular properties that make the technique suited for data mining. In addition to fitting of points for individual objects or subjects, additional points may be fitted to identify groups among them. There is a large emphasis on graphical display of the results in biplots (with variables and objects) and triplots (with variables, objects, and groups). The information contained in the biplots and triplots is used to draw special graphs that identify particular groups in the data that stand out on selected variables. Supplementary variables and objects may be used to link different data sets in a single representation. When a fixed configuration of points is given, the technique may be used for property fitting, i.e., fitting external information into the space. The method can be used to analyze very large data sets by assuming that the variables are categorical; when, however, continuous variables are available as well, these can be made discrete by various optimal procedures. Ordered (ordinal) and non-ordered (nominal) data can be handled by the use of monotonic or non-monotonic (spline) transformations. A state-of-the-art computer program (called CATPCA) is available from SPSS Categories 10.0 onwards.

The most important advantage of decision tree methods are based on compactness and clearness of presented knowledge and high accuracy of classification. In case of large data tables, the existing decision tree induction methods often show to be inefficient in both computation and description aspects. The disadvantage of standard decision tree methods is also their instability, i.e., small deviation of data perhaps cause a total change of decision tree. We present the novel "soft discretization" methods using "soft cuts" instead of traditional "crisp" (or sharp) cuts. This new concept allows to generate more compact and stable decision trees with high classification accuracy. We also present an efficient method for soft cut generation from large data bases.

However, in the transition from academic prototypes to commercial products there have been few successes with commercial Data Mining applications failing to stake any significant impact in the marketplace. In this paper it is argued that most Data Mining applications concentrate on the model-building phase of the Data Mining process and rarely engage the user in other stages. The paper reviews the challenges of producing successful Data Mining applications and in particular the role of information visualisation. Visualisation in Data Mining tends to be used to present final results, rather than playing an important part throughout the entire process. We argue that an immersive environment may provide the user with a more suitable interface than is commonly offered. We present a Virtual Data Mining Environment which attempts to integrate a Data Mining application interface and information visualisation in a seamless manner, using the concept of 'liquid data'.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				Data mining is the process of extracting implicit, valuable, and interesting information from large sets of data. Visualization is the process of visually exploring data for pattern and trend analysis, and it is a common method of browsing spatial datasets to look for patterns. However the growing volume of spatial datasets make it difficult for humans to browse such datasets in their entirety, and data mining algorithms are needed to filter out large uninteresting parts of spatial datasets. We construct a web-based visualization software package for observing the summarization of spatial patterns and temporal trends. We also present data mining algorithms for filtering out vast parts of datasets for spatial outlier patterns. The algorithms were implemented and tested with a real-world set of Minneapolis-St. Paul(Twin Cities) traffic data.

The state of hearing can be described via a measurement of polymorphic disorders in the voice structure that are secondary to restricted auditory control. The diagnostic voice analysis determines voice descriptors that can be used for marginal estimation of the state of hearing. This problem is hard for the most of predictive data mining methods. The presence of strongly correlated and redundant information in the set of voice descriptors might be one reason of low prediction accuracy. In this paper different feature selection techniques are evaluated by their ability to raise the prediction accuracy discarding irrelevant and redundant voice descriptors when modeling the dependency between functional changes within a phonatory organ and restricted auditory control. As far as the result of prediction varies for different prediction methods, the applicability of certain feature selection technique is considered with respect Of prediction method and evaluated in this paper as a feature selection strategy.

The data mining layer performs the primary activity of data mining, generates the shallow knowledge. The adaptive layer plays the main role in the intelligent system, which gets a user's intention, modifies a given data set, tunes parameters and generates an expert system combining the user's intention, the deep knowledge from the knowledge base and an obtained rule set, and executes the expert system to yield predictions. Feasibility of the intelligent data mining system will be demonstrated by using a simple example.

Unlike conventional data mining research, this workshop focuses on deep reflection into the meaning of patterns obtained from data. Since patterns are embedded in sets of real world objects, algebraic or geometric views on sets may play important roles. For this purpose, granular and rough computing are most important methodologies. In other words, granular and rough computing gives one of the best tools to analyze algebraic or geometric characteristics of patterns and data.

The analysis of the data on online customers has not been given adequate effort. The difficulty of accurate assessment of online customer behaviors is due to its complexity, disorganized knowledge about it, and the lack of effective and valid tools to measure and predict it. The technology of data mining has provided the opportunity to extract interesting knowledge from large amount of data. Since the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is one of the most powerful general nonlinear modeling techniques, we have built a back office analytical system based on it and returned our classification. and prediction results back to the consumer. The purpose of the research is to develop a system to help better understand customer online purchasing behaviors and to assist the customer relationship management campaigns of e-business enterprises. The system aims to classify online customers and predict their purchasing behaviors according to their demographics and attitudes toward online shopping. The data used for model building and testing was collected through a website. A group of students at City University of Hong Kong participated in the data collection process to provide their online shopping behaviors. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we compare it with other mature classification tools, namely, K-means clustering and multiple discriminate analysis (MDA) tools. The results show better precision with the designed system.

The site will confederate a number of massive variability surveys and enable exploration of the time domain in astronomy. We discuss the architecture of the database and the functionality of the user interface. An important aspect of SkyDOT is that it is continuously updated in near real time so that users can access new observations in a timely manner. The site will also utilize high level machine learning tools that will allow sophisticated mining of the archive.

Our work in this book focuses on this topic. To briefly clarify the background of association rule mining in this chapter, we will concentrate on introducing data mining techniques. In Section 1.1 we begin with explaining what data mining is. In Section 1.2 we argue as to why data mining is needed. In Section 1.3 we recall the process of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). In Section 1.4 we demonstrate data mining tasks and faced data types. Section 1.5 introduces some basic data mining techniques. Section 1.6 presents data mining and marketing. In Section 1.7, we show some examples where data mining is applied to real-world problems. And, finally in Section 1.8 we discuss future work involving data mining.

The heuristic backpropagation learning algorithm using a divide-and-conquer method is developed to enhance learning quality in term of discovered knowledge, training error and prediction error. Simulations have shown that the fuzzy neural network tree is able to discover meaningful fuzzy rules with low training errors and low prediction errors. In the future, the fuzzy neural network tree will have more applications in large-scale data mining and data fusion, machine learning, and eBusiness.

The problem targeted, which is frequently encountered in military/intelligence surveillance, is to mine a massive surveillance video database automatically collected to retrieve the shots containing independently moving targets. A novel solution to this problem is presented in this paper, which offers a completely qualitative approach to solving for the automatic independent motion detection problem directly from the compressed surveillance video in a faster than real-time mining performance. This approach is based on the linear system consistency analysis, and consequently is called QLS. Since the QLS approach only focuses on what exactly is necessary to compute a solution, it saves the computation to a minimum and achieves the efficacy to the maximum.

J	Ferscha, A; Johnson, J; Turner, SJ				Ferscha, A; Johnson, J; Turner, SJ			Distributed simulation performance data mining	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS			English	Article						distributed simulation (DS); performance data mining; Time Warp (TW); Chandy/Misra/Bryant (CMB)	DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION; TIME WARP	The performance of logical process based distributed simulation (DS) protocols like Time Warp and Chandy/Misra/Bryant is influenced by a variety of factors such as the event structure underlying the simulation model, the partitioning into submodels, the performance characteristics of the execution platform, the implementation of the simulation engine and optimizations related to the protocols. The mutual performance effects of parameters exhibit a prohibitively complex degree of interweaving, giving analytical performance investigations only relative relevance. Nevertheless: performance analysis is of utmost practical interest for the simulationist who wants to decide on the suitability of a certain DS protocol for a specific simulation model before substantial efforts are invested in developing sophisticated DS codes. Since DS performance prediction based on analytical models appears doubtful with respect to adequacy and accuracy, this work presents a prediction method based on the simulated execution of skeletal implementations of DS protocols. Performance data mining methods based on statistical analysis and a simulation tool for DS protocols have been developed for DS performance prediction, supporting the simulationist in three types of decision problems: (i) given a simulation problem and parallel execution platform, which DS protocol promises best performance, (ii) given a simulation model and a DS strategy, which execution platform is appropriate from the performance viewpoint, and (iii) what class of simulation models is best executed on a given multiprocessor using a certain DS protocol. Methodologically, skeletons of the most important variations of DS protocols are developed and executed in the N-MAP performance prediction environment. As a mining technique, performance data is collected and analyzed based on a full factorial design. The design predictor variables are used to explain DS performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Lau, HCW; Jiang, B; Lee, WB; Lau, KH				Lau, HCW; Jiang, B; Lee, WB; Lau, KH			Development of an intelligent data-mining system for a dispersed manufacturing network	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; OLAP; rule-based reasoning; dispersed network manufacturing; multidimensional database	WEB SITES; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; SUPPORT; DESIGN	Recent advances related to on-line analytical processing (OLAP) have resulted in a significant improvement in data analysis efficiency by virtue of its multidimensional database structure and pre-computing operations of measuring data. However, the research related to the design and implementation of OLAP, particularly in the support of dispersed manufacturing networks in terms of 'intelligent decision making', has yet to be considered as remarkable. Research studies indicate that the level of intelligence of decision support systems can be enhanced with the incorporation of computational intelligence techniques such as case-based reasoning or rule-based reasoning. This paper describes the development of an intelligent data-mining system using a rule-based OLAP approach which can be adopted to support dispersed manufacturing networks in terms of performance enhancement. In this paper, the techniques, methods and infrastructure for the development of such a data-mining system, which possesses certain intelligent features, are presented. To validate the feasibility of this approach, a case example related to the testing of the approach in an emulated industrial environment is covered.

J	Sadakane, K; Imai, H				Sadakane, K; Imai, H			Fast algorithms for k-word proximity search	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						proximity search; text retrieval; plane-sweep; divide-and-conquer		When we search from a huge amount of documents, we often specify several keywords and use conjunctive queries to narrow the result of the search. Though the searched documents contain all keywords, positions of the keywords are usually not considered. As a result, the search result contains some meaningless documents. It is therefore effective to rank documents according to proximity of keywords in the documents. This ranking is regarded as a kind of text data mining. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for finding documents in which all given keywords appear in neighboring places. One is based on plane-sweep algorithm and the other is based on divide-and-conquer approach. Both algorithms run in O(n log n) time where n is the number of occurrences of given keywords. We run the algorithms on a large collection of html files and verify its effectiveness.

These algorithms are based on techniques like finite elements, thin plate splines, wavelets and additive models. They all consist of two steps: First, data is read from secondary storage and a linear system is assembled. Secondly, the linear system is solved. The assembly can be done with almost no communication and the size of the linear system is independent of the data size. Thus the presented algorithms are both scalable with the data size and the number of processors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Our entire existence is a process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amount of data, Pattern classification is a key element in arriving at the solution. Engineering applications like SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making respectively. Although modern technologies enable storage of large streams of data, we do not yet have a technology to help us to understand, analyze, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data Mining is now the emerging field attracting all research communities. Pattern classification is one particular category of Data Mining, which enables the Discovery of Knowledge from Very Large Databases (VLDB). In this paper, mining the database through pattern classification has been done by utilizing two important mining tools called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Fuzzy logic concepts are also applied to improve decision-making capability of the network. The Artificial Neural Network used is a Fuzzy Multilayer Perceptron (FMLP) with Backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network. The concept of Knowledge encoding is incorporated in the FMLP that helps the network converge to the target quickly and thus reducing the search space. In addition, the fuzzy mean square error function is used in the training phase, which gives improved and efficient results over the conventional method. Genetic Algorithm is used for optimizing different parameters controlling the network in the training stage and reducing the total number of rules generated through the rule generation algorithm. Circular Backpropagation Network (CBP), which is the modified form of Multilayer Perceptron, has also been applied and its results are compared with the conventional one. Finally, the performance evaluation of all the networks are analysed and comparision is done with an inclusion of GA and without GA. The proposed methods have been tested on two applications like Image Segmentation data and Heart disease data. Simulation algorithms are implemented using C++ language in a Pentium pro machine and graphical results are obtained with the help of MS EXCEL package.

The main goal of the study was to summarize the experience gained over more than 20 years by a surgical team. To this end, two decision trees have been induced from data: a model M1 that contains a full set of prognostic rules derived from the data on the basis of the 20 available factors, and a model M2 that considers only the two most relevant factors. M1 will be used to explicit the knowledge embedded in the data (externalization), while the model M2 will be used to extract operational rules (socialization). The models performance has been compared with the one of a Naive Bayes classifier and have been validated by the expert physicians. The paper concludes that a knowledge management perspective improves the validity of data mining techniques in presence of small data sets, coming from severe pathologies with relative low incidence. In these cases, it is more crucial the quality of the extracted knowledge than the predictive accuracy gained.

Such techniques consider small windows of data from large data sets to give preliminary information of developing fault(s) or failure precursor(s). However, these techniques only provide information of a minute portion of a large data set, which limits the accuracy of predicting the remaining useful life of the system. Diagnosis and prognosis (DAP) techniques should be able to identify the origin of the fault(s), estimate the rate of its progression and determine the remaining useful life of the system. This research demonstrates the use of data mining and numerical visualization techniques for diagnosis and prognosis of bearing vibration data. By using these techniques a comprehensive understanding of large vibration data sets can be attained. This approach uses intelligent agents to isolate particular bearing vibration characteristics using statistical analysis and signal processing for data compression. The results of the compressed data can be visualized in 3-D plots and used to track the origination and evolution of failure in the bearing vibration data. The Bearing Test Bed (TSUBTB) is used for applying measurable static and dynamic stresses on the bearing and collecting vibration signatures from the stressed bearings.

In this paper, a skin cancer image database is created using a three-tier system: a client application implemented in Java applets, a web server, and a backend database server. JDBC-ODBC is used for the web server to communicate with the database server. Various browsing and content-based retrieval methods are supported for the skin cancer image database through web-based graphic user interfaces. A data mining algorithm for finding association rules between different features of the skin cancer images is also implemented.

Its use in data mining is growing very fast. Traditional clustering algorithms which no longer cater to the data mining requirements are modified increasingly. Clustering algorithms are numerous which can be divided in several categories. Two prominent categories are distance-based and density-based (e.g. K-means a,ld DBSCAN, respectively?). While K-means is fast, eas? to implement, and converges to local optima almost surely, but it is also easily affected by noise. On the other hand, while density-based clustering can find arbitrary shape clusters and handle noise well, but it is also slow in comparison due to neighborhood search for each data point, and faces difficulty in setting density threshold properly. In this paper, we propose BRIDGE that efficiently merges the two by exploiting the advantages of one to counter the limitations of the other a,ld vice versa. BRIDGE enables DBSCAN to handle very large data efficiently and improves the quality of K-means clusters by removing the noisy points. It also helps the user in setting the density threshold parameter proper!,: We further show that other clustering algorithms can be merged using similar strategy. An example given in the paper merges BIRCH clustering with DBSCAN.

The emerging data mining tools and systems lead to the demand of a powerful data mining query language. The concepts of such a language for relational databases are discussed before. With the increasing popularity of object-oriented databases, it is important to design a data mining query language for such databases. The main objective of this paper is to propose an Object Data Mining Query Language (ODMQL) for object-oriented databases as an extension to the Object Query Language (OQL) proposed by the Object Data Management Group (ODMG) as a standard query language for object,oriented databases. The proposed language is implemented as a feature of an experimental object-oriented database management system that is developed as a testbed for research issues of object-oriented databases.

This is obtained by combining inductive and deductive techniques. We also use different inductive techniques such as clustering algorithms, to derive data partition, and decision trees induction, characterizing classes in terms of logical rules. Inductive techniques are used for generating hypotheses from data whereas deductive techniques are used to derive knowledge and to verify hypotheses. In order to guide users in the analysis process, we have developed a system which integrates deductive tools and data mining tools such as classification algorithms, features selection algorithms, visualization tools and tools to manipulate data sets easily. The system developed is currently used in a large project whose aim is the integration of information sources containing data concerning the socioeconomic aspects of Calabria and its subsequent analysis. Several experiments on the socio-economic data have shown that the combined use of different techniques improves both the comprehensibility and the accuracy of models.

The index TDS is a valuable diagnostic parameter used in the diagnosis of melanoma. Both data sets were partitioned into training data sets (250 cases) and testing (26 cases). Two classifiers were used: the well-known k-th Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and the algorithm LEM2, a part of the data mining system LERS. KNN algorithm is a typical statistical method based on voting among k training cases that are as close to the tested case as possible. On the other hand, LEM2 induces rules, and then classification is based on voting among all rules that match the case. Surprisingly, both methods yield similar results. However, the KNN algorithm may produce a smaller error rate, but LEM2 offers explanation of its results.

Usually a learning curve can be fitted by interpolating or extrapolating some points on it with a specified model. The obtained learning curve can then be used to predict the maximum achievable learning accuracy or to estimate the amount of data needed to achieve an expected learning accuracy, both of which will be especially meaningful to data mining on large data sets. Although some models have been proposed to model learning curves, most of them do not test their applicability to large data sets. In this paper, we focus on this issue. We empirically compare six potentially useful models by fitting learning curves of two typical classification algorithms-C4.5 (decision tree) and LOG (logistic discrimination) on eight large UCI benchmark data sets. By using all available data for learning, we fit a full-length learning curve; by using a small portion of the data, we fit a part-length learning curve. The models are then compared in terms of two performances: (1) how well they fit a full-length learning curve, and (2) how well a fitted part-length learning curve can predict learning accuracy at the full length. Experimental results show that the power law (y = a - b (*) x(-c)) is the best among the six models in both the performances for the two algorithms and all the data sets. These results support the applicability of learning curves to data mining.

In this chapter, we propose several data modeling methods to incorporate spatial and temporal features of scientific Simulation data and investigate some of them in the context of developing models for predicting burst events in turbulent flow. We use the classification rules algorithm C4.5rules and support-vector machines on the turbulent flow simulation data to develop predictive models for identifying upward or downward velocity movements of the flow close to the wall as a function of swirl strength in the nearby region.

The classification results, taken as the models for the data, can be used for better understanding of the relationships among the objects in the database and for prediction of characteristics and features of new objects. Spatial classification is a challenging task due to the sparsity of spatial features which leads to high dimensionality and also the "curse of dimensionality". In this paper, we introduce an association-based spatial classification algorithm, called SPARC (SPatial Association Rule-based Classification), for efficient spatial classification in large geospatial databases. SPARC explores spatial association-based classification and integrates a few important techniques developed in spatial indexing and data mining to achieve high scalability when classifying a large number of spatial data objects. These techniques include micro-clustering, spatial join indexing, feature reduction by frequent pattern mining, and association-based classification. Our performance study shows that SPARC is efficient for classification of spatial objects in large databases.

Many businesses would benefit from examining customer habits and trends and making marketing and product decisions based on that analysis. However, the process of manually examining data and making sound decisions based on that data Is time consuming and often Impractical. Intelligent systems that can make Judgments similar to human judgments are sorely needed. Thus, systems based on fuzzy logic present themselves as an option to be seriously considered. The work described m this paper attempts to make an initial comparison between fuzzy logic and more traditional hard or crisp logic to see which would make a better substitute for human intervention. In this particular case study, customers are classified Into categories that indicate how desirable the customer would be as a prospect for marketing. This classification Is based on a small set of customer data. The results from these investigations make It clear that fuzzy logic Is more able to "think for itself" and make decisions that more closely match human decision and Is therefore significantly closer to human logic than crisp logic.

Information networks and huge data-storage equipments brought data-retrieval to new dimensions. Time-series are especially easy to accumulate as digital sensors can be used to fill databases without any intervention. This is both a boon and a problem as the very amount of data available prevents the user from being able to understand them. One has to build high-level representations of the time-series to be able to extract some information. Segmentation is often used in process-monitoring for similar reasons. In this paper, we describe step by step difficulties and solutions that we studied when adapting automated time-series segmentation to a real-world example of electric consumption analysis. The data that we want to analyze consist of yearly reports of electric power consumption in 10 minute ticks. We study industrial consumers that have simple processes (ovens, motors) switched either on or off for the duration of the process. Hence we could use this prior knowledge to model the time-series with piecewise constant changing mean models. We then extend the segmentation to a symbolic representation to enable interpretation of the overwhelming number of generated segments.

For example, we usually use some linguistic terms (e.g., young, middle age, and old) for dividing our ages into some fuzzy categories. In this paper we describe the extraction of linguistic association rules and examine the performance of extracted rules. First we modify the definitions of the two basic measures (i.e., confidence and support) of association rules for extracting linguistic association rules. The main difference between standard and linguistic association rules is the discretization of continuous attributes. We divide the domain interval of each attribute into some fuzzy regions (i.e., linguistic terms) when we extract linguistic association rules. Next we compare fuzzy discretization with standard non-fuzzy discretization through computer simulations on a pattern classification problem with many continuous attributes. The classification performance of extracted rules on unseen test patterns is examined tinder various conditions. Simulation results show that linguistic association rules with rule weights have high generalization ability even when the domain of each continuous attribute is homogeneously partitioned.

Methods such as association rules, chi square rules, ratio rules, implication rules, etc. that have been proposed in several contexts offer complimentary choices in rule induction in this model. Other than inductive and abductive logic programming, research into data mining from knowledge bases has been almost non-existent, because contemporary methods involve inherent procedurality which is difficult to cast into the declarativity of knowledge base systems. In this paper, we propose a logic-based technique for association rule mining from declarative knowledge which does not rely on procedural concepts such as candidate generation. This development is significant as this empowers the users with the capability to explore knowledge bases by mining association rules in a declarative and ad hoc fashion.			jamil@acm.org					Agrawal R., 1994, VLDB, P487; Beeri C., 1987, P 6 ACM S PRINC DAT, P269, DOI 10.1145/28659.28689; Brin S., 1997, P ACM SIGMOD INT C M, P265, DOI 10.1145/253260.253327; Chimenti D., 1990, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, V2, DOI 10.1109/69.50907; Han J, 2000, P 2000 ACM SIGMOD IN, p1 12, DOI 10.1145/342009.335372; Holsheimer M, 1995, P 1 INT C KNOWL DISC, P150; KONSTANTINOS F, 1994, P ACM SIGMOD INT C, P442; Korn F., 1998, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Very-Large Databases; Lent B, 1997, PROC INT CONF DATA, P220, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.1997.581756; LIU M, 1995, P INT S LOG PROGR, P83; Meo R, 1998, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V2, P195, DOI 10.1023/A:1009774406717; NETZ A, 2000, P 26 VLDB, P719; NETZ A, 2001, IEEE ICDE; Ng R., 1998, P 1998 ACM SIGMOD IN, P13, DOI 10.1145/276304.276307; Park J.

The goal of this paper is to discuss the blending of these areas to improve decision making for a variety of applications. The paper offers a conceptual model for integrating decisionmaking models, models for discovery of relations (computational intelligence models) and methods of visual correlation. Analysts use visual correlation for discovering relations and decision-makers use them for visualizing the decision under consideration. The model reflects this difference. The blending of these models is illustrated in the example of stopping cholera in London in the 19(th) century, The last part of the paper is devoted to systematization of visual correlation (VC) methods and their efficiency.

These features of XML offer both challenges and opportunities in information retrieval, document management, and data mining. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for preparing XML documents for quantitative determination of similarity between XML documents by taking account of XML semantics (i.e., meanings of the elements and nested structures of XML documents). Accurate quantitative determination of similarity between XML documents provides an important basis for a variety of applications of XML document mining and processing. Experiments with XML documents show that our methodology provides a 50-100% improvement in determining similarity, over the traditional vector-space model that considers only term-frequency and 100% accuracy in identifying the category of each document from an on-line bookstore.

End users of the data range from instrument scientists to global change and climate researchers to federal agencies and foreign governments. Many of these users apply Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) techniques to large volumes of data (on the order of a terabyte) received from the GES DAAC. However, rapid advances in computer power are enabling increases in data processing that are outpacing tape drive performance and network capacity. As a result, the proportion of data that can be distributed to users continues to decrease. As mitigation, we are migrating more knowledge extraction (e.g., data mining and data reduction) activities into the data center in order to reduce the data volume that needs to be distributed and to offer the users a more useful and manageable product. This migration of activities faces several technical and human-factor challenges. As data reduction and mining algorithms are often quite specific to the user's research needs, the user's algorithm must be integrated virtually unchanged into the archive environment. Also, the archive itself is busy with everyday data archive and distribution activities and cannot be dedicated to, or even impacted by, the mining activities. Therefore, we schedule KDD "campaigns", during which we schedule a wholesale retrieval of specific data products, offering users the opportunity to extract information from the data being retrieved during the campaign.

Therefore, when searching for specific keywords, it is desirable to eliminate occurrences where the word or words are used in an inappropriate sense. This task could be exploited in internet browsers, and resource discovery systems, relational databases containing free text fields, electronic document management systems, data warehouse and data mining systems, etc. In order to resolve this problem in this paper a method for the automatic disambiguating of nouns, using the notion of Specification Marks and the noun taxonomy of the WordNet lexical knowledge base [8] is presented. This method is applied to a Natural Language Processing System (NLP). The method resolves the lexical ambiguity of nouns in any sort of text, and although it relies on the semantics relations (Hypernymy/Hyponymy) and the hierarchic organization of WordNet. However, it does not require any sort of training process, no hand-coding of lexical entries, nor the hand-tagging of texts. An evaluation of the method was done on both the Semantic Concordance Corpus (Semcor)[9], and on Microsoft's electronic encyclopaedia (,,Microsoft 98 Encarta Encyclopaedia Deluxe"). The percentage of correct resolutions achieved with these two corpora were: Semcor 65.8% and Microsoft 65.6%. This percentages show that successful results with different domain corpus have been obtained, so our proposed method can be applied successfully on any corpus.

The system has three capabilities: detection of known and unknown malicious attachments, tracking the propagation of malicious attachments and efficient model update algorithms. The system filters multiple malicious attachments in an email by using detection models obtained from data mining over known malicious attachments. It leverages preliminary research in data mining applied to malicious executables which allows the detection of previously unseen, malicious attachments. In addition, the system provides a method for monitoring and measurement of the spread of malicious attachments. Finally, the system also allows for the efficient propagation of detection models from a central server. These updated models can be downloaded by a system administrator and easily incorporated into the current model. The system will be released under GPL in June 2001.

The platforms can be very general, e.g., ships, planes, robots, land based facilities, etc. Potential foes the platforms deal with can also be general. The initial version of the algorithm was optimized using a genetic algorithm employing fitness functions constructed based on expertise. A new approach is being explored that involves embedding the resource manager in a electronic game environment. The game allows a human expert to play against the resource manager in a simulated battlespace with each of the defending platforms being exclusively directed by the fuzzy resource manager and the attacking platforms being controlled by the human expert or operating autonomously under their own logic. This approach automates the data mining problem. The game automatically creates a database reflecting the domain expert's knowledge, it calls a data mining function, a genetic algorithm, for data mining of the data base as required. The game allows easy evaluation of the information mined in the second step. The measure of effectiveness (MOE) for reoptimization is discussed.

Earlier work on generalized association rules confined the minimum supports to be uniformly specified for all items or items within the same taxonomy level. This constraint would restrain an expert to discover some more interesting but much less supported association rules. In our previous work, we have addressed this problem and proposed two algorithms, MMS_Cumulate and MMS_Stratify. In this paper, we examined the problem of maintaining the discovered multi-support, generalized association rules when new transactions are added into the original database. We proposed an algorithm MMS_UP. Empirical evaluation showed that MMS_UP is 2-6 times faster than running MMS_Cumulate or MMS_Stratify on the updated database afresh.

While traditional cross-referencing consists in correcting catalog coordinates in order to seek nearest candidate, non-optical surveys tend to have lower resolutions and more coordinates uncertainties. Then, it seemed to be a loss not to use more light sources parameters obtained through image processing pipelines. A data mining approach based on decision trees (machine learning algorithms), we processed different FOCA/DPOSS sources pairs that we could suppose being the same stellar entity, and some other pairs, obviously too distant to match. Trees use every existing ultraviolet/optical parameter present on catalog, excluding only coordinates. The resulting trees allows a classification of any FOCA/DPOSS pair, giving a probability for the pair to match, i.e. come from the same source. The originality of this method is the use of non-position parameters, that can be used for cross-referencing various catalogs in different wavelength without the need to homogenize coordinates systems. Such methods could be tools for working on upcoming multi-wavelength catalogs.

The data unquestionably provide a useful source of information for supervisors and engineers to monitor the performance of the plant and identify opportunities for improvement and causes of poor performance. This contribution describes the use of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques for automatic analysis and interpretation of process operational data both in real time and over the operating history. Techniques studied include data pre-processing using wavelets and principal component analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, and unsupervised machine learning approaches as well as inductive learning for conceptual clustering. Examples and industrial case studies are used to illustrate these methods.

In this paper, we put forward a genetic algorithm approach for classification problems. Binary coding is adopted in which an individual in a population consists of a fixed number of rules that stand for a solution candidate. The evaluation function considers four important factors which are error rate, entropy measure, rule consistency and hole ratio, respectively. Adaptive asymmetric mutation is applied by the self-adaptation of mutation inversion probability from 1-0 (0-1). The generated rules are not disjoint but can overlap. The final conclusion for prediction is based on the voting of rules and the classifier gives all rules equal weight for their votes. Based on three databases, we compared our approach with several other traditional data mining techniques including decision trees, neural networks and naive bayes learning. The results show that our approach outperformed others on both the prediction accuracy and the standard deviation.

J	Wong, ML; Leung, KS; Cheng, JCY				Wong, ML; Leung, KS; Cheng, JCY			Discovering knowledge from noisy databases using genetic programming	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INDUCTION; GRAMMARS	In data mining, we emphasize the need for learning from huge, incomplete, and imperfect data sets. To handle noise in the problem domain, existing learning systems avoid overfitting the imperfect training examples by excluding insignificant patterns. The problem is that these systems use a limiting attribute-value language for representing the training examples and the induced knowledge. Moreover, some important patterns are ignored because they are statistically insignificant. In this article, we present a framework that combines Genetic Programming and Inductive Logic Programming to induce knowledge represented in various knowledge representation formalisms from noisy databases. The framework is based on a formalism of logic grammars, and it can specify the search space declaratively. An implementation of the framework, LOGENPRO (The Logic grammar based GENetic PROgramming system), has been developed. The performance of LOGENPRO is evaluated on the chess end-game domain. We compare LOGENPRO with FOIL and other learning systems in detail, and find its performance is significantly better than that of the others, This result indicates that the Darwinian principle of natural selection is a plausible noise handling method that can avoid overfitting and identify important patterns at the same time. Moreover, the system is applied to one real-life medical database. The knowledge discovered provides insights to and allows better understanding of the medical domains.

J	McClean, S; Scotney, B; Shapcott, M				McClean, S; Scotney, B; Shapcott, M			Incorporating domain knowledge into attribute-oriented data mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM	It is frequently the case that data mining is carried out in an environment which contains noisy and missing data. This is particularly likely to be true when the data were originally collected for different purposes, as is commonly the case in data warehousing. In this paper we discuss the use of domain knowledge, e.g., integrity constraints or a concept hierarchy, to re-engineer the database and allocate sets to which missing or unacceptable outlying data may belong. Attribute-oriented knowledge discovery has proved to be a powerful approach for mining multi-level data in large databases. Such methods are set-oriented in that attribute values are considered to belong to subsets of the domain.

The grammar's higher probability strings correspond to the user preferred trails and an algorithm was given to find all strings with probability above a threshold. Herein, we propose a heuristic aimed at finding longer trails composed of links whose average probability is above the threshold. A dynamic threshold is provided whose value is at all times proportional to the length of the trail being evaluated. We report on experiments with both real and synthetic data which were conducted to assess the heuristic's utility.

Knowledge organization aims at generating the set of most specific classes: the Generalization Space. It has applications in the field of data mining, knowledge indexation or knowledge acquisition. Efficient algorithms have been proposed for data described in <attribute, value> pairs formalism and for taking into account domain knowledge. Our research focuses on the organization of relational knowledge represented using conceptual graphs. In order to avoid the combinatorial explosion due to the relations in the building of the Generalization Space, we progressively introduce the complexity of the relations. The KIDS algorithm is based upon an iterative data reformulation which allows us to use an efficient propositional knowledge organization algorithm. Experiments show that the KIDS algorithm builds an organization of relational concepts but remains with a complexity that grows linearly with the number of considered objects.

Most work in this field has concentrated on the generation of such rules in the intermediate form of decision trees. An alternative approach is to generate modular classification rules directly from the examples. This paper seeks to establish a revised form of the rule generation algorithm Prism as a credible candidate for use in the automatic induction of classification rules from examples in practical domains where noise may be present and where predicting the classification for previously unseen instances is the primary focus of attention.

As the other papers in this volume illustrate, the Data Mining community has now turned its collective attention towards the Web as a fertile venue for research and development. In doing so, Data Miners have found themselves at the nexus of this conflict. We present the technical issues regarding privacy from two perspectives. First, from the perspective of the Web user who may be unaware of the degree to which identifying information can be inadvertently disclosed. And second, from the perspective of a Data Miner we consider the extent to which privacy enhancing technologies could substantially invalidate data mining results.

Most variants of decision trees test a single attribute at a node, leading to axis-parallel trees, where the test results in a hyperplane which is parallel to one of the dimensions in the attribute space. These trees can be rather large and inaccurate in cases where the concept to be learned is best approximated by oblique hyperplanes. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to use an oblique decision tree, where the decision at each node is a linear combination of the attributes. Oblique decision trees have not gained wide popularity in part due to the complexity of constructing good oblique splits and the tendency of existing splitting algorithms to get stuck in local minima. Several alternatives have been proposed to handle these problems including randomization in conjunction with deterministic hill-climbing and the use of simulated annealing. In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to determine the split. EAs are well suited for this problem because of their global search properties, their tolerance to noisy fitness evaluations, and their scalability to large dimensional search spaces. We demonstrate our technique on a synthetic data set, and then we apply it to a practical problem from astronomy, namely, the classification of galaxies with a bent-double morphology. In addition, we describe our experiences with several split evaluation criteria. Our results suggest that, in some cases, the evolutionary approach is faster and more accurate than existing oblique decision tree algorithms. However, for our astronomical data, the accuracy is not significantly different than the axis-parallel trees.

In this paper, we describe a scalable data warehousing and OLAP-based engine for analyzing WLRs. We have to address several scalability and performance challenges in developing such a framework. Because an active web site may generate hundreds of millions of WLRs daily, we have to deal with Huge data volumes and data flow rates. To support fine-grained analysis, e.g., individual users' access profiles, we end up with huge, sparse data cubes defined over very large-sized dimensions (there may be hundreds of thousands of visitors to the site and tens of thousands of pages). While OLAP servers store sparse cubes quite efficiently, rolling up a very large cube can take prohibitively long. We have applied several non-traditional approaches to deal with this problem, which allow us to speed up WLR analysis by 3 orders of magnitude. Our framework supports multilevel and multidimensional pattern extraction, analysis and feature ranking, and in addition to the typical OLAP operations, supports data mining operations such as extended multilevel and multidimensional association rules.

In particular, the mechanism of user-defined aggregates provided in LDL++ allows to specify data mining tasks and to formalize the mining results in a uniform way. We show how the mechanism applies to the concept of Inductive Databases, proposed in [2,12]. We concentrate on bayesian classification and show how user defined aggregates allow to specify the mining evaluation functions and the returned patterns. The resulting formalism provides a flexible way to customize, tune and reason on both the evaluation functions and the extracted knowledge.

J	Gyenesei, A				Gyenesei, Attila			Mining Weighted Association Rules for Fuzzy Quantitative Items	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								During the last ten years, data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, has established its position as a prominent and important research area. Mining association rules is one of the important research problems in data mining. Many algorithms have been proposed to find association rules in large databases containing both categorical and quantitative attributes. We generalize this to the case where part of attributes are given weights to reflect their importance to the user. In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining weighted quantitative association rules based on fuzzy approach. Using the fuzzy set concept, the discovered rules are more understandable to a human. We propose two different definitions of weighted support: with and without normalization. In the normalized case, a subset of a frequent itemset may not be frequent, and we cannot generate candidate k-itemsets simply from the frequent (k-1)-itemsets. We tackle this problem by using the concept of z-potential frequent subset for each candidate itemset. We give an algorithm for mining such quantitative association rules. Finally, we describe the results of using this approach on a real-life dataset.

An analytical model is developed for the central schedulers in such systems, which can be applied at various levels in a hierarchical modelling approach. The system involves a form of blocking in which clients must wait for one of a number of parallel 'instance servers' to clear its outstanding work in order that a new instance may be activated. Thus,blocking time is the minimum of sojourn times at the parallel queues. We solve this model for the probability distribution of blocking time and obtain a simple formula for its mean value. We then use this result in a flow-equivalent server model of the whole system and compare our approximate results with simulation data. This numerical validation indicates good accuracy for the blocking approach per se as well as for system throughput, the performance objective chosen for the exercise.

J	Hilario, M; Kalousis, A				Hilario, Melanie; Kalousis, Alexandros			Quantifying the Resilience of Inductive Classification Algorithms	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								Selecting the most appropriate learning algorithm for a given task has become a crucial research issue since the advent of multi-paradigm data mining tool suites. To address this issue, researchers have tried to extract dataset characteristics which might provide clues as to the most appropriate learning algorithm. We propose to extend this research by extracting inducer profiles, i.e., sets of metalevel features which characterize learning algorithms from the point of view of their representation and functionality, efficiency, practicality, and resilience. Values for these features can be determined on the basis of author specifications, expert consensus or previous case studies. However, there is a need to characterize learning algorithms in more quantitative terms on the basis of extensive, controlled experiments. This paper illustrates the proposed approach and reports empirical findings on one resilience-related characteristic of learning algorithms for classification, namely their tolerance to irrelevant variables in training data.

Recently, however, cost issues have received growing attention, see for example [1,2,3]. Cost-sensitive classifiers are usually based on the assumption of constant misclassification costs between given classes, that is, the cost incurred when an object of class j is erroneously classified as belonging to class i. In many domains, the same type of error may have differing costs due to particular characteristics of objects to be classified. For example, loss caused by misclassifying credit card abuse as normal usage is dependent on the amount of uncollectible credit involved. In this paper, we extend the concept of misclassification costs to include the influence of the input data to be classified. Instead of a fixed misclassification cost matrix, we now have a misclassification cost matrix of functions, separately evaluated for each object to be classified. We formulate the conditional risk for this new approach and relate it to the fixed misclassification cost case. As an illustration, experiments in the telecommunications fraud domain are used, where the costs are naturally data-dependent due to the connection-based nature of telephone tariffs. Posterior probabilities from a hidden Markov model are used in classification, although the described cost model is applicable with other methods such as neural networks or probabilistic networks.

In our previous works, we focus on the computing cost to derive associative keywords, we propose the method to determine system parameters, such as Minsup and Mincon f threshold values. Moreover we evaluate the ROC performance of derived keywords by weighted association algorithms. In this paper, we try to implement two kinds of Java applets in our Mondou system, such as ROC graph for selecting associative keywords and documents clustering. This visual interface shows characteristics of associative rules on the ROC graph with the Minsup values. It also provides the function of document clustering in order to visualize retrieved documents.

This paper argues that one of the key reasons for the large number of rules is that an inefficient knowledge representation scheme has been used. The current predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the if-then rules. This representation often severely fragments the knowledge that exists in the data, thereby resulting in a large number of rules. The fragmentation also makes the discovered rules hard to understand and to use. In this paper, we propose a more efficient representation scheme, called general rules & exceptions. In this representation, a unit of knowledge consists of a single general rule and a set of exceptions. This scheme reduces the complexity of the discovered knowledge substantially. It is also intuitive and easy to understand. This paper focuses on using the representation to express the knowledge embedded in a decision tree. An algorithm that converts a decision tree to the new representation is presented. Experiment results show that the new representation dramatically simplifies the decision tree. Real-life applications also confirm that this representation is more intuitive to human users.

It requires the development of stable and adaptive models that are capable of handling the typically very high-dimensional feature spaces. In this paper we present the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GH-SOM), a neural network model based on the self-organizing map. The main feature of this extended model is its capability of growing both in terms of map size as well as in a three-dimensional tree-structure in order to represent the hierarchical structure present in a data collection. This capability, combined with the stability of the self-organizing map for high-dimensional feature space representation, makes it an ideal tool for data analysis and exploration. We demonstrate the potential of this method with an application from the information retrieval domain, which is prototypical of the high-dimensional feature spaces frequently encountered in today's applications.

Information extraction (IE) is a form of shallow text understanding that locates specific pieces of data in natural language documents, transforming unstructured text into a structured database. This paper describes a system called DISCOTEX, that combines IE and data mining methodologies to perform text mining as well as improve the performance of the underlying extraction system. Rules mined from a database extracted from a corpus of texts are used to predict additional information to extract from future documents, thereby improving the recall of IE. Encouraging results are presented on applying these techniques to a corpus of computer job postings from an Internet newsgroup.

It gives a nicely interpretable way of controlling the trade-off between minimizing training error and capacity.

In this study, variable as predictors of bankruptcy had been selected by three Al-based data mining techniques and two conventional statistical methods, Logit analysis and Stepwise. After the selection of a set of variables for every method, discriminant power of each set was compared to verify the most suitable data mining technique to select financial variables. Finally, the study concludes that a set of variables selected by Logit analysis (with logit model) indicated the best discriminant power, more than 87% accuracy.

These dissolved gases can be extracted and identified with the application of gas chromatography. The overall process, from oil sampling to gas identification, is known as dissolved gas analysis (DGA). In this paper, comparison of conventional DGA interpretation schemes is briefly presented. Moreover, some new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for transformer incipient fault diagnosis based on DGA data, are also discussed. The second part of the paper reports on the initial work performed for the proposed new approach. This includes simple statistical analysis on DGA records and is followed by high-level data-mining (DM) using self-organising map (SOM) algorithm. The inherent data 'structure' revealed from the latter part of the analysis could hypothetically be associated with certain transformer faults, either electrical, thermal or cellulose decomposition. The proposed approach could provide a viable alternative for transformer incipient fault diagnosis and condition-monitoring applications.

Therefore, we need to recognize timely what any kind of failure causes affect to total yield quantitatively to decide the countermeasures for yield improvement. Collected data for data analysis involve the noise with various influences. For example, analyzing all collected data always does not bring us precious correlation between the collected data. We prefer to adapt a new method to get more precious information. We have got many success stories for yield improvement by DATA MINING which is one of the statistical methods, now we have succeeded in developing a method to clarify the correlation between yield and various wafer parametrical data value, because the data can be extracted to reduce the influence of the manufacturing fluctuation automatically.

We describe a system implementing the four steps in ODA, focusing our attention on the data-mining step where our goal is to predict the value of a performance parameter (e.g., response time, cpu utilization, memory utilization) in the future. Our approach to the prediction problem extracts patterns from a database containing information from thousands of historical records and across computers. We show empirically how a multivariate linear regression model applied on all available records outperforms 1) a linear univariate model per machine, 2) a linear multivariate model per machine, and 3) a decision tree for regression across all machines. We conclude that global patterns relating characteristics across different computer models exist and can be extracted to improve the accuracy in predicting future performance behavior.

The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. As our computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, Mle argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, Mle apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn more and more quickly in an integrated visual data-mining environment.

J	Yaginuma, Y				Yaginuma, Y			High-performance data mining system	FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								Extensive research and development into data mining systems has been done to enable businesses to extract valuable information from very large amounts of data and then use that information to develop business strategies. A data mining system should provide multiple analysis technologies (mining engines) so that the user can select a technique that suits the characteristics of the data to be analyzed and the way in which the extracted information will be used. Also, it must have an architecture that is flexible enough for use with a general-purpose system and must be customizable for a specific business purpose. In this paper, we describe the overall architecture and the mining engines of a data mining system that Fujitsu Laboratories has developed and installed in a Fujitsu product called "SymfoWARE Mining Server." Then, we describe the advantages of Memory-Based Reasoning (MBR), which is one of the mining engines supported by SymfoWARE Mining Server; some enhancements made for applications to real business problems; and an example application which shows the efficiency of this system. Finally, we look at two directions in which advanced data mining systems might evolve.

One aspect of text mining is on automatic text categorization, which assigns a text document to some predefined category according to the correlation between the document and the category. Traditionally the categories are arranged in hierarchical manner to achieve effective searching and indexing as well as easy comprehension for human. The determination of categories and their hierarchical structures were most done by human experts. In this work, we developed an approach to automatically generate categories and reveal the hierarchical structure among them. We also used the generated structure to categorize text documents. The document collection is trained by a self-organizing map to form two feature maps. We then analyzed the two maps to obtain the categories and the structure among them. Although the corpus contains documents written in Chinese, the proposed approach can be applied to documents written in any language and such documents can be transformed into a list of separated terms.

Identification or prediction of transcribed sequences from within genomic DNA has been a major rate-limiting step in the pursuit of genes. Programs currently available are far from being powerful enough to elucidate the gene structure completely. Here we develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) to represent the degeneracy features of splicing junction acceptor sites in eukaryotic genes. The HMM system is fully trained using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the system performance is evaluated using the 10-way cross-validation method. Experimental results show that our HMM system can correctly classify more than 94% of the candidate sequences (including true and false acceptor sites) into right categories. About 90% of the true acceptor sites and 96% of the false acceptor sites in the test data are classified correctly. These results are very promising considering that only the local information in DNA is used. The proposed model will be a very important component of an effective and accurate gene structure detection system currently being developed in our lab.

Currently database systems are dominated by relational database and the ability to perform data mining using standard SQL queries will definitely ease implementation of data mining. However the performance of SQL based data mining is known to fall behind specialized implementation and expensive mining tools being on sale. In this paper we present an evaluation of SQL based data mining on commercial RDBMS (IBM DB2 UDB EEE). We examine some techniques to reduce I/O cost by using View and Subquery. Those queries can be more than 6 times faster than SETM SQL query reported previously. In addition, we have made performance evaluation on parallel database environment and compared the performance result with commercial data mining tool (IBM Intelligent Miner). We prove that SQL based data mining can achieve sufficient performance by the utilization of SQL query customization and database tuning. Keywords: data mining, parallel SQL, query optimization, commercial RDBMS.

This paper describes the development of the Modeler's Workspace, a digital library system we are building to improve the researcher's means of accessing, managing and sharing neuroscience data. The Workspace consists of a distributed system of heterogeneous databases, and a Java front-end for data mining and visualization. A three-tier architecture with CORBA as the middleware facilitates database federation. We discuss our design choices, and some sociological issues, such as how to encourage data submission and ensure security and quality control. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Data mining is to analyze all the data in such a database and to obtain useful information for database users. One of the well-studied problems in data mining is the search for meaningful association rules in a market basket database which contains massive amounts of transactions. One way to find meaningful association rules is to find all the large itemsets first, and then to find meaningful association rules from the large itemsets. Although a number of algorithms for computing all the large itemsets have been proposed, the computational complexity of them is scarcely disscussed. In this paper, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists a large itemset that has a given cardinality. Also, we propose subclasses of databases in which ail the meaningful association rules can be computed in time polynomial of the size of a database.

We present a data mining tool which addresses both the discovery and update of causal networks hidden in database systems. It contributes to the discovery of knowledge which links rules-knowledge which would normally be considered domain knowledge (to be elicited from domain experts). We used different methods for generating networks such as our heuristic algorithm (HNG), which is briefly discussed in this paper. Evaluation of such knowledge presents difficulties but some anecdotal appraisal is presented here in the form of a simple case study. Applications of this prototype with its new causal updating supplement are under way. Our approach is based on Evidence Theory and offers important advantages over conventional Bayesian methods for the applications envisaged. These approaches allow certainty levels of rules in causal networks to be kept up to date. When a causal network has been discovered, any subsequent new evidence may be fed into the model. After updating the belief function for any node the complete network is updated through communication between neighbouring nodes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The second step of the process makes use of the concatenation product to get a global context in which binary relations of individual contexts coexist with relations produced by the application of some operators to individual contexts. The last step permits the discovery of concepts and implication rules using the concept lattice as a framework in order to discover and interpret nontrivial concepts and rules that may relate different components of complex objects. This paper focuses on two main steps of the knowledge discovery process, namely data mining and interpretation.

Recently, a lot of effort has been put into the development of effective clustering algorithms for spatial data mining. These algorithms are mainly developed to deal with continuous valued attributes. They typically use a distance measure defined in the Euclidean space to determine if two records should be placed in the same or in disjoint clusters. Since such a distance measure cannot be validly defined in non-Euclidean space, these algorithms cannot be used to handle databases that contain records characterized also by discrete qualitative or categorical values. Owing to the fact that there is usually a mixture of both continuous and discrete valued attributes in many real-world databases, it is important that a clustering algorithm should be developed to handle data mining tasks involving them. in this paper, we present such a clustering algorithm. The algorithm can be divided into two phases: a discretization phase and a genetic algorithm-based clustering phase. The first phase involves discretizing continuous attributes into discrete attributes based on the use of an information theoretic measure that minimizes loss of information during such process. These discretized and the discrete attributes are then used in the second phase. In this phase, clustering is carried out using a genetic algorithm. By representing a specific grouping of records in a chromosome and using a weight of evidence measure as a fitness measure to determine if such grouping is meaningful, we present here an effective GA for data clustering. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we tested it using some real data. The experimental results showed that it is very promising.

Experimental results show the obtained classifiers, learned using the CI based algorithms, are competitive with (or superior to) the best known classifiers, based on both Bayesian networks and other formalisms; and that the computational time for learning and using these classifiers is relatively small. Moreover, these results also suggest a way to learn yet more effective classifiers; we demonstrate empirically that this new algorithm does work as expected. Collectively, these results argue that BN classifiers deserve more attention in machine learning and data mining communities.

It consists in testing deaf people by speech signal delivered through a ball shaped microelectrode connected to the modulated current source and attached to the promontory area. The electric current delivered to the ball shaped electrode is modulated with real speech signal which is transposed downwards the frequency scale. A computer database of patients' data and electrostimulation test results has been created. This database was analyzed using the rough set method in order to find rules allowing prediction of hearing recovery of cochlear implantation candidates. The Rough Set Class Library (RSCL) has been developed in order to implement data mining procedures to the engineered database of electrostimulation test results. The RSC Library supports symbolic approach to data processing. Additionally, the library is equipped with a set of data quantization methods that may be a part of an interface between external data environment and the rough set-based kernel of the system. The results of studies in the domain of prediction of post-operative profits of deaf patients based on the rough set analysis of electrostimulation test database are presented and discussed in the paper.

Given a training database of records, each tagged with a class label, the goal of classification is to build a concise model that can be used to predict the class label of future, unlabeled records. A very popular class of classifiers are decision trees. All current algorithms to construct decision trees, including all main-memory algorithms, make one scan over the training database per level of the tree. We introduce a new algorithm (BOAT) for decision tree construction that improves upon earlier algorithms in both performance and functionality. BOAT constructs several levels of the tree in only two scans over the training database, resulting in an average performance gain of 300% over previous work. The key to this performance improvement is a novel optimistic approach to tree construction in which we construct an initial tree using a small subset of the data and refine it to arrive at the final tree. We guarantee that any difference with respect to the "real" tree (i.e., the tree that would be constructed by examining all the data in a traditional way) is detected and corrected. The correction step occasionally requires us to make additional scans over subsets of the data; typically, this situation rarely arises, and can be addressed with little added cost. Beyond offering faster tree construction, BOAT is the first scalable algorithm with the ability to incrementally update the tree with respect to both insertions and deletions over the dataset. This property is valuable in dynamic environments such as data warehouses, in which the training dataset changes over time. The BOAT update operation is much cheaper than completely rebuilding the tree, and the resulting tree is guaranteed to be identical to the tree that would be produced by a complete re-build.

A generalized association rule is derived from regularities of data patterns, which are found in the database under a given data hierarchy with enough frequencies. The pattern search is a central part of data mining of this type and occupies most of the running time. In this paper, we regard a data pattern as a partial-match query in partial-match retrieval then the pattern search becomes a problem to find partial-match queries of which answers include sufficient number of database records. The proposed method consists of a selective enumeration of candidate queries and an efficient partial-match retrieval using signatures. A signature, which is a bit sequence of fixed length, is associated with data, a record and a query. The answer for a query is fast computed by bit operations among the signatures. The proposed data mining method is realized based on an extended signature method that can deal with a data hierarchy. We also discuss design issues and mathematical properties of the method.

The applications of clustering cover customer segmentation, catalog design, store layout, stock market segmentation, etc. In this paper, we consider the problem of discovering similarity-based clusters in a large database of event sequences. We introduce a hierarchical algorithm that uses sequential patterns found in the database to efficiently generate both the clustering model and data clusters. The algorithm iteratively merges smaller, similar clusters into bigger ones until the requested number of clusters is reached. In the absence of a well-defined metric space, we propose the similarity measure, which is used in cluster merging. The advantage of the proposed measure is that no additional access to the source database is needed to evaluate the inter-cluster similarities.

An integration technique should be able to estimate and select the most appropriate component classifiers from the ensemble. We present two variations of an advanced dynamic integration technique with two distance metrics. The technique is one variation of the stacked generalization method with an assumption that each of the component classifiers is the best one inside a certain sub area of the whole domain area. Our technique includes two phases: the learning phase and the application phase. During the learning phase a performance matrix of each component classifier is derived using the instances of the training set. Each matrix thus includes in a way information concerning the "competence area" of the corresponding component classifier. These matrixes are used during the application phase to predict the performance of each component classifier in each new instance. The technique is evaluated on three data sets taken from the UCI machine learning repository, with which well-known classification methods have not worked very well. The comparison results show that our dynamic integration technique outperforms weighted voting and cross-validation majority techniques in some data sets.

Construction of good classifiers is computationally intensive and offers plenty of scope for parallelization. Divide-and-conquer paradigm can be used to efficiently construct decision tree classifiers. We discuss in detail various techniques for parallel divide-and-conquer and extend these techniques to handle efficiently disk-resident data. Furthermore, a generic technique for parallel out-of-core divide-and-conquer problems is suggested We present pCLOUDS, the parallel version of the decision tree classifier algorithm CLOUDS, capable of handling large out-of-core data sets. pCLOUDS exhibits excellent speedup, sizeup and scaleup properties which make it a competitive tool for data mining applications. We evaluate the performance of pCLOUDS for a range of synthetic darn sets on the IBM-SP2.

Recently promising approaches using parallel and distributed computing have been presented. In this paper, we consider an approach that uses classifiers trained on a number of data subsets in parallel as in the arbiter meta-learning technique. We suggest that information is collected during the learning phase about the performance of the included base classifiers and arbiters and that this information is used during the application phase to select the best classifier dynamically. We evaluate our technique and compare it with the simple arbiter meta-learning using selected data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. The comparison results show that our dynamic meta-learning technique outperforms the arbiter meta-learning significantly in some cases but further profound analysis is needed to draw general conclusions.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for learning, expressed in terms of Constraint Databases: from the point of view of ILP, it gives a uniform way to deal with symbolic/numeric values and it extends the classical framework by allowing the representation of infinite sets of positive/negative examples; from the point of view of Data Mining, it can be applied not only to relational databases, but also to spatial databases. A prototype has been implemented and experiments are currently in progress.

Amer Med Informat Assoc			NATURAL-LANGUAGE; MEDICAL RECORDS; MORTALITY; SYSTEMS; ACCESS	Narrative text reports represent a significant source of clinical data. However, the information stored in these reports is inaccessible to many automated decision support systems. Data mining techniques can assist in extracting information from narrative data. Multiple classification methods, such as rule generation, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and information retrieval were used to classify a set of 200 chest X-ray reports according to 6 clinical conditions indicated. A general-purpose natural language processor was used to convert the narrative text into a coded form that could be used by the classification algorithms. Significant differences in performance were found between algorithms. The best performing algorithm applied to the processor output was significantly better than information retrieval applied to raw text. Predictor variables from the coded processor output were limited to avoid overfitting. Methods that limited by domain knowledge performed significantly better than those that limited by conditional probabilities of the variables in the training set. Algorithms were also shown to be dependent on training set size.

But these patterns will yield knowledge only if they are interesting, i.e. valid, new, potentially useful, and understandable. Unfortunately, during pattern search most Data Mining Algorithms focus on validity only, which also holds true for Neuro-Fuzzy Systems. In this Paper we introduce a method to enhance the interestingness of a rule base as a whole. In the first step, we aggregate the rule base. through amalgamation of adjacent rules and eliminiation of redundant attributes. Supplementing this rather technical approach, we next sort rules with regard to their performance, as measured by their evidence. Finally, we compute reduced evidences, which penalize rules that are very similar to rules with a higher, evidence. Rules sorted on reduced evidence are fed into an integrated rulebrowser, to allow for manual rule selection according to personal and situation-dependent preference. This method was applied successfully to two real-life classification problems, the target group selection for a retail bank, and fault diagnosis for a large car manufacturer. Explicit reference is taken to the NEFCLASS algorithm, but the procedure is easily generalized to other systems.

J	Cheng, PS; Chang, P				Cheng, PS; Chang, P			Transforming corporate information into value through data warehousing and data mining	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article								The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to some promising potential applications to turn the existing information within a corporation into a business advantage through data warehousing and data mining. The idea is to have a data warehouse system capable of accommodating diverse needs through analytical decision support usage. Roll up data from legacy transaction-based routine business operational systems have to be an integral part of the repository. In addition, data warehousing plans must be done in conjunction with rep-level strategies, and most importantly with the cooperation of the technical and other business entities within the corporation. An architecture to coordinate the evolution will be needed. Also, per implementation perspective, there are many synergies between intranet and data warehousing. In turn, intranet provides a quick and easy mechanism for external data sourcing, and facilitates information access by its users anywhere, at any rime, which is critical in making timely decisions.

For this purpose, a study about knowledge acquirement from supervised neural networks employed for classification problems is presented. An algorithm for rule extraction from neural networks, based on the work by Lu et al. [1] in 1996, is developed. This algorithm, named Modified RX, is experimentally evaluated in three different domains. The results are compared to those obtained by classification trees. In respect of the efficacy, one observes that the successful application of the algorithm mainly depends on the knowledge representation acquired by the conecctionist model, while the eficciency only depends on the neural network training time.

Recently, a consortium led by George Mason University has been funded by NASA's Working Prototype Earth Science Information Partner (WP-ESIP) program to develop, implement, and operate a distributed data and information system. The system will address the research needs of seasonal to interannual scientists whose research focus includes phenomena such as El Nino, monsoons and associated climate studies. The system implementation involves several institutions using a multitiered client-sewer architecture. Specifically, the consortium involves an information system of three physical sites, GMU, the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) and the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center, distributing tasks in the areas of user services, access to data, archiving, and other aspects enabled by a low-cost, scalable information technology implementation. The project can serve as a model for a larger WP-ESIP Federation to assist in the overall data information system associated with future large Earth Observing System data sets and their distribution. The consortium has developed innovative information technology techniques such as content based browsing, data mining and associated component working prototypes; analysis tools particularly GrADS developed by COLA, the preferred analysis tool of the working seasonal to interannual communities; and a Java front-end query engine working prototype.

However, when we are immersed in heaps of databases, an immediate question facing practitioners is where we should start mining. In this paper, breaking away from the conventional data mining assumption that many databases be joined into one, we argue that the first step for multidatabase mining is to identify databases that are most likely relevant to an application; without doing so, the mining process can be lengthy, aimless and ineffective. A relevance measure is thus proposed to identify relevant databases for mining tasks with an objective to find patterns or regularities about certain attributes. An efficient implementation for identifying relevant databases is described. Experiments are conducted to validate the measure's performance and to show its promising applications.

Although many approaches of knowledge discovery for relational spatial databases exist, there is a growing interest in mining SOODB. Indeed, object-oriented databases are well-suited to represent complex spatial information. Moreover, a very large number of existing spatial databases are ready to be mined. We propose an algorithm to mine a SOODB. After a spatial object query and a mathematical and fuzzy preprocessing, we apply decision tree based techniques and fuzzy set theory to discover knowledge. An experiment on a region of France to discover classification rules related to houses and urban area is conducted with this algorithm to validate the interest of the approach.

We further develop the direction started (or symbolised) by GeoMiner [9] and argue that the technique developed for database schema design in deductive object-oriented databases is fully usable for spatial mining and overcome, in expressive power, some other mining methods. An inductive query language, with richer semantics, is proposed and three kinds of inductive queries are described. Two of them are improved versions of DBMiner [8] rules. The third kind of rules, dependency rules, allow to compare two or more subsets. Then a description of GWiM mining system as well as results reached by the system are given. We conclude with discussion of weaknesses of the method.(1)	Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Informat, Prague, Czech Republic; Czech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Prague, Czech Republic	Popelinsky, L (reprint author), Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Informat, Prague, Czech Republic.	popel@fi.muni.cz					BLOCKEEL H, IN PRESS APPL ARTIFI; DEHASPE L, LNAI, P125; DZEROSKI S, 1993, IEEE T KNOWLEDGE DAT, V5; Fayyad U.

The KNAVE domain-independent navigation operators access the domain-specific knowledge base, which is modeled by the formal ontology of the knowledge-based temporal-abstraction method; the method generates the temporal abstractions from the time-oriented database. Thus, domain-specific knowledge underlies the semantics of the domain-independent visualization and navigation processes. By accessing the domain-specific temporal-abstraction knowledge base and the domain-specific time-oriented database, the KNAVE modules enable users to query for domain-specific temporal abstractions and to change the focus of the visualization, thus reusing for a different task (visualization and navigation) the domain model that has been abstraction om the domain experts for the purpose of temporal abstraction. Initial evaluation of the KNAVE prototype has been encouraging. The KNAVE methodology has potentially broad implications for tasks such as planning, monitoring, explanation, and darn mining.									0	2	2	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		0-8186-8473-9				1998							11	20				10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BL08L	WOS:000074225400003

Algorithms for building classification decision trees have a natural concurrency?, but are difficult to parallelize due to the inherent dynamic nature of the computation. In this paper; we present parallel formulations of classification decision tree learning algorithm based on induction. We describe Mio basic parallel formulations. One is based on Synchronous Tree Construction Approach and the other is based on Partitioned Tree Construction Approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using these methods and propose a hybrid method that employs the good features of these methods. Experimental results on an IBMSP-2 demonstrate excellent speedups and scalability.

This problem is especially related to inductive logic programming systems, which employ algorithms that are computationally complex. Learning time can be reduced by feeding the ILP algorithm only a well-chosen portion of the original input data. Such transformation of the input data should throw away unimportant clauses but leave ones that are potentially necessary to obtain proper results. In this paper two approaches to data reduction problem are proposed. Both are based on rough set theory. Rough set techniques serve as data reduction tools to reduce the size of input data fed to more time-expensive (search-intensive) ILP techniques. First approach transforms input clauses into decision table form, then uses reducts to select only meaningful data. Second approach introduces a special kind of approximation space. When properly used, iterated lower and upper approximations of target concept have the ability to preferably select facts that are more relevant to the problem, at the same time throwing out the facts that are totally unimportant.

In the KDD context, data mining is often used for description purposes rather than for prediction. However, it turns out difficult to find clustering systems that help to ease the interpretation task to the user in both, statistics and Machine Learning fields. In this paper we present ISAAC, a hierarchical clustering system which employs traditional clustering ideas combined with a feature selection mechanism and heuristics in order to provide comprehensible results. At the same time, it allows to efficiently deal with large datasets by means of a preprocessing step. Results suggest that these aims are achieved and encourage further research.

In this paper, we attempt to discover characteristics common to a collection of WAKA poems. As a formalism for characteristics, we use regular patterns where the constant parts are limited to sequences of auxiliary verbs and postpositional particles. We call such patterns FUSHI. The problem is to find automatically significant FUSHI patterns that characterize the poems. Solving this problem requires a reliable significance measure for the patterns. Brazma et al. (1996) proposed such a measure according to the MDL principle. Using this method, we report successful results in finding patterns from five anthologies. Some of the results are quite stimulating, and we hope that they will lead to new discoveries. Based on our experience, we also propose a pattern-based text data mining system. Further research into WAKA poetry is now proceeding using this system.

Of the many issues in rule discovery, relevancy, interestingness, and supportiveness of association rules are considered in this paper. For a given user query, a database can be partitioned into three views: a positively-related-query view, a negatively-related-query view, and an unrelated-query view. We present a methodology for data mining and rule discovery that incorporates pattern extraction from the three types of query views with pattern spanning to enlarge the scope of a pattern and its derived association rule. The rule discovery process involves several interrelated steps: 1) pattern extraction from both positively- and/or negatively-related query views, 2) pattern association across attributes to enhance the semantics of patterns, while performing 3) pattern spanning within an attribute domain to enhance the supportiveness of the resulting pattern. The contributions of the paper includes the specification and development of the data mining method and associated tool that combines the operations of association and spanning on query views to derive semanticany interesting patterns. These patterns can then be used in decision making because the patterns were mined from the user's original hypothesis its expressed by the query.

In WEBSOM the full-text documents are encoded as vectors in a document space somewhat like in earlier information retrieval methods, but in WEBSOM the document space is formed in an unsupervised manner using the Self-Oganizing Map algorithm. In this article the document representations the WEBSOM creates are shown to he computationally efficient approximations of the results of a certain probabilistic model. The probabilistic model incorporates information about the similarity of use of different words to take into account their semantic relations.

The hardware needed to train an ALN, or to evaluate the function it represents,can be quite modest, since ALN algorithms achieve high speed and efficiency by controlling the flow of execution: omitting computations involving linear pieces that are not needed for the current state change or output. Efficient flow of control can be combined with programmable hardware, as is illustrated by a field programmable gate array processor built for evaluating functions learned by ALNs.

They aim at building clusters of items so that similar items fall into the same cluster while dissimilar ones fall into separate clusters. A particular class of clustering methods are hierarchical ones where recursive clusters are formed to grow a tree representing an approximation of similarities between items. We propose a new interactive interface to help the user to interpret the result of such a clustering process, according to the item characteristics. The prototype has been applied successfully to a special case of items providing nice graphical representations (electric load curves) but can also be used with other types of curves or with more standard items.

Nonetheless, the quality of information inferred from this voluminous data has not been proportional to its size. One of the reasons for this is that the computational complexities of the algorithms used to extract information from the data are normally proportional to the number of input data items resulting in prohibitive execution time on large data sets. Parallelism is one solution to this problem. In this paper we present preliminary results on experiments in parallelising C4.5, a classification-rule learning system using decision-trees as a model representation, which has been used as a base model for investigating methods for parallelising induction algorithms. The experiments assess the potential for improving the execution time by exploiting parallelism in the algorithm.

The input data set consists of 3 Terabytes of pixel information, and contains a few billion sources. We describe some of the specific scientific problems posed by the data, including searches for distant quasars and clusters of galaxies, and the data-mining techniques we are exploring in addressing them. Machine-assisted discovery methods may become essential for the analysis of such multi-Terabyte data sets. New and future approaches involve unsupervised classification and clustering analysis in the Giga-object data space, including various Bayesian techniques. In addition to the searches for known types of objects in this data base, these techniques may also offer the possibility of discovering previously unknown, rare types of astronomical objects.

These patterns provide knowledge on the application domain that is represented by the collection. A pattern can also be seen as a query that retrieves a set of documents. Thus the data mining tools can be used to identify interesting queries which can be used to browse the collection. The main pattern types, the system can search for, are frequent sets of concepts, association rules, concept distributions, and concept graphs. To enable the user to specify some explicit bias, the system provides several types of constraints for searching the vast implicit spaces of patterns that exist in the collection. The patterns which have been verified as interesting are structured and presented in a visual user interface allowing the user to operate on the results to refine and redirect search tasks or to access the associated documents. The system offers preprocessing tools to construct or refine a knowledge base of domain concepts and to create an internal representation of the document collection that will be used by all subsequent data mining operations. In this paper, we give an overview on the Document Explorer system. We summarize our methodical approaches and solutions for the special requirements of this document mining area.

Therefore, new approaches in the fields of spatia-temporal, multidimensional and statistical database systems have to be considered to develop an appropriate support architecture. fn this paper we present our experiences and ideas gained in implementing a prototype. Based on these facts, we describe our approach to dynamically create statistical objects over predicate-based aggregates in the course of epidemiological data analysis.

EDA has much in common with existing data mining techniques: its main objective is to help an investigator reach an understanding of the important relationships in a data set rather than simply develop predictive models for selected variables. Brief descriptions of a number of novel techniques developed for use in SNOUT are presented. These include heuristic variable level inference and classification, automatic category formation, the use of similarity trees to identify groups of related variables, interactive decision tree construction, and model selection using a genetic algorithm.

J	Teller, A; Veloso, M				Teller, A; Veloso, M			Program evolution for data mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Around the world there are innumerable databases of information, The quantity of information available has created a high demand for automatic methods for searching these databases and extracting specific kinds of information. Unfortunately, the information in these databases increasingly contains signals that have no corresponding classification symbols. Examples include databases of images, sounds, etc. A few systems have been written to help solve these search and retrieve issues. But we cannot write a new system for every kind of signal we want to recognize and extract. Some work has been done on automating (i.e., learning) the task of identifying desired signal elements. It would be useful to automate (learn) not just a part of the classification function, but the entire signal identification program. It would be helpful if we could use the same learning architecture to automatically create these programs for distinguishing many different classes of the same signal type. It would be better still if we could use the same learning architecture to create these programs even for signal types as different as images and sound waves. We introduce PADO (Parallel Architecture Discovery and Orchestration), a learning architecture designed to deliver this. PADO has at its core a variant of genetic programming (GP) that extends the paradigm to explore the space of algorithms. PADO learns the entire classification algorithm for an arbitrary signal type with arbitrary signal class distinctions. This architecture has been designed specifically for signal understanding and classification. The architecture of PADO and its achievements on the recovery of visual and acoustic signal classes from test databases are the subjects of this article.

For an order-N tensor, most CP algorithms can be computationally demanding due to computation of gradients which are related to products between tensor unfoldings and Khatri-Rao products of all factor matrices except one. These products have the largest workload in most CP algorithms. In this paper, we propose a fast method to deal with this issue. The method also reduces the extra memory requirements of CP algorithms. As a result, we can accelerate the standard alternating CP algorithms 20-30 times for order-5 and order-6 tensors, and even higher ratios can be obtained for higher order tensors (e.g., N >= 10). The proposed method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art ALS algorithm which operates two modes at a time (ALSo2) in the Eigenvector PLS toolbox, especially for tensors with order N >= 5 and high rank.

A taxonomy of privacy-preserving record linkage techniques	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Record linkage; Data matching; Entity resolution; Data quality; Privacy techniques; Survey	K-ANONYMITY; FRAMEWORK; SECURITY; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; GENERATION; PROTOCOL; QUALITY; SYSTEM; GRAPH	The process of identifying which records in two or more databases correspond to the same entity is an important aspect of data quality activities such as data pre-processing and data integration. Known as record linkage, data matching or entity resolution, this process has attracted interest from researchers in fields such as databases and data warehousing, data mining, information systems, and machine learning. Record linkage has various challenges, including scalability to large databases, accurate matching and classification, and privacy and confidentiality. The latter challenge arises because commonly personal identifying data, such as names, addresses and dates of birth of individuals, are used in the linkage process. When databases are linked across organizations, the issue of how to protect the privacy and confidentiality of such sensitive information is crucial to successful application of record linkage. In this paper we present an overview of techniques that allow the linking of databases between organizations while at the same time preserving the privacy of these data. Known as 'privacy-preserving record linkage' (PPRL), various such techniques have been developed. We present a taxonomy of PPRL techniques to characterize these techniques along 15 dimensions, and conduct a survey of PPRL techniques. We then highlight shortcomings of current techniques and discuss avenues for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An automatic system for identifying authorities in digital libraries	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Authority control; Data mining; Digital libraries; Automatic system	DISAMBIGUATION; AUTHORSHIP	In this paper we introduce an automatic system to perform authority control in digital libraries based on data mining techniques. This system is able to find the different representations for an author name as well as to distinguish between different authors sharing the same name. Using that information, the system shows the user the results of a search over a digital library properly grouped according to their authorship. To accomplish this task, it only uses information that can be directly obtained from the digital library itself without any kind of external data. The system has been tested using different digital libraries on the web. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hajian, S; Domingo-Ferrer, J				Hajian, Sara; Domingo-Ferrer, Josep			A Methodology for Direct and Indirect Discrimination Prevention in Data Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Antidiscrimination; data mining; direct and indirect discrimination prevention; rule protection; rule generalization; privacy		Data mining is an increasingly important technology for extracting useful knowledge hidden in large collections of data. There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latter consists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mining have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory (sensitive) attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, antidiscrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on nonsensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive ones. In this paper, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data sets in such a way that direct and/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (nondiscriminatory) classification rules. We also propose new metrics to evaluate the utility of the proposed approaches and we compare these approaches. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and/or indirect discrimination biases in the original data set while preserving data quality.

A survey on 3D interfaces for OLAP is detailed, which shows that only one interface that uses Virtual Reality has been proposed. Then we present our approach: it consists of a 3D representation of OLAP cubes where many OLAP operators have been integrated and where several measures can be visualized. A 3D stereoscopic screen can be used in conjunction with a 3D mouse. Finally a user study is reported that compares standard dynamic cross-tables with our interface on different tasks. We conclude that 3D with stereoscopy is not as promising as expected even with recent 3D devices.

J	Honko, P				Honko, Piotr			Association discovery from relational data via granular computing	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multi-relational data mining; Granular computing; Association discovery	CLASSIFICATION; APPROXIMATION	We propose a novel framework for association discovery from relational data. The framework is a specialized version of the general framework intended for mining relational data and is defined in granular computing theory. In the framework proposed in this paper we define a method for deriving information granules from relational data. Such granules are the basis for association discovery. Our framework, unlike others, unifies not only the way the data and patterns to be derived are expressed and specified, but also partially the process of discovering patterns from the data. Namely, the patterns can be directly obtained from the information granules or constructed based on them. Moreover, the information granule-based relational data representation, defined in the framework, can be treated as the search space for association discovery. Thanks to this the size of the search space may significantly be limited. Furthermore, we apply in our approach the granular computing idea of switching between different levels of granularity of the universe. Thanks to this relational data representation can easily be replaced by another one and thereby adjusted to a given data mining task, e.g., association discovery. The results of preliminary experiments show that granular representation of relational data can be powerful enough to generate essential patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we utilize a fuzzy c-means clustering hybrid approach that combines support vector regression and a genetic algorithm. In this method, the fuzzy clustering parameters, cluster size and weighting factor are optimized and missing values are estimated. The proposed novel hybrid method yields sufficient and sensible imputation performance results. The results are compared with those of fuzzy c-means genetic algorithm imputation, support vector regression genetic algorithm imputation and zero imputation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Through several management techniques, the waste, the redundant things, and the expenses without added values can be cleared, and the production and service within an enterprise will become smoother, that is, the competitiveness of an enterprise will be enhanced. In this study, the data collected from experiment carried out in Toyota lean service simulation laboratory of China University of Technology are used for analysis. Data mining technique is used to investigate whether the result of lean production and service taken by enterprises can enhance the entire performance of production and service. In this study, Grey relational analysis is performed first and is used to judge whether the data collected in the experiment using lean production and service can enhance performance; then, clustering method is used to classify experimental data into two clusters based on service attitude and dish-serving efficiency; finally, three data mining techniques of Genetic Programming (GP), Back-propagation Artificial Neural Network and logistic regression are used to set up, respectively, lean service performance model and Employee Characteristic Analysis model.

Often, these activities involve textual communication between a criminal and a victim, or between criminals themselves. The forensic analysis of online textual documents for addressing the anonymity problem called authorship analysis is the focus of most cybercrime investigations. Authorship analysis is the statistical study of linguistic and computational characteristics of the written documents of individuals. This paper is the first work that presents a unified data mining solution to address authorship analysis problems based on the concept of frequent pattern-based writeprint. Extensive experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed solution can precisely capture the writing styles of individuals. Furthermore, the writeprint is effective to identify the author of an anonymous text from a group of suspects and to infer sociolinguistic characteristics of the author. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Song, J; Takakura, H; Okabe, Y; Nakao, K				Song, Jungsuk; Takakura, Hiroki; Okabe, Yasuo; Nakao, Koji			Toward a more practical unsupervised anomaly detection system	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Intrusion Detection System; Clustering; One-class SVM; Anomaly detection	INTRUSION-DETECTION; NETWORKS	During the last decade, various machine learning and data mining techniques have been applied to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which have played an important role in defending critical computer systems and networks from cyber attacks. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques have received a particularly great amount of attention because they enable construction of intrusion detection models without using labeled training data (i.e., with instances preclassified as being or not being an attack) in an automated manner and offer intrinsic ability to detect unknown attacks; i.e., 0-day attacks. Despite the advantages, it is still not easy to deploy them into a real network environment because they require several parameters during their building process, and thus IDS operators and managers suffer from tuning and optimizing the required parameters based on changes of their network characteristics. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly detection method by which we can automatically tune and optimize the values of parameters without predefining them. We evaluated the proposed method over real traffic data obtained from Kyoto University honeypots. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the previous one. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We propose a signal-detection strategy that combines the adverse event reporting system (AERS) of the Food and Drug Administration and electronic health records (EHRs) by requiring signaling in both sources. We claim that this approach leads to improved accuracy of signal detection when the goal is to produce a highly selective ranked set of candidate ADRs. Materials and methods Our investigation was based on over 4 million AERS reports and information extracted from 1.2 million EHR narratives. Well-established methodologies were used to generate signals from each source. The study focused on ADRs related to three high-profile serious adverse reactions. A reference standard of over 600 established and plausible ADRs was created and used to evaluate the proposed approach against a comparator. Results The combined signaling system achieved a statistically significant large improvement over AERS (baseline) in the precision of top ranked signals. The average improvement ranged from 31% to almost threefold for different evaluation categories. Using this system, we identified a new association between the agent, rasburicase, and the adverse event, acute pancreatitis, which was supported by clinical review. Conclusions The results provide promising initial evidence that combining AERS with EHRs via the framework of replicated signaling can improve the accuracy of signal detection for certain operating scenarios. The use of additional EHR data is required to further evaluate the capacity and limits of this system and to extend the generalizability of these results.

Knowledge maps have been used for the purpose of discovering the location, ownership and value of intellectual assets. The purpose of this article is to develop a new method for assessing national and firm-level competences in a given technological discipline. To achieve this goal, we draw a competence map by applying agglomerative hierarchical clustering on a sample of patents. Considering the top levels of the resulting dendrogram, each cluster represents one of the technological branches of nanotechnology and its children branches are those that are most technologically proximate. We also assign a label to each branch by extracting the most relevant words found in each of them. From the information about patents inventors' cities, we are able to identify where the largest invention communities are located. Finally, we use information regarding patent assignees and identify the most productive firms. We apply our method to the case of the emerging and multidisciplinary Canadian nanotechnology industry.

Formal concept analysis and lattice-valued Chu systems	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Formal (L-)context; Galois connection; Formal (L-)concept/(L-)preconcept/(L-)protoconcept; (L-)Chu system; (L-)Topological system; (L-)formal context interchange	FUZZY GALOIS CONNECTIONS; TOPOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; FOUNDATIONS; ALGEBRAS; SPACES	This paper links formal concept analysis (FCA) both to order-theoretic developments in the theory of Galois connections and to Chu spaces or systems viewed as a common rubric for both topological systems and systems arising from predicate transformers in programming semantics [13]. These links are constructed for each of traditional FCA and L-FCA, where L is a commutative residuated semiquantale. Surprising and important consequences include relationships between formal (L-)contexts and (L-)topological systems within the category of (L-)Chu systems, relationships justifying the categorical study of formal (L-)contexts and linking such study to (L-)Chu systems. Applications and potential applications are primary motivations, including several example classes of formal (L-)contexts induced from data mining notions. Throughout, categorical frameworks are given for FCA and lattice-valued FCA in which morphisms preserve the Birkhoff operators on which all the structures of FCA and lattice-valued FCA rest; and, further, the results of this paper show that, under very general conditions, these categorical frameworks are both sufficient and necessary for the "interchange" or "preservation" of (L-)concepts and (L-)protoconcepts, structures centfral to FCA and lattice-valued FCA.

J	Kwon, O; Sim, JM				Kwon, Ohbyung; Sim, Jae Mun			Effects of data set features on the performances of classification algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Big data; Classification algorithms; Performance evaluation; Data mining	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; KERNEL; MODEL	As the need to analyze big data sets grows dramatically, the role that classification algorithms play in data mining techniques also increases. Big data analysis requires more of the data sets' characteristics to be included, such as data structure, variety of sources, and the rate of update frequency. In this paper, we evaluate scenarios that examine which data set characteristics most affect the classification algorithms' performance. It is still a complex issue to determine which algorithm is how strong or how weak in relation to which data set. Thus, our research experimentally examines how data set characteristics affect algorithm performance, both in terms of accuracy and in elapsed time. To do so, we use a multiple regression method to evaluate the causality between data set characteristics as independent variables, and performance metrics as dependent variables. We also examine the role that classification algorithms play as moderator in this causality. All benchmark data sets in a UCI database are used that are fit to run the classification algorithm. Based on the results of the experiment, we discuss the requirements of legacy classification algorithms to address big data analysis in a new business intelligence era. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Current online configuration systems are unable to efficiently identify real customer affective needs because they offer an excess variety of products that usually confuse customers. On the other hand, mining affective customer needs may result in recommender systems, which can enhance existing configuration systems by recommending initial configurations according to customer affective needs. This paper introduces a mass customization recommender system that exploits data mining techniques on automotive industry customer data aiming at revealing associations between user affective needs and the design parameters of automotive products. One key novelty of the presented approach is that it deploys the Citarasa engineering, a methodology that focuses on the provision of the appropriate characterizations on customer data in order to associate them with customer affective needs. Based on the application of classification techniques we build a recommendation engine, which is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction, tool's effectiveness, usefulness and reliability among other parameters.

Exploring Spatiotemporal Phenological Patterns and Trajectories Using Self-Organizing Maps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); phenology; Sammon's projection; self-organizing map (SOM); synoptic state; Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-VEGETATION; time series	TIME-SERIES DATA; COVER CHANGE DETECTION; COMPOSITE IMAGES; AVHRR DATA; VEGETATION; CLASSIFICATION	Consistent satellite image time series are increasingly accessible to geoscientists, allowing an effective monitoring of environmental phenomena. Specifically, the use of vegetation index time series has pushed forward the monitoring of large-scale vegetation phenology. Most of these studies derive key phenological metrics from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series on a per-pixel basis. This paper demonstrates an approach to analyze synoptic spatiotemporal phenological patterns over large areas, rather than per pixel. The selected approach involves data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) and Sammon's projection. To illustrate our approach, we trained a SOM using 13 years of ten-day NDVI composites from the Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre-VEGETATION over the Kruger National Park, South Africa. This resulted in a topologically ordered set of phenological synoptic states. The Sammon's projection was then used to create a simplified representation of the trained SOM that reflects the similarities among the synoptic states. Subsequently, we depicted phenological trajectories for each vegetation season to show how phenological development changes between years. This time series data mining approach provides a holistic characterization of the main regional phenological dynamics and effectively summarizes the information present in the time series, thus facilitating further interpretation.

J	Vo, B; Coenen, F; Le, B				Bay Vo; Coenen, Frans; Bac Le			A new method for mining Frequent Weighted Itemsets based on WIT-trees	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent Weighted Itemset; Frequent weighted support; WIT-trees; WIT-FWI	ASSOCIATION RULES; CLOSED ITEMSETS; PATTERN TREES; LATTICE	The mining frequent itemsets plays an important role in the mining of association rules. Frequent itemsets are typically mined from binary databases where each item in a transaction may have a different significance. Mining Frequent Weighted Itemsets (FWI) from weighted items transaction databases addresses this issue. This paper therefore proposes algorithms for the fast mining of FWI from weighted item transaction databases. Firstly, an algorithm for directly mining FWI using WIT-trees is presented. After that, some theorems are developed concerning the fast mining of FWI. Based on these theorems, an advanced algorithm for mining FWI is proposed. Finally, a Diffset strategy for the efficient computation of the weighted support for itemsets is described, and an algorithm for mining FWI using Diffsets presented. A complete evaluation of the proposed algorithms is also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Costa, G; Manco, G; Ortale, R; Ritacco, E				Costa, Gianni; Manco, Giuseppe; Ortale, Riccardo; Ritacco, Ettore			Hierarchical clustering of XML documents focused on structural components	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data Mining; Semi-structured data and XML; XML clustering; XML transactional representation; XML cluster summarization and representative	SEMISTRUCTURED DATA; ALGORITHM; EFFICIENT; SYSTEM; SIMILARITY; TREES	Clustering XML documents by structure is the task of grouping them by common structural components. Hitherto, this has been accomplished by looking at the occurrence of one preestablished type of structural components in the structures of the XML documents. However, the a-priori chosen structural components may not be the most appropriate for effective clustering. Moreover, it is likely that the resulting clusters exhibit a certain extent of inner structural inhomogeneity, because of uncaught differences in the structures of the XML documents, due to further neglected forms of structural components. To overcome these limitations, a new hierarchical approach is proposed, that allows to consider (if necessary) multiple forms of structural components to isolate structurally-homogeneous clusters of XML documents. At each level of the resulting hierarchy, clusters are divided by considering some type of structural components (unaddressed at the preceding levels), that still differentiate the structures of the XML documents. Each cluster in the hierarchy is summarized through a novel technique, that provides a clear and differentiated understanding of its structural properties. A comparative evaluation over both real and synthetic XML data proves that the devised approach outperforms established competitors in effectiveness and scalability. Cluster summarization is also shown to be very representative. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gorecki, T; Luczak, M				Gorecki, Tomasz; Luczak, Maciej			Using derivatives in time series classification	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Dynamic Time Warping; Derivative Dynamic Time Warping; Data mining; Time series		Over recent years the popularity of time series has soared. Given the widespread use of modern information technology, a large number of time series may be collected during business, medical or biological operations, for example. As a consequence there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of interest in querying and mining such data, which in turn has resulted in a large number of works introducing new methodologies for indexing, classification, clustering and approximation of time series. In particular, many new distance measures between time series have been introduced. In this paper, we propose a new distance function based on a derivative. In contrast to well-known measures from the literature, our approach considers the general shape of a time series rather than point-to-point function comparison. The new distance is used in classification with the nearest neighbor rule. In order to provide a comprehensive comparison, we conducted a set of experiments, testing effectiveness on 20 time series datasets from a wide variety of application domains. Our experiments show that our method provides a higher quality of classification on most of the examined datasets.

J	Heneberg, P				Heneberg, Petr			Supposedly uncited articles of Nobel laureates and Fields medalists can be prevalently attributed to the errors of omission and commission	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; bibliographic references; citation searching	DATABASE CUPBOARD; MODEL; SKELETONS; THOUGHTS	Several independent authors reported a high share of uncited publications, which include those produced by top scientists. This share was repeatedly reported to exceed 10% of the total papers produced, without any explanation of this phenomenon and the lack of difference in uncitedness between average and successful researchers. In this report, we analyze the uncitedness among two independent groups of highly visible scientists (mathematicians represented by Fields medalists, and researchers in physiology or medicine represented by Nobel Prize laureates in the respective field). Analysis of both groups led to the identical conclusion: over 90% of the uncited database records of highly visible scientists can be explained by the inclusion of editorial materials progress reports presented at international meetings (meeting abstracts), discussion items (letters to the editor, discussion), personalia (biographic items), and by errors of omission and commission of the Web of Science (WoS) database and of the citing documents. Only a marginal amount of original articles and reviews were found to be uncited (0.9 and 0.3%, respectively), which is in strong contrast with the previously reported data, which never addressed the document types among the uncited records.

A window of opportunity: Assessing behavioural scoring	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Supervised classification; Behavioural scoring; Credit scoring	PREDICTION; CARD	After credit has been granted, lenders use behavioural scoring to assess the likelihood of default occurring during some specific outcome period. This assessment is based on customers' repayment performance over a given fixed period. Often the outcome period and fixed performance period are arbitrarily selected, causing instability in making predictions. Behavioural scoring has failed to receive the same attention from researchers as application scoring. The bias for application scoring research can be attributed, in part, to the large volume of data required for behavioural scoring studies. Furthermore, the commercial sensitivities associated with such a large pool of customer data often prohibits the publication of work in this area. This paper focuses on behavioural scoring and evaluates the contrasting effects of altering the performance period and outcome period using 7-years worth of data from the Irish market. The results of this work indicate that a 12-month performance period yields an easier prediction task when compared with other historical payment periods of varying lengths. This article also quantifies differences in the classification performance of logistic regression arising from different outcome periods length. Our findings show that the performance of a logistic regression classifier degrades significantly when the outcome window is extended beyond 6-month. Finally we consider different approaches to how the concept of default is defined. Typically whether the customer is identified as a default risk or not is set based on either (i) whether the account is in default at the end of the outcome period or (ii) at any time during the outcome period. This paper studies both approaches and finds that the latter approach resulted in an easier classification problem, that is, it gives the highest assurance that the classification will be correct.

J	Kong, XN; Ng, MK; Zhou, ZH				Kong, Xiangnan; Ng, Michael K.; Zhou, Zhi-Hua			Transductive Multilabel Learning via Label Set Propagation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; machine learning; multilabel learning; transductive learning; semi-supervised learning; unlabeled data	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	The problem of multilabel classification has attracted great interest in the last decade, where each instance can be assigned with a set of multiple class labels simultaneously. It has a wide variety of real-world applications, e. g., automatic image annotations and gene function analysis. Current research on multilabel classification focuses on supervised settings which assume existence of large amounts of labeled training data. However, in many applications, the labeling of multilabeled data is extremely expensive and time consuming, while there are often abundant unlabeled data available. In this paper, we study the problem of transductive multilabel learning and propose a novel solution, called TRAsductive Multilabel Classification (TRAM), to effectively assign a set of multiple labels to each instance. Different from supervised multilabel learning methods, we estimate the label sets of the unlabeled instances effectively by utilizing the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. We first formulate the transductive multilabel learning as an optimization problem of estimating label concept compositions. Then, we derive a closed-form solution to this optimization problem and propose an effective algorithm to assign label sets to the unlabeled instances. Empirical studies on several real-world multilabel learning tasks demonstrate that our TRAM method can effectively boost the performance of multilabel classification by using both labeled and unlabeled data.

J	Lin, SM				Lin, Su-Mei			Analysis of service satisfaction in web auction logistics service using a combination of Fruit fly optimization algorithm and general regression neural network	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fruit fly optimization algorithm; General regression neural network; Principal component regression; Service satisfaction; Data mining	ROC CURVE; AREA	When constructing classification and prediction models, most researchers used genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, or ant colony optimization algorithm to optimize parameters of artificial neural network models in their previous studies. In this paper, a brand new approach using Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is adopted to optimize artificial neural network model. First, we carried out principal component regression on the results data of a questionnaire survey on logistics quality and service satisfaction of online auction sellers to construct our logistics quality and service satisfaction detection model. Relevant principal components in the principal component regression analysis results were selected for independent variables, and overall satisfaction level toward auction sellers' logistics service as indicated in the questionnaire survey was selected as a dependent variable for sample data of this study. In the end, FOA-optimized general regression neural network (FOAGRNN), PSO-optimized general regression neural network (PSOGRNN), and other data mining techniques for ordinary general regression neural network were used to construct a logistics quality and service satisfaction detection model. In the study, 4-6 principal components in principal component regression analysis were selected as independent variables of the model. Analysis results of the study show that of the four data mining techniques, FOA-optimized GRNN model has the best detection capacity.

Data mining applied to the cognitive rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain injury	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Acquired brain injury; Cognitive rehabilitation; Data mining; Decision tree; Multilayer perceptron; General regression neural network	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION-TREE ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; MODEL; PREDICTION; VARIABLES	Acquired brain injury (ABI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world and is associated with high health care costs as a result of the acute treatment and long term rehabilitation involved. Different algorithms and methods have been proposed to predict the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs. In general, research has focused on predicting the overall improvement of patients with ABI. The purpose of this study is the novel application of data mining (DM) techniques to predict the outcomes of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with ABI. We generate three predictive models that allow us to obtain new knowledge to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the cognitive rehabilitation process. Decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and general regression neural network (GRNN) have been used to construct the prediction models. 10-fold cross validation was carried out in order to test the algorithms, using the Institut Guttmann Neurorehabilitation Hospital (IG) patients database. Performance of the models was tested through specificity, sensitivity and accuracy analysis and confusion matrix analysis. The experimental results obtained by DT are clearly superior with a prediction average accuracy of 90.38%, while MLP and GRRN obtained a 78.7% and 75.96%, respectively. This study allows to increase the knowledge about the contributing factors of an ABI patient recovery and to estimate treatment efficacy in individual patients. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A data mining approach to knowledge discovery from multidimensional cube structures	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data cubes; OLAP analysis; Data mining; Ranked paths; Principal Component Analysis; Multiple Correspondence Analysis	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM	In this research we present a novel methodology for the discovery of cubes of interest in large multidimensional datasets. Unlike previous research in this area, our approach does not rely on the availability of specialized domain knowledge and instead makes use of robust methods of data reduction such as Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Correspondence Analysis to identify a small subset of numeric and nominal variables that are responsible for capturing the greatest degree of variation in the data and are thus used in generating cubes of interest. Hierarchical clustering was integrated with the use of data reduction in order to gain insights into the dynamics of relationships between variables of interests at different levels of data abstraction. The two case studies that were conducted on two real word datasets revealed that the methodology was able to capture regions of interest that were significant from both the application and statistical perspectives.

Active control of friction self-excited vibration using neuro-fuzzy and data mining techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Neuro-fuzzy systems; Active control; Friction; Self-excited vibration	COMPENSATION; SYSTEMS; NETWORKS; MODELS; DESIGN	Vibration caused by friction, termed as friction-induced self-excited vibration (FSV), is harmful to engineering systems. Understanding this physical phenomenon and developing some strategies to effectively control the vibration have both theoretical and practical significance. This paper proposes a self-tuning active control scheme for controlling FSV in a class of mechanical systems. Our main technical contributions include: setup of a data mining based neuro-fuzzy system for modeling friction; learning algorithm for tuning the neuro-fuzzy system friction model using Lyapunov stability theory, which is associated with a compensation control scheme and guaranteed closed-loop system performance. A typical mechanical system with friction is employed in simulation studies. Results show that our proposed modeling and control techniques are effective to eliminate both the limit cycle and the steady-state error. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wang, Y.

In many applications, the cost of collecting the features must be taken into account. To cope with the cost problem, we developed a new cost-sensitive fitness function based on histogram comparison. This function is integrated with a genetic search method to form a new feature selection algorithm termed CASH (cost-sensitive attribute selection algorithm using histograms). The CASH algorithm takes into account feature collection costs as well as feature grouping and misclassification costs. Our experiments in various domains demonstrated the superiority of CASH over several other cost-sensitive genetic algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Existing methods are typically superlinear in space or execution time. Halite's strengths are that it is fast and scalable, while still giving highly accurate results. Specifically the main contributions of Halite are: 1) Scalability: it is linear or quasi linear in time and space regarding the data size and dimensionality, and the dimensionality of the clusters' subspaces; 2) Usability: it is deterministic, robust to noise, doesn't take the number of clusters as an input parameter, and detects clusters in subspaces generated by original axes or by their linear combinations, including space rotation; 3) Effectiveness: it is accurate, providing results with equal or better quality compared to top related works; and 4) Generality: it includes a soft clustering approach. Experiments on synthetic data ranging from five to 30 axes and up to 1 million points were performed. Halite was in average at least 12 times faster than seven representative works, and always presented highly accurate results. On real data, Halite was at least 11 times faster than others, increasing their accuracy in up to 35 percent. Finally, we report experiments in a real scenario where soft clustering is desirable.

This technique is used iteratively to assign these nodes ID numbers ranging from 1 to. This assignment is anonymous in that the identities received are unknown to the other members of the group. Resistance to collusion among other members is verified in an information theoretic sense when private communication channels are used. This assignment of serial numbers allows more complex data to be shared and has applications to other problems in privacy preserving data mining, collision avoidance in communications and distributed database access. The required computations are distributed without using a trusted central authority. Existing and new algorithms for assigning anonymous IDs are examined with respect to trade-offs between communication and computational requirements. The new algorithms are built on top of a secure sum data mining operation using Newton's identities and Sturm's theorem. An algorithm for distributed solution of certain polynomials over finite fields enhances the scalability of the algorithms. Markov chain representations are used to find statistics on the number of iterations required, and computer algebra gives closed form results for the completion rates.

J	Kurtcephe, M; Guvenir, HA				Kurtcephe, Murat; Guvenir, H. Altay			A DISCRETIZATION METHOD BASED ON MAXIMIZING THE AREA UNDER RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; discretization; area under ROC curve	ROC CURVE; ATTRIBUTES; CLASSIFICATION	Many machine learning algorithms require the features to be categorical. Hence, they require all numeric-valued data to be discretized into intervals. In this paper, we present a new discretization method based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC) measure. Maximum area under ROC curve-based discretization (MAD) is a global, static and supervised discretization method. MAD uses the sorted order of the continuous values of a feature and discretizes the feature in such a way that the AUC based on that feature is to be maximized. The proposed method is compared with alternative discretization methods such as ChiMerge, Entropy-Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP), Fixed Frequency Discretization (FFD), and Proportional Discretization (PD). FFD and PD have been recently proposed and are designed for Naive Bayes learning. ChiMerge is a merging discretization method as the MAD method. Evaluations are performed in terms of M-Measure, an AUC-based metric for multi-class classification, and accuracy values obtained from Naive Bayes and Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) algorithms by using real-world datasets. Empirical results show that MAD is a strong candidate to be a good alternative to other discretization methods.	[Kurtcephe, Murat; Guvenir, H.

A New Sequential Covering Strategy for Inducing Classification Rules With Ant Colony Algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Ant colony optimization; classification; data mining; rule induction; sequential covering	CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; OPTIMIZATION; MINER	Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have been successfully applied to discover a list of classification rules. In general, these algorithms follow a sequential covering strategy, where a single rule is discovered at each iteration of the algorithm in order to build a list of rules. The sequential covering strategy has the drawback of not coping with the problem of rule interaction, i.e., the outcome of a rule affects the rules that can be discovered subsequently since the search space is modified due to the removal of examples covered by previous rules. This paper proposes a new sequential covering strategy for ACO classification algorithms to mitigate the problem of rule interaction, where the order of the rules is implicitly encoded as pheromone values and the search is guided by the quality of a candidate list of rules. Our experiments using 18 publicly available data sets show that the predictive accuracy obtained by a new ACO classification algorithm implementing the proposed sequential covering strategy is statistically significantly higher than the predictive accuracy of state-of-the-art rule induction classification algorithms.

A main drawback of manifold learning methods is, however, that there are no explicit mappings from the input data manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and target detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for manifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an approximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too restrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for manifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial mapping between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional representations. As far as we know, this is the first time that an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this to the method of locally linear embedding and derive an explicit nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, which is named neighborhood preserving polynomial embedding. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed mapping is much more effective in preserving the local neighborhood information and the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional data samples than previous work.

Simple Hybrid and Incremental Postpruning Techniques for Rule Induction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Overfitting; pruning; noise handling; data mining; knowledge discovery; machine learning; inductive learning; supervised learning; rule induction; classification	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Pruning achieves the dual goal of reducing the complexity of the final hypothesis for improved comprehensibility, and improving its predictive accuracy by minimizing the overfitting due to noisy data. This paper presents a new hybrid pruning technique for rule induction, as well as an incremental postpruning technique based on a misclassification tolerance. Although both have been designed for RULES-7, the latter is also applicable to any rule induction algorithm in general. A thorough empirical evaluation reveals that the proposed techniques enable RULES-7 to outperform other state-of-the-art classification techniques. The improved classifier is also more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster than before.

J	Chen, MY				Chen, Mu-Yen			A hybrid ANFIS model for business failure prediction utilizing particle swarm optimization and subtractive clustering	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Particle swarm optimization; Subtractive clustering; Business failure prediction	FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION; FUZZY TIME-SERIES; STOCK MARKETS; BANKRUPTCY; NETWORK; RATIOS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	In recent years, newly-developed data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to various fields to build intelligent information systems. However, few of these approaches offer online support or are able to flexibly adapt to large and complex financial datasets. Therefore, the present research adopts particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques to obtain appropriate parameter settings for subtractive clustering (SC) and integrates the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model to construct a model for predicting business failures. Experiments were conducted based on an initial sample of 160 electronics companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC). Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to other models, providing a lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The proposed one-order momentum method is able to learn quickly through one-pass training and provides high-accuracy short-term predictions, while the proposed two-order momentum provides high-accuracy long-term predictions from large financial datasets. Therefore, the proposed approach fulfills some important characteristics of the proposed model: the one-order momentum method is suitable for online learning and the two-order momentum method is suitable for incremental learning. Thus, the PS-ANFIS approach could provide better results in predicting potential financial distress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The complexity of the project selection problem is due to the high number of projects from which a subset (portfolio) has to be chosen. We present a hybrid fuzzy rule-based multi-objective framework for sustainable project portfolio selection. The multiple and conflicting objectives are considered as the input variables in a Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) system developed to estimate the overall fitness (suitability) of the potential project portfolios. A hybrid multi-objective framework integrates and synthesizes the results from a data mining model with the results from a Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) model and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to design the structure of the proposed FRB system. The proposed framework simultaneously considers the accuracy maximization and the complexity minimization objectives. A Genetic Based Machine Learning (GBML) method is utilized to design an alternative FRB system for comparison purposes. The proposed framework and the GBML method are used to assess the alternative project portfolios in a real-world financial services institution. The statistical analysis shows the performance dominance of the proposed hybrid framework over the GBML method based on selected accuracy and interoperability measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hasuike, T; Ichimura, T				Hasuike, Takashi; Ichimura, Takumi			Web intelligence for tourism using railway data by a simplified fuzzy reasoning method	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Tourism information; Web intelligence; Fuzzy reasoning method; Data mining	INTERNET	This paper proposes an approach to analyze the tourism information and data derived from the Web, particularly seat availability data of bullet trains in Japan, and to discover some useful knowledge for the tourism. For the fast development of information and communication technologies, the relation between the web data and tourism is inseparable. However, the Web data include various types of information such as numerical, linguistic, and graded data. Furthermore, the expert tourism planner's subjectivity is also an important factor to develop new favorable plans. A simplified fuzzy reasoning method, which is one of the useful approaches in Data mining, is introduced in order to deal with these data mathematically. The analysis of the tourism data and the knowledge discovery are performed using actual data of bullet trains in Japan.

J	Li, XY; Du, JP				Li, Xiaoyong; Du, Junping			Adaptive and attribute-based trust model for service-level agreement guarantee in cloud computing	IET INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article							AD HOC NETWORKS; ROUGH SETS; OPERATORS	In cloud computing, trust management is more important than ever before in the use of information and communication technologies. Owing to the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on trust attributes is necessary to enforce service-level agreements. This study presents Cloud-Trust, an adaptive trust management model for efficiently evaluating the competence of a cloud service based on its multiple trust attributes. In Cloud-Trust, two kinds of adaptive modelling tools (rough set and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator) are organically integrated and successfully applied to trust data mining and knowledge discovery. Using rough set to discover knowledge from trust attributes makes the model surpass the limitations of traditional models, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Moreover, Cloud-Trust uses the IOWA operator to aggregate the global trust degree based on time series, thereby enabling better real-time performance. Experimental results show that Cloud-Trust converges more rapidly and accurately than do existing approaches, thereby verifying that it can effectively take on trust measurement tasks in cloud computing.

J	Lu, ZM; Zhang, Q				Lu ZhiMao; Zhang Qi			Clustering by data competition	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; clustering analysis; partitional clustering; data competition	ALGORITHM	Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to find out hidden structures in datasets. Most partitional clustering algorithms are sensitive to the selection of initial exemplars, the outliers and noise. In this paper, a novel technique called data competition algorithm is proposed to solve the problems. First the concept of aggregation field model is defined to describe the partitional clustering problem. Next, the exemplars are identified according to the data competition. Then, the members will be assigned to the suitable clusters. Data competition algorithm is able to avoid poor solutions caused by unlucky initializations, outliers and noise, and can be used to detect the coexpression gene, cluster the image, diagnose the disease, distinguish the variety, etc. The provided experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed schemes and show that the proposed approach of data competition algorithm is simple, stable and efficient. The experimental results also show that the proposed approach of data competition clustering outperforms three of the most well known clustering algorithms K-means clustering, affinity propagation clustering, hierarchical clustering.

J	Petersen, C; DeMuro, P; Goodman, KW; Kaplan, B				Petersen, Carolyn; DeMuro, Paul; Goodman, Kenneth W.; Kaplan, Bonnie			Sorrell v. IMS Health: issues and opportunities for informaticians	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; DRUG; PHYSICIANS; IMPACT; COST; GIFT	In 2011, the US Supreme Court decided Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., a case that addressed the mining of large aggregated databases and the sale of prescriber data for marketing prescription drugs. The court struck down a Vermont law that required data mining companies to obtain permission from individual providers before selling prescription records that included identifiable physician prescription information to pharmaceutical companies for drug marketing. The decision was based on constitutional free speech protections rather than data sharing considerations. Sorrell illustrates challenges at the intersection of biomedical informatics, public health, constitutional liberties, and ethics. As states, courts, regulatory agencies, and federal bodies respond to Sorrell, informaticians' expertise can contribute to more informed, ethical, and appropriate policies.

J	Romero, C; Ventura, S				Romero, Cristobal; Ventura, Sebastian			Data mining in education	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							SYSTEMS; TEACHERS	Applying data mining (DM) in education is an emerging interdisciplinary research field also known as educational data mining (EDM). It is concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational environments. Its goal is to better understand how students learn and identify the settings in which they learn to improve educational outcomes and to gain insights into and explain educational phenomena. Educational information systems can store a huge amount of potential data from multiple sources coming in different formats and at different granularity levels. Each particular educational problem has a specific objective with special characteristics that require a different treatment of the mining problem. The issues mean that traditional DM techniques cannot be applied directly to these types of data and problems. As a consequence, the knowledge discovery process has to be adapted and some specific DM techniques are needed. This paper introduces and reviews key milestones and the current state of affairs in the field of EDM, together with specific applications, tools, and future insights.

For example, mined subgraphs with high frequency are often of small size, and vice-versa. Use of such objectives in the multiobjective subgraph mining process generates Pareto-optimal subgraphs, where no subgraph is better than another subgraph in all objectives. We have applied a Pareto dominance approach for the evaluation and search subgraphs regarding to both proximity and diversity in multiobjective sense, which has incorporated in the framework of Subdue algorithm for subgraph mining. The method is called multiobjective subgraph mining by Subdue (MOSubdue) and has several advantages: (i) generation of Pareto-optimal subgraphs in a single run (ii) selection of subgraph-seeds from the candidate subgraphs based on all objectives (iii) search in the multiobjective subgraphs lattice space, and (iv) capability to deal with different multiobjective frequent subgraph mining tasks by customizing the tackled objectives. The good performance of MOSubdue is shown by performing multiobjective subgraph mining defined by two and three objectives on two real-life datasets.

Preference-oriented mining techniques for location-based store search	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Location-based search; Preference learning; Feedback; Collaborative filtering	RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEMS; SERVICES	With the development of wireless telecommunication technologies, a number of studies have been done on the issues of location-based services due to wide applications. Among them, one of the active topics is the location-based search. Most of previous studies focused on the search of nearby stores, such as restaurants, hotels, or shopping malls, based on the user's location. However, such search results may not satisfy the users well for their preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining-based approach, named preference-oriented location-based search (POLS), to efficiently search for k nearby stores that are most preferred by the user based on the user's location, preference, and query time. In POLS, we propose two preference learning algorithms to automatically learn user's preference. In addition, we propose a ranking algorithm to rank the nearby stores based on user's location, preference, and query time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on taking temporal location-based search with automatic user preference learning into account simultaneously. Through experimental evaluations on the real dataset, the proposed approach is shown to deliver excellent performance.

Landslide susceptibility is required for disaster management and planning development activities in mountain regions. The extent of damages could be reduced or minimized if a long-term early warning system predicting the landslide prone areas would have been in place. We required an early warning system to predict the occurrence of Landslide in advance to prevent these damages. Landslide is triggered by many factors such as rainfall, landuse, soil type, slope and etc. The proposed idea is to build an Early Warning Landslide Susceptibility Model (EWLSM) to predict the possibilities of landslides in Niligri's district of the Tamil Nadu. The early warning of the landslide susceptibility model is built through data mining technique classification approach with the help of important factors, which triggers a landslide. In this study, we also compared and shown that the performance of Bayesian classifier is more accurate than SVM Classifier in landslide analysis.

J	Wu, G; Xu, W; Zhang, Y; Wei, YM				Wu, Gang; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Ying; Wei, Yimin			A preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for GeneRank with application to microarray data mining	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Gene network; Microarray; GeneRank; Preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG); Krylov subspace method	GENES	The problem of identifying key genes is of fundamental importance in biology and medicine. The GeneRank model explores connectivity data to produce a prioritization of the genes in a microarray experiment that is less susceptible to variation caused by experimental noise than the one based on expression levels alone. The GeneRank algorithm amounts to solving an unsymmetric linear system. However, when the matrix in question is very large, the GeneRank algorithm is inefficient and even can be infeasible. On the other hand, the adjacency matrix is symmetric in the GeneRank model, while the original GeneRank algorithm fails to exploit the symmetric structure of the problem in question. In this paper, we discover that the GeneRank problem can be rewritten as a symmetric positive definite linear system, and propose a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve it. Numerical experiments support our theoretical results, and show superiority of the novel algorithm.

Data mining using clinical physiology at discharge to predict ICU readmissions	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Feature selection; Patient readmission; Intensive care unit	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; PATIENT READMISSION; DECISION-MAKING; RISK; OUTCOMES; HOSPITALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDITY	Patient readmissions to intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with increased mortality, morbidity and costs. Current models for predicting ICU readmissions have moderate predictive value, and can utilize up to twelve variables that may be assessed at various points of the ICU inpatient stay. We postulate that greater predictive value can be achieved with fewer physiological variables, some of which can be assessed in the 24 h before discharge. A data mining approach combining fuzzy modeling with tree search feature selection was applied to a large retrospectively collected ICU database (MIMIC II), representing data from four different ICUs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. The goal was to predict ICU readmission between 24 and 72 h after ICU discharge. Fuzzy modeling combined with sequential forward selection was able to predict readmissions with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 +/- 0.04, a sensitivity of 0.68 +/- 0.02 and a specificity of 0.73 +/- 0.03. Variables selected as having the highest predictive power include mean heart rate, mean temperature, mean platelets, mean non-invasive arterial blood pressure (mean), mean spO2, and mean lactic acid, during the last 24 h before discharge. Collection of the six predictive variables selected is not complex in modern ICUs, and their assessment may help support the development of clinical management plans that potentially mitigate the risk of readmission.

J	Koc, L; Mazzuchi, TA; Sarkani, S				Koc, Levent; Mazzuchi, Thomas A.; Sarkani, Shahram			A network intrusion detection system based on a Hidden Naive Bayes multiclass classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Data mining; Multiclass classification; Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB); Denial-of-services (DoS)	SELECTION	With increasing Internet connectivity and traffic volume, recent intrusion incidents have reemphasized the importance of network intrusion detection systems for combating increasingly sophisticated network attacks. Techniques such as pattern recognition and the data mining of network events are often used by intrusion detection systems to classify the network events as either normal events or attack events. Our research study claims that the Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) model can be applied to intrusion detection problems that suffer from dimensionality, highly correlated features and high network data stream volumes. HNB is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes method's conditional independence assumption. Our experimental results show that the HNB model exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and misclassification cost compared with the traditional Naive Bayes model, leading extended Naive Bayes models and the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Cup 1999 winner. Our model performed better than other leading state-of-the art models, such as SVM, in predictive accuracy. The results also indicate that our model significantly improves the accuracy of detecting denial-of-services (DoS) attacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, CH				Lee, Chung-Hong			Unsupervised and supervised learning to evaluate event relatedness based on content mining from social-media streams	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Stream mining; Data mining; Event evaluation; Social networks		Due to the explosive growth of social-media applications, enhancing event-awareness by social mining has become extremely important. The contents of microblogs preserve valuable information associated with past disastrous events and stories. To learn the experiences from past events for tackling emerging real-world events, in this work we utilize the social-media messages to characterize real-world events through mining their contents and extracting essential features for relatedness analysis. On one hand, we established an online clustering approach on Twitter microblogs for detecting emerging events, and meanwhile we performed event relatedness evaluation using an unsupervised clustering approach. On the other hand, we developed a supervised learning model to create extensible measure metrics for offline evaluation of event relatedness. By means of supervised learning, our developed measure metrics are able to compute relatedness of various historical events, allowing the event impacts on specified domains to be quantitatively measured for event comparison. By combining the strengths of both methods, the experimental results showed that the combined framework in our system is sensible for discovering more unknown knowledge about event impacts and enhancing event awareness.

J	Tseng, FC				Tseng, Fan-Chen			An adaptive approach to mining frequent itemsets efficiently	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent itemsets; Frequent Pattern List (FPL); Transaction Pattern List (TPL); Database density	CANDIDATE GENERATION; CLOSED ITEMSETS; PATTERNS	The mining of frequent itemsets is a fundamental and important task of data mining. To improve the efficiency in mining frequent itemsets, many researchers developed smart data structures to represent the database, and designed divide-and-conquers approaches to generate frequent itemsets from these data structures. However, the features of real databases are diversified and the features of local databases in the mining process may also change. Consequently, different data structures may be utilized in the mining process to enhance efficiency. This study presents an adaptive mechanism to select suitable data structures depending on database densities: the Frequent Pattern List (FPL) for sparse databases, and the Transaction Pattern List (TPL) for dense databases. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of this approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Aviad, B; Roy, G				Aviad, Barak; Roy, Gelbard			A decision support method, based on bounded rationality concepts, to reveal feature saliency in clustering problems	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature selection; Feature saliency; Data mining; Cluster analysis; Classification; Bounded-rationality	VARIABLE-SELECTION; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; SIMILARITY; SYSTEM	In many real-life data mining problems, there is no a-priori classification (no target attribute that is known in advance). The lack of a target attribute (target column/class label) makes the division process into a set of groups very difficult to define and construct. The end user needs to exert considerable effort to interpret the results of diverse algorithms because there is no pre-defined reliable "benchmark". To overcome this drawback the current paper proposes a methodology based on bounded-rationality theory. It implements an S-shaped function as a saliency measure to represent the end user's logic to determine the features that characterize each potential group. The methodology is demonstrated on three well-known datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository. The grouping uses cluster analysis algorithms, since clustering techniques do not need a target attribute. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These analyses include conservation, alignment, differentiation, and discrimination, among others. When defined on general graphs, these problems are considerably harder than their well-studied counterparts on sets and sequences. In this paper, we study the problem of global alignment of large sparse graphs. Specifically, we investigate efficient methods for computing approximations to the state-of-the-art IsoRank solution for finding pairwise topological similarity between nodes in two networks (or within the same network). Pairs of nodes with high similarity can be used to seed global alignments. We present a novel approach to this computationally expensive problem based on uncoupling and decomposing ranking calculations associated with the computation of similarity scores. Uncoupling refers to independent preprocessing of each input graph. Decomposition implies that pairwise similarity scores can be explicitly broken down into contributions from different link patterns traced back to a low-rank approximation of the initial conditions for the computation. These two concepts result in significant improvements, in terms of computational cost, interpretability of similarity scores, and nature of supported queries. We show over two orders of magnitude improvement in performance over IsoRank/Random Walk formulations, and over an order of magnitude improvement over constrained matrix-triple-product formulations, in the context of real data sets.

Among different marketing domains, customer segmentation or profiling is recognized as an important area in research and industry practice. Various data mining techniques can be useful for efficient customer segmentation and targeted marketing. One such technique is the RFM method. Recency, frequency, and monetary methods provide a simple means to categorize retail customers. We identify two sets of data involving catalog sales and donor contributions. Variants of RFM-based predictive models are constructed and compared to classical data mining techniques of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The spectrum of tradeoffs is analyzed. RFM methods are simpler, but less accurate. The effect of balancing cells, of the value function, and classical data mining algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks) are also applied to the data. Both balancing expected cell densities and compressing RFM variables into a value function were found to provide models similar in accuracy to the basic RFM model, with slight improvement obtained by increasing the cutoff rate for classification. Classical data mining algorithms were found to yield better prediction, as expected, in terms of both prediction accuracy and cumulative gains. Relative tradeoffs among these data mining algorithms in the context of customer segmentation are presented. Finally we discuss practical implications based on the empirical results.

J	Ahn, KI				Ahn, Kwang-Il			Effective product assignment based on association rule mining in retail	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rules; Cross-selling; Product assignment	FREQUENT; DATABASES	Much academic research has been conducted about the process of association rule mining. More effort is now required for practical application of association rules in various commercial fields. A potential application of association rule mining is the problem of product assignment in retail. The product assignment problem involves how to most effectively assign items to sites in retail stores to grow sales. Effective product assignment facilitates cross-selling and convenient shopping for customers to promote maximum sales for retailers. However, little practical research has been done to address the issue. The current study approaches the product assignment problem using association rule mining for retail environments. There are some barriers to overcome in applying association rule mining to the product assignment problem for retail. This study conducts some generalizing to overcome drawbacks caused by the short lifecycles of current products. As a measure of cross-selling, lift is used to compare the effectiveness of various assignments for products. The proposed algorithm consists of three processes, which include mining associations among items, nearest neighbor assignments, and updating assignments. The algorithm was tested on synthetic databases. The results show very effective product assignment in terms of the potential for cross-selling to drive maximum sales for retailers.

J	Ahmed, CF; Tanbeer, SK; Jeong, BS; Choi, HJ				Ahmed, Chowdhury Farhan; Tanbeer, Syed Khairuzzaman; Jeong, Byeong-Soo; Choi, Ho-Jin			Interactive mining of high utility patterns over data streams	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; High utility pattern mining; Interactive mining; Incremental mining; Data streams	SLIDING WINDOW METHOD; ASSOCIATION RULES; FREQUENT ITEMSETS; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; TREE; DATABASES; DISCOVERY; SETS	High utility pattern (HUP) mining over data streams has become a challenging research issue in data mining. When a data stream flows through, the old information may not be interesting in the current time period. Therefore, incremental HUP mining is necessary over data streams. Even though some methods have been proposed to discover recent HUPs by using a sliding window, they suffer from the level-wise candidate generation-and-test problem. Hence, they need a large amount of execution time and memory. Moreover, their data structures are not suitable for interactive mining. To solve these problems of the existing algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel tree structure, called HUS-tree (high utility stream tree) and a new algorithm, called HUPMS (high utility pattern mining over stream data) for incremental and interactive HUP mining over data streams with a sliding window. By capturing the important information of stream data into an HUS-tree, our HUPMS algorithm can mine all the HUPs in the current window with a pattern growth approach. Furthermore, HUS-tree is very efficient for interactive mining. Extensive performance analyses show that our algorithm is very efficient for incremental and interactive HUP mining over data streams and significantly outperforms the existing sliding window-based HUP mining algorithms.

It impinges on a large proportion of the population and affects government service policies and people's life quality. Typical welfare countries, such as Australia and Canada, have accumulated a huge amount of social security and social welfare data. Emerging business issues such as fraudulent outlays, and customer service and performance improvements challenge existing policies, as well as techniques and systems including data matching and business intelligence reporting systems. The need for a deep understanding of customers and customer-government interactions through advanced data analytics has been increasingly recognized by the community at large. So far, however, no substantial work on the mining of social security and social welfare data has been reported. For the first time in data mining and machine learning, and to the best of our knowledge, this paper draws a comprehensive overall picture and summarizes the corresponding techniques and illustrations to analyze social security/welfare data, namely, social security data mining (SSDM), based on a thorough review of a large number of related references from the past half century. In particular, we introduce an SSDM framework, including business and research issues, social security/welfare services and data, as well as challenges, goals, and tasks in mining social security/welfare data. A summary of SSDM case studies is also presented with substantial citations that direct readers to more specific techniques and practices about SSDM.

These observations lead to a collection of organized data called time series. The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field.

J	Guil, F; Marin, R				Guil, Francisco; Marin, Roque			A tree structure for event-based sequence mining	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Temporal data mining; Inter-transaction itemsets; Event-based sequences; Inter-transactional mining; Temporal associations	INTERTRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; DISCOVERY	The incorporation of temporal semantics into traditional data mining techniques has led to the development of a new field called temporal data mining. This is especially necessary for extracting useful knowledge from dynamic domains, which by nature are time-varying. However, in practical terms, this is a computationally intractable problem, and therefore, it poses more challenges to efficient processing than non-temporal techniques. In this paper, we present a tree-based structure and a handling algorithm, called TSET - Miner, for frequent temporal pattern mining from time-stamped datasets. The algorithm is based on mining inter-transaction association, and is mainly characterized by the use of a single tree-based data structure for generation and storage of all frequent sequences discovered by mining. Given the versatility involved in the use of a single data structure, it may be extended an adapted to extract other types of patterns with relative little effort. To demonstrate this, we also present TSETmax - Miner, an algorithm based on the TSET structure, designed to extract maximal frequent event-based sequences. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Joshi, D; Soh, LK; Samal, A				Joshi, Deepti; Soh, Leen-Kiat; Samal, Ashok			Redistricting Using Constrained Polygonal Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Spatial clustering; polygonal clustering; constraint-based processing; data mining; spatial databases and GIS	EXTENDED OBJECTS	Redistricting is the process of dividing a geographic area consisting of spatial units-often represented as spatial polygons-into smaller districts that satisfy some properties. It can therefore be formulated as a set partitioning problem where the objective is to cluster the set of spatial polygons into groups such that a value function is maximized [ 1]. Widely used algorithms developed for point-based data sets are not readily applicable because polygons introduce the concepts of spatial contiguity and other topological properties that cannot be captured by representing polygons as points. Furthermore, when clustering polygons, constraints such as spatial contiguity and unit distributedness should be strategically addressed. Toward this, we have developed the Constrained Polygonal Spatial Clustering (CPSC) algorithm based on the A* search algorithm that integrates cluster-level and instance-level constraints as heuristic functions. Using these heuristics, CPSC identifies the initial seeds, determines the best cluster to grow, and selects the best polygon to be added to the best cluster. We have devised two extensions of CPSC-CPSC* and CPSC*-PS-for problems where constraints can be soft or relaxed. Finally, we compare our algorithm with graph partitioning, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm-based approaches in two applications-congressional redistricting and school districting.

Effectively monitoring a large field by analyzing images from multiple cameras remains a challenging issue. Other approaches generally require the tracking objects to attach special devices, which are infeasible in many scenarios. To address the issue, we propose to use RF tag arrays for activity monitoring, where data mining techniques play a critical role. The RFID technology provides an economically attractive solution due to the low cost of RF tags and readers. Another novelty of this design is that the tracking objects do not need to be equipped with any RF transmitters or receivers. By developing a practical fault-tolerant method, we offset the noise of RF tag data and mine frequent trajectory patterns as models of regular activities. Our empirical study using real RFID systems and data sets verifies the feasibility and the effectiveness of this design.

Inducing decision trees with an ant colony optimization algorithm	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant colony optimization; Data mining; Classification; Decision tree	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; MODELS	Decision trees have been widely used in data mining and machine learning as a comprehensible knowledge representation. While ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have been successfully applied to extract classification rules, decision tree induction with ACO algorithms remains an almost unexplored research area. In this paper we propose a novel ACO algorithm to induce decision trees, combining commonly used strategies from both traditional decision tree induction algorithms and ACO. The proposed algorithm is compared against three decision tree induction algorithms, namely C4.5, CART and cACDT, in 22 publicly available data sets. The results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed algorithm is statistically significantly higher than the accuracy of both C4.5 and CART, which are well-known conventional algorithms for decision tree induction, and the accuracy of the ACO-based cACDT decision tree algorithm.

J	Qi, Z; Shi, Y				Qi, Z.; Shi, Y.			Structural Regular Multiple Criteria Linear Programming for Classification Problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						classification; RMCLP; structural information of data; SVM	MODELS	Classification problem has attracted an increasing amount of interest. Various classifiers have been proposed in the last decade, such as ANNs, LDA, and SVM. Regular Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (RMCLP) is an effective classification method, which was proposed by Shi and his colleagues and have been applied to handle different real-life data mining problems. In this paper, inspired by the application potential of RMCLP, we propose a novel Structural R.MCLP (called SR.MCLP) method for classification problem. Unlike RMCLP, SRMCLP is sensitive to the structure of the data distribution and can construct more reasonable classifiers by exploiting these prior data distribution information within classes. The corresponding optimization problem of SRMCLP can be solved by a standard quadratic programming. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via experiments on synthetic and available benchmark datasets.

Reconstruction of Sparse Signals From l(1) Dimensionality-Reduced Cauchy Random Projections	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Cauchy random projections; compressed sensing; dimensionality reduction; myriad filter; Restricted Isometry Property (RIP); sketching	COORDINATE DESCENT ALGORITHMS; WEIGHTED MYRIAD FILTERS; PENALIZED REGRESSION; NOISE ENVIRONMENTS; OPTIMIZATION; COMPUTATION; RECOVERY; SEARCH	Dimension reduction methods via linear random projections are used in numerous applications including data mining, information retrieval and compressive sensing (CS). While CS has traditionally relied on normal random projections, corresponding to l(2) distance preservation, a large body of work has emerged for applications where l(1) approximate distances may be preferred. Dimensionality reduction in l(1) often use Cauchy random projections that multiply the original data matrix B is an element of R-nxD with a Cauchy random matrix R is an element of R-kxn (k << n), resulting in a projected matrix C is an element of R-kxD. In this paper, an analogous of the Restricted Isometry Property for dimensionality reduction in l(1) is proposed using explicit tail bounds for the geometric mean of the random projections. A set of signal reconstruction algorithms from the Cauchy random projections are then developed given that the large suite of reconstruction algorithms developed in compressive sensing perform poorly due to the lack of finite second-order statistics in the projections. These algorithms are based on regularized coordinate-descent Myriad estimates using both l(0) and Lorentzian norms as sparsity inducing terms.

The technical advances achieved by the genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics technologies in recent years have significantly increased the amount of data that are available for biologists to analyze different aspects of an organism. However, *omics data sets have several additional problems: they have inherent biological complexity and may have significant amounts of noise as well as measurement artifacts. The need to extract information from such databases has once again become a challenge. This requires novel computational techniques and models to automatically perform data mining tasks such as integration of different data types, clustering and knowledge discovery, among others. In this article, we will present a novel integrated computational intelligence approach for biological data mining that involves neural networks and evolutionary computation. We propose the use of self-organizing maps for the identification of coordinated patterns variations; a new training algorithm that can include a priori biological information to obtain more biological meaningful clusters; a validation measure that can assess the biological significance of the clusters found; and finally, an evolutionary algorithm for the inference of unknown metabolic pathways involving the selected clusters.

An Analysis Pipeline with Statistical and Visualization-Guided Knowledge Discovery for Michigan-Style Learning Classifier Systems	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article							HUMAN-DISEASE; XCS; EPISTASIS; ACCURACY	Michigan-style learning classifier systems (M-LCSs) represent an adaptive and powerful class of evolutionary algorithms which distribute the learned solution over a sizable population of rules. However their application to complex real world data mining problems, such as genetic association studies, has been limited. Traditional knowledge discovery strategies for M-LCS rule populations involve sorting and manual rule inspection. While this approach may be sufficient for simpler problems, the confounding influence of noise and the need to discriminate between predictive and non-predictive attributes calls for additional strategies. Additionally, tests of significance must be adapted to M-LCS analyses in order to make them a viable option within fields that require such analyses to assess confidence. In this work we introduce an M-LCS analysis pipeline that combines uniquely applied visualizations with objective statistical evaluation for the identification of predictive attributes, and reliable rule generalizations in noisy single-step data mining problems. This work considers an alternative paradigm for knowledge discovery in M-LCSs, shifting the focus from individual rules to a global, population-wide perspective. We demonstrate the efficacy of this pipeline applied to the identification of epistasis (i.e., attribute interaction) and heterogeneity in noisy simulated genetic association data.

Massively increasing volume of data in real life databases has motivated researchers to design novel and incremental algorithms for association rules mining. In this paper, we propose an incremental association rules mining algorithm that integrates shocking interestingness criterion during the process of building the model. A new interesting measure called shocking measure is introduced. One of the main features of the proposed approach is to capture the user background knowledge, which is monotonically augmented. The incremental model that reflects the changing data and the user beliefs is attractive in order to make the over all Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process more effective and efficient. We implemented the proposed approach and experiment it with some public datasets and found the results quite promising.

These data can serve as a low-cost augmentation to an observing system, which can be incorporated into geophysical models together with other scientific data such as satellite observations and sensor measurements. As a use case scenario, we analyze the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. We gather SM data that mention sightings of oil from Flickr, geolocate them, and use them as boundary forcings in the General NOAA Oil Modeling Environment (GNOME) software for oil spill predictions. We show how SM data can be incorporated into the GNOME model to obtain improved estimates of the model parameters such as rates of oil spill, couplings between surface winds and ocean currents, diffusion coefficient, and other model parameters.

A framework for ontology based decision support system for e-learning modules, business modeling and manufacturing systems	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Ontology; Decision support systems; Data mining; Knowledge engineering; Quality analysis; E-learning; Business modeling	KNOWLEDGE	This paper identifies how ontology models can be vigorously used to define semantics and relationships in representing objects/modules for e-learning, business modeling support and manufacturing processing details. Further extraction of these relations by intelligent decision-support systems using data mining as a tool is discussed. The paper envisages the possibility of establishing a common solution platform for product development and customization leading to increased profitability and better resource utilization. It showcases ways to link these different ontological models leading to cross platform compatibility. It also tries to explore manufacturer-customer relationship and using them to provide quality analysis methods for further improvement in the product processing model.

The grid is a computing infrastructure for implementing distributed high-performance applications and solving complex problems, offering effective support to the implementation and use of data mining and knowledge discovery systems. The Web Services Resource Framework has become the standard for the implementation of grid services and applications, and it can be exploited for developing high-level services for distributed data mining applications. This paper describes how distributed data mining patterns, such as collective learning, ensemble learning, and meta-learning models, can be implemented as Web Services Resource Framework mining services by exploiting the grid infrastructure. The goal of this work was to design a distributed architectural model that can be exploited for different distributed mining patterns deployed as grid services for the analysis of dispersed data sources. In order to validate such an approach, we presented also the implementation of two clustering algorithms on the developed architecture. In particular, the distributed k-means and distributed expectation maximization were exploited as pilot examples to show the suitability of the implemented service-oriented framework. An extensive evaluation of its performance was provided. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, it faces a new data deluge with the next generation of synoptic sky surveys which are opening up the time domain for discovery and exploration. This brings both new scientific opportunities and fresh challenges, in terms of data rates from robotic telescopes and exponential complexity in linked data, but also for data mining algorithms used in classification and decision making. In this paper, we describe how an informatics-based approach-part of the so-called "fourth paradigm" of scientific discovery-is emerging to deal with these. We review our experiences with the Palomar-Quest and Catalina Real-Time Transient Sky Surveys; in particular, addressing the issue of the heterogeneity of data associated with transient astronomical events (and other sensor networks) and how to manage and analyze it.

J	Hatamlou, A				Hatamlou, Abdolreza			In search of optimal centroids on data clustering using a binary search algorithm	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						A binary search algorithm; Optimal centroids; Data clustering	K-MEANS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION	Data clustering is an important technique in data mining. It is a method of partitioning data into clusters, in which each cluster must have data of great similarity and different clusters must have data of high dissimilarity. A lot of clustering algorithms are found in the literature. In general, there is no single algorithm that is suitable for all types of data, conditions and applications. Each algorithm has its own advantages, limitations and shortcomings. Therefore, introducing novel and effective approaches for data clustering is an open and active research area. This paper presents a novel binary search algorithm for data clustering that not only finds high quality clusters but also converges to the same solution in different runs. In the proposed algorithm a set of initial centroids are chosen from different parts of the test dataset and then optimal locations for the centroids are found by thoroughly exploring around of the initial centroids. The simulation results using six benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository indicate that proposed algorithm can efficiently be used for data clustering. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lin, J; Khade, R; Li, Y				Lin, Jessica; Khade, Rohan; Li, Yuan			K Rotation-invariant similarity in time series using bag-of-patterns representation	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time series; Similarity search; Feature extraction; Representation; Classification; Structural similarity	MODEL	For more than a decade, time series similarity search has been given a great deal of attention by data mining researchers. As a result, many time series representations and distance measures have been proposed. However, most existing work on time series similarity search relies on shape-based similarity matching. While some of the existing approaches work well for short time series data, they typically fail to produce satisfactory results when the sequence is long. For long sequences, it is more appropriate to consider the similarity based on the higher-level structures. In this work, we present a histogram-based representation for time series data, similar to the "bag of words" approach that is widely accepted by the text mining and information retrieval communities. We performed extensive experiments and show that our approach outperforms the leading existing methods in clustering, classification, and anomaly detection on dozens of real datasets. We further demonstrate that the representation allows rotation-invariant matching in shape datasets.

We propose a classification approach across multiple heterogeneous relational databases. More specifically, given a set of inter-related databases, we use a regression model for predicting the most useful links that will be connected to build a multi-relational decision tree. Experiments performed on different real and synthetic databases were very satisfactory compared with previous classification approaches in multiple databases. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nguyen, LTT; Vo, B; Hong, TP; Thanh, HC				Nguyen, Loan T.

A lot of methods for mining classification rules have been developed in recent years, such as C4.5 and ILA. These methods are, however, based on heuristics and greedy approaches to generate rule sets that are either too general or too over-fitting for a given dataset. They thus often yield high error ratios. Recently, a new method for classification from data mining, called the Classification Based on Associations (CBA), has been proposed for mining class-association rules (CARs). This method has more advantages than the heuristic and greedy methods in that the former could easily remove noise, and the accuracy is thus higher. It can additionally generate a rule set that is more complete than C4.5 and ILA. One of the weaknesses of mining CARS is that it consumes more time than C4.5 and ILA because it has to check its generated rule with the set of the other rules. We thus propose an efficient pruning approach to build a classifier quickly. Firstly, we design a lattice structure and propose an algorithm for fast mining CARs using this lattice. Secondly, we develop some theorems and propose an algorithm for pruning redundant rules quickly based on these theorems. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach is more efficient than those used previously. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Peters, G; Weber, R; Nowatzke, R				Peters, Georg; Weber, Richard; Nowatzke, Rene			Dynamic rough clustering and its applications	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Dynamic data mining; Changing data structures; Rough k-means clustering	FUZZY DATA-ANALYSIS; K-MEANS; ALGORITHMS; SETS; PREDICTION; VALIDITY	Dynamic data mining has gained increasing attention in the last decade. It addresses changing data structures which can be observed in many real-life applications, e.g. buying behavior of customers. As opposed to classical, i.e. static data mining where the challenge is to discover pattern inherent in given data sets, in dynamic data mining the challenge is to understand - and in some cases even predict how such pattern will change over time. Since changes in general lead to uncertainty, the appropriate approaches for uncertainty modeling are needed in order to capture, model, and predict the respective phenomena considered in dynamic environments. As a consequence, the combination of dynamic data mining and soft computing is a very promising research area. The proposed algorithm consists of a dynamic clustering cycle when the data set will be refreshed from time to time. Within this cycle criteria check if the newly arrived data have structurally changed in comparison to the data already analyzed. If yes, appropriate actions are triggered, in particular an update of the initial settings of the cluster algorithm. As we will show, rough clustering offers strong tools to detect such changing data structures. To evaluate the proposed dynamic rough clustering algorithm it has been applied to synthetic as well as to real-world data sets where it provides new insights regarding the underlying dynamic phenomena.

In the coming years, both high temporal and high spatial resolution SITS will become available. In the classical methodologies, SITS are studied by analyzing the radiometric evolution of the pixels with time. When dealing with high spatial resolution images, object-based approaches are generally used in order to exploit the spatial relationships of the data. However, these approaches require a segmentation step to provide contextual information about the pixels. Even if the segmentation of single images is widely studied, its generalization to series of images remains an open-issue. This article aims at providing both temporal and spatial analysis of SITS. We propose first segmenting each image of the series, and then using these segmentations in order to characterize each pixel of the data with a spatial dimension (i.e., with contextual information). Providing spatially characterized pixels, pixel-based temporal analysis can be performed. Experiments carried out with this methodology show the relevance of this approach and the significance of the resulting extracted patterns in the context of the analysis of SITS.

A lack of publishing standards for decision tree algorithm software produced a large time gap between algorithm proposals and their wider application in practice. Non-existence of common repository for storing algorithms and their parts led to a need to re-implement these algorithms from a scratch when they had to be implemented on a different platform. This makes the comparison between algorithms and their partial improvements vague. In addition, combinations and interactions between different algorithm parts haven't been analyzed thoroughly. Reusable component design of decision tree algorithms has been recently suggested as a potential solution to these problems. In this paper we describe an architecture for component-based (white-box) decision tree algorithm design, and we present an open-source framework which enables design and fair testing of decision tree algorithms and their parts. This architecture and developed platform can provide the research community with a common codebase for storing, designing, and evaluating decision tree algorithms (traditional, multivariate and hybrid) and their partial improvements. It is intended for data mining practitioners, algorithm and software developers, and as well for students, as a technology enhanced learning tool.

J	Zangooei, MH; Jalili, S				Zangooei, Mohammad Hossein; Jalili, Saeed			Protein secondary structure prediction using DWKF based on SVR-NSGAII	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Protein secondary structure prediction; Machine learning approach; Support vector regression; Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ACCURACY; SERVER; PROFILES; SUBSTITUTION; ALGORITHMS; HELICES; MODELS	Prediction of protein secondary structure is an important step towards elucidating its three dimensional structure and its function. This is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. By introduction of machine learning for protein structure prediction, a solution has brought to this challenge to some extent. In the literature of Machine learning or data mining, regression and classification problems are typically viewed as two distinct problems differentiated by continuous or categorical dependent variable. There are endeavors to use regression methods to solve the classification problem and vice versa. To regard a classification problem as a regression one, we proposed a method which is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) classification model as one of the powerful methods in the field of machine intelligence. We applied non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) to find mapping points (MPs) for rounding a real-value to an integer one. Also NSGAII is used for finding out and tuning SVR kernel parameters optimally to enhance the performance of our model and achieve better results. At the other hand, using a suitable SVR kernel function for a particular problem can improve the prediction results remarkably but there is not a kernel which can predict all protein secondary structure classes with acceptable accuracy. Therefore we use a Dynamic Weighted Kernel Fusion (DWKF) method for fusing of three SVR kernels to achieve a supreme performance. Also to improve our method, Position Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles are used as the input information to it. The goals of this research are to regulate SVR parameters and fuse different SVR kernel outputs in order to determine protein secondary structure classes accurately. The obtained classification accuracies of our method are 85.79% and 84.94% on RS126 and CB513 datasets respectively and they are promising with regard to other classification methods in the literature. Moreover, for gauging our method behavior in comparison to other state of arts methods, an independent dataset is used and achieves 81.4% accuracy.

A classification tree approach to identify key factors of transit service quality	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Service quality; Bus transit; Data mining; Classification and regression trees (CART); Non-parametric techniques	TRAFFIC INJURY SEVERITY; POINT-OF-VIEW; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; MODELS	A key aspect to take into consideration when developing indices to evaluate transit service quality is to determine how much weight passengers give to each attribute when making a global assessment of service quality (SQ.). The simplest method of a direct question in customer satisfaction survey (CSS) poses a number of problems, and therefore statistical regression methods have been developed to infer attribute importance on the basis of CSS or stated preference surveys. However, most regression models have their own model assumptions and pre-defined underlying relationships between dependant and independent variables. If these assumptions are violated, the model could lead to erroneous estimations. This paper proposes using a classification and regression tree (CART) that does not require any pre-defined underlying relationship between dependent and independents variables, to identify the key factors affecting bus transit quality of service. The paper uses the data gathered in a CSS conducted on the Granada metropolitan transit system in 2007, which was a non-research oriented survey. Two CART models were developed to compare the key attributes identified before and after making passengers reflect on the main aspects of the system. The outcomes show that, in a preliminary evaluation, passenger perception of SQ is basically influenced by frequency. After being asked to evaluate all the attributes, however, other attributes (e.g. proximity, speed and safety) become more important than frequency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The most reliable data of permeability obtained from laboratory measurements on cores do not provide a continuous profile along the depth of the formation. Recently, researchers utilized statistical regression, neural networks, and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs. Unfortunately, due to both uncertainty and imprecision, the developed predictive modelings are less accurate compared to laboratory experimental core data. This paper presents functional networks as a novel approach to forecast permeability using well logs in a carbonate reservoir. The new intelligence paradigm helps to overcome the most common limitations of the existing modeling techniques in statistics, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence communities. To demonstrate the usefulness of the functional networks modeling strategy, we briefly describe its learning algorithm through simple distinct examples. Comparative studies were carried out using real-life industry wireline logs to compare the performance of the new framework with the most popular modeling schemes, such as linear/nonlinear regression, neural networks, and fuzzy logic inference systems. The results show that the performance of functional networks (separable and generalized associativity) architecture with polynomial basis is accurate, reliable, and outperforms most of the existing predictive data mining modeling approaches. Future work can be achieved using different structure of functional networks with different basis, interaction terms, ensemble and hybrid strategies, different clustering, and outlier identification techniques within different oil and gas challenge problems, namely, 3D passive seismic, identification of lithofacies types, history matching, rock mechanics, viscosity, risk assessment, and reservoir characterization.

However, globalization and the rapid development of technologies have made it difficult to find appropriate business partners such as suppliers and customers, and build reciprocal relationships among them, while it simultaneously offers many opportunities. In this contribution, we propose AI-based approach to find plausible candidates of business partners using firm profiles and transactional relationships among them. We employ machine learning techniques to build a prediction model of customer-supplier relationships. We applied our approach to the large amount of actual business data. The results showed that our approach successfully found potential business partners with F-values of about 84% and reciprocity among them with F-values of about 77%. Using our method, we also developed the Web-based system that helps people in actual businesses to find their new business partners. These contribute to developing one's own business in the complicated, specialized and rapidly changing business environments of recent years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ramos, RP; do Nascimento, MZ; Pereira, DC				Ramos, Rodrigo Pereira; do Nascimento, Marcelo Zanchetta; Pereira, Danilo Cesar			Texture extraction: An evaluation of ridgelet, wavelet and co-occurrence based methods applied to mammograms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Mammography; CADx; Texture extraction; Co-occurrence; Wavelet and ridgelet	FALSE-POSITIVE REDUCTION; MASS DETECTION; ROC ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; SEGMENTATION; IMPROVEMENT; ALGORITHMS; TRANSFORM; VIEWS	Image processing algorithms can be used in computer-aided diagnosis systems to extract features directly from digitized mammograms. Typically, two classes of features are extracted from mammograms with these algorithms, namely morphological and non-morphological features. Image texture analysis is an important technique that represents gray level properties of images used to describe non-morphological features. This technique has shown to be a promising technique in analyzing mammographic lesions caused by masses. In this paper, we evaluate texture classification using features derived from co-occurrence matrices, wavelet and ridgelet transforms of mammographic images. In particular, we propose a false positive reduction in computer-aided detection of masses. The data set consisted of 120 cranio-caudal mammograms, half containing a mass, rated as abnormal images, and half with no lesions. The following texture descriptors were then calculated to analyze the regions of interest (ROIs) texture patterns: entropy, energy, sum average, sum variance, and cluster tendency. To select the best set of features for each method, we applied a genetic algorithm (GA). In the ROIs classification stage, we used the Random Forest algorithm, a data mining technique that separates the data into non-overlapping segments. Experimental results showed that the best classification rates were obtained with the wavelet-based feature extraction using GA for selection of the most relevant features, giving an AUC = 0.90.

J	Chung, YY; Wahid, N				Chung, Yuk Ying; Wahid, Noorhaniza			A hybrid network intrusion detection system using simplified swarm optimization (SSO)	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Particle swarm optimization; Local search; Classification; Data mining; Network intrusion detection	CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; PSO	The network intrusion detection techniques are important to prevent our systems and networks from malicious behaviors. However, traditional network intrusion prevention such as firewalls, user authentication and data encryption have failed to completely protect networks and systems from the increasing and sophisticated attacks and malwares. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid intrusion detection system by using intelligent dynamic swarm based rough set (IDS-RS) for feature selection and simplified swarm optimization for intrusion data classification. IDS-RS is proposed to select the most relevant features that can represent the pattern of the network traffic. In order to improve the performance of SSO classifier, a new weighted local search (WLS) strategy incorporated in SSO is proposed. The purpose of this new local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the neighborhood of the current solution produced by SSO. The performance of the proposed hybrid system on KDDCup 99 dataset has been evaluated by comparing it with the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and two other most popular benchmark classifiers.

J	Jankowski, N				Jankowski, Norbert			GRAPH-BASED GENERATION OF A META-LEARNING SEARCH SPACE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						meta-learning; data mining; learning machines; complexity of learning; complexity of learning machines; computational intelligence	FUZZY-SYSTEMS; ENSEMBLE	Meta-learning is becoming more and more important in current and future research concentrated around broadly defined data mining or computational intelligence. It can solve problems that cannot be solved by any single, specialized algorithm. The overall characteristic of each meta-learning algorithm mainly depends on two elements: the learning machine space and the supervisory procedure. The former restricts the space of all possible learning machines to a subspace to be browsed by a meta-learning algorithm. The latter determines the order of selected learning machines with a module responsible for machine complexity evaluation, organizes tests and performs analysis of results. In this article we present a framework for meta-learning search that can be seen as a method of sophisticated description and evaluation of functional search spaces of learning machine configurations used in meta-learning. Machine spaces will be defined by specially defined graphs where vertices are specialized machine configuration generators. By using such graphs the learning machine space may be modeled in a much more flexible way, depending on the characteristics of the problem considered and a priori knowledge. The presented method of search space description is used together with an advanced algorithm which orders test tasks according to their complexities.

J	Liang, GS; Ding, JF; Wang, CK				Liang, Gin-Shuh; Ding, Ji-Feng; Wang, Chun-Kai			Applying fuzzy quality function deployment to prioritize solutions of knowledge management for an international port in Taiwan	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Knowledge management; Port; Fuzzy number; Quality function deployment; Taiwan	SYSTEMS; MODEL	The purpose of this paper is to apply a fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) approach to prioritize knowledge management (KM) solutions for an international port in Taiwan. First, the paper examines house of quality (HOQ) matrices to facilitate handling of the 'what' (i.e., KM requirements) and 'how' (KM solutions) aspects of the QFD problem, and proposes procedures for the use of a fuzzy QFD method. A case study concerning port K in Taiwan is then used to demonstrate a systematic appraisal process for prioritizing KM solutions, and twenty attributes with sixteen feasible KM implementation solutions are measured employing an HOQ matrix. Finally, the top five feasible solutions for implementing KM at port K are identified. The empirical results show that 'establishment of a data storage and data mining system' in the technology dimension is the most urgent requirement for KM implementation at port K in Taiwan.

J	Liang, JY; Wang, F; Dang, CY; Qian, YH				Liang, Jiye; Wang, Feng; Dang, Chuangyin; Qian, Yuhua			An efficient rough feature selection algorithm with a multi-granulation view	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Feature selection; Multi-granulation view; Rough set theory; Large-scale data sets	ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; SET-THEORY; INFORMATION GRANULATION; DECISION PERFORMANCE; FUZZY-SETS; ENTROPY; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS; TABLES	Feature selection is a challenging problem in many areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Rough set theory, as a valid soft computing tool to analyze various types of data, has been widely applied to select helpful features (also called attribute reduction). In rough set theory, many feature selection algorithms have been developed in the literatures, however, they are very time-consuming when data sets are in a large scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper an efficient rough feature selection algorithm for large-scale data sets, which is stimulated from multi-granulation. A sub-table of a data set can be considered as a small granularity. Given a large-scale data set, the algorithm first selects different small granularities and then estimate on each small granularity the reduct of the original data set. Fusing all of the estimates on small granularities together, the algorithm can get an approximate reduct. Because of that the total time spent on computing reducts for sub-tables is much less than that for the original large-scale one, the algorithm yields in a much less amount of time a feature subset (the approximate reduct). According to several decision performance measures, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and efficient for large-scale data sets. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Mamitsuka, H				Mamitsuka, Hiroshi			Mining from protein-protein interactions	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							DOMAIN-DOMAIN INTERACTIONS; INTERACTION NETWORKS; INTERACTION PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; CLIQUES; MODULES; MODELS; SET	Proteins are important cellular molecules, and interacting protein pairs provide biologically important information, such as functional relationships. We focus on the problem of predicting physically interacting protein pairs. This is an important problem in biology, which has been actively investigated in the field of data mining and knowledge discovery. Our particular focus is on data-mining-based methods, and the objective of this review is to introduce these methods for data mining researchers from technical viewpoints. We categorize those methods into three types: pairwise data-based, network-based, and integrative approaches, each approach being described in a different section. The first section is further divided into five types, such as supervised learning, algorithmic approaches, and unsupervised learning. The second section is mainly on link prediction, which can be further divided into two types, and two subsections that cover topics related with protein interaction networks are further added. The final section provides a wide variety of methods in integrative approaches. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Piegat, A; Landowski, M				Piegat, Andrzej; Landowski, Marek			OPTIMAL ESTIMATOR OF HYPOTHESIS PROBABILITY FOR DATA MINING PROBLEMS WITH SMALL SAMPLES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						single-case problem; probability; probability estimation; frequency interpretation of probability; completeness interpretation of probability; uncertainty theory		The paper presents a new (to the best of the authors' knowledge) estimator of probability called the "Ep(h root 2) completeness estimator" along with a theoretical derivation of its optimality. The estimator is especially suitable for a small number of sample items, which is the feature of many real problems characterized by data insufficiency. The control parameter of the estimator is not assumed in an a priori, subjective way, but was determined on the basis of an optimization criterion (the least absolute errors). The estimator was compared with the universally used frequency estimator of probability and with Cestnik's m-estimator with respect to accuracy. The comparison was realized both theoretically and experimentally. The results show the superiority of the Ep(h root 2) completeness estimator over the frequency estimator for the probability interval p(h) is an element of (0.1, 0.9). The frequency estimator is better for p(h) is an element of [0, 0.1] and p(h) is an element of [0.9, 1].

J	Severyn, A; Moschitti, A				Severyn, Aliaksei; Moschitti, Alessandro			Fast support vector machines for convolution tree kernels	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Kernel methods; Tree kernels; Natural language processing; Large scale learning		Feature engineering is one of the most complex aspects of system design in machine learning. Fortunately, kernel methods provide the designer with formidable tools to tackle such complexity. Among others, tree kernels (TKs) have been successfully applied for representing structured data in diverse domains, ranging from bioinformatics and data mining to natural language processing. One drawback of such methods is that learning with them typically requires a large number of kernel computations (quadratic in the number of training examples) between training examples. However, in practice substructures often repeat in the data which makes it possible to avoid a large number of redundant kernel evaluations. In this paper, we propose the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to compactly represent trees in the training algorithm of Support Vector Machines. In particular, we use DAGs for each iteration of the cutting plane algorithm (CPA) to encode the model composed by a set of trees. This enables DAG kernels to efficiently evaluate TKs between the current model and a given training tree. Consequently, the amount of total computation is reduced by avoiding redundant evaluations over shared substructures. We provide theory and algorithms to formally characterize the above idea, which we tested on several datasets. The empirical results confirm the benefits of the approach in terms of significant speedups over previous state-of-the-art methods.

This approach is based on seeking the knowledge that is assumed to be embedded in the efficient solutions provided by the optimization module built using tabu search. The objective is to discover the scheduling concepts using data mining and hence to obtain a set of rules capable of approximating the efficient solutions for a job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). A data mining based scheduling framework is presented and implemented for a job shop problem with maximum lateness as the scheduling objective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sheikhan, M; Jadidi, Z; Farrokhi, A				Sheikhan, Mansour; Jadidi, Zahra; Farrokhi, Ali			Intrusion detection using reduced-size RNN based on feature grouping	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Partial connection; Recurrent neural network; Intrusion detection; Feature grouping	ANOMALY DETECTION; DETECTION SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELS	Intrusion detection is well-known as an essential component to secure the systems in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Based on the type of analyzing events, two kinds of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed: anomaly-based and misuse-based. In this paper, three-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with categorized features as inputs and attack types as outputs of RNN is proposed as misuse-based IDS. The input features are categorized to basic features, content features, time-based traffic features, and host-based traffic features. The attack types are classified to Denial-of-Service (DoS), Probe, Remote-to-Local (R2L), and User-to-Root (U2R). For this purpose, in this study, we use the 41 features per connection defined by International Knowledge Discovery and Data mining group (KDD). The RNN has an extra output which corresponds to normal class (no attack). The connections between the nodes of two hidden layers of RNN are considered partial. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to improve classification rate, particularly in R2L attacks. This method also offers better Detection Rate (DR) and Cost Per Example (CPE) when compared to similar related works and also the simulated Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Elman-based intrusion detectors. On the other hand, False Alarm Rate (FAR) of the proposed model is not degraded significantly when compared to some recent machine learning methods.

J	Tatti, N; Vreeken, J				Tatti, Nikolaj; Vreeken, Jilles			Comparing apples and oranges: measuring differences between exploratory data mining results	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Exploratory data mining; Distance; Maximum entropy model; Iterative data mining; Tiling; Binary data		Deciding whether the results of two different mining algorithms provide significantly different information is an important, yet understudied, open problem in exploratory data mining. Whether the goal is to select the most informative result for analysis, or to decide which mining approach will most likely provide the most novel insight, it is essential that we can tell how different the information is that different results by possibly different methods provide. In this paper we take a first step towards comparing exploratory data mining results on binary data. We propose to meaningfully convert results into sets of noisy tiles, and compare between these sets by maximum entropy modelling and Kullback-Leibler divergence, well-founded notions from Information Theory. We so construct a measure that is highly flexible, and allows us to naturally include background knowledge, such that differences in results can be measured from the perspective of what a user already knows. Furthermore, adding to its interpretability, it coincides with Jaccard dissimilarity when we only consider exact tiles. Our approach provides a means to study and tell differences between results of different exploratory data mining methods. As an application, we show that our measure can also be used to identify which parts of results best redescribe other results. Furthermore, we study its use for iterative data mining, where one iteratively wants to find that result that will provide maximal novel information. Experimental evaluation shows our measure gives meaningful results, correctly identifies methods that are similar in nature, automatically provides sound redescriptions of results, and is highly applicable for iterative data mining.

For some data in a rich dimensional space, the performance (i.e., testing accuracy) of linear classifiers has shown to be close to that of nonlinear classifiers such as kernel methods, but training and testing speed is much faster. Recently, many research works have developed efficient optimization methods to construct linear classifiers and applied them to some large-scale applications. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey on the recent development of this active research area.

J	Zhang, P; Gao, BJ; Liu, P; Shi, Y; Guo, L				Zhang, Peng; Gao, Byron J.; Liu, Ping; Shi, Yong; Guo, Li			A framework for application-driven classification of data streams	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Data stream classification; Transfer learning; Semi-supervised learning; Relational k-means; Concept drifting	NOISY DATA STREAMS	Data stream classification has drawn increasing attention from the data mining community in recent years. Relevant applications include network traffic monitoring, sensor network data analysis, Web click stream mining, power consumption measurement, dynamic tracing of stock fluctuations, to name a few. Data stream classification in such real-world applications is typically subject to three major challenges: concept drifting, large volumes, and partial labeling. As a result, training examples in data streams can be very diverse and it is very hard to learn accurate models with efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that first categorizes diverse training examples into four types and assign learning priorities to them. Then, we derive four learning cases based on the proportion and priority of the different types of training examples. Finally, for each learning case, we employ one of the four SVM-based training models: classical SVM, semi-supervised SVM, transfer semi-supervised SVM, and relational k-means transfer semi-supervised SVM. We perform comprehensive experiments on real-world data streams that validate the utility of our approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chiu, HP; Tang, YT; Hsieh, KL				Chiu, Hung-Pin; Tang, Yi-Tsung; Hsieh, Kun-Lin			Applying cluster-based fuzzy association rules mining framework into EC environment	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy association rule; Clustering-based data mining; Electronic commerce (EC); Fuzzy membership functions	CLASSIFICATION; PERSPECTIVE	During electronic commerce (EC) environment, how to effectively mine the useful transaction information will be an important issue to be addressed in designing the marketing strategy for most enterprises. Especially, the relationships between different databases (e.g., the transaction and online browsing database) may have the unknown and potential knowledge of business intelligence. Two important issues of mining association rules were mentioned to address EC application in this study. The first issue is the discovery of generalized fuzzy association rules in the transaction database. The second issue is to discover association rules from the web usage data and the large itemsets identified in the transaction database. A cluster-based fuzzy association rules (CBFAR) mining architecture is then proposed to simultaneously address such two issues in this study. Three contributions were achieved as: (a) an efficient fuzzy association rule miner based on cluster-based fuzzy-sets tables is presented to identify all the large fuzzy itemsets; (b) this approach requires less contrast to generate large itemsets; (3) a fuzzy rule mining approach is used to compute the confidence values for discovering the relationships between transaction database and browsing information database. Finally, a simulated example during EC environment is provided to demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ferraretti, D; Gamberoni, G; Lamma, E				Ferraretti, Denis; Gamberoni, Giacomo; Lamma, Evelina			Unsupervised and supervised learning in cascade for petroleum geology	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Knowledge discovery and data mining; Clustering; Classification; Application; Petroleum geology	CLASSIFICATION	Cascade of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms are suitable in all those problems where there are large unlabelled input datasets and the underlying data structure is hidden and not clearly defined. In petroleum geology the understanding and characterization of reservoirs needs integration of different subsurface data in order to create reliable reservoir models. The large amount of data for each well and the presence of different wells to be simultaneously analysed make this task both complex and time consuming. In this scenario, the development of reliable characterization methods is of prime importance in order to help the geologist and reduce the subjectivity of data interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation system based on the use of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in cascade. Using unsupervised algorithm the domain expert identifies relevant clusters that will be used as classes in the following step, in order to learn a classifier to be applied to new instances and wells. We test the approach over five real well dataset using different evaluating techniques. Main advantages of this approach are the ability to manage and use a large amount of data simultaneously and the reduction in interpretation time of a group of wells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jin, C; Jin, SW; Qin, LN				Jin, Cong; Jin, Shu-Wei; Qin, Li-Na			Attribute selection method based on a hybrid BPNN and PSO algorithms	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Reduction dimensionality; Attribute selection; Back Propagation Neural Network; Particle Swarm Optimization; Input output correlation	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION	High dimensional data contain many redundant or irrelevant attributes, which will be difficult for data mining and a variety of pattern recognition. When implementing data mining or a variety of pattern recognition on high dimensional space, it is necessary to reduce the dimension of high dimensional space. In this paper, a new attribute importance measure and selection methods based on attribute ranking was proposed. In proposed attribute selection method, input output correlation (IOC) is applied for calculating attribute' importance, and then sorts them according to descending order. The hybrid of Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms is also proposed. PSO is used to optimize weights and thresholds of BPNN for overcoming the inherent shortcoming of BPNN. The experiment results show the proposed attribute selection method is an effective preproceesing technology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This technique detects abnormal behavior of a target by comparing it with its peer group and measuring the deviation of its behavior from that of its peers. Moreover, this study proposes a method to improve the general peer group analysis by incorporating the weight of peer group members into summarizing their behavior, along with the consideration of parameter updates over time. Using real time series data of Korean stock market, this study shows the advantage of the proposed peer group analysis in detecting abnormal stock price change. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of the parameters used in the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, C; Song, B; Park, Y				Lee, Changyong; Song, Bomi; Park, Yongtae			Design of convergent product concepts based on functionality: An association rule mining and decision tree approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						New product development (NPD); Convergent product; Concept design; Online community information; Text mining; Association rule mining (ARM); Decision tree (DT)	CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE; SERVICE; SYSTEM; CONCEPTUALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; INDUCTION; DATABASES; DIAGNOSIS; COMMUNITY	Recent trends in paradigms of digital convergence have accentuated the notions of convergent products that are formed by adding new functions to an existing base product. However, a lacuna still remains in the literature as to systematic design of convergent product concepts (CPCs) based on functionality. This study proposes a systematic approach to design of CPCs based on online community information using data mining techniques. At the heart of the suggested approach is the combined use of association rule mining (ARM) and decision tree (DT) for discovering the significant relationships among items and detecting the meaningful conditions of items. Specifically, the proposed approach is composed of four steps: data collection and transformation, definition of target functions, identification of critical product features, and specification of design details. Three maps - function co-preferences map, feature relations map, and concepts specification map - are developed to aid decision making in design of CPCs, structuring and visualizing design implications. A case of the portable multimedia player (PMP) is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. We believe that our approach can reduce uncertainty and risk involved in the concept design stage.

As an extension of the classical two-stage capacitated facility location problem, our problem allows flows of commodities to move among TPs and does not impose restrictions on the number of TPs traversed by flows going from plants to customers. In order to obtain high-quality feasible solutions, we propose a clustering-based scatter search in which the seed solution generation, the diversification technique and the local search are designed using the clusters generated by a data mining technique, the K-means method. The computational results show that the scatter search performs efficiently over different kinds of instances. Moreover, the solution quality is also good since the average gaps to lower bounds range between 1 and 3%.

Yet many repositories lack the information required for a social analysis. So, what other means exist to infer how developers interact around their code? One option is static code metrics that have already demonstrated their usefulness in analyzing change in evolving software systems. But do they also help in defect prediction? To address this question we selected a set of static code metrics to determine what classes are most "active" (i.e., the classes where the developers spend much time interacting with each other's design and implementation decisions) in 33 open-source Java systems that lack details about individual developers. In particular, we assessed the merit of these activity-centric measures in the context of "inspection optimization" - a technique that allows for reading the fewest lines of code in order to find the most defects. For the task of inspection optimization these activity measures perform as well as (usually, within 4%) a theoretical upper bound on the performance of any set of measures. As a result, we argue that activity-centric static code metrics are an excellent predictor for defects.

Tunnelling, mining and excavations are some examples of these problems. The purpose of this paper is to apply Data Mining (DM) techniques such as multiple regressions (MR), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), to predict the uniaxial compressive strength and the deformation modulus of the Oporto granite. This rock is a light grey, two-mica, medium-grained, hypidiomorphic granite and is located in Oporto (Portugal) and surrounding areas. Begonha (1997) and Begonha and Sequeira Braga (2002) studied this granite in terms of chemical, mineralogical, physical and mechanical properties. Among other things, like the weathering features, those authors applied correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between two properties either physical or mechanical or physical and mechanical. This study took the data published by those authors to build a database containing 55 rock sample records. Each record contains the free porosity (N-48), the dry bulk density (d), the ultrasonic velocity (v), the uniaxial compressive strength (sigma(c)) and the modulus of elasticity (E). It was concluded that all the models obtained from DM techniques have good performances. Nevertheless, the best forecasting capacity was obtained with the SVM model with N-48 and v as input parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Not only is it important in order to reduce costs, but also it is necessary even more as a means of reducing the amount of fuel that gets wasted, thereby improving productivity, ensuring better product quality, and generally increasing profits. This article describes a decision system developed for optimizing the energy efficiency of a petrochemical plant. The system has been developed after a data mining process of the parameters registered in the past. The designed system carries out an optimization process of the energy efficiency of the plant based on a combined algorithm that uses the following for obtaining a solution: On the one hand, the energy efficiency of the operation points occurred in the past and, on the other hand, a module of two neural networks to obtain new interpolated operation points. Besides, the work includes a previous discriminant analysis of the variables of the plant in order to select the parameters most important in the plant and to study the behavior of the energy efficiency index. This study also helped ensure an optimal training of the neural networks. The robustness of the system as well as its satisfactory results in the testing process (an average rise in the energy efficiency of around 7%, reaching, in some cases, up to 45%) have encouraged a consulting company (ALIATIS) to implement and to integrate the decision system as a pilot software in an SCADA.

They are in a constant need for personalization in order to make effective suggestions and to provide valuable information of items available. A way to reach such personalization is by means of an alternative data mining technique called classification based on association, which uses association rules in a prediction perspective. In this work we propose a hybrid methodology for recommender systems, which uses collaborative filtering and content-based approaches in a joint method taking advantage from the strengths of both approaches. Moreover, we also employ fuzzy logic to enhance recommendations' quality and effectiveness. In order to analyze the behavior of the techniques used in our methodology, we accomplished a case study using real data gathered from two recommender systems.

J	Shehzad, K				Shehzad, Khurram			EDISC: A Class-Tailored Discretization Technique for Rule-Based Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Discretization; continuous values; discrete values; data transformation; data mining; machine learning; inductive learning; supervised learning; rule induction	ALGORITHM; INDUCTION; KNOWLEDGE	Discretization is a critical component of data mining whereby continuous attributes of a data set are converted into discrete ones by creating intervals either before or during learning. There are many good reasons for preprocessing discretization, such as increased learning efficiency and classification accuracy, comprehensibility of data mining results, as well as the inherent limitation of a great majority of learning algorithms to handle only discrete data. Many preprocessing discretization techniques have been proposed to date, of which the Entropy-MDLP discretization has been accepted as by far the most effective in the context of both decision tree learning and rule induction algorithms. This paper presents a new discretization technique EDISC which utilizes the entropy-based principle but takes a class-tailored approach to discretization. The technique is applicable in general to any covering algorithm, including those that use the class-per-class rule induction methodology such as CN2 as well as those that use a seed example during the learning phase, such as the RULES family. Experimental evaluation has proved the efficiency and effectiveness of the technique as a preprocessing discretization procedure for CN2 as well as RULES-7, the latest algorithm among the RULES family of inductive learning algorithms.

J	Shi, FQ; Sun, SQ; Xu, J				Shi, Fuqian; Sun, Shouqian; Xu, Jiang			Employing rough sets and association rule mining in KANSEI knowledge extraction	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						KANSEI Engineering; Rough sets theory; Association rule mining; Reduction algorithm	CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; SYSTEM; FORM	KANSEI Engineering (KE) is a method for translating feelings and impressions into product parameters and the objective of KANSEI Engineering is to study the relationship between product forms and KANSEI images. It is most important to extract critical form features of the product relative to specific KANSEI adjectives through a WEB-based KANSEI information system. In this paper, critical form features and KANSEI adjectives were defined as condition attributes and decision attributes respectively, which were formalized as two objects in Decision Table (DT). Then, the Semantic Differential (SD), which measures the connotative meaning of concepts, was applied to evaluate form features of the product through a KANSEI questionnaire system. The evaluation record from an individual's transaction data was reserved if its frequency was higher than the given threshold. Some form features were deleted by using an attribute reduction algorithm based on Rough Sets Theory (RST). Furthermore, the size of the DT was reduced by using a rule-joining operation. A strong association rule set which describes the relationship between the critical form features and the corresponding KANSEI adjectives was subsequently generated. A case study of a mobile phone design was presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with other non-linear data mining methods in KANSEI Engineering.

A descriptive data mining approach is applied to achieve a pattern of citizens' satisfaction, and also establishes a fitting grey relation agent to handle the re-service process when a citizen is unsatisfied for his/her on-line requests. This work collected 2023 cases, which are collected from the satisfaction quantity tables in the On-line Service System of Kaohsiung City Government (OSSKCG) database. These cases are accessed during the period from the first of September 2008 to the thirty-first of August 2009. The results of the study show that our selected seven critical measuring indicators could positively evaluate twenty service items and five citizens' attributes, and could report the service performance or automatically recreate a case after citizen was unsatisfied.

Clustering takes place in the product space of systems inputs and outputs and each cluster corresponds to a fuzzy IF-THEN rule. By initializing the clustering with a number of clusters and subsequently removing less important ones as the clustering progresses, it is sought to obtain a suitable partition of the data in an automated manner. The approach is generally applicable to the fuzzy-means and related algorithms. In this paper, this method can better return appropriate information for user queries; in particular, a novel ranking strategy is provided to measure the relevance score of an annotated set of web results by considering user queries, data annotation, and the underlying ontology.

Discovering injective episodes with general partial orders	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Episode mining; General partial order; Non-overlapped count; Bidirectional evidence	FREQUENT EPISODES; SPIKE TRAINS; SEQUENCES; PATTERNS	Frequent episode discovery is a popular framework for temporal pattern discovery in event streams. An episode is a partially ordered set of nodes with each node associated with an event type. Currently algorithms exist for episode discovery only when the associated partial order is total order (serial episode) or trivial (parallel episode). In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for discovering frequent episodes with unrestricted partial orders when the associated event-types are unique. These algorithms can be easily specialized to discover only serial or parallel episodes. Also, the algorithms are flexible enough to be specialized for mining in the space of certain interesting subclasses of partial orders. We point out that frequency alone is not a sufficient measure of interestingness in the context of partial order mining. We propose a new interestingness measure for episodes with unrestricted partial orders which, when used along with frequency, results in an efficient scheme of data mining. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.	[Achar, Avinash; Sastry, P.

For this reason, WFP mining becomes an important research issue in data mining and knowledge discovery. However, existing algorithms cannot be applied for incremental and interactive WFP mining and also for stream data mining because they are based on a static database and require multiple database scans. In this paper, we present two novel tree structures IWFPTWA (Incremental WFP tree based on weight ascending order) and IWFPTFD (Incremental WFP tree based on frequency descending order), and two new algorithms IWFPWA and IWFPFD for incremental and interactive WFP mining using a single database scan. They are effective for incremental and interactive mining to utilize the current tree structure and to use the previous mining results when a database is updated or a minimum support threshold is changed. IWFPWA gets advantage in candidate pattern generation by obtaining the highest weighted item in the bottom of IWFFTWA. IWFPFD ensures that any non-candidate item cannot appear before candidate items in any branch of IWFPTFD and thus speeds up the prefix tree and conditional tree creation time during mining operation. IWFPTFD also achieves the highly compact incremental tree to save memory space. To our knowledge, this is the first research work to perform single-pass incremental and interactive mining for weighted frequent patterns. Extensive performance analyses show that our tree structures and algorithms are very efficient and scalable for single-pass incremental and interactive WFP mining.

J	Kenig, B; Tassa, T				Kenig, Batya; Tassa, Tamir			A practical approximation algorithm for optimal k-anonymity	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; k-Anonymity; l-Diversity; Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems; Frequent generalized itemsets	ANONYMIZATION	k-Anonymity is a privacy preserving method for limiting disclosure of private information in data mining. The process of anonymizing a database table typically involves generalizing table entries and, consequently, it incurs loss of relevant information. This motivates the search for anonymization algorithms that achieve the required level of anonymization while incurring a minimal loss of information. The problem of k-anonymization with minimal loss of information is NP-hard. We present a practical approximation algorithm that enables solving the k-anonymization problem with an approximation guarantee of O(ln k). That algorithm improves an algorithm due to Aggarwal et al. (Proceedings of the international conference on database theory (ICDT), 2005) that offers an approximation guarantee of O(k), and generalizes that of Park and Shim (SIGMOD '07: proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data, 2007) that was limited to the case of generalization by suppression. Our algorithm uses techniques that we introduce herein for mining closed frequent generalized records. Our experiments show that the significance of our algorithm is not limited only to the theory of k-anonymization. The proposed algorithm achieves lower information losses than the leading approximation algorithm, as well as the leading heuristic algorithms. A modified version of our algorithm that issues a""-diverse k-anonymizations also achieves lower information losses than the corresponding modified versions of the leading algorithms.

Using an inorganic AB(2) compound database as a template data platform, the evolution of design rules for crystal chemistry based on an information-theoretic partitioning classifier for a high-dimensional manifold of crystal chemistry descriptors is monitored. An application of this data-mining approach to establish chemical and structural design rules for crystal chemistry is demonstrated by showing that, when coupled with first-principles calculations, statistical inference methods can serve as a tool for significantly accelerating the prediction of unknown crystal structures.

J	Luengo, J; Garcia, S; Herrera, F				Luengo, Julian; Garcia, Salvador; Herrera, Francisco			On the choice of the best imputation methods for missing values considering three groups of classification methods	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Approximate models; Classification; Imputation; Rule induction learning; Lazy learning; Missing values; Single imputation	INPUT FEATURE-SELECTION; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFIERS; PERFORMANCE; INDUCTION; ALGORITHM; RULES; TREES	In real-life data, information is frequently lost in data mining, caused by the presence of missing values in attributes. Several schemes have been studied to overcome the drawbacks produced by missing values in data mining tasks; one of the most well known is based on preprocessing, formerly known as imputation. In this work, we focus on a classification task with twenty-three classification methods and fourteen different imputation approaches to missing values treatment that are presented and analyzed. The analysis involves a group-based approach, in which we distinguish between three different categories of classification methods. Each category behaves differently, and the evidence obtained shows that the use of determined missing values imputation methods could improve the accuracy obtained for these methods. In this study, the convenience of using imputation methods for preprocessing data sets with missing values is stated. The analysis suggests that the use of particular imputation methods conditioned to the groups is required.

Determinants of intangible assets value: The data mining approach	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature selection; Data mining; Firm value; Intangible assets value; Neural networks	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURE-SELECTION; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; EMERGING MARKETS; FIRM VALUE; REGRESSION TREES; EQUITY OWNERSHIP; BUSINESS GROUPS; BANK FAILURE	It is very important for investors and creditors to understand the critical factors affecting a firm's value before making decisions about investments and loans. Since the knowledge-based economy has evolved, the method for creating firm value has transferred from traditional physical assets to intangible knowledge. Therefore, valuation of intangible assets has become a widespread topic of interest in the future of the economy. This study takes advantage of feature selection, an important data-preprocessing step in data mining, to identify important and representative factors affecting intangible assets. Particularly, five feature selection methods are considered, which include principal component analysis (PCA), stepwise regression (STEPWISE), decision trees (DT), association rules (AR), and genetic algorithms (GA). In addition, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are used as the prediction model in order to understand which features selected from these five methods can allow the prediction model to perform best. Based on the chosen dataset containing 61 variables, the experimental result shows that combining the results from multiple feature selection methods performs the best.

J	Yildizer, E; Balci, AM; Jarada, TN; Alhajj, R				Yildizer, Ela; Balci, Ali Metin; Jarada, Tamer N.; Alhajj, Reda			Integrating wavelets with clustering and indexing for effective content-based image retrieval	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Content-based image retrieval; Wavelet transformation; Clustering; Cluster validity analysis; Indexing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLE; SEARCH; TREE	Recent development in technology influenced our daily life and the way people communicate and store data. There is a clear shift from traditional methods to sophisticated techniques; this maximizes the utilization of the widely available digital media. People are able to take photos using hand held devices and there is a massive increase in the volume of photos digitally stored. Digital devices are also shaping the medical field. Scanners are available for every part of the body to help identifying problems. However, this tremendous increase in the number of digitally captured and stored images necessitates the development of advanced techniques capable of classifying and effectively retrieving relevant images when needed. Thus, content-based image retrieval systems (CBIR) have become very popular for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images with minimum human intervention. The research community is competing for more efficient and effective methods as CBIR systems may be heavily employed in serving time critical monitoring applications in homeland security, scientific and medical domains, among others. All of this motivated for the work described in this paper. We propose a novel approach which uses a well-known clustering algorithm k-means and a database indexing structure B+-tree to facilitate retrieving relevant images in an efficient and effective way. Cluster validity analysis indexes combined with majority voting are employed to verify the appropriate number of clusters. While searching for similar images, we consider images from the closest cluster and from other nearby clusters. We introduced two new parameters named c(G) and c(S) to determine the distance range to be searched in each cluster. These parameters enable us to find similar images even if the query image is misclustered and to further narrow down the search space for large clusters. To determine values of c(G) and c(S), we introduced a new formula for gain measurement and we iteratively find the best gain value and accordingly set the values. We used Daubechies wavelet transformation for extracting the feature vectors of images. The reported test results are promising. The results demonstrate how using data mining techniques could improve the efficiency of the CBIR task without sacrificing much from the accuracy of the overall process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	De Bock, KW; Van den Poel, D				De Bock, Koen W.; Van den Poel, Dirk			Reconciling performance and interpretability in customer churn prediction using ensemble learning based on generalized additive models	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Database marketing; Customer churn prediction; Ensemble classification; Generalized additive models (GAMs); GAMens; Model interpretability	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; RANDOM FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION; RETENTION; CLASSIFIERS; SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; DEFECTION; DIAGNOSIS	To build a successful customer churn prediction model, a classification algorithm should be chosen that fulfills two requirements: strong classification performance and a high level of model interpretability. In recent literature, ensemble classifiers have demonstrated superior performance in a multitude of applications and data mining contests. However, due to an increased complexity they result in models that are often difficult to interpret. In this study, GAMensPlus, an ensemble classifier based upon generalized additive models (GAMs), in which both performance and interpretability are reconciled, is presented and evaluated in a context of churn prediction modeling. The recently proposed GAMens, based upon Bagging, the Random Subspace Method and semi-parametric GAMs as constituent classifiers, is extended to include two instruments for model interpretability: generalized feature importance scores, and boot-strap confidence bands for smoothing splines. In an experimental comparison on data sets of six real-life churn prediction projects, the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm over a set of well-known benchmark algorithms is demonstrated in terms of four evaluation metrics. Further, the ability of the technique to deliver valuable insight into the drivers of customer churn is illustrated in a case study on data from a European bank. Firstly, it is shown how the generalized feature importance scores allow the analyst to identify the relative importance of churn predictors in function of the criterion that is used to measure the quality of the model predictions. Secondly, the ability of GAMensPlus to identify nonlinear relationships between predictors and churn probabilities is demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, CW; Lan, GC; Hong, TP				Lin, Chun-Wei; Lan, Guo-Cheng; Hong, Tzung-Pei			An incremental mining algorithm for high utility itemsets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Utility mining; High utility itemset; Incremental mining; FUP concept; Two-phase algorithm	FREQUENT; PERSPECTIVE; GENERATION; DATABASES	Association-rule mining, which is based on frequency values of items, is the most common topic in data mining. In real-world applications, customers may, however, buy many copies of products and each product may have different factors, such as profits and prices. Only mining frequent itemsets in binary databases is thus not suitable for some applications. Utility mining is thus presented to consider additional measures, such as profits or costs according to user preference. In the past, a two-phase mining algorithm was designed for fast discovering high utility itemsets from databases. When data come intermittently, the approach needs to process all the transactions in a batch way. In this paper, an incremental mining algorithm for efficiently mining high utility itemsets is proposed to handle the above situation. It is based on the concept of the fast-update (FUP) approach, which was originally designed for association mining. The proposed approach first partitions itemsets into four parts according to whether they are high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in the original database and in the newly inserted transactions. Each part is then executed by its own procedure. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm executes faster than the two-phase batch mining algorithm in the intermittent data environment (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While these methods do not guarantee precise results, they can be vastly more efficient than approaches that rely on exact counting. However, for many similarity measures no such methods have been known. In this paper, we show how a wide variety of measures can be supported by a simple sampling method. The method also extends to find high-confidence association rules. We demonstrate theoretically that our method is superior to exact methods when the threshold for "interesting similarity/confidence" is above the average pairwise similarity/confidence, and the average support is not too low. Our method is particularly advantageous when transactions contain many items. We confirm in experiments on standard association mining benchmarks that we obtain a significant speedup on real data sets. Reductions in computation time of over an order of magnitude, and significant savings in space, are observed.

An important element that helps a tutor better understand learner's mistake is finding the causes of the learners' mistakes. In this paper, we explain how we have designed and integrated a causal learning mechanism in a cognitive agent named CELTS (Conscious Emotional Learning Tutoring System) that assists learners during learning activities. Unlike other works in cognitive agents that used Bayesian Networks to deal with causality, CELTS's causal learning mechanism is implemented using data mining algorithms that can be used with large amount of data. The integration of a causal learning mechanism within CELTS allows it to predict learners' mistakes. Experiments showed that the causal learning mechanism help CELTS improve learners' performance.

J	Kaosar, MG; Paulet, R; Yi, X				Kaosar, Mohammed Golam; Paulet, Russell; Yi, Xun			Fully homomorphic encryption based two-party association rule mining	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; Security; Association rules; Homomorphic encryption; Privacy preservation	PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOSYSTEMS; PRIVACY	Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the popular data mining methods that discover interesting correlations amongst a large collection of data, which appears incomprehensible. This is known to be a trivial task when the data is owned by one party. But when multiple data sites collectively engage in ARM, privacy concerns are introduced. Due to this concern, privacy preserving data mining algorithms have been developed to attain the desired result, while maintaining privacy. In the case of two party privacy preserving ARM for horizontally partitioned databases, both parties are required to compare their itemset counts securely. This problem is comparable to the famous millionaire problem of Yao. However, in this paper, we propose a secure comparison technique using fully homomorphic encryption scheme that provides a similar level of security to the Yao based solution, but promotes greater efficiency due to the reuse of resources.

In this work, we address significance in the context of frequent itemset mining. Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to identify a meaningful support threshold s* for a dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support at least s* represents a substantial deviation from what would be expected in a random dataset with the same number of transactions and the same individual item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as statistically significant with a small false discovery rate. We present extensive experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of our methodology.

The main issues include frequent-pattern mining and data-overload handling. Therefore, a mining algorithm together with two dedicated overload-handling mechanisms is proposed. The algorithm extracts basic information from streaming data and keeps the information in its data structure. The mining task is accomplished when requested by calculating the approximate counts of itemsets and then returning the frequent ones. When there exists data overload, one of the two mechanisms is executed to settle the overload by either improving system throughput or shedding data load. From the experimental data, we find that our mining algorithm is efficient and possesses good accuracy. More importantly, it could effectively manage data overload with the overload-handling mechanisms. Our research results may lead to a feasible solution for frequent-pattern mining in dynamic data streams. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data mining methods mostly approach this challenge by examining the effect of operation settings on product quality. We analyze the impact of operational sequences on product quality. For this purpose, we propose a novel method for visual analysis and classification of operational sequences. The suggested framework is based on an Iterated Function System (IFS), for producing a fractal representation of manufacturing processes. We demonstrate our method with a software application for visual analysis of quality-related data. The proposed method offers production engineers an effective tool for visual detection of operational sequence patterns influencing product quality, and requires no understanding of mathematical or statistical algorithms. Moreover, it enables to detect faulty operational sequence patterns of any length, without predefining the sequence pattern length. It also enables to visually distinguish between different faulty operational sequence patterns in cases of recurring operations within a production route. Our proposed method provides another significant added value by enabling the visual detection of rare and missing operational sequences per product quality measure. We demonstrate cases in which previous methods fail to provide these capabilities.

To aid in the timely diagnosis and treatment of such exposures, this research investigates the feasibility of a knowledge-based system capable of generating differential diagnoses for human exposures involving unknown toxins. Methods: Data mining techniques automatically extract prior probabilities and likelihood ratios from a database managed by the Florida Poison Information Center. Using observed clinical effects, the trained system produces a ranked list of plausible toxic exposures. The resulting system was evaluated using 30,152 single exposure cases. In addition, the effects of two filters for refining diagnosis based on a minimum number of exposure cases and a minimum number of clinical effects were also explored. Results: The system achieved accuracies (calculated as the percentage of exposures correctly identified in top 10% of trained diagnoses) as high as 79.8% when diagnosing by substance and 78.9% when diagnosing by the major and minor categories of toxins. Conclusions: The results of this research are modest, yet promising. At this time, no similar systems are currently in use in the United States and it is hoped that these studies will yield an effective medical decision support system for clinical toxicology.

But, it has not been studied as much. We consider negative association in a hierarchical setting, in which we are able to generate negative association rules at different hierarchy levels. It allows to impose restrictions when we proceed to the next level and discover only most interesting negative association rules among the vast number of possible negative association rules. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for mining negative association rules by considering that items are organized in a hierarchy, and this hierarchy is reflected on the association rules we produce. In this way, we can mine for both general and specialized rules of negative association between items.

It can also be used for image segmentation, but the algorithm is not robust to noise. The possibilistic c-means (PCM) algorithm was proposed to overcome such a problem. However, the performance of PCM is too sensitive to the initialization of cluster centers, and often deteriorates due to the coincident clustering problem. To remedy these problems, we propose a new hybrid clustering algorithm that incorporates AGO (ant colony optimization)-based clustering into PCM, namely ACOPCM for noisy image segmentation. Our A CO PCM solves the coincident clustering problem by using pre-classified pixel information and provides the near optimal initialization of the number of clusters and their centroids. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons are performed on several images having different noise levels and bias-fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher segmentation accuracy than PCM and other hybrid fuzzy clustering approaches.

A unified view of the apriori-based algorithms for frequent episode discovery	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent episode mining; Serial episodes; Apriori-based; Frequency notions	EVENT SEQUENCES	Frequent episode discovery framework is a popular framework in temporal data mining with many applications. Over the years, many different notions of frequencies of episodes have been proposed along with different algorithms for episode discovery. In this paper, we present a unified view of all the apriori-based discovery methods for serial episodes under these different notions of frequencies. Specifically, we present a unified view of the various frequency counting algorithms. We propose a generic counting algorithm such that all current algorithms are special cases of it. This unified view allows one to gain insights into different frequencies, and we present quantitative relationships among different frequencies. Our unified view also helps in obtaining correctness proofs for various counting algorithms as we show here. It also aids in understanding and obtaining the anti-monotonicity properties satisfied by the various frequencies, the properties exploited by the candidate generation step of any apriori-based method. We also point out how our unified view of counting helps to consider generalization of the algorithm to count episodes with general partial orders.	[Achar, Avinash; Sastry, P.

EMOSTAT automatically imports data from the hemodialysis monitoring software tools and analyzes the delivered treatment looking at six clinically relevant parameters. Failures-to-adhere ( FtAs) to the planned treatment are detected and reported to the care-givers. Methods: EMOSTAT has been used for more than seven years in the management of a dialysis service located in Mede, Italy. A total of 72 patients were monitored and 21 251 dialyses were collected. Data analysis is performed on the periods 2002-2005 and 2005-2008, corresponding to two different software releases. Results: The system had been exploited into everyday clinical practice for the entire considered period. The number of FtAs significantly decreased along the first period: the bulk blood flow FtAs decreased after the introduction of the system. Hemodialysis sessions lasted longer in the second period. Co-occurring FtAs, highlighting the presence of complex FtAs patterns, were also detected. Conclusions: EMOSTAT provides an effective way to re-focus the attention of the dialysis department on the treatment plan and on its implementation. The automatic data collection and the design philosophy of EMOSTAT allowed the routine use of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Berendt, B				Berendt, Bettina			More than modelling and hiding: towards a comprehensive view of Web mining and privacy	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Web mining; Privacy; Knowledge discovery cycle; Web usage (mining); Social network analysis	DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY; SOCIAL NETWORKS; E-COMMERCE; COMMUNITIES; LAW	Over the last decade, privacy has been widely recognised as one of the major problems of data collections in general and the Web in particular. This concerns specifically data arising from Web usage (such as querying or transacting) and social networking (characterised by rich self-profiling including relational information) and the inferences drawn from them. The data mining community has been very conscious of these issues and has addressed in particular the inference problems through various methods for "privacy-preserving data mining" and "privacy-preserving data publishing". However, it appears that these approaches by themselves cannot effectively solve the privacy problems posed by mining. We argue that this is due to the underlying notions of privacy and of data mining, both of which are too narrow. Drawing on notions of privacy not only as hiding, but as control and negotiation, as well as on data mining not only as modelling, but as the whole cycle of knowledge discovery, we offer an alternative view. This is intended to be a comprehensive view of the privacy challenges as well as solution approaches along all phases of the knowledge discovery cycle. The paper thus combines a survey with an outline of an agenda for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary view of Web mining and privacy.

J	Hijazi, MHA; Coenen, F; Zheng, YL				Hijazi, Mohd Hanafi Ahmad; Coenen, Frans; Zheng, Yalin			Data mining techniques for the screening of age-related macular degeneration	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Image classification; Spatial-histograms; Image decomposition; Case based reasoning; Weighted frequent sub-graph mining	SPATIAL-HISTOGRAM FEATURES; IMAGE RETRIEVAL; SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; QUADTREE	Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the primary cause of adult blindness. Currently AMD cannot be cured, however early detection does allow the progress of the condition to be inhibited. One of the first symptoms of AMD is the presence of fatty deposits, called drusen, on the retina. The presence of drusen may be identified through the manual inspection/screening of retinal images. This task, however, requires recourse to domain experts and is therefore resource intensive. This paper proposes and compares two data mining techniques to support the automated screening for AMD. The first uses spatial-histograms, that maintain both image colour and spatial information, for the image representation; to which a case based reasoning (CBR) classification technique is applied. The second is founded on a hierarchical decomposition of the image set so that a tree representation is generated. A weighted frequent sub-graph mining technique is then applied to this representation to identify sub-trees that frequently occur across the data set. The identified sub-trees are then encoded in the form of feature vectors to which standard classification techniques can be applied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, HW; Zhang, SC				Liu, Huawen; Zhang, Shichao			Noisy data elimination using mutual k-nearest neighbor for classification mining	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Data mining; Pattern classification; kNN; Mutual nearest neighbor; Data reduction	PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; INSTANCE SELECTION; ALGORITHMS; SEARCH	k nearest neighbor (kNN) is an effective and powerful lazy learning algorithm, notwithstanding its easy-to-implement. However, its performance heavily relies on the quality of training data. Due to many complex real-applications, noises coming from various possible sources are often prevalent in large scale databases. How to eliminate anomalies and improve the quality of data is still a challenge. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a new anomaly removal and learning algorithm under the framework of kNN. The primary characteristic of our method is that the evidence of removing anomalies and predicting class labels of unseen instances is mutual nearest neighbors, rather than k nearest neighbors. The advantage is that pseudo nearest neighbors can be identified and will not be taken into account during the prediction process. Consequently, the final learning result is more creditable. An extensive comparative experimental analysis carried out on UCI datasets provided empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing the performance of the k-NN rule.

GoldMine mines the simulation traces of a behavioral register transfer level (RTL) design using a decision tree based learning algorithm to produce candidate assertions. These candidate assertions are passed to a formal verification engine. If a candidate assertion is false, a counterexample trace is generated. In this paper, we feed these counterexample traces to iteratively refine the original simulation trace data. We introduce an incremental decision tree to mine the new traces in each iteration. The algorithm converges when all the candidate assertions are true. We formally prove that our algorithm will always converge and capture the complete functionality of each output of a sequential design on convergence. We show that our method always results in a monotonic increase in simulation coverage. We also present an output-centric notion of coverage, and argue that we can attain coverage closure with respect to this notion of coverage. We elaborate the technique step by step using a nontrivial arbiter design. Experimental results to validate our arguments are presented on several designs from Rigel, OpenRisc, and SpaceWire. Some practical limitations to achieve 100% coverage and the differences between final decision tree and binary decision diagram are discussed.

A Framework for Personal Mobile Commerce Pattern Mining and Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; mobile commerce	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	Due to a wide range of potential applications, research on mobile commerce has received a lot of interests from both of the industry and academia. Among them, one of the active topic areas is the mining and prediction of users' mobile commerce behaviors such as their movements and purchase transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Mobile Commerce Explorer (MCE), for mining and prediction of mobile users' movements and purchase transactions under the context of mobile commerce. The MCE framework consists of three major components: 1) Similarity Inference Model (SIM) for measuring the similarities among stores and items, which are two basic mobile commerce entities considered in this paper; 2) Personal Mobile Commerce Pattern Mine (PMCP-Mine) algorithm for efficient discovery of mobile users' Personal Mobile Commerce Patterns (PMCPs); and 3) Mobile Commerce Behavior Predictor (MCBP) for prediction of possible mobile user behaviors. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that facilitates mining and prediction of mobile users' commerce behaviors in order to recommend stores and items previously unknown to a user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation by simulation and show that our proposals produce excellent results.

Because sRNAs are negative regulators it is generally assumed that expression profiles of sRNAs and their targets are negatively correlated. Recently, examples of positive correlation between the expression of sRNAs and their targets have been discovered. At the moment, it is not known how many sRNA-target pairs are positively and negatively correlated, and it is also not clear in what situations (e.g., under which treatments) any of these correlations can be observed. To determine this, one of the first steps is to develop tools to carry out a genome wide characterization of covariation of expression levels of sRNAs and genes. We present FiRePat-Finding Regulatory Patterns-an unsupervised data mining tool applicable to large datasets, typically produced by high throughput sequencing of sRNAs and mRNAs or microarray experiments, that detects sRNA-gene pairs with correlated expression levels. The method consists of three steps: first, we select differentially expressed sRNAs and genes; second, we compute the correlation between sRNA and gene series for all possible sRNA-gene pairs; and third, we cluster the sRNA or gene expression series, simultaneously inducing clusters in the other series. Potential uses of FiRePat are presented using publicly available sRNA and mRNA datasets for both plants and animals. The standard output of FiRePat, a list of correlated pairs formed with sRNAs and mRNAs, can be used to investigate the cause and consequences of the respective expression patterns.

Ontological knowledge bases enable formal querying and reasoning and, consequently, a main research focus has been the investigation of how deductive reasoning can be utilized in ontological representations to enable more advanced applications. However, purely logic methods have not yet proven to be very effective for several reasons: First, there still is the unsolved problem of scalability of reasoning to Web scale. Second, logical reasoning has problems with uncertain information, which is abundant on Semantic Web data due to its distributed and heterogeneous nature. Third, the construction of ontological knowledge bases suitable for advanced reasoning techniques is complex, which ultimately results in a lack of such expressive real-world data sets with large amounts of instance data. From another perspective, the more expressive structured representations open up new opportunities for data mining, knowledge extraction and machine learning techniques. If moving towards the idea that part of the knowledge already lies in the data, inductive methods appear promising, in particular since inductive methods can inherently handle noisy, inconsistent, uncertain and missing data. While there has been broad coverage of inducing concept structures from less structured sources (text, Web pages), like in ontology learning, given the problems mentioned above, we focus on new methods for dealing with Semantic Web knowledge bases, relying on statistical inference on their standard representations. We argue that machine learning research has to offer a wide variety of methods applicable to different expressivity levels of Semantic Web knowledge bases: ranging from weakly expressive but widely available knowledge bases in RDF to highly expressive first-order knowledge bases, this paper surveys statistical approaches to mining the Semantic Web. We specifically cover similarity and distance-based methods, kernel machines, multivariate prediction models, relational graphical models and first-order probabilistic learning approaches and discuss their applicability to Semantic Web representations. Finally, we present selected experiments which were conducted on Semantic Web mining tasks for some of the algorithms presented before. This is intended to show the breadth and general potential of this exiting new research and application area for data mining.

J	Stahl, F; Jordanov, I				Stahl, Frederic; Jordanov, Ivan			An overview of the use of neural networks for data mining tasks	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; GENE-EXPRESSION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; PREDICTION; BIOINFORMATICS; RECOGNITION; MICROARRAY; GENERATION; SEQUENCES	In the recent years, the area of data mining has been experiencing considerable demand for technologies that extract knowledge from large and complex data sources. There has been substantial commercial interest as well as active research in the area that aim to develop new and improved approaches for extracting information, relationships, and patterns from large datasets. Artificial neural networks (NNs) are popular biologically-inspired intelligent methodologies, whose classification, prediction, and pattern recognition capabilities have been utilized successfully in many areas, including science, engineering, medicine, business, banking, telecommunication, and many other fields. This paper highlights from a data mining perspective the implementation of NN, using supervised and unsupervised learning, for pattern recognition, classification, prediction, and cluster analysis, and focuses the discussion on their usage in bioinformatics and financial data analysis tasks.

J	Wardeh, M; Coenen, F; Capon, TB				Wardeh, Maya; Coenen, Frans; Capon, Trevor Bench			PISA: A framework for multiagent classification using argumentation	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; Argumentation; Multiagent (data mining); Classification Association Rules	VALUES; TREES	This paper describes an approach to multi-agent classification using an argumentation from experience paradigm whereby individual agents argue for a given example to be classified with a particular label according to their local data. Arguments are expressed in the form of classification rules which are generated dynamically. As such each local database can be conceptualised as an experience repository; and the individual classification rules, generated from this repository, as describing generalisations drawn from this experience. The argumentation process and the supporting data structures are fully described. The process has been implemented in the PISA (Pooling Information from Several Agents) multi-agent framework which is fully described. Experiments indicate that the operation of PISA is comparable with other classification approaches and that, when operating groups or in the presence of noise, PISA outperforms such comparable approaches.

The HaLoop approach to large-scale iterative data analysis	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						Large-scale analytics; Data-intensive computing; Mapreduce; Cloud data management		The growing demand for large-scale data mining and data analysis applications has led both industry and academia to design new types of highly scalable data-intensive computing platforms. MapReduce has enjoyed particular success. However, MapReduce lacks built-in support for iterative programs, which arise naturally in many applications including data mining, web ranking, graph analysis, and model fitting. This paper (This is an extended version of the VLDB 2010 paper "HaLoop: Efficient Iterative Data Processing on Large Clusters" PVLDB 3(1):285-296, 2010.) presents HaLoop, a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework, that is designed to serve these applications. HaLoop allows iterative applications to be assembled from existing Hadoop programs without modification, and significantly improves their efficiency by providing inter-iteration caching mechanisms and a loop-aware scheduler to exploit these caches. HaLoop retains the fault-tolerance properties of MapReduce through automatic cache recovery and task re-execution. We evaluated HaLoop on a variety of real applications and real datasets. Compared with Hadoop, on average, HaLoop improved runtimes by a factor of 1.85 and shuffled only 4 % as much data between mappers and reducers in the applications that we tested.

Use of machine learning techniques for educational proposes: a decision support system for forecasting students' grades	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Machine learning; Educational data mining; Decision support tools	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; UNIVERSITY; COURSES	Use of machine learning techniques for educational proposes (or educational data mining) is an emerging field aimed at developing methods of exploring data from computational educational settings and discovering meaningful patterns. The stored data (virtual courses, e-learning log file, demographic and academic data of students, admissions/registration info, and so on) can be useful for machine learning algorithms. In this article, we cite the most current articles that use machine learning techniques for educational proposes and we present a case study for predicting students' marks. Students' key demographic characteristics and their marks in a small number of written assignments can constitute the training set for a regression method in order to predict the student's performance. Finally, a prototype version of software support tool for tutors has been constructed.

J	Liao, ZX; Peng, WC				Liao, Zhung-Xun; Peng, Wen-Chih			Clustering spatial data with a geographic constraint: exploring local search	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dual clustering; Spatial clustering; Spatial data mining		Spatial data objects that possess attributes in the optimization domain and the geographic domain are now widely available. For example, sensor data are one kind of spatial data objects. The location of a sensor is an attribute in the geographic domain, while its reading is an attribute in the optimization domain. Previous studies discuss dual clustering problems that attempt to partition spatial data objects into several groups, such that objects in the same group have similar values in their optimization attributes and form a compact region in the geographic domain. However, previous studies do not clearly define compact regions. Therefore, this paper formulates a connective dual clustering problem with an explicit connected constraint given. Objects with a geographic distance smaller than or equal to the connected constraint are connected. The goal of the connective dual clustering problem is to derive clusters that contain objects with similar values in the optimization domain and are connected in the geographic domain. This study further proposes an algorithm CLS (Clustering with Local Search) to efficiently derive clusters. This algorithm consists of two phases: the ConGraph (standing for Connective Graph) transformation phase and the clustering phase. In the ConGraph transformation phase, CLS first transforms the data objects into a ConGraph that captures geographic constraints among data objects and selects initial seeds for clustering. Then, the initial seeds selected nearby data objects and formed coarse clusters by exploring local search in the clustering phase. Moreover, coarse clusters are merged and finely turned. Experiments show that CLS algorithm is more efficient and scalable than existing methods.

J	Meo, R; Bachar, D; Ienco, D				Meo, Rosa; Bachar, Dipankar; Ienco, Dino			LODE: A distance-based classifier built on ensembles of positive and negative observations	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Data mining; Supervised learning; Concept learning; Associative classifier	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; DISCOVERY	Current work on assembling a set of local patterns such as rules and class association rules into a global model for the prediction of a target usually focuses on the identification of the minimal set of patterns that cover the training data. In this paper we present a different point of view: the model of a class has been built with the purpose to emphasize the typical features of the examples of the class. Typical features are modeled by frequent itemsets extracted from the examples and constitute a new representation space of the examples of the class. Prediction of the target class of test examples occurs by computation of the distance between the vector representing the example in the space of the itemsets of each class and the vectors representing the classes. It is interesting to observe that in the distance computation the critical contribution to the discrimination between classes is given not only by the itemsets of the class model that match the example but also by itemsets that do not match the example. These absent features constitute some pieces of information on the examples that can be considered for the prediction and should not be disregarded. Second, absent features are more abundant in the wrong classes than in the correct ones and their number increases the distance between the example vector and the negative class vectors. Furthermore, since absent features are frequent features in their respective classes, they make the prediction more robust against over-fitting and noise. The usage of features absent in the test example is a novel issue in classification: existing learners usually tend to select the best local pattern that matches the example and do not consider the abundance of other patterns that do not match it. We demonstrate the validity of our observations and the effectiveness of LODE, our learner, by means of extensive empirical experiments in which we compare the prediction accuracy of LODE with a consistent set of classifiers of the state of the art. In this paper we also report the methodology that we adopted in order to determine automatically the setting of the learner and of its parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fast Elastic Peak Detection for Mass Spectrometry Data Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge discovery from LC-MS data; time series data mining; bioinformatics; computational proteomics; algorithms and data structures	TIME-SERIES; SPECTRA; ALIGNMENT	We study a data mining problem concerning the elastic peak detection in 2D liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data. These data can be modeled as time series, in which the X-axis represents time points and the Y-axis represents intensity values. A peak occurs in a set of 2D LC-MS data when the sum of the intensity values in a sliding time window exceeds a user-determined threshold. The elastic peak detection problem is to locate all peaks across multiple window sizes of interest in the data set. We propose a new data structure, called a Shifted Aggregation Tree or AggTree for short, and use the data structure to find the different peaks. Our method, called PeakID, solves the elastic peak detection problem in 2D LC-MS data yielding neither false positives nor false negatives. The method works by first constructing an AggTree in a bottom-up manner from the given data set, and then searching the AggTree for the peaks in a top-down manner. We describe a state-space algorithm for finding the topology and structure of an efficient AggTree to be used by PeakID. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other methods on both synthetic and real-world data.

Resource management and scalability of the XCSF learning classifier system	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Learning classifier system; XCS; Function approximation; Scalability; Resource management; Structure alignment	FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; ACCURACY	It has been shown many times that the evolutionary online learning XCS classifier system is a robustly generalizing reinforcement learning system, which also yields highly competitive results in data mining applications. The XCSF version of the system is a real-valued function approximation system, which learns piecewise overlapping local linear models to approximate an iteratively sampled function. While the theory on the binary domain side goes as far as showing that XCS can PAC learn a slightly restricted set of k-DNF problems, theory for XCSF is still rather sparse. This paper takes the theory from the XCS side and projects it onto the real-valued XCSF domain. For a set of functions, in which fitness guidance is given, we even show that XCSF scales optimally with respect to the population size, requiring only a constant overhead to ensure that the evolutionary process can locally optimize the evolving structures. Thus, we provide foundations concerning scalability and resource management for XCSF. Furthermore, we reveal dimensions of problem difficulty for XCSF - and local linear learners in general - showing how structural alignment, that is, alignment of XCSF's solution representation to the problem structure, can reduce the complexity of challenging problems by orders of magnitude.

As such AA favors features that constitute representative 'corners' of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that AA enjoys the interpretability of clustering - without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of SVD - without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale AA, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote FURTHESTSUM that is inspired by the FURTHESTFIRST approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the AA procedure to KERNEL-AA in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of AA when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the AA model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data.

The key issue to facilitate organization of services, taking into account their semantics, is the development of automatic mechanisms that generate appropriate mappings between Web service elements and their semantics-enabled counterparts. In this paper, we introduce an ontology-based mechanism for automatic semantic categorization of WS and their structural components. The presented approach, as opposed to similar ones, takes into account the lexicographic, structural, and data type characteristics of WS. Moreover, a software tool that implements the proposed service categorization mechanism is presented, and a benchmark process is executed that reveals outstanding performance of the developed mechanism in comparison with a relevant state-of-the-art approach.

In our work, we aim at proposing a prototype of a medical expert system that could significantly aid medical experts to detect hemodynamic abnormalities (increased artery wall shear stress). Based on the acquired simulated data, we apply several methodologies for 1) predicting magnitudes and locations of maximum wall shear stress in the artery, 2) estimating reliability of computed predictions, and 3) providing user-friendly explanation of the model's decision.

Case of study: Psychiatric emergency department decision support	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Instance selection; Predictive models; Support decision; Validation; Missing values	EVOLUTIONARY PROTOTYPE SELECTION; INSTANCE SELECTION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; REDUCTION; DATABASES; FRAMEWORK; SETS	There is a frequent situation in data mining where data collected must be used in real time to support decisions and they could present missing or non consistent values. The objective of this proposal consists of the recovery of missing values and verifies the consistency and integrity of the provided, in order to increase the information to support decisions. To address this, a predictive-collaborative model has been designed. It is composed of different predictive models generated by means of a training set and classifier selection algorithm. The combined suggestions of these predictive models are offered to support decisions. As case of study, the psychiatric emergency department at the Doce de Octubre Hospital in Madrid has been considered, where the response time is critical and the data are acquired in a stress situation which affects the quality of data significantly.

J	Glorio, O; Mazon, JN; Garrigos, I; Trujillo, J				Glorio, Octavio; Mazon, Jose-Norberto; Garrigos, Irene; Trujillo, Juan			A personalization process for spatial data warehouse development	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatial data warehouse; Geographic information; Personalization		Spatial data warehouses (SDW) rely on extended multidimensional (MD) models in order to provide decision makers with appropriate structures to intuitively explore spatial data by using different analysis techniques such as OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) or data mining. Current development approaches are focused on defining a unique and static Spatial multidimensional (SMD) schema at the conceptual level over which all decision makers fulfill their current spatial information needs. However, considering the required spatiality for each decision maker is likely to derive in a potentially misleading SMD schema (even if a departmental DW or data mart is being defined). Furthermore, spatial needs of each decision maker could change over time or depending on the context, thus requiring the SMD schema to be continuously updated with changes that can hamper decision making. Therefore, if a unique and static SMD schema is designed, acquiring the required spatial information is more costly than expected for decision makers and they may get frustrated during the analysis. To overcome these drawbacks, we argue for considering spatiality as a personalization feature within a formal design process. In this way, each decision maker will be able to access its own personalized SMD schema with its required spatial structures and instances, suitable to be properly analyzed at a glance. Our approach considers several novel artifacts: (i) a UML profile for spatial multidimensional modeling at the conceptual level, (ii) a spatial-aware user model in order to define decision maker profile; and (iii) a spatial personalization language to define spatial needs of decision makers as personalization rules. The definition of personalized SMD schemas by using these artifacts is formally defined using the Software Process Engineering Metamodel Specification (SPEM) standard. Finally, the applicability of our approach is shown through a running example based on our Eclipse-based tool for SDW development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This line of research is highly contingent upon reliable stock ranking for successful portfolio construction. Recent advances in machine learning and data mining are leading to significant opportunities to solve these problems more effectively. In this study, we aim at developing a methodology for effective stock selection using fuzzy models as well as genetic algorithms (GA). We first devise a stock scoring mechanism using fundamental variables and apply fuzzy membership functions to re-scale the scores properly. The scores are then used to obtain the relative rankings of stocks and top-ranked stocks can be selected to form a portfolio. On top of the stock scoring model, we employ GA for optimization of model parameters and feature selection for input variables simultaneously. We will show that the investment returns provided by our proposed methodology significantly outperform the benchmark. Based upon the promising results obtained, we expect that this hybrid fuzzy-CA methodology can advance the research in soft computing for finance and provide an effective solution to stock selection in practice.

The underlying ensemble-information matrix presents only cluster-data point relations, with many entries being left unknown. The paper presents an analysis that suggests this problem degrades the quality of the clustering result, and it presents a new link-based approach, which improves the conventional matrix by discovering unknown entries through similarity between clusters in an ensemble. In particular, an efficient link-based algorithm is proposed for the underlying similarity assessment. Afterward, to obtain the final clustering result, a graph partitioning technique is applied to a weighted bipartite graph that is formulated from the refined matrix. Experimental results on multiple real data sets suggest that the proposed link-based method almost always outperforms both conventional clustering algorithms for categorical data and well-known cluster ensemble techniques.

J	Khalid, S; Razzaq, S				Khalid, Shehzad; Razzaq, Shahid			Frameworks for multivariate m-mediods based modeling and classification in Euclidean and general feature spaces	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Multivariate m-mediods; Classification; Anomaly detection; Data mining; Dynamic modeling	MOTION PATTERNS; NETWORK	This paper presents an extension of m-mediods based modeling technique to cater for multimodal distributions of sample within a pattern. The classification of new samples and anomaly detection is performed using a novel classification algorithm which can handle patterns with underlying multivariate probability distributions. We have proposed two frameworks, namely MMC-ES and MMC-GFS, to enable our proposed multivarite m-mediods based modeling and classification approach workable for any feature space with a computable distance metric. MMC-ES framework is specialized for finite dimensional features in Euclidean space whereas MMC-GFS works on any feature space with a computable distance metric. Experimental results using simulated and complex real life dataset show that multivariate m-mediods based frameworks are effective and give superior performance than competitive modeling and classification techniques especially when the patterns exhibit multivariate probability density functions.

Methods and materials: CT is widely considered an effective tool for evaluating patients with minor head trauma who have potentially suffered serious intracranial injury. However, its use poses possible harmful effects, particularly for children, due to exposure to radiation. Safety concerns, along with issues of cost and practice variability, have led to calls for the development of effective methods to decide when CT imaging is needed. Clinical decision rules represent such methods and are normally derived from the analysis of large prospectively collected patient data sets. The CATCH rule was created by a group of Canadian pediatric emergency physicians to support the decision of referring children with minor head injury to CT imaging. The goal of the CATCH rule was to maximize the sensitivity of predictions of potential intracranial lesion while keeping specificity at a reasonable level. After extensive analysis of the CATCH data set, characterized by severe class imbalance, and after a thorough evaluation of several data mining methods, we derived an ensemble of multiple Naive Bayes classifiers as the prediction model for CT imaging decisions. Results: In the first phase of the experiment we compared the proposed ensemble model to other ensemble models employing rule-, tree- and instance-based member classifiers. Our prediction model demonstrated the best performance in terms of AUC, G-mean and sensitivity measures. In the second phase, using a bootstrapping experiment similar to that reported by the CATCH investigators, we showed that the proposed ensemble model achieved a more balanced predictive performance than the CATCH rule with an average sensitivity of 82.8% and an average specificity of 74.4% (vs. 98.1% and 50.0% for the CATCH rule respectively). Conclusion: Automatically derived prediction models cannot replace a physician's acumen. However, they help establish reference performance indicators for the purpose of developing clinical decision rules so the trade-off between prediction sensitivity and specificity is better understood.

J	Lin, SF; Chang, JW; Hsu, YC				Lin, Sheng-Fuu; Chang, Jyun-Wei; Hsu, Yung-Chi			A self-organization mining based hybrid evolution learning for TSK-type fuzzy model design	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Fuzzy model; Group-based symbiotic evolution; Data mining; Identification; FP-Growth	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTION; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; CONTROLLER-DESIGN; NEURAL-NETWORK; HVAC SYSTEMS	In this paper, a self-organization mining based hybrid evolution (SOME) learning algorithm for designing a TSK-type fuzzy model (TFM) is proposed. In the proposed SOME, group-based symbiotic evolution (GSE) is adopted in which each group in the GSE represents a collection of only one fuzzy rule. The proposed SOME consists of structure learning and parameter learning. In structure learning, the proposed SOME uses a two-step self-organization algorithm to decide the suitable number of rules in a TFM. In parameter learning, the proposed SOME uses the data mining based selection strategy and data mining based crossover strategy to decide groups and parental groups by the data mining algorithm that called frequent pattern growth. Illustrative examples were conducted to verify the performance and applicability of the proposed SOME method.

In addition to the targeted retrieval as is performed by search engines, browsing and explorative navigation is an important issue. Since the collections grow fast and authors most often do not annotate their web pages according to a given ontology, automatic structuring is in demand as a prerequisite for any pleasant human-computer interface. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding alternative high-quality structures for navigation in a large collection of high-dimensional data. We express desired properties of frequent termset clustering (FTS) in terms of objective functions. In general, these functions are conflicting. This leads to the formulation of FTS clustering as a multi-objective optimization problem. The optimization is solved by a genetic algorithm. The result is a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Users may choose their favorite type of a structure for their navigation through a collection or explore the different views given by the different optimal solutions. We explore the capability of the new approach to produce structures that are well suited for browsing on a social bookmarking data set.

J	Phua, C; Smith-Miles, K; Lee, VCS; Gayler, R				Phua, Clifton; Smith-Miles, Kate; Lee, Vincent Cheng-Siong; Gayler, Ross			Resilient Identity Crime Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining-based fraud detection; security; data stream mining; anomaly detection		Identity crime is well known, prevalent, and costly; and credit application fraud is a specific case of identity crime. The existing nondata mining detection system of business rules and scorecards, and known fraud matching have limitations. To address these limitations and combat identity crime in real time, this paper proposes a new multilayered detection system complemented with two additional layers: communal detection (CD) and spike detection (SD). CD finds real social relationships to reduce the suspicion score, and is tamper resistant to synthetic social relationships. It is the whitelist-oriented approach on a fixed set of attributes. SD finds spikes in duplicates to increase the suspicion score, and is probe-resistant for attributes. It is the attribute-oriented approach on a variable-size set of attributes. Together, CD and SD can detect more types of attacks, better account for changing legal behavior, and remove the redundant attributes. Experiments were carried out on CD and SD with several million real credit applications. Results on the data support the hypothesis that successful credit application fraud patterns are sudden and exhibit sharp spikes in duplicates. Although this research is specific to credit application fraud detection, the concept of resilience, together with adaptivity and quality data discussed in the paper, are general to the design, implementation, and evaluation of all detection systems.

Empirical findings on team size and productivity in software development	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Team size; Productivity; Effort estimation datasets; ISBSG repository	COST ESTIMATION; EFFORT PREDICTION; PROJECT; REGRESSION; SIMULATION; SCHEDULE; STATE; MODEL	The size of software project teams has been considered to be a driver of project productivity. Although there is a large literature on this, new publicly available software repositories allow us to empirically perform further research. In this paper we analyse the relationships between productivity, team size and other project variables using the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) repository. To do so, we apply statistical approaches to a preprocessed subset of the ISBSG repository to facilitate the study. The results show some expected correlations between productivity, effort and time as well as corroborating some other beliefs concerning team size and productivity. In addition, this study concludes that in order to apply statistical or data mining techniques to these type of repositories extensive preprocessing of the data needs to be performed due to ambiguities, wrongly recorded values, missing values, unbalanced datasets, etc. Such preprocessing is a difficult and error prone activity that would need further guidance and information that is not always provided in the repository.

Fires in the natural environment are phenomena that extensively increase the level of greenhouse emissions and disturb the normal functioning of natural ecosystems. Therefore, estimating the risk of fire outbreaks and fire prevention are the first steps in reducing the damage caused by fire. In this study, we build predictive models to estimate the risk of fire outbreaks in Slovenia, using data from a GIS, Remote Sensing imagery and the weather prediction model ALADIN. The study is carried out on three datasets, from three regions: one for the Kras region, one for the coastal region and one for continental Slovenia. On these datasets, we apply both classical statistical approaches and state-of-the-art data mining algorithms, such as ensembles of decision trees, in order to obtain predictive models of fire outbreaks. In addition, we explore the influence of fire fuel information on the performance of the models, measured in terms of accuracy, Kappa statistic, precision and recall. Best results in terms of predictive accuracy are obtained by ensembles of decision trees.

J	Tu, YN; Seng, JL				Tu, Yi-Ning; Seng, Jia-Lang			Indices of novelty for emerging topic detection	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Topic detection and tracking; Text mining; Information retrieval; Novelty index; Published volume index; Aging theory	SCIENCE-AND-TECHNOLOGY; CITATION NETWORKS; DISCOVERY LRD; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; TRACKING; INFRASTRUCTURE; INTELLIGENCE; EXTRACTION; CHINESE	Emerging topic detection is a vital research area for researchers and scholars interested in searching for and tracking new research trends and topics. The current methods of text mining and data mining used for this purpose focus only on the frequency of which subjects are mentioned, and ignore the novelty of the subject which is also critical, but beyond the scope of a frequency study. This work tackles this inadequacy to propose a new set of indices for emerging topic detection. They are the novelty index (NI) and the published volume index (PVI). This new set of indices is created based on time, volume, frequency and represents a resolution to provide a more precise set of prediction indices. They are then utilized to determine the detection point (DP) of new emerging topics. Following the detection point, the intersection decides the worth of a new topic. The algorithms presented in this paper can be used to decide the novelty and life span of an emerging topic in a specific field. The entire comprehensive collection of the ACM Digital Library is examined in the experiments. The application of the NI and PVI gives a promising indication of emerging topics in conferences and journals. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, YF; Gao, QX; Gao, LX; Wang, CR				Zhang, Yanfeng; Gao, Qixin; Gao, Lixin; Wang, Cuirong			iMapReduce: A Distributed Computing Framework for Iterative Computation	JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING			English	Article						Iterative computation; iMapReduce; Distributed computing framework; Hadoop	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; LINK-PREDICTION	Iterative computation is pervasive in many applications such as data mining, web ranking, graph analysis, online social network analysis, and so on. These iterative applications typically involve massive data sets containing millions or billions of data records. This poses demand of distributed computing frameworks for processing massive data sets on a cluster of machines. MapReduce is an example of such a framework. However, MapReduce lacks built-in support for iterative process that requires to parse data sets iteratively. Besides specifying MapReduce jobs, users have to write a driver program that submits a series of jobs and performs convergence testing at the client. This paper presents iMapReduce, a distributed framework that supports iterative processing. iMapReduce allows users to specify the iterative computation with the separated map and reduce functions, and provides the support of automatic iterative processing within a single job. More importantly, iMapReduce significantly improves the performance of iterative implementations by (1) reducing the overhead of creating new MapReduce jobs repeatedly, (2) eliminating the shuffling of static data, and (3) allowing asynchronous execution of map tasks. We implement an iMapReduce prototype based on Apache Hadoop, and show that iMapReduce can achieve up to 5 times speedup over Hadoop for implementing iterative algorithms.

With respect to the operation optimization problem for coke oven gas, a two-phase data-driven based forecasting and optimized adjusting method is proposed, where a Gaussian process-based echo states network is established to predict the gas real-time flow and the gasholder level in the prediction phase. Then, using the predicted gas flow and gasholder level, we develop a certain heuristic to quantify the user's optimal gas adjustment. The proposed operation measure has been verified to be effective by experimenting with the real-world on-line energy data sets coming from Shanghai Baosteel Corporation, Ltd., China. At present, the scheduling software developed with the proposed model and ensuing algorithms have been applied to the production practice of Baosteel. The application effects indicate that the software system can largely improve the real-time prediction accuracy of the gas units and provide with the optimized gas balance direction for the energy optimization.

J	Zhu, Q; Keogh, E				Zhu, Qiang; Keogh, Eamonn			Mining historical manuscripts with local color patches	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Historical manuscripts; Color indexing	HIGH-LEVEL SEMANTICS; IMAGE RETRIEVAL; FEATURES	Initiatives such as the Google Print Library Project and the Million Book Project have already archived more than twelve million books in digital format, and within the next decade, the majority of world's books will be online. Although most of the data will naturally be text, there will also be tens of millions of pages of images, many in color. While there is an active research community pursuing data mining of text from historical manuscripts, there has been very little work that exploits the rich color information which is often present. In this work, we introduce a simple color measure which both addresses and exploits typical features of historical manuscripts. To enable the efficient mining of massive archives, we propose a tight lower bound to the measure. Beyond the fast similarity search, we show how this lower bound allows us to build several higher-level data mining tools, including motif discovery and link analyses. We demonstrate our ideas in several data mining tasks on manuscripts dating back to the fifteenth century.

J	Koenigstein, N; Shavitt, Y				Koenigstein, N.; Shavitt, Y.			Talent scouting in P2P networks	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Spatial data mining; P2P networks; Information retrieval	SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; TIES	Record labels would like to identify potential artists as early as possible in their career, before other companies approach the artists with competing contracts. However, there is a huge number of new artists, and the process of identifying the ones with high success potential is labor intensive. This paper demonstrates how data mining in P2P networks can be used together with social marketing theories in order to mechanize most of this detection process. Using a unique intercepting system over the Gnutella network we captured an unprecedented amount of geographically identified queries, allowing us to investigate the diffusion of music related content in time and space. Our solution is based on the observation that successful artists, start by growing a discernible stronghold of fans in their hometown area, where they are able to perform and market their music. Only then they manage to breakthrough to national fame. In a file sharing network, their initial local success is reflected as a delta function spatial distribution of content queries. Using this observation, we devised a detection algorithm for emerging artists that suggests a short list of artists with breakthrough potential, from which we showed that about 30% translate the potential to national success.

J	Kwak, DS; Kim, KJ				Kwak, Doh-Soon; Kim, Kwang-Jae			A data mining approach considering missing values for the optimization of semiconductor-manufacturing processes	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining approach; Missing values; Patient Rule Induction Method; Process optimization	RULE INDUCTION METHOD; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION	Due to the rapid development of information technologies, abundant data have become readily available. Data mining techniques have been used for process optimization in many manufacturing processes in automotive, LCD, semiconductor, and steel production, among others. However, a large amount of missing values occurs in the data set due to several causes (e.g., data discarded by gross measurement errors, measurement machine breakdown, routine maintenance, sampling inspection, and sensor failure), which frequently complicate the application of data mining to the data set. This study proposes a new procedure for optimizing processes called missing values-Patient Rule Induction Method (m-PRIM), which handles the missing-values problem systematically and yields considerable process improvement, even if a significant portion of the data set has missing values. A case study in a semiconductor manufacturing process is conducted to illustrate the proposed procedure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data mining for grammatical inference with bioinformatics criteria	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Grammatical inference; Bioinformatic; Free Context Grammar; DNA; Sequential patterns	TOOL	In this work a novel data mining process is described that combines hybrid techniques of association analysis and classical sequentiation algorithms of genomics, to generate grammatical structures of a specific language. Subsequently, these structures are converted to Context-Free Grammars. Initially the method applies to context-free languages with the possibility of being applied to other languages: structured programming, the language of the book of life expressed in the genome and proteome and even the natural languages. We used an application of a compilers generator system that allows the development of a practical application within the area of grammarware, where the concepts of the language analysis are applied to other disciplines, like bioinformatic. The tool allows measuring the complexity of the obtained grammar automatically from textual data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The problem is extensively studied in the context of relational databases to hide frequent itemsets and association rules. Recently, sequential pattern hiding from sequential (both sequence and spatio-temporal) databases has been investigated [1]. With the ever increasing versatile application demands, new forms of knowledge and databases should be addressed as well. In this work, we address the knowledge hiding problem in the context of tree and graph databases. For these databases efficient frequent pattern mining algorithms have already been developed in the literature. Since, some of the discovered patterns may be attributed as sensitive, we develop appropriate sanitization techniques to protect the privacy of the sensitive patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Grossi, V; Turini, F				Grossi, Valerio; Turini, Franco			Stream mining: a novel architecture for ensemble-based classification	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Mining data streams; Classification; Concept drifting; Ensemble classifier; Data aggregation	CONCEPT DRIFT; CLASSIFIERS; CONTEXTS	Mining data streams has become an important and challenging task for a wide range of applications. In these scenarios, data tend to arrive in multiple, rapid and time-varying streams, thus constraining data mining algorithms to look at data only once. Maintaining an accurate model, e.g. a classifier, while the stream goes by requires a smart way of keeping track of the data already passed away. Such a synthetic structure has to serve two purposes: distilling the most of information out of past data and allowing a fast reaction to concept drifting, i.e. to the change of the data trend that necessarily affects the model. The paper outlines novel data structures and algorithms to tackle the above problem, when the model mined out of the data is a classifier. The introduced model and the overall ensemble architecture are presented in details, even considering how the approach can be extended for treating numerical attributes. A large part of the paper discusses the experiments and the comparisons with several existing systems. The comparisons show that the performance of our system in general, and in particular with respect to the reaction to concept drifting, is at the top level.

A density-based spatial clustering for physical constraints	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Constraint-based clustering; Density-based clustering; Obstacle; Facilitator	OBSTACLES	We propose a spatial clustering method, called DBRS+, which aims to cluster spatial data in the presence of both obstacles and facilitators. It can handle datasets with intersected obstacles and facilitators. Without preprocessing, DBRS+ processes constraints during clustering. It can find clusters with arbitrary shapes. DBRS+ has been empirically evaluated using synthetic and real data sets and its performance has been compared to DBRS and three related methods for handling obstacles, namely AUTOCLUST+, DBCLuC*, and DBRS_O.

In this regard, trust is a crucial basis for social interactions among users in online environment specifically social web applications in which user participation is the primary driver of value. Predicting unknown trust relationship between users is a problem addressed in this paper, using data mining and classification approach. Achieving this, we provide a framework of social trust-inducing factors that contribute in trust formation process and then we investigate the role of these factors in predicting trust between users by the results of experimental study on real data from Epinions. The experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed framework is quite feasible and promising in predicting trust connectivity with a high degree of accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Finite mixture models are broadly applicable to clustering problems. But, they involve the challenging problem of the selection of the number of clusters which requires a certain trade-off. The number of clusters must be sufficient to provide the discriminating capability between clusters required for a given application. Indeed, if too many clusters are employed overfitting problems may occur and if few are used we have a problem of underfitting. Here we approach the problem of modeling and clustering proportional data using infinite mixtures which have been shown to be an efficient alternative to finite mixtures by overcoming the concern regarding the selection of the optimal number of mixture components. In particular, we propose and discuss the consideration of infinite Liouville mixture model whose parameter values are fitted to the data through a principled Bayesian algorithm that we have developed and which allows uncertainty in the number of mixture components. Our experimental evaluation involves two challenging applications namely text classification and texture discrimination, and suggests that the proposed approach can be an excellent choice for proportional data modeling.

In bioinformatics, where datasets are categorised as having complex features, the need for pre-processing is unavoidable. In this paper, we propose a framework for selecting the discriminatory features from protein sequences prior to classification by integrating the filter and wrapper approaches. Several state-of-the-art multivariate filters were explored in the first phase to remove the unwanted features that contributed to noise, while particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with support vector machine (SVM) was adopted in the wrapper phase to produce the most optimal features. Several PSO variants were investigated in the wrapper phase to compare the most suitable PSO variants for the problem domain. The results of both phases were analysed based on classification accuracy, number of selected features, modelling time and area under the curve on the main dataset and, five benchmark machine learning datasets of similar complexity. The higher classification accuracy of the proposed framework was highly reliable with an improvement over the filter phase and the use of full features despite using smaller features.

The most authoritative birds of the pigeons' flock take the lead, and followers follow the leaders' directions. Pigeon leaders' roles vary over time. Following this unprecedented discovery made by zoologists at the University of Oxford and Eotvos University, we extend in this paper the flocking model largely used in computer science. We define a new biologically inspired clustering algorithm entitled "FlockbyLeader" that detects hierarchical leaders, discovers their followers, and enables them to flock based on local proximity in an artificial virtual space to create clusters. We offer empirical evidence that the algorithm outperforms both the existing flocking algorithm and the K-means algorithm. We analyze the performance of the algorithm based on widely used datasets in the literature.

This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even pro-active efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.

A particular feature of the framework is that, after an initial cluster configuration has been generated, the agents are able to negotiate with a view to improving on this initial clustering. The framework can be used in the context of a number of clustering paradigms, two are investigated: K-means and KNN. The reported evaluation demonstrates that negotiation can serve to improve on an initial cluster configuration.

Based on changeable user movement behavior patterns (UMBPs), mobile service systems have the capability of effectively mining a special request from abundant data. In this paper, UMBPs are studied in terms of the problem of mining matching mobile access patterns based on joining the following four kinds of characteristics, U, L, T, and S, where U is the mobile user, L is the movement location, T is the dwell time in the timestamp, and S is the service request. By introducing standard graph-matching algorithms along with the primitives of a database management system, which comprises grouping, sorting, and joining, these joint operations are defined. Moreover, by mining the associated structure via maximum weight bipartite graph matching, a prediction mechanism, based on the model of UMBPs, is utilized to find strong relationships among U, L, T, and S. In addition, a PC-based experimental evaluation under various simulation conditions, using synthetically generated data, is introduced. Finally, performance studies are conducted to show that, in terms of execution efficiency and scalability, the proposed procedures produced excellent performance results.

J	Chen, YL; Wu, YY; Chang, RI				Chen, Yen-Liang; Wu, Yu-Ying; Chang, Ray-I			From data to global generalized knowledge	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Attribute-oriented induction; Data mining; Multiple-level mining; Generalized knowledge	ATTRIBUTE-ORIENTED INDUCTION; RELATIONAL DATABASES; ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM	The attribute-oriented induction (AOI) is a useful data mining method that extracts generalized knowledge from relational data and user's background knowledge. The method uses two thresholds, the relation threshold and attribute threshold, to guide the generalization process, and output generalized knowledge, a set of generalized tuples which describes the major characteristics of the target relation. Although AOI has been widely used in various applications, a potential weakness of this method is that it only provides a snapshot of the generalized knowledge, not a global picture. When thresholds are different, we would obtain different sets of generalized tuples, which also describe the major characteristics of the target relation. If a user wants to ascertain a global picture of induction, he or she must try different thresholds repeatedly. That is time-consuming and tedious. In this study, we propose a global AOI (GAOI) method, which employs the multiple-level mining technique with multiple minimum supports to generate all interesting generalized knowledge at one time. Experiment results on real-life dataset show that the proposed method is effective in finding global generalized knowledge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Software patches and upgrades to anti-viral packages are typically released only after the malware's key characteristics have been identified through infection, by which time it may be too late to protect systems. Multiple sequence analysis is widely used in bioinformatics for revealing the genetic diversity of organisms and annotating gene functions through the identification of common genetic regions. This paper adopts a new approach to the problem of malware recognition, which is to use multiple sequence alignment techniques from bioinformatics to align variable length computer viral and worm code so that core, invariant regions of the code occupy fixed positions in the alignment patterns. Data mining (ANNs, symbolic rule extraction) can then be used to learn the critical features that help to determine into which class the aligned patterns fall. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our novel approach for identifying malware code through multiple sequence alignment followed by analysis by ANNs and symbolic rule extraction methods.

J	David, G; Averbuch, A				David, Gil; Averbuch, Amir			SpectralCAT: Categorical spectral clustering of numerical and nominal data	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Spectral clustering; Diffusion Maps; Categorical data clustering; Dimensionality reduction	KERNEL K-MEANS; FEATURE SPACE; MEAN SHIFT; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Data clustering is a common technique for data analysis, which is used in many fields, including machine learning, data mining, customer segmentation, trend analysis, pattern recognition and image analysis. Although many clustering algorithms have been proposed, most of them deal with clustering of one data type (numerical or nominal) or with mix data type (numerical and nominal) and only few of them provide a generic method that clusters all types of data. It is required for most real-world applications data to handle both feature types and their mix. In this paper, we propose an automated technique, called SpectralCAT, for unsupervised clustering of high-dimensional data that contains numerical or nominal or mix of attributes. We suggest to automatically transform the high-dimensional input data into categorical values. This is done by discovering the optimal transformation according to the Calinski-Harabasz index for each feature and attribute in the dataset. Then, a method for spectral clustering via dimensionality reduction of the transformed data is applied. This is achieved by automatic non-linear transformations, which identify geometric patterns in the data, and find the connections among them while projecting them onto low-dimensional spaces. We compare our method to several clustering algorithms using 16 public datasets from different domains and types. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms in most cases these algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To improve the overall rescue process, a fast and accurate estimation of the severity of the accident represents a key point to help the emergency services to better determine the amount of required resources. This paper proposes a novel intelligent system which is able to automatically estimate the severity of traffic accidents based on the concept of data mining and knowledge inference. Our system considers the most relevant variables that can characterize the severity of the accidents (variables such as the vehicle speed, the type of vehicles involved, and the airbag status). Results show that data mining classification algorithms, combined with an adequate selection of relevant features and a prior division of collisions based on the impact direction, allows generating estimation models able to predict the severity of new accidents.

Although a recent approach has been able to find frequent episodes from complex sequences, the discovered sets are neither condensed nor accurate. This paper investigates the discovery of condensed sets of frequent episodes from complex sequences. We adopt a novel anti-monotonic frequency measure based on non-redundant occurrences, and define a condensed set, nDaCF (the set of non-derivable approximately closed frequent episodes) within a given maximal error bound of support. We then introduce a series of effective pruning strategies, and develop a method, nDaCF-Miner, for discovering nDaCF sets. Experimental results show that, when the error bound is somewhat high, the discovered nDaCF sets are two orders of magnitude smaller than complete sets, and nDaCF-miner is more efficient than previous mining approaches. In addition, the nDaCF sets are more accurate than the sets found by previous approaches.

Given a textual change request (e. g., a bug report), a single snapshot (release) of source code, indexed using Latent Semantic Indexing, is used to estimate the impact set. Should additional contextual information be available, the approach configures the best-fit combination to produce an improved impact set. Contextual information includes the execution trace and an initial source code entity verified for change. Combinations of information retrieval, dynamic analysis, and data mining of past source code commits are considered. The research hypothesis is that these combinations help counter the precision or recall deficit of individual techniques and improve the overall accuracy. The tandem operation of the three techniques sets it apart from other related solutions. Automation along with the effective utilization of two key sources of developer knowledge, which are often overlooked in impact analysis at the change request level, is achieved. To validate our approach, we conducted an empirical evaluation on four open source software systems. A benchmark consisting of a number of maintenance issues, such as feature requests and bug fixes, and their associated source code changes was established by manual examination of these systems and their change history. Our results indicate that there are combinations formed from the augmented developer contextual information that show statistically significant improvement over stand-alone approaches.

The input value of AOI contains a relational data table and attribute-related concept hierarchies. The output is a general feature inducted by the related data. Though it is useful in searching for general feature with traditional AOI method, it only can mine the feature from the single-value attribute data. If the data is of multiple-value attribute, the traditional AOI method is not able to find general knowledge from the data. In addition, the AOI algorithm is based on the way of induction to establish the concept hierarchies. Different principles of classification or different category values produce different concept trees, therefore, affecting the inductive conclusion. Based on the issue, this paper proposes a modified AOI algorithm combined with a simplified Boolean bit Karnaugh map. It does not need to establish the concept tree. It can handle data of multi value and find out the general features implied within the attributes.

Yet, to date, these analyses have been hampered by limitations of human coding of large data sets, and by bias due to human interpretation. In this paper, we compare and combine two quantitative analysis techniques to demonstrate the capabilities of computational analysis for content analysis of unstructured text. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate how two quantitative analytic methods, viz., Latent Semantic Analysis and data mining, can aid researchers in revealing core content topic areas in large (or small) data sets, and in visualizing how these concepts evolve, migrate, converge or diverge over time. We exemplify the complementary application of these techniques through an examination of a 25-year sample of abstracts from selected journals in Information Systems, Management, and Accounting disciplines. Through this work, we explore the capabilities of two computational techniques, and show how these techniques can be used to gather insights from a large corpus of unstructured text.

J	Jiang, LX; Zhang, H; Cai, ZH; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Zhang, Harry; Cai, Zhihua; Wang, Dianhong			Weighted average of one-dependence estimators	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						naive Bayes; averaged one-dependence estimators; attribute weighting; classification; data mining	ROC CURVE; AREA	Naive Bayes (NB) is a probability-based classification model which is based on the attribute independence assumption. However, in many real-world data mining applications, its attribute independence assumption is often violated. Responding to this fact, researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve the classification accuracy of NB by weakening its attribute independence assumption. For a recent example, averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is proposed, which weakens its attribute independence assumption by averaging all models from a restricted class of one-dependence classifiers. However, all one-dependence classifiers in AODE have same weights and are treated equally. According to our observation, different one-dependence classifiers should have different weights. Therefore, in this article, we proposed an improved model called weighted average of one-dependence estimators (WAODE) by assigning different weights to these one-dependence classifiers. In our WAODE, four different weighting approaches are designed and thus four different versions are created. For simplicity, we respectively denote them by WAODE-MI, WAODE-ACC, WAODE-CLL and WAODE-AUC. The experimental results on a large number of UCI datasets published on the main website of Weka platform show that our WAODE significantly outperform AODE.

We studied various classification, Association and clustering algorithms like CART, Simple Logistic, BayesNet, Random forest, j48, LMT, Nave Bayesian, Apriori and simpleKMeans over different E.coli promoter dataset. Random forest method using training dataset outperforms the remaining classification methods. The Association model (Apriori) predicted the presence of Adenine (A) at -45, -10 and -11 regions, Thiamine (T) at -35, -36 regions, Guanine (G) at -34 region. Cytosine (C) is not present in the submitted DNA data for E.coli promoter dataset at -14 to -9 and -36 to -31 regions using association model. Cluster based model using simpleKMeans predicted promoter regions true at -35 and -10 regions. If -36 to -31 region of the sequence contain TTGACA and -14 to -9 region contains TATAAT, there can be highest probability of finding promoter in E.coli. The condition becomes false, if the -36 to -31 region contains ACGACG and -14 to -9 contain TGAATG.	[Kaladhar, D. S. V. G. K.; Devi, T. Uma; Reddy, R. Harikrishna; Ayayangar, R. K. SriTeja; Rao, P.

J	Kato, K; Hosino, T				Kato, Kimikazu; Hosino, Tikara			Multi-GPU algorithm for k-nearest neighbor problem	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						GPGPU; data mining		The recommendation system is a mechanism which automatically recommends items that are likely to be of interest to the user. In the recommendation system, customers' preferences are encoded into vectors, and finding the nearest vectors to each vector is an essential part. This vector-searching part of the problem is called a k-nearest neighbor problem. We give an effective algorithm to solve this problem on multiple graphics processor units (GPUs). Our algorithm consists of two parts: the N-body problem and the partial sort. For an algorithm of the N-body problem, we applied the idea of a known algorithm, although another trick is needed to overcome the problem of small-sized shared memory. For the partial sort, we give a novel GPU algorithm which is effective for small k. In our partial sort algorithm, a heap is accessed in parallel by threads with a low cost of synchronization. We show through an experiment that when the size of the problem is large, an implementation of the algorithm on two GPUs runs more than 330 times faster than a single core implementation on a latest CPU.

A Projection-Based Approach for Discovering High Average-Utility Itemsets	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; association rule mining; utility mining; average utility; indexing mechanism	DATABASES	Utility mining has recently been an important issue due to its wide applications. An itemset in traditional utility mining considers individual profits and quantities of items in transactions regardless of its length. The average-utility measure, which is the total utility of an itemset divided by its number of items within it, was then proposed to reveal a better utility effect than the original utility measure. A mining algorithm was also proposed to find high average-utility itemsets from a transaction database. However, the previous mining approach was based on the principle of level-wise processing to find high average-utility itemsets from a database. In this paper, we thus propose an efficient average-utility mining approach which adopts a projection technique and an indexing mechanism to speed up the execution and reduce the memory requirement in the mining process. The proposed approach can project relevant sub-databases for mining, thus avoiding some unnecessary checking. In addition, a pruning strategy is also designed to reduce the number of unpromising itemsets in mining. Finally, the experimental results on synthetic datasets and two real datasets show the superior performance of the proposed approach.

J	Li, JH; Mei, CL; Lv, YJ				Li, Jinhai; Mei, Changlin; Lv, Yuejin			Knowledge reduction in formal decision contexts based on an order-preserving mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						formal concept analysis; formal context; formal decision context; concept lattice; knowledge reduction; order-preserving mapping	CONCEPT LATTICES; ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; RETRIEVAL; DISCOVERY	Knowledge reduction is one of the basic issues in knowledge presentation and data mining. In this study, an order-preserving mapping between the set of all the extensions of the conditional concept lattice and that of the decision concept lattice is defined to classify formal decision contexts into consistent and inconsistent categories. Then, methods of knowledge reduction for both the consistent and the inconsistent formal decision contexts are formulated by constructing proper discernibility matrices and their associated Boolean functions. For the consistent formal decision contexts, the proposed reduction method can avoid redundancy subject to maintaining consistency, while for the inconsistent formal decision contexts, the reduction method can make the set of all the compact non-redundant decision rules complete in the initial formal decision context.

This paper is concentrated on clustering uncertain objects with location uncertainty. Uncertain locations are described by probability density function (PDF). Number of uncertain objects can be very large and obtaining quality result within reasonable time is a challenging task. Basic clustering method is UK-means, in which all expected distances (ED) from objects to clusters are calculated. Thus UK-means is inefficient. To avoid ED calculations various pruning methods are proposed. The pruning methods are significantly more effective than UK-means method. In this paper, Improved Bisector pruning method is proposed as an improvement of clustering process.

J	Meged, A; Gelbard, R				Meged, Avichai; Gelbard, Roy			A Unified Fuzzy Data Model: Representation and Processing	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Binary Databases; Clustering; Data Mining; Data Representation Models; Fuzzy Data; Fuzzy Databases	OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASES; UNCERTAIN DATA; RELATIONAL DATABASES; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; DESIGN METHODOLOGY; CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS; EFFICIENT; VAGUE	A novel fuzzy data representation model which enables data mining with standard tools is introduced. Many data elements in the world are fuzzy in nature. There is an obvious need to represent and process such data effectively and efficiently, using the same standard tools for crisp data that are popular with researchers and practitioners alike. Currently, however, standard tools cannot process or analyze data that are not adequately represented. The comprehensive data representation model put forward here extends principles of binary databases and provides a unified approach to all types of data: discrete and continuous, crisp and fuzzy. The model is illustrated on a baseline dataset and tested in clustering experiments matched against controlled groupings and a real dataset. The tests confirm that the implementation of the model not only enables the use of standard tools but also yields better results as regards segmentation and clustering of fuzzy datasets.

We predict that such software development analytics will become commonplace, in the near future. For example, as large software systems migrate to the cloud, they are divided and sold as dozens of smaller apps; when shopping inside the cloud, users are free to mix and match their apps from multiple vendors (e. g. Google Docs' word processor with Zoho's slide manager); to extend, or even retain, market share cloud vendors must mine their user data in order to understand what features best attract their clients. This panel will address the open issues with analytics. Issues addressed will include the following. What is the potential for software development analytics? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current generation of analytics tools? How best can we mature those tools?

Today most of the intrusion detection approaches focused on the issues of feature selection or reduction, since some of the features are irrelevant and redundant which results lengthy detection process and degrades the performance of an intrusion detection system (IDS). The purpose of this study is to identify important reduced input features in building IDS that is computationally efficient and effective. For this we investigate the performance of three standard feature selection methods using Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain and Gain Ratio. In this paper we propose method Feature Vitality Based Reduction Method, to identify important reduced input features. We apply one of the efficient classifier naive bayes on reduced datasets for intrusion detection. Empirical results show that selected reduced attributes give better performance to design IDS that is efficient and effective for network intrusion detection. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Learning a Propagable Graph for Semisupervised Learning: Classification and Regression	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; graph-based learning; feature extraction; and similarity graph	AUTOMATIC AGE ESTIMATION; MANIFOLD; DATABASE	In this paper, we present a novel framework, called learning by propagability, for two essential data mining tasks, i.e., classification and regression. The whole learning process is driven by the philosophy that the data labels and the optimal feature representation jointly constitute a harmonic system, where the data labels are invariant with respect to the propagation on the similarity graph constructed based on the optimal feature representation. Based on this philosophy, a unified framework of learning by propagability is proposed for the purposes of both classification and regression. Specifically, this framework has three characteristics: 1) the formulation unifies the label propagation and optimal feature representation pursuing, and thus the label propagation process is enhanced by benefiting from the refined similarity graph constructed with the derived optimal feature representation instead of the original representation; 2) it unifies the formulations for supervised and semisupervised learning in both classification and regression tasks; and 3) it can directly deal with the multiclass classification problems. Extensive experiments for the classification task on UCI toy data sets, handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, and microarray recognition as well as for the regression task of human age estimation on the FG-NET aging database, all validate the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework, compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts.

J	Alvarez, VP; Vazquez, JM				Pachon Alvarez, Victoria; Mata Vazquez, Jacinto			An evolutionary algorithm to discover quantitative association rules from huge databases without the need for an a priori discretization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rules; Evolutionary algorithms		Association rules are one of the most frequently used tools for finding relationships between different attributes in a database. There are various techniques for obtaining these rules, the most common of which are those which give categorical association rules. However, when we need to relate attributes which are numeric and discrete, we turn to methods which generate quantitative association rules, a far less studied method than the above. In addition, when the database is extremely large, many of these tools cannot be used. In this paper, we present an evolutionary tool for finding association rules in databases (both small and large) comprising quantitative and categorical attributes without the need for an a priori discretization of the domain of the numeric attributes. Finally, we evaluate the tool using both real and synthetic databases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A dynamic clustering algorithm for building overlapping clusters	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; overlapping clustering; graph-based algorithms	TOPIC DETECTION	Clustering is a Data Mining technique which has been widely used in many practical applications. In some of these applications like, medical diagnosis, categorization of digital libraries, topic detection and others, the objects could belong to more than one cluster. However, most of the clustering algorithms generate disjoint clusters. Moreover, processing additions, deletions and modifications of objects in the clustering built so far, without having to rebuild the clustering from the beginning is an issue that has been little studied. In this paper, we introduce DCS, a clustering algorithm which includes a new graph-cover strategy for building a set of clusters that could overlap, and a strategy for dynamically updating the clustering, managing multiple additions and/or deletions of objects. The experimental evaluation conducted over different collections demonstrates the good performance of the proposed algorithm.

However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy.

In Reynolds' classic flocking algorithm (1987), individuals move in a 2-dimensional space and emulate the behavior of a flock of birds (or "boids", as Reynolds refers to them). Each individual in the simulated flock exhibits specific behaviors that dictate how it moves and how it interacts with other boids in its "neighborhood". We are interested in using this approach as a way of visualizing large multi-dimensional data sets. In particular, we are focused on data sets in which records contain time-tagged information about people (e.g., a student in an educational data set or a patient in a medical records data set). We present a system in which individuals in the data set are represented as agents, or "data bolds". The flocking exhibited by our boids is driven not by observation and emulation of creatures in nature, but rather by features inherent in the data set.

Discovering Subgroups Using Descriptive Models of Adverse Outcomes in Medical Care	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Subgroup discovery; data mining; descriptive trees	ICU PATIENTS; PATTERNS	Objectives: Hospital discharge databases store hundreds of thousands of patients. These datasets are usually used by health insurance companies to process claims from hospitals, but they also represent a rich source of information about the patterns of medical care. The proposed subgroup discovery method aims to improve the efficiency of detecting interpretable subgroups in data. Methods: Supervised descriptive rule discovery techniques can prove inefficient in cases when target class samples represent only an extremely small amount of all available samples. Our approach aims to balance the number of samples in target and control groups prior to subgroup discovery process. Additionally, we introduce some improvements to an existing subgroup discovery algorithm enhancing the user experience and making the descriptive data mining process and visualization of rules more user friendly. Results: Instance-based subspace subgroup discovery introduced in this paper is demonstrated on hospital discharge data with focus on medical errors. In general, the number of patients with a recorded diagnosis related to a medical error is relatively small in comparison to patients where medical errors did not occur. The ability to produce comprehensible and simple models with high degree of confidence, support, and predictive power using the proposed method is demonstrated. Conclusions: This paper introduces a subspace subgroup discovery process that can be applied in all settings where a large number of samples with relatively small number of target class samples are present. The proposed method is implemented in Weka machine learning environment and is available at http://ri.fzv.uni-mb.si/ssd.

This is also called as text data mining or knowledge discovery. It can be viewed as an extension of data mining or knowledge from structured databases. At present, the stored information is increasing tremendously day by day. This is unstructured form so we can not extract the needed information. Some data mining techniques are used to extract the useful information from text documents, such as classification, clustering, visualization and information extraction. Here framework of text mining with techniques is discussed as well as benefits and limitations of text mining have been discussed.

This applies also to the area of animal breeding, in which datasets collect remarkably a large number of animal features. In this paper, we have conducted a comprehensive study of both 12 classification methods as well as 12 GA-based feature selection methods for classification of the Silesian horse data. To assess the performance of the wrappers and the classification methods over the animal dataset we used two metrics: a probability metric Area under the ROC curve (AUC), and a rank metric Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). All of the classifiers and the wrappers were taken from the Weka machine learning software. We find that most of the GA-based wrappers achieved results no worse than high-dimensional dataset. The statistical results obtained make the three classifiers: a decision tree ADT, a logistic regression Log and a bagging method Bag competitive method to be considered in the field of animal breeding data mining.

It is a bit surprising that there was very limited comprehensive study for addressing an important intersecting problem, that is, cost-sensitive online classification. In this paper, we formally study this problem, and propose a new framework for cost-sensitive online classification by exploiting the idea of online gradient descent techniques. Based on the framework, we propose a family of cost-sensitive online classification algorithms, which are designed to directly optimize two well-known cost-sensitive measures: (i) maximization of weighted sum of sensitivity and specificity, and (ii) minimization of weighted misclassification cost. We analyze the theoretical bounds of the cost-sensitive measures made by the proposed algorithms, and extensively examine their empirical performance on a variety of cost-sensitive online classification tasks.

Compared with the traditional econometric method, our model takes the advantage of the machine learning method to give a more accurate forecast of future CPI in small dataset. In addition, we add more financial indicators including M2 growth rate, growth rate of housing sales and lag CPI in our model which is more in line with economy. A monthly data of Chinese CPI and other financial indicators are adopted to construct FCI (SVRs) with different lag terms. The experiment result shows that FCI (SVRs) performs better than VAR impulse response analysis. As a result, our model based on support vector regression in construction of FCI is appropriate.

To conduct the interval-valued data mining, we conduct two investigations: (1) construct the interval-valued information system, and (2) conduct the interval-valued knowledge discovery. In constructing the interval-valued information system, we first make the paired attributes in the database discovered, and then, make them stored in the neighbour locations in a common database and regard them as 'one' new field. In conducting the interval-valued knowledge discovery, we utilise some related priori knowledge and regard the priori knowledge as the control objectives; and design an approximate closed-loop control mining system. On the implemented experimental platform (prototype), we conduct the corresponding experiments and compare the proposed algorithms with several typical algorithms, such as the Apriori algorithm, the FP-growth algorithm and the CLOSE+ algorithm. The experimental results show that the interval-valued information system method is more effective than the conventional algorithms in discovering interval-valued patterns.

J	Zhong, W; Chow, R; He, JY				Zhong, Wei; Chow, Rick; He, Jieyue			Clinical charge profiles prediction for patients diagnosed with chronic diseases using Multi-level Support Vector Machine	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Support Vector Machine; Classification problem; Multi-level clustering algorithm; Chronic disease and parallel algorithm	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	This research utilizes the national Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP-3) databases to construct Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to predict clinical charge profiles, including hospital charges and length of stay (LOS), for patients diagnosed with heart and circulatory disease, diabetes and cancer, respectively. Clinical charge profiles predictions can provides relevant clinical knowledge for healthcare policy makers to effectively manage healthcare services and costs at the national, state, and local levels. Despite its solid mathematical foundation and promising experimental results, SVM is not favorable for large-scale data mining tasks since its training time complexity is at least quadratic to the number of samples. Furthermore, traditional SVM classification algorithms cannot build an effective SVM when different data distribution patterns are intermingled in a large dataset. In order to enhance SVM training for large, complex and noisy healthcare datasets, we propose the Multi-level Support Vector Machine (MLSVM) that organizes the dataset as clusters in a tree to produce better partitions for more effective SVM classification. The MLSVM model utilizes multiple SVMs, each of which learns the local data distribution patterns in a cluster efficiently. A decision fusion algorithm is used to generate an effective global decision that incorporates local SVM decisions at different levels of the tree. Consequently, MLSVM can handle complex and often conflicting data distributions in large datasets more effectively than the single-SVM based approaches and the multiple SVM systems. Both the combined 5 x 2-fold cross validation F test and the independent test show that classification performance of MLSVM is much superior to that of a CVM, ACSVM and CSVM based on three popular performance evaluation metrics. In this work. CSVM and MLSVM are parallelized to speed up the slow SVM training process for very large and complex datasets. Running time analysis shows that MLSVM can accelerate SVM's training process noticeably when the parallel algorithm is employed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impact of noise is seldom considered in previous works while real-world data often contain much noise. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of noise on imputation methods and propose a new imputation approach by introducing the mechanism of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to deal with incomplete data with noise. The performance of four commonly used imputation methods is compared with ours, called RIBG (robust imputation based on GMDH), on nine benchmark datasets. The experimental result demonstrates that noise has a great impact on the effectiveness of imputation techniques and our method RIBG is more robust to noise than the other four imputation methods used as benchmark.

While being an integral part of transaction data, pricing and time information have not been integrated into market basket analysis in earlier studies. This paper proposes a new approach to mine price, time and domain related attributes through re-mining of association mining results. The underlying factors behind positive and negative relationships can be characterized and described through this second data mining stage. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated through the analysis of data coming from a large apparel retail chain, and its algorithmic complexity is analyzed in comparison to the existing techniques.

No research on full ceramic bearing fault diagnostics using acoustic emission (AE) sensors has been reported. Unlike their steel counterparts, signal processing methods to extract effective AE fault characteristic features and fault diagnostic systems for full ceramic bearings have not been developed. In this paper, a data mining based full ceramic bearing diagnostic system using AE based condition indicators (CIs) is presented. The system utilizes a new signal processing method based on Hilbert Huang transform to extract AE fault features for the computation of CIs. These CIs are used to build a data mining based fault classifier using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Seeded fault tests on full ceramic bearing outer race, inner race, balls, and cage are conducted on a bearing diagnostic test rig and AE burst data are collected. The effectiveness of the developed fault diagnostic system is validated using real full ceramic bearing seeded fault test data.

The many advantages of CBR include rapid learning, the ability to use numerous unrestricted domains, minimal knowledge requirements, and effective presentation of knowledge. However, a major difficulty when applying CBR algorithms is selection of appropriate parameter values, features and weight assignment of features, to avoid constructing poor models. Unfortunately, key CBR parameters, beneficial features and the weight assignment of features vary across different problems. This study developed an efficient CBR approach based on artificial immune system algorithm (AISCBR) to increase classification accuracy by improving parameter tuning, feature selection and weight assignment of features. The proposed approach was then compared with those of other studies using the same University of California, Irvine (UCI) data sets. The experimental results showed that the AISCBR can provide better performance than other existing methods, because higher classification accurate rates can be obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

J	Orriols-Puig, A; Casillas, J				Orriols-Puig, Albert; Casillas, Jorge			Fuzzy knowledge representation study for incremental learning in data streams and classification problems	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy rule-based representation; Genetic algorithms; Learning classifier systems; Genetic fuzzy systems; Data streams; Concept drift	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; RULE-BASED SYSTEMS; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; INTERPRETABILITY; CLASSIFIERS; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION; REDUCTION	The extraction of models from data streams has become a hot topic in data mining due to the proliferation of problems in which data are made available online. This has led to the design of several systems that create data models online. A novel approach to online learning of data streams can be found in Fuzzy-UCS, a young Michigan-style fuzzy-classifier system that has recently demonstrated to be highly competitive in extracting classification models from complex domains. Despite the promising results reported for Fuzzy-UCS, there still remain some hot issues that need to be analyzed in detail. This paper carefully studies two key aspects in Fuzzy-UCS: the ability of the system to learn models from data streams where concepts change over time and the behavior of different fuzzy representations. Four fuzzy representations that move through the dimensions of flexibility and interpretability are included in the system. The behavior of the different representations on a problem with concept changes is studied and compared to other machine learning techniques prepared to deal with these types of problems. Thereafter, the comparison is extended to a large collection of real-world problems, and a close examination of which problem characteristics benefit or affect the different representations is conducted. The overall results show that Fuzzy-UCS can effectively deal with problems with concept changes and lead to different interesting conclusions on the particular behavior of each representation.

J	Shahzad, W; Baig, AR				Shahzad, Waseem; Baig, Abdul Rauf			HYBRID ASSOCIATIVE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM USING ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Classification; Association rules mining; Ant colony optimization; Associative classification	INDUCTION	Classification rule discovery and association rules mining are two important data mining tasks. Association rules mining discovers all those rules from the training set that satisfies minimum support and confidence threshold while classification rule mining discovers a set of rules for predicting the class of unseen data. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid classification algorithm called ACO-AC, combining the idea of association rules mining and supervised classification using ant colony optimization. It is a class based association rules mining. The proposed technique integrates the classification with the association rule mining to discover high quality rules for improving the performance of classifier. Ant colony optimization is used to mine only the more appropriate subset of class association rules instead of exhaustively searching for all possible rules. First, strong association rules are discovered based on confidence and support and then, these rules are used to classify the unseen data. In proposed approach, we can mine association rules of each class parallel in distributed manner. We compared the proposed approach with eight other state of the art classification algorithms on twenty six data sets. Experiments results show that the hybrid classifier is more accurate and achieves higher accuracy rates when compared with other classification techniques.

J	Chang, TS				Chang, Tsung-Sheng			A comparative study of artificial neural networks, and decision trees for digital game content stocks price prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Artificial neural networks (ANN); C&RT; Decision tree; Stock price forecasting	MARKET; MODEL; RETURNS	Precise prediction of stock prices is difficult chiefly because of the many intervening factors. Unpredictability is particularly notable in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Data mining may however be used to discover highly correlated estimation models. This study looks at artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees and the hybrid model of ANN and decision trees (hybrid model), the three common algorithm methods used for numerical analysis, to forecast stock prices. The author compared the stock price forecasting models derived from the three methods, and applied the models on 10 different stocks in 320 data sets in an empirical forecast. Average accuracy of ANN is 15.31%, the highest, in terms of match with real market stock prices, followed by decision trees, at 14.06%; hybrid model is 13.75%. The study also discovers that compared to the other two methods, ANN is a more stable method for predicting stock prices in the volatile post-crisis stock market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of SVM kernel functions on classification of vibration signals of a single point cutting tool	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision Tree; Statistical features; Support Vector Machine; Tool condition monitoring	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; ROLLER BEARING; WEAR; NETWORKS	The studies on tool condition monitoring along with digital signal processing can be used to prevent damages on cutting tools and workpieces when the tool conditions become faulty. These studies have become more relevant in today's context where the order realization dates are crunched and deadlines are to be met in order to catch up with the competition. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is extensively used to probe into structural health of the tool and the process. This paper discusses condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool using Support Vector Machine and compares the classification efficiency between C-SVC and v-SVC. It further analyses the results with other classifiers like Decision Tree and Naive Bayes and Bayes Net. The vibration signals are acquired for various tool conditions like tool-good condition, tip-breakage, etc. The effort is to bring out the better features-classifier combination.

J	Jung, WG; Park, SS; Jang, DS				Jung, Won-Gyo; Park, Sang-Sung; Jang, Dong-Sik			Patent Registration Prediction Methodology Using Multivariate Statistics	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						patent; neural network; pattern recognition; data mining; text mining	INNOVATION; SCIENCE	Whether a patent is registered or not is usually based on the subjective judgment of the patent examiners. However, the patent examiners may determine whether the patent is registered or not according to their personal knowledge, backgrounds etc. In this paper, we propose a novel patent registration method based on patent data. The method estimates whether a patent is registered or not by utilizing the objective past history of patent data instead of existing methods of subjective judgments. The proposed method constructs an estimation model by applying multivariate statistics algorithm. In the prediction model, the application date, activity index, IPC code and similarity of registration refusal are set to the input values, and patent registration and rejection are set to the output values.

J	Lin, KP; Chen, MS				Lin, Keng-Pei; Chen, Ming-Syan			On the Design and Analysis of the Privacy-Preserving SVM Classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; classification; support vector machines		The support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used tool in classification problems. The SVM trains a classifier by solving an optimization problem to decide which instances of the training data set are support vectors, which are the necessarily informative instances to form the SVM classifier. Since support vectors are intact tuples taken from the training data set, releasing the SVM classifier for public use or shipping the SVM classifier to clients will disclose the private content of support vectors. This violates the privacy-preserving requirements for some legal or commercial reasons. The problem is that the classifier learned by the SVM inherently violates the privacy. This privacy violation problem will restrict the applicability of the SVM. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been work extending the notion of privacy preservation to tackle this inherent privacy violation problem of the SVM classifier. In this paper, we exploit this privacy violation problem, and propose an approach to postprocess the SVM classifier to transform it to a privacy-preserving classifier which does not disclose the private content of support vectors. The postprocessed SVM classifier without exposing the private content of training data is called Privacy-Preserving SVM Classifier (abbreviated as PPSVC). The PPSVC is designed for the commonly used Gaussian kernel function. It precisely approximates the decision function of the Gaussian kernel SVM classifier without exposing the sensitive attribute values possessed by support vectors. By applying the PPSVC, the SVM classifier is able to be publicly released while preserving privacy. We prove that the PPSVC is robust against adversarial attacks. The experiments on real data sets show that the classification accuracy of the PPSVC is comparable to the original SVM classifier.

J	Molina, D; Lozano, M; Sanchez, AM; Herrera, F				Molina, Daniel; Lozano, Manuel; Sanchez, Ana M.; Herrera, Francisco			Memetic algorithms based on local search chains for large scale continuous optimisation problems: MA-SSW-Chains	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Memetic algorithms; Continuous optimisation; Large scale problems; Local search chains	CODED GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; MINIMIZATION; DESIGN	Nowadays, large scale optimisation problems arise as a very interesting field of research, because they appear in many real-world problems (bio-computing, data mining, etc.). Thus, scalability becomes an essential requirement for modern optimisation algorithms. In a previous work, we presented memetic algorithms based on local search chains. Local search chain concerns the idea that, at one stage, the local search operator may continue the operation of a previous invocation, starting from the final configuration reached by this one. Using this technique, it was presented a memetic algorithm, MA-CMA-Chains, using the CMA-ES algorithm as its local search component. This proposal obtained very good results for continuous optimisation problems, in particular with medium-size (with up to dimension 50). Unfortunately, CMA-ES scalability is restricted by several costly operations, thus MA-CMA-Chains could not be successfully applied to large scale problems. In this article we study the scalability of memetic algorithms based on local search chains, creating memetic algorithms with different local search methods and comparing them, considering both the error values and the processing cost. We also propose a variation of Solis Wets method, that we call Subgrouping Solis Wets algorithm. This local search method explores, at each step of the algorithm, only a random subset of the variables. This subset changes after a certain number of evaluations. Finally, we propose a new memetic algorithm based on local search chains for high dimensionality, MA-SSW-Chains, using the Subgrouping Solis Wets' algorithm as its local search method. This algorithm is compared with MA-CMA-Chains and different reference algorithms, and it is shown that the proposal is fairly scalable and it is statistically very competitive for high-dimensional problems.

A generic construct based workload model for business intelligence benchmark	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data warehouse; Data mining; Business intelligence; Generic construct; Benchmark; Workload model; Performance measurement and evaluation		Benchmarks are vital tools in the performance measurement and evaluation of computer hardware and software systems. Standard benchmarks such as the TREC, TPC, SPEC, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Wisconsin, AS(3)AP, OO1, OO7, XOO7 benchmarks have been used to assess the system performance. These benchmarks are domain-specific in that they model typical applications and tie to a problem domain. Test results from these benchmarks are estimates of possible system performance for certain predetermined problem types. When the user domain differs from the standard problem domain or when the application workload is divergent from the standard workload, they do not provide an accurate way to measure the system performance of the user problem domain. System performance of the actual problem domain in terms of data and transactions may vary significantly from the standard benchmarks. In this research, we address the issue of domain boundness and workload boundness which results in the ir-representative and ir-reproducible performance readings. We tackle the issue by proposing a domain-independent and workload-independent benchmark method which is developed from the perspective of the user requirements. We present a user-driven workload model to develop a benchmark in a process of workload requirements representation, transformation, and generation. We aim to create a more generalized and precise evaluation method which derives test suites from the actual user domain and application. The benchmark method comprises three main components. They are a high-level workload specification scheme, a translator of the scheme, and a set of generators to generate the test database and the test suite. The specification scheme is used to formalize the workload requirements. The translator is used to transform the specification. The generator is used to produce the test database and the test workload. In web search, the generic constructs are main common carriers we adopt to capture and compose the workload requirements. We determine the requirements via the analysis of literature study. In this study, we have conducted ten baseline experiments to validate the feasibility and validity of the benchmark method. An experimental prototype is built to execute these experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is capable of modeling the standard benchmarks as well as more general benchmark requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At first, we combine the position information of fixed-length patterns to generate a fixed-length spanning tree to mine frequent fixed-length contiguous patterns. Later on, by joining them based on their position information, we come up with a fast approach to mine all contiguous frequent patterns. After generating the fixed-length contiguous frequent DNA patterns, joining of the patterns of same length is done to produce the next length frequent patterns by comparing their sequence IDs and starting positions in the database. Besides, the spanning tree is constructed in such a way so that the frequent patterns are generated in sorted order. The sorted frequent patterns are then utilized for indexing the starting and ending position of the patterns with the first element as A, C, G, and T, respectively, to come up with fast joining process of the same length subsequences based on binary search. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior over the existing contiguous DNA sequence mining approaches.

Similarity-based methods belong to the most accurate data mining approaches. A large group of such methods is based on instance selection and optimization, with the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm being a prominent example. Accuracy of LVQ depends highly on proper initialization of prototypes and the optimization mechanism. This paper introduces prototype initialization based on context dependent clustering and modification of the LVQ cost function that utilizes additional information about class-dependent distribution of training vectors. This approach is illustrated on several benchmark datasets, finding simple and accurate models of data in the form of prototype-based rules. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, JY; Wu, GH; Shen, LL; Ji, Z				Chen, Jianyong; Wu, Guihua; Shen, Linlin; Ji, Zhen			Differentiated security levels for personal identifiable information in identity management system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Identity management; Differentiated security; Personal identifiable information		With the rapid development of Internet services, identity management (IdM) has got widely attraction as the credit agency between users and service providers. It facilitates users to use the Internet service, promotes service providers to enrich services, and makes Internet more security. Personally identifiable information (PII) is the most important information asset with which identity provider (IdP) can provide various services. Since PII is sensitive to users, it has become a serious problem that PII is leaked, illegal selected, illegal accessed. In order to improve security of PII, this study develops a novel framework using data mining to forecast information asset value and find appropriate security level for protecting user PII. The framework has two stages. In the first stage, user information asset is forecasted by data mining tool (decision tree) from PII database. Then security level for user PII is determined by the information asset value assuming that the higher information asset is, the more security requirement of PII is. In the second stage, with time being, number of illegal access and attack can be accumulated. It can be used to reconstruct the decision tree and update the knowledge base combined with the result of the first stage. Thus security level of PII can be timely adjusted and the protection of PII can be guaranteed even when security threat changes. Furthermore, an empirical case was studied in a user dataset to demonstrate the protection decision derived from the framework for various PII. Simulation results show that the framework with data mining can protect PII effectively. Our work can benefit the development of e-business service. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Merging local patterns using an evolutionary approach	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-database mining; Genetic algorithms; Distributed data mining; Multi-agent systems	HIGH-FREQUENCY RULES; STACKED GENERALIZATION; ENSEMBLE CONSTRUCTION; COMBINING CLASSIFIERS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	This paper describes a Decentralized Agent-based model for Theory Synthesis (DATS) implemented by MASETS, a Multi-Agent System for Evolutionary Theory Synthesis. The main contributions are the following: first, a method for the synthesis of a global theory from distributed local theories. Second, a conflict resolution mechanism, based on genetic algorithms, that deals with collision/contradictions in the knowledge discovered by different agents at their corresponding locations. Third, a system-level classification procedure that improves the results obtained from both: the monolithic classifier and the best local classifier. And fourth, a method for mining very large datasets that allows for divide-and-conquer mining followed by merging of discoveries. The model is validated with an experimental application run on 15 datasets. Results show that the global theory outperforms all the local theories, and the monolithic theory (obtained from mining the concatenation of all the available distributed data), in a statistically significant way.

Intelligent machine agent architecture for adaptive control optimization of manufacturing processes	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Intelligent machining; Agent architecture; Intelligent manufacturing; Process optimization	MULTIAGENT ARCHITECTURE; INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRATION; AUTOMATION	Intelligent agents have been earmarked as the key enabling technology to provide the flexibility required by modern, competitive, customer-orientated manufacturing environments. Rational agent behavior is of paramount importance when interacting with these environments to ensure significant losses are not incurred. To achieve rationality, intelligent agents must constantly balance technical (process) and economic (enterprise wide) trade-offs through co-operation, learning and autonomy. The research presented in this manuscript integrates methodological commonalities in intelligent manufacturing research and prognostics to design and evaluate a generic architecture for the core services of self-learning, rational, machining process regulation agents. The proposed architecture incorporates learning, flexibility and rational decision making through the integration of heterogeneous intelligent algorithms (i.e. neural networks and genetic algorithms) from fields such as machine learning, data mining and statistics. The architecture's ability to perceive, learn and optimize is evaluated on a high-volume industrial gun drilling process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

PTCR-MINER: AN EFFECTIVE RULE-BASED CLASSIFIER ON MULTIVARIATE TEMPORAL DATA CLASSIFICATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Rule-based; Progressive; Multivariate temporal data; Classification; Data mining		Multivariate temporal data are hybrid data. Numeric and categorical data type could be consisted of. Most past researches cannot be operated directly on the multivariate temporal data with both types. Additionally, no useful and readable rules are provided in their methods for advanced classification analysis. We proposed Progressive Temporal Class Rule Miner (PTCR-Miner) algorithm to achieve the classification on multivariate temporal data with a rule-based designed. Through our algorithm, all really useful classification rules are discovered. The rules follow the purification concept we defined, which makes rules comprehensible and intuitive for general users on data classification. We did several experiments to evaluate our method with a multivariate temporal data simulator. Experimental results show PTCR-Miner performs effectively and efficiently on the different simulated multivariate temporal datasets. That means the discovered rules are really helpful and comprehensible for data classification. Furthermore, the rule-based and flexible architecture enables PTCR-Miner more applicable to different areas of multivariate temporal data classification.

In this study, we take a look at this problem, but unlike in traditional statistical analysis, we apply a new method, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), to an airport service survey. A set of "if ... then ... " decision rules is used in the preference model. The passengers indicate their perception of airport LOS by rating a set of criteria/attributes. The proposed method provides practical information that should be of help to airport planners, designers, operators, and managers to develop LOS improvement strategies. The model was implemented using survey data from a large sample of customers from an international airport in Taiwan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Liou, James J.

Mining fastest path from trajectories with multiple destinations in road networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Intelligent transportation system; Trajectory; Path planning	TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; PATTERNS; PREDICTION; HEURISTICS	Nowadays, research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has received many attentions due to its broad applications, such as path planning, which has become a common activity in our daily life. Besides, with the advances of Web 2.0 technologies, users are willing to share their trajectories, thus providing good resources for ITS applications. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the fastest path planning with multiple destinations in the literature. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, called Trajectory-based Path Finding (TPF), which is built upon a novel algorithm named Mining-based Algorithm for Travel time Evaluation (MATE) for evaluating the travel time of a navigation path and a novel index structure named Efficient Navigation Path Search Tree (ENS-Tree) for efficiently retrieving the fastest path. With MATE and ENS-tree, an efficient fastest path finding algorithm for single destination is derived. To find the path for multiple destinations, we propose a novel strategy named Cluster-Based Approximation Strategy (CBAS), to determine the fastest visiting order from specified multiple destinations. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the proposed techniques employed in the design of TPF and show that MATE, ENS-tree and CBAS produce excellent performance under various system conditions.

J	Matsubara, Y; Sakurai, Y; Yoshikawa, M				Matsubara, Yasuko; Sakurai, Yasushi; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi			D-Search: an efficient and exact search algorithm for large distribution sets	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distribution sets; KL divergence; Singular value decomposition; Likelihood		Distribution data naturally arise in countless domains, such as meteorology, biology, geology, industry and economics. However, relatively little attention has been paid to data mining for large distribution sets. Given n distributions of multiple categories and a query distribution Q, we want to find similar clouds (i.e., distributions) to discover patterns, rules and outlier clouds. For example, consider the numerical case of sales of items, where, for each item sold, we record the unit price and quantity; then, each customer is represented as a distribution of 2-d points (one for each item he/she bought). We want to find similar users, e.g., for market segmentation or anomaly/fraud detection. We propose to address this problem and present D-Search, which includes fast and effective algorithms for similarity search in large distribution datasets. Our main contributions are (1) approximate KL divergence, which can speed up cloud-similarity computations, (2) multistep sequential scan, which efficiently prunes a significant number of search candidates and leads to a direct reduction in the search cost. We also introduce an extended version of D-Search: (3) time-series distribution mining, which finds similar subsequences in time-series distribution datasets. Extensive experiments on real multidimensional datasets show that our solution achieves a wall clock time up to 2,300 times faster than the naive implementation without sacrificing accuracy.

J	Moerchen, F; Thies, M; Ultsch, A				Moerchen, Fabian; Thies, Michael; Ultsch, Alfred			Efficient mining of all margin-closed itemsets with applications in temporal knowledge discovery and classification by compression	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Closed itemsets; Constrained itemsets; Condensed representation; Temporal data mining; Compression	FREQUENT ITEMSETS; PATTERNS; RULES	Margin-closed itemsets have previously been proposed as a subset of the closed itemsets with a minimum margin constraint on the difference in support to supersets. The constraint reduces redundancy in the set of reported patterns favoring longer, more specific patterns. A variety of patterns ranging from rare specific itemsets to frequent general itemsets is reported to support exploratory data analysis and understandable classification models. We present DCI_Margin, a new efficient algorithm that mines the complete set of margin-closed itemsets. We modified the DCI_Closed algorithm that has low memory requirements and can be parallelized. The margin constraint is checked on-the-fly reusing information already computed by DCI_Closed. We thoroughly analyzed the behavior on many datasets and show how other data mining algorithms can benefit from the redundancy reduction.

Rules extraction from constructively trained neural networks based on genetic algorithms	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Data mining classification; Rules; Learning; Convergent; Comprehensible	REGRESSION	The application of neural networks in the data mining has become wider. Although neural networks may have complex structure, long training time, and the representation of results is not comprehensible, neural networks have high acceptance ability for noisy data, high accuracy and are preferable in data mining. On the other hand, It is an open question as to what is the best way to train and extract symbolic rules from trained neural networks in domains like classification. In this paper, we train the neural networks by constructive learning and present the analysis of the convergence rate of the error in a neural network with and without threshold which have been learnt by a constructive method to obtain the simple structure of the network. The response of ANN is acquired but its result is not in understandable form or in a black box form. It is frequently desirable to use the model backwards and identify sets of input variable which results in a desired output value. The large numbers of variables and nonlinear nature of many materials models that can help finding an optimal set of difficult input variables. We will use a genetic algorithm to solve this problem. The method is evaluated on different public-domain data sets with the aim of testing the predictive ability of the method and compared with standard classifiers, results showed comparatively high accuracy.

A popular type of such a mechanism is similarity querying. For a long time, the database-oriented applications of similarity search employed the definition of similarity restricted to metric distances. Due to its topological properties, metric similarity can be effectively used to index a database which can then be queried efficiently by so-called metric access methods. However, together with the increasing complexity of data entities across various domains, in recent years there appeared many similarities that were not metrics-we call them nonmetric similarity functions. In this article we survey domains employing nonmetric functions for effective similarity search, and methods for efficient nonmetric similarity search. First, we show that the ongoing research in many of these domains requires complex representations of data entities. Simultaneously, such complex representations allow us to model also complex and computationally expensive similarity functions (often represented by various matching algorithms). However, the more complex similarity function one develops, the more likely it will be a nonmetric. Second, we review state-of-the-art techniques for efficient (fast) nonmetric similarity search, concerning both exact and approximate search. Finally, we discuss some open problems and possible future research trends.

J	Yang, R; Olafsson, S				Yang, Rui; Olafsson, Sigurdur			Classification for predicting offender affiliation with murder victims	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Homicide data; Classification; Decision tree; Support vector machine; Random forest	REPORTING SYSTEM; NIBRS DATA; CRIME; HOMICIDE; RATES	The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is used by law enforcement to record a detailed picture of crime incidents, including data on offenses, victims and suspected arrestees. Such incident data lends itself to the use of data mining to uncover hidden patterns that can provide meaningful insights to law enforcement and policy makers. In this paper we analyze all homicide data recorded over one year in the NIBRS database, and use classification to predict the relationships between murder victims and the offenders. We evaluate different ways for formulating classification problems for this prediction and compare four classification methods: decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and neural network. Our results show that by setting up binary classification problems to discriminate each type of victim-offender relationship versus all others good classification accuracy can be obtained, especially by the support vector machine method and the random forest approach. Furthermore, our results show that interesting structural insight can be obtain by performing attribute selection and by using transparent decision tree models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chuang, LY; Tsai, SW; Yang, CH				Chuang, Li-Yeh; Tsai, Sheng-Wei; Yang, Cheng-Hong			Improved binary particle swarm optimization using catfish effect for feature selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Catfish binary particle swarm optimization; K-nearest neighbor; Leave-one-out cross-validation	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS	The feature selection process constitutes a commonly encountered problem of global combinatorial optimization. This process reduces the number of features by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant data, thus resulting in acceptable classification accuracy. Feature selection is a preprocessing technique with great importance in the fields of data analysis and information retrieval processing, pattern classification, and data mining applications. This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm called catfish binary particle swarm optimization (CatfishBPSO), in which the so-called catfish effect is applied to improve the performance of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). This effect is the result of the introduction of new particles into the search space ("catfish particles"), which replace particles with the worst fitness by the initialized at extreme points of the search space when the fitness of the global best particle has not improved for a number of consecutive iterations. In this study, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the quality of the solutions. CatfishBPSO was applied and compared to 10 classification problems taken from the literature. Experimental results show that CatfishBPSO simplifies the feature selection process effectively, and either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features than other feature selection methods.

A note on "A new method for ranking discovered rules from data mining by DEA", and a full ranking approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis; Data mining; Multiple criteria	MODEL	In a recent paper by Toloo et al. [Toloo, M., Sohrabi, B., & Nalchigar, S. (2009). A new method for ranking discovered rules from data mining by DEA. Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 8503-8508], they proposed a new integrated data envelopment analysis model to find most efficient association rule in data mining. Then, utilizing this model, an algorithm is developed for ranking association rules by considering multiple criteria. In this paper, we show that their model only selects one efficient association rule by chance and is totally depended on the solution method or software is used for solving the problem. In addition, it is shown that their proposed algorithm can only rank efficient rules randomly and will fail to rank inefficient DMUs. We also refer to some other drawbacks in that paper and propose another approach to set up a full ranking of the association rules. A numerical example illustrates some contents of the paper.

J	Lessmann, S; Caserta, M; Arango, IM				Lessmann, Stefan; Caserta, Marco; Montalvo Arango, Idel			Tuning metaheuristics: A data mining based approach for particle swarm optimization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Metaheuristics; Particle swarm optimization; Forecasting; Data mining	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HYBRID GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION MODELS; SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES; CUSTOMER ATTRITION; CHURN PREDICTION; TABU SEARCH; PARAMETERS; BENCHMARKING	The paper is concerned with practices for tuning the parameters of metaheuristics. Settings such as, e.g., the cooling factor in simulated annealing, may greatly affect a metaheuristic's efficiency as well as effectiveness in solving a given decision problem. However, procedures for organizing parameter calibration are scarce and commonly limited to particular metaheuristics. We argue that the parameter selection task can appropriately be addressed by means of a data mining based approach. In particular, a hybrid system is devised, which employs regression models to learn suitable parameter values from past moves of a metaheuristic in an online fashion. In order to identify a suitable regression method and, more generally, to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study of particle swarm optimization is conducted. Empirical results suggest that characteristics of the decision problem as well as search history data indeed embody information that allows suitable parameter values to be determined, and that this type of information can successfully be extracted by means of nonlinear regression models.

Nasir; Mamat, Ali			Efficient prime-based method for interactive mining of frequent patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent pattern mining; Interactive mining; Prime number	ASSOCIATION RULES; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES; TREE; GENERATION; ITEMSETS	Over the past decade, an increasing number of efficient algorithms have been proposed to mine frequent patterns by satisfying the minimum support threshold. Generally, determining an appropriate value for minimum support threshold is extremely difficult. This is because the appropriate value depends on the type of application and expectation of the user. Moreover, in some real-time applications such as web mining and e-business, finding new correlations between patterns by changing the minimum support threshold is needed. Since rerunning mining algorithms from scratch is very costly and time-consuming, researchers have introduced interactive mining of frequent patterns. Recently, a few efficient interactive mining algorithms have been proposed, which are able to capture the content of transaction database to eliminate possibility of the database rescanning. In this paper, we propose a new method based on prime number and its characteristics mainly for interactive mining of frequent patterns. Our method isolates the mining model from the mining process such that once the mining model is constructed; it can be frequently used by mining process with various minimum support thresholds. During the mining process, the mining algorithm reduces the number of candidate patterns and comparisons by using a new candidate set called candidate head set and several efficient pruning techniques.

J	Yen, SJ; Lee, YS				Yen, Show-Jane; Lee, Yue-Shi			A neural network approach to discover attribute dependency for improving the performance of classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Attribute dependency; Classification; Data mining; Decision tree; Neural network	DECISION-TREE	The decision tree learning algorithms, e.g., C5, are good at dataset classification. But those algorithms usually work with only one attribute at a time and adopt the greedy method to build the decision tree. The dependencies among attributes are not considered in those algorithms. Unfortunately, in the real world, most datasets contain attributes, which are dependent. Thus, the results generated by those algorithms are not the optimal learning results. However, it is a combinatorial explosion problem for considering multiple attributes at a time. So, it is very important to construct a model to efficiently discovery the dependencies among attributes, and to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the decision tree learning algorithms. Generally, these dependencies are classified into two types: categorical-type and numerical-type dependencies. This paper proposes a Neural Decision Tree (NDT) model, to deal with these two kinds of dependencies. The NDT model combines the neural network technologies and the traditional decision-tree learning capabilities, to handle the complicated and real cases. According to the experiments on ten datasets from the UCI database repository, the NDT model can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of C5. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Pattern- and Network-Based Classification Techniques for Multichannel Medical Data Signals to Improve Brain Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification; epilepsy diagnosis; multidimensional time series; optimization; pattern recognition	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TIME-SERIES CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY; RECOGNITION; PROGNOSIS	There is an urgent need for a quick screening process that could help neurologists diagnose and determine whether a patient is epileptic versus simply demonstrating symptoms linked to epilepsy but actually stemming from a different illness. An inaccurate diagnosis could have fatal consequences, particularly in operating rooms and intensive care units. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been traditionally used, as a gold standard, to diagnose patients by evaluating those brain functions thatmight correspond to epilepsy and other brain disorders. This research therefore focuses on developing new classification techniques for multichannel EEG recordings. Two time-series classification techniques, namely, Support Feature Machine (SFM) and Network-Based Support Vector Machine (SVM) (NSVM), are proposed in this paper to predict from EEG readings whether a person is epileptic or nonepileptic. The SFM approach is an optimization model that maximizes classification accuracy by selecting a group of electrodes (features) that has strong class separability based on time-series similarity measures and correctly classifies EEG samples in the training phase. The NSVM approach integrates a new network-based model for multidimensional time-series data with traditional SVMs to exploit both the spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG data. The proposed techniques are tested on two EEG data sets acquired from ten and five patients, respectively. Compared with other commonly used classification techniques such as SVMand decision trees, the proposed SFM and NSVM techniques provide very promising and practical results and require much less time and memory resources than traditional techniques. This study is a necessary application of data mining to advance the diagnosis and treatment of human epilepsy.

J	Chuang, CL				Chuang, Chun-Ling			Case-based reasoning support for liver disease diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Liver disease; Case-based reasoning; Hepatitis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHRONIC HEPATITIS-C; OF-THE-ART; CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DECISION-SUPPORT; SYSTEM; CANCER; CIRRHOSIS	Objectives: In Taiwan, as well as in the other countries around the world, liver disease has reigned over the list of leading causes of mortality, and its resistance to early detection renders the disease even more threatening. It is therefore crucial to develop an auxiliary system for diagnosing liver disease so as to enhance the efficiency of medical diagnosis and to expedite the delivery of proper medical treatment. Methods: The study accordingly integrated the case-based reasoning (CBR) model into several common classification methods of data mining techniques, including back-propagation neural network (BPN), classification and regression tree, logistic regression, and discriminatory analysis, in an attempt to develop a more efficient model for early diagnosis of liver disease and to enhance classification accuracy. To minimize possible bias, this study used a ten-fold cross-validation to select a best model for more precise diagnosis results and to reduce problems caused by false diagnosis. Results: Through a comparison of five single models, BPN and CBR emerged to be the top two methods in terms of overall performance. For enhancing diagnosis performance, CBR was integrated with other methods, and the results indicated that the accuracy and sensitivity of each CBR-added hybrid model were higher than those of each single model. Of all the CBR-added hybrid models, the BPN-CBR method took the lead in terms of diagnosis capacity with an accuracy rate of 95%, a sensitivity of 98%, and a specificity of 94%. Conclusions: After comparing the five single and hybrid models, the study found BPN-CBR the best model capable of helping physicians to determine the existence of liver disease, achieve an accurate diagnosis, diminish the possibility of a false diagnosis being given to sick people, and avoid the delay of clinical treatment.

In this paper, we also aim to improve the derivation of fuzzy relationships, and compare the results to previous studies. The proposed model in this paper not only requires no prior knowledge or pre-review dataset to generate heuristic rules, but also effectively reduces computational effort by decreasing the quantity of fuzzy sets of linguistic variables. The rough set classifier is introduced to discover fuzzy relationships first when a time-invariant relation is derived. The empirical results show that the proposed model's MSE (mean square error) is 79,040, the MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error) is 1.47% and the time complexity outperforms previous models and yields the best known result.

There has been a growing need for the use of clustering algorithms in embedded systems with restricted computational capabilities, such as wireless sensor nodes, in order to support automated knowledge extraction from such systems. Although there has been considerable research on clustering algorithms, many of the proposed methods are computationally expensive. We propose a robust clustering algorithm with low computational complexity, suitable for computationally constrained environments. Our evaluation using both synthetic and real-life datasets demonstrates lower computational complexity and comparable accuracy of our approach compared to a range of existing methods.

The use of decision trees for cost-sensitive classification: an empirical study in software quality prediction	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							MODELS	This empirical study investigates two commonly used decision tree classification algorithms in the context of cost-sensitive learning. A review of the literature shows that the cost-based performance of a software quality prediction model is usually determined after the model-training process has been completed. In contrast, we incorporate cost-sensitive learning during the model-training process. The C4.5 and Random Forest decision tree algorithms are used to build defect predictors either with, or without, any cost-sensitive learning technique. The paper investigates six different cost-sensitive learning techniques: AdaCost, Adc2, Csb2, MetaCost, Weighting, and Random Undersampling (RUS). The data come from case study include 15 software measurement datasets obtained from several high-assurance systems. In addition, to a unique insight into the cost-based performance of defection prediction models, this study is one of the first to use misclassification cost as a parameter during the model-training process. The practical appeal of this research is that it provides a software quality practitioner with a clear process for how to consider (during model training) and analyze (during model evaluation) the cost-based performance of a defect prediction model. RUS is ranked as the best cost-sensitive technique among those considered in this study. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In many cases, locations could be easily estimated using various traditional positioning methods and conventional machine learning approaches based on signalling devices, e. g., access points (APs). When there exist environmental changes, however, such traditional methods cannot be employed due to data distribution change. In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce feature relevance network-based method, which focuses on interrelatedness among features. Feature relevance networks are connected graphs representing concurrency of the signalling devices such as APs. In the newly created relevance network, a test instance and the prototype of a location are expanded until convergence. The expansion cost corresponds to distance between the test instance and the prototype. Unlike other methods, our model is nonparametric making no assumptions about signal distributions. The proposed method is applied to the 2007 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Data Mining Contest Task #2 (transfer learning), which is a typical example situation where the training and test datasets have been gathered during different periods. Using the proposed method, we accomplish the estimation accuracy of 0.3238, which is better than the best result of the contest.

J	Song, SJ; Kim, EH; Kim, HG; Kumar, H				Song, Seung-Jae; Kim, Eung-Hee; Kim, Hong-Gee; Kumar, Harshit			Query-based association rule mining supporting user perspective	COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Association rule; Formal concept analysis; User perspective	RECOMMENDATION; LATTICES	Two parameters, namely support and confidence, in association rule mining, are used to arrange association rules in either increasing or decreasing order. These two parameters are assigned values by counting the number of transactions satisfying the rule without considering user perspective. Hence, an association rule, with low values of support and confidence, but meaningful to the user, does not receive the same importance as is perceived by the user. Reflecting user perspective is of paramount importance in light of improving user satisfaction for a given recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a model and an algorithm to extract association rules, meaningful to a user, with an ad-hoc support and confidence by allowing the user to specify the importance of each transaction. In addition, we apply the characteristics of a concept lattice, a core data structure of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to reflect subsumption relation of association rules when assigning the priority to each rule. Finally, we describe experiment results to verify the potential and efficiency of the proposed method.

J	Sun, S; Zambreno, J				Sun, Song; Zambreno, Joseph			Design and Analysis of a Reconfigurable Platform for Frequent Pattern Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; frequent item set mining; data mining; reconfigurable computing; systolic tree; FPGA		Frequent pattern mining algorithms are designed to find commonly occurring sets in databases. This class of algorithms is typically very memory intensive, leading to prohibitive runtimes on large databases. A class of reconfigurable architectures has been recently developed that have shown promise in accelerating some data mining applications. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for frequent pattern mining based on a systolic tree structure. The goal of this architecture is to mimic the internal memory layout of the original pattern mining software algorithm while achieving a higher throughput. We provide a detailed analysis of the area and performance requirements of our systolic tree-based architecture, and show that our reconfigurable platform is faster than the original software algorithm for mining long frequent patterns.

The algorithm only searches for local frequent items in a projected database that stores potential local inter-transaction items and partitions the database into a set of smaller databases recursively. In addition, two pruning strategies are designed to further condense the partitioned databases and thus accelerate the algorithm. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed PITP-Miner algorithm outperforms the ITP-Miner and FITI algorithms in most cases. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In reality, the data warehouse mining system has provided many applicable solutions in industries, yet there are still many problems causing users extra problems in discovering knowledge or even failing to obtain the real and useful knowledge they need. To improve the overall data warehouse mining process, we present an intelligent data warehouse mining approach incorporated with schema ontology, schema constraint ontology, domain ontology and user preference ontology. The structures of these ontologies are illustrated and how they benefit the mining process is also demonstrated by examples utilizing rule mining. Finally, we present a prototype multidimensional association mining system, which with intelligent assistance through the support of the ontologies, can help users build useful data mining models, prevent ineffective pattern generation, discover concept extended rules, and provide an active knowledge re-discovering mechanism.

Furthermore, clustering has proven elemental in microRNA expression profiling, which demonstrates enormous promise in the areas of cancer diagnosis and treatment, gene function identification, therapy development and drug testing, and genetic regulatory network inference. However, such a practice is inherently limited due to the existence of many uncorrelated genes with respect to sample or condition clustering, or many unrelated samples or conditions with respect to gene clustering. Biclustering offers a solution to such problems by performing simultaneous clustering on both dimensions, or automatically integrating feature selection to clustering without any prior information, so that the relations of clusters of genes (generally, features) and clusters of samples or conditions (data objects) are established. However, the NP-complete computational complexity raises a great challenge to computational methods for identifying such local relations. Here, we propose and demonstrate that a neural-based classifier, ARTMAP, can be modified to perform biclustering in an efficient way, leading to a biclustering algorithm called Biclustering ARTMAP (BARTMAP). Experimental results on multiple human cancer data sets show that BARTMAP can achieve clustering structures with higher qualities than those achieved with other commonly used biclustering or clustering algorithms, and with fast run times.
