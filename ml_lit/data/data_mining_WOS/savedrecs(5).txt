J	Boran, FE; Akay, D				Boran, Fatih Emre; Akay, Diyar			A Generic Method for the Evaluation of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Linguistic Summaries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Data mining; interval type-2 fuzzy set; linguistic summarization	QUANTIFIER DRIVEN AGGREGATION; GRADUAL NUMBERS; SETS; RULES; REPRESENTATION; SIMILARITY; SENTENCES; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; SYSTEMS	Linguistic summarization has turned out to be an important knowledge discovery technique by providing the most relevant natural language-based sentences in a human consistent manner. While many studies on linguistic summarization have handled ordinary fuzzy sets [type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS)] for modeling words, only few of them have dealt with interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) even though IT2FS is better capable of handling uncertainties associated with words. Furthermore, the existent studies work with the scalar cardinality based degree of truth which might lead to inconsistency in the evaluation of interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) linguistic summaries. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel probabilistic degree of truth for evaluating IT2F linguistic summaries in the forms of type-I and type-II quantified sentences. We also extend the properties that should be fulfilled by any degree of truth on linguistic summarization with T1FS to IT2F environment. We not only prove that our probabilistic degree of truth satisfies the given properties, but also illustrate by examples that it provides more consistent results when compared to the existing degree of truth in the literature. Furthermore, we carry out an application on linguistic summarization of time series data of Europe Brent Spot Price, along with a comparison of the results achieved with our approach and that of the existing degree of truth in the literature.

With multiple sources of data, the natural challenge is to determine how to collaborate effectively across proprietary organizational boundaries while maximizing the utility of collected information. Since using only local data gives suboptimal utility, techniques for privacy-preserving collaborative knowledge discovery must be developed. Existing cryptography-based work for privacy-preserving data mining is still too slow to be effective for large scale data sets to face today's big data challenge. Previous work on random decision trees (RDT) shows that it is possible to generate equivalent and accurate models with much smaller cost. We exploit the fact that RDTs can naturally fit into a parallel and fully distributed architecture, and develop protocols to implement privacy-preserving RDTs that enable general and efficient distributed privacy-preserving knowledge discovery.

In recent years, the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has assessed the evidence available on the following adverse reactions associated with the use of statins: sleep disturbances, memory loss, micturition disorders (problems with urination), sexual disturbances, depression, and interstitial pneumopathy. However, the association between statin use and the risk of these adverse reactions remains unclear. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or the disorder causing LUTS, we carried out data mining using a prescription database. Methods: A large organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor was used in the study. Symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of LUTS after using statins over the period January 2006 to August 2013. Statin use in combination with drugs administered for storage LUTS was examined by prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA). Results: A significant association between statins and drugs for storage LUTS was found, with adjusted sequence ratios (ASRs) of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.00-1.46), 1.19(95% CI, 1.04-1.38), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30) for intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, respectively. In the analyses of individual statins, significant associations were found only for pravastatin. Significant associations with individual drugs for storage LUTS were found for solifenacin succinate with ASRs of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.02-1.81), 1.48 (95% CI, 1.19-1.84), and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.25-1.73) for intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, for fiavoxate hydrochloride with an ASR of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.13-2.17) at an interval of 182 days, and for oxybutynin hydrochloride with ASRs of 2.06(95% CI, 1.11-3.94) and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.09-2.72) at intervals of 182 and 365 days. Significant associations with gender were found only in females with ASRs of 1.25(95% CI, 1.04-1.51) and 1.23(95% CI, 1.07-1.41) at intervals of 182 and 365days, respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of the prescription database showed significant association for storage LUTS in statin users.

Prototype endogenous avian retroviruses of the genus Gallus	JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY			English	Article							REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE ACTIVITY; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; LEUKOSIS-VIRUS; CHICKEN GENOME; HOST-RANGE; SUBGROUP-J; EAV-HP; ART-CH; FAMILY; SEQUENCES	Ancient endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), designated endogenous avian retrovirus (EAVs), are present in all Gallus spp. including the chicken, and resemble the modern avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses (ASLVs). The EAVs comprise several distinct retroviruses, including EAV-0, EAV-E51 and EAV-HP, as well as a putative member previously named the avian retrotransposon of chickens (ART-CH). Thus far, only the EAV-HP elements have been well characterized. Here, we determined sequences of representative EAV-0 and EAV-E51 proviruses by cloning and data mining of the 2011 assembly of the Gallus gallus genome. Although the EAV-0 elements are primarily deleted in the env region, we identified two complete EAV-0 env genes within the G. gal/us genome and prototype elements sharing identity with an EAV-E51-related clone previously designated EAV-E33. Prototype EAV-0, EAV-E51 and EAV-E33 gag, pot and env gene sequences used for phylogenetic analysis of deduced proteins showed that the EAVs formed three distinct clades, with EAV-0 sharing the last common ancestor with the ASLVs. The EAV-E51 clade showed the greatest level of divergence compared with other EAVs or ASLVs, suggesting that these ERVs represented exogenous retroviruses that evolved and integrated into the germline over a long period of time. Moreover, the degree of divergence between the chicken and red jungle fowl EAV-E51 sequences suggested that they were more ancient than the other EAVs and may have diverged through mutations that accumulated post-integration. Finally, we showed that the ART-CH elements were chimeric defective ERVs comprising portions of EAV-E51 and EAV-HP rather than authentic retrotransposons.

Methods: For a 6647 population without diabetes, aged >= 20 years, followed for 12 years, a prediction model was developed using classification by the decision tree technique. Seven hundred and twenty-nine (11%) diabetes cases occurred during the follow-up. Predictor variables were selected from demographic characteristics, smoking status, medical and drug history and laboratory measures. Results: We developed the predictive models by decision tree using 60 input variables and one output variable. The overall classification accuracy was 90.5%, with 31.1% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; and for the subjects without diabetes, precision and f-measure were 92% and 0.95, respectively. The identified variables included fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, triglycerides, mean arterial blood pressure, family history of diabetes, educational level and job status. Conclusions: In conclusion, decision tree analysis, using routine demographic, clinical, anthropometric and laboratory measurements, created a simple tool to predict individuals at low risk for type 2 diabetes.

The mechanistic understanding of how these psychotropic medications are related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is crucial for the development of novel drug candidates and patient adherence. This study aims to associate in vitro assessed binding affinity profiles (39 compounds, 24 molecular drug targets) and ADRs (n=22) reported in clinical trials of antidepressants and antipsychotics (n>59.000 patients) by the use of robust multivariate statistics. Orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-PLS) regression models with reasonable predictability were found for several frequent ADRs such as nausea, diarrhea, hypotension, dizziness, headache, insomnia, sedation, sleepiness, increased sweating, and weight gain. Results of the present study support many well-known pharmacological principles such as the association of hypotension and dizziness with alpha(1)-receptor or sedation with H-1-receptor antagonism. Moreover, the analyses revealed novel or hardly investigated mechanisms for common ADRs including the potential involvement of 5-HT6-antagonism in weight gain, muscarinic receptor antagonism in dizziness, or 5-HT7-antagonism in sedation. To summarize, the presented study underlines the feasibility and value of a multivariate data mining approach in psychopharmacological development of antidepressants and antipsychotics.

Statistical performances of these five models were compared based on mean square error, mean absolute error and three correlation coefficients, which are measured by the difference between the observed and the corresponding predicted values. As a result, the performance of support vector regression is equivalent to (or better than) that of neural networks, and these two models are superior to the tree regression model, analysis of variance, and generalized linear model based on CPUE analyses of actual fishery data for southern bluefin tuna. We suggest a simple method for factorial analysis to extract the CPUE year trend based on the predicted values obtained from these data mining models. This method is expected to contribute markedly to reduce the difficulty of estimating the CPUE year trends by these models for data mining and should be applied to CPUE analyses because of its ease of use, general versatility and high performance .

J	Lee, PH				Lee, Paul H.			Resampling Methods Improve the Predictive Power of Modeling in Class-Imbalanced Datasets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						automated classifier; data mining; decision tree; oversampling; predictive power; rare events		In the medical field, many outcome variables are dichotomized, and the two possible values of a dichotomized variable are referred to as classes. A dichotomized dataset is class-imbalanced if it consists mostly of one class, and performance of common classification models on this type of dataset tends to be suboptimal. To tackle such a problem, resampling methods, including oversampling and undersampling can be used. This paper aims at illustrating the effect of resampling methods using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) wave 2009-2010 dataset. A total of 4677 participants aged >= 20 without self-reported diabetes and with valid blood test results were analyzed. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) procedure was used to build a classification model on undiagnosed diabetes. A participant demonstrated evidence of diabetes according to WHO diabetes criteria. Exposure variables included demographics and socio-economic status. CART models were fitted using a randomly selected 70% of the data (training dataset), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed using the remaining 30% of the sample for evaluation (testing dataset). CART models were fitted using the training dataset, the oversampled training dataset, the weighted training dataset, and the undersampled training dataset. In addition, resampling case-to-control ratio of 1: 1, 1: 2, and 1: 4 were examined. Resampling methods on the performance of other extensions of CART (random forests and generalized boosted trees) were also examined. CARTs fitted on the oversampled (AUC = 0.70) and undersampled training data (AUC = 0.74) yielded a better classification power than that on the training data (AUC = 0.65). Resampling could also improve the classification power of random forests and generalized boosted trees. To conclude, applying resampling methods in a class-imbalanced dataset improved the classification power of CART, random forests, and generalized boosted trees.

J	Zhou, QM; Dilmore, R; Kleit, A; Wang, JY				Zhou, Qiumei; Dilmore, Robert; Kleit, Andrew; Wang, John Yilin			Evaluating gas production performances in marcellus using data mining technologies	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Gas recovery; Stimulation effectiveness; Data mining; Marcellus Shale		Shale gas development enabled by the advent of advanced horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology - has become, over the past several years, a very important energy resource. The estimated ultimate recovery of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia alone has been estimated to be between 98 and 150 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). In 2008, 25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas was produced from 41 horizontal wells in West Virginia. By 2012, that gas production reached 301.7 Bcf from 631 horizontal wells. However, the hydraulic fracture stimulation of horizontal wells with multiple stages mechanism, by which that natural gas is produced from shale, is complex. Significant uncertainty about production performance in these unconventional reservoirs represents significant risk for whether resource development will lead to favorable technical and economic performance. The objective of this paper is to use post-hoc analysis techniques to identify correlations between gas production performance of a well and attributes of its completion and geological setting, and to identify those factors most important to predicting gas recovery performance. To accomplish this, the geological attributes of Marcellus Shale in West Virginia were characterized through literature review. Then, the set of 631 wells was down selected to a representative subset of 187 wells for which complete data are available, including well location, completion data, hydraulic fracture treatment data and production data. The wells were classified into four groups based on geological setting. For each geological group, engineering and statistical analyses were applied to study the correlation between well performance and well completion attributes through traditional regression methods. Important factors considered to affect gas production include number of hydraulic fracture stages, lateral length, vertical depth, proppant volume, and fracture fluid volume and treatment rate. The numbers of hydraulic fracture stages and lateral length have relative large influence on well performance. With these analysis results, it was possible to estimate well-scale ultimate natural gas production performance as a function of known geological conditions and completion parameters. The results lead to a better understanding of the trends in Marcellus Formation well performance. These approaches could, in the future, help to optimize stimulation treatments and well completions and improve resource recovery in the Marcellus, and other unconventional hydrocarbon formations.

J	Wong, KS; Kim, MH				Wong, Kok-Seng; Kim, Myung Ho			On private Hamming distance computation	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Private Hamming distance; Similarity measurement; Privacy preserving computation protocol; Secure two-party computation	ISLANDS	Finding similarities between two datasets is an important task in many research areas, particularly those of data mining, information retrieval, cloud computing, and biometrics. However, maintaining data protection and privacy while enabling similarity measurements has become a priority for data owners in recent years. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient and secure protocol to facilitate the Hamming distance computation between two semi-honest parties (a client and a server). In our protocol design, both parties are constrained to ensure that no extra information will be revealed other than the computed result (privacy is protected) and further, the output of the protocol is according to the prescribed functionality (correctness is guaranteed).

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SUBTYPES TO PREDICT LONG-TERM COURSE	DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Article						epidemiology; depression; anxiety; anxiety disorders; suicide; self-harm; panic attacks	RECURSIVE PARTITIONING ANALYSIS; WORLD-HEALTH-ORGANIZATION; COMMON MENTAL-DISORDERS; LARGE-SAMPLE; GENERAL-POPULATION; ANXIETY DISORDERS; RISK; COMORBIDITY; INPATIENTS; REMISSION	BackgroundVariation in the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing subtype distinctions. A new subtyping approach is considered here. MethodsTwo data mining techniques, ensemble recursive partitioning and Lasso generalized linear models (GLMs), followed by k-means cluster analysis are used to search for subtypes based on index episode symptoms predicting subsequent MDD course in the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. The WMH surveys are community surveys in 16 countries. Lifetime DSM-IV MDD was reported by 8,261 respondents. Retrospectively reported outcomes included measures of persistence (number of years with an episode, number of years with an episode lasting most of the year) and severity (hospitalization for MDD, disability due to MDD). ResultsRecursive partitioning found significant clusters defined by the conjunctions of early onset, suicidality, and anxiety (irritability, panic, nervousness-worry-anxiety) during the index episode. GLMs found additional associations involving a number of individual symptoms. Predicted values of the four outcomes were strongly correlated. Cluster analysis of these predicted values found three clusters having consistently high, intermediate, or low predicted scores across all outcomes. The high-risk cluster (30.0% of respondents) accounted for 52.9-69.7% of high persistence and severity, and it was most strongly predicted by index episode severe dysphoria, suicidality, anxiety, and early onset. A total symptom count, in comparison, was not a significant predictor. ConclusionsDespite being based on retrospective reports, results suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made using data mining methods. Further studies are needed to test and expand these results with prospective data. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Zhang, QC; Chen, ZK				Zhang, Qingchen; Chen, Zhikui			A weighted kernel possibilistic c-means algorithm based on cloud computing for clustering big data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						big data; complex networks; cloud computing; PCM	NETWORK	Possibilistic c-means (PCM) cluster algorithm has emerged as an important tool for data preprocessing widely used in data mining and knowledge discovery. Owning to the huge amount of data, high computational complexity, and noise-corrupted data, the PCM algorithms scaled for big data find it difficult to produce a good result in real time. The paper proposes a weighted kernel PCM (wkPCM) algorithm to cluster data objects in appropriate groups. The proposed algorithm introduces weights to define the relative importance of each object in the kernel clustering solution, which reduces the corruption caused by noisy data. In order to improve the real time of the proposed algorithm, cloud computing technology is used to optimize wkPCM to propose a distributed wkPCM algorithm based on MapReduce, which can provide significant computation speed. Experiment demonstrates that the proposed possibilistic clustering algorithms can cluster big data in appropriate groups in real time. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, an efficient genetic algorithm-based image retrieval strategy is proposed where user relevance feedback based on regions of interest is employed to improve the retrieval efficiency. The combination of low-level features from the selected regions forms the chromosomes of the genetic algorithm used for retrieving the target images. The user relevance feedback is used to direct the advanced search. Furthermore, the retrieval performance is improved by mining association rules from the recorded feedback. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the approach both in terms of retrieval precision and recall rates.

The consortium consists of 14 sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe. This report summarizes data mining studies of 614 patients with UCDs enrolled in the UCDC's longitudinal study protocol. The most common disorder is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, accounting for more than half of the participants. We calculated the overall prevalence of urea cycle disorders to be 1/35,000, with 2/3rds presenting initial symptoms after the newborn period. We found the mortality rate to be 24% in neonatal onset cases and 11% in late onset cases. The most common precipitant of clinical hyperammonemic episodes in the post-neonatal period was intercurrent infections. Elevations in both blood ammonia and glutamine appeared to be biomarkers for neurocognitive outcome. In terms of chronic treatment, low protein diet appeared to result in normal weight but decreased linear growth while N-scavenger therapy with phenylbutyrate resulted in low levels of branched chain amino acids. Finally, we found an unexpectedly high risk for hepatic dysfunction in patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. This natural history study illustrates how a collaborative study of a rare genetic disorder can result in an improved understanding of morbidity and disease outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To understand the driving forces and the actual distribution patterns of forest fires is crucial to adapt to those future challenges. We used the province Tyrol in Austria as a case study area. We tested two machine learning algorithms (MaxEnt and RandomForests) for their capability in use with historic fire data and environmental datasets. Presence-only data of 399 forest fires between 1993 and 2011 was compared with a range of topography, vegetation, climate and socio-economic datasets, in order to find out the main driving parameters of the spatial forest fire distribution and to delimit areas of particular fire danger. The results of both algorithms were compared for agreement and differences. Both algorithms delivered broadly similar results; climate (number of days above a certain fire weather index) and anthropogenic parameters (distance to buildings, population density) are the most important parameters in the current alpine fire regime. The models slightly disagreed on the role of forest type and of topography. Joined model results show a strong concentration of potential fire danger along the main valleys and in the drier Tyrolean Upland. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Skudlarek, SJ; Yamamoto, H				Skudlarek, Stefan Jan; Yamamoto, Hirosuke			Unsupervised anomaly detection within non-numerical sequence data by average index difference, with application to masquerade detection	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						unsupervised; anomaly detection; sequence data; non-numerical; masquerade; average index difference		Anomaly detection within non-numerical sequence data has developed into an important topic of data mining, but comparatively little research has been done regarding anomaly detection without training data (unsupervised anomaly detection). One application found in computer security is the detection of a so-called masquerade attack, which consists of an attacker abusing a regular account. This leaves only the session input, which is basically a string of non-numerical commands, for analysis. Our previous approach to this problem introduced the use of the so-called average index difference function for mapping the non-numerical symbol data to a numerical space. In the present paper, we examine the theoretical properties of the average index difference function, present an enhanced unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on the average index difference function, show the parameters to be theoretically inferable, and evaluate the performance using real-world data.

J	Chen, HB; Xu, JG; He, B				Chen, Hongbo; Xu, Jungang; He, Ben			Automated Essay Scoring by Capturing Relative Writing Quality	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						automated essay scoring; learning to rank; data mining		Automated essay-scoring (AES) systems utilize computer techniques and algorithms to automatically rate essays written in an educational setting, by which the workload of human raters is greatly reduced. AES is usually addressed as a classification or regression problem, where classical machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor and support vector machines are applied. In this paper, we argue that essay rating is based on the comparison of writing quality between essays and treat AES rather as a ranking problem by capturing the difference in writing quality between essays. We propose a rank-based approach that trains an essay-rating model by learning to rank algorithms, which have been widely used in many information retrieval and social Web mining tasks. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on two public English essay datasets, Automated Student Assessment Prize and Chinese Learners English Corpus, show that our proposed approach based on pairwise learning outperforms previous classification or regression-based methods on all 15 topics. Finally, analysis on the importance of the features extracted reveals that content, organization and structure are the main factors that affect the ratings of essays written by native English speakers, while non-native speakers are prone to losing ratings on improper term usage, syntactic complexity and grammar errors.

However, complex behavioral and social problems often exhibit strong couplings and heterogeneity between values, attributes and objects (i.e., non-IIDness). This fundamentally challenges the IIDness-based learning methodologies and techniques. This paper presents a high-level overview of the needs, challenges and opportunities of non-IIDness learning for handling complex behavioral and social problems. By reviewing the nature and issues of classic IIDness-based algorithms in frequent pattern mining, clustering and classification to complex behavioral and social applications, concepts, structures, frameworks and exemplar techniques are discussed for non-IIDness learning. Case studies, related work and prospects of non-IIDness learning are presented. Non-IIDness learning is also a fundamental issue in big data analytics.

The forecast of traffic density reduces traffic congestion and improves transportation mobility. This study describes a novel methodology for traffic prediction by extracting important time-related association rules using an evolutionary algorithm named genetic network programming (GNP). The extracted rules provide a useful means for forecasting the future traffic density level of traffic networks. The proposed methodology is implemented and experimentally evaluated using a large-scale real-time traffic simulator named SOUND/4U. The routing algorithm combined with the traffic prediction was also studied using different environments.

Choosing and using diversity indices: insights for ecological applications from the German Biodiversity Exploratories	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; arthropods; Berger-Parker; chemical diversity; Hill's powers; molecular diversity; plant diversity; Plantago lanceolata; Shannon index; Simpson's index	PLANTAGO-LANCEOLATA; MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; EVENNESS; COMMUNICATION; RICHNESS	Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D-1), Simpson's dominance (D-2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P.lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.

Improving the prediction performance of a large tropical vis-NIR spectroscopic soil library from Brazil by clustering into smaller subsets or use of data mining calibration techniques	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ORGANIC-CARBON; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL LIBRARY; REGRESSION; CLAY; MOISTURE; SAMPLES; PH	Effective agricultural planning requires basic soil information. In recent decades visible near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (vis-NIR) has been shown to be a viable alternative for rapidly analysing soil properties. We studied 7172 samples of seven different soil types collected from several regions of Brazil and varying in organic matter (OM) (0.2-10.3%) and clay content (0.2-99.0%). The aim was to explore the possibility of enhancing the performance of vis-NIR data in predicting organic matter and clay content in this library by dividing it into smaller sub-libraries on the basis of their vis-NIR spectra. We used partial least square regression (PLSR) models on the sub-libraries and compared the results with PLSR and two non-linear calibration techniques, boosted regression trees (BT) and support vector machines (SVM) applied to the whole library. The whole library calibrations for clay performed well (ME (modelling efficiency) > 0.82; RMSE (root mean squared error) < 10.9%), reflecting the influence of the direct spectral responses of this property in the vis-NIR range. Calibrations for OM were reasonably good, especially in view of the very small variation in this property (ME > 0.60; RMSE < 0.55%). The best results were, however, found when dividing the large library into smaller subsets by using variation in the mean-normalized or first derivative spectra. This divided the global data set into clusters that were more uniform in mineralogy, regardless of geographical origin, and improved predictive performance. The best clustering method improved the RMSE in the validation to 8.6% clay and 0.47% OM, which corresponds to a 21% and 15% reduction, respectively, as compared with whole library PLSR. For the whole library, SVM performed almost equally well, reducing RMSE to 8.9% clay and 0.48% OM.	[Araujo, S. R.; Dematte, J. A.

Several chosen methods of gene selection, including the Fisher method, correlation of gene with a class, application of the support vector machine and statistical hypotheses, are compared on the basis of clustering measures. The results of applying these individual selection methods are combined together to identify the most often selected genes forming the required pattern, best associated with the cancerous cases. This resulting pattern of selected gene lists is treated as the input data to the classifier, performing the task of the final recognition of the patterns. The numerical results of the recognition of prostate cancer from normal (reference) cases using the selected genes and the support vector machine confirm the good performance of the proposed gene selection approach.

Although cultural and digital memories are characterized as contested, multiple and often involving interplay and conflict between different power dynamics, what remains missing is an understanding of the material basis of digital, globally connective memory or what is termed here globital memory'. In work on memory which addresses social and mobile technologies there is an emphasis on the transition from collective to connective memory' and the ways in which social media offer possibilities for the articulation of marginalized memories, as well as new forms of archiving. While current concern is signalling a return to the question of the significance of mass media' in relation to social and mobile media and digital memory, this work does not yet address the political economy of globital' memory which includes the underlying materiality and technical infrastructure of social media. Using the conceptual metaphor of mining memories, the article will attend to what lies beneath the digital skin' of memories on social networks such as YouTube. I address the socioeconomic and technical infrastructures that enable the capture, circulation and storage of data that then become the raw material of globital memory.

ABC-Miner plus : constructing Markov blanket classifiers with ant colony algorithms	MEMETIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); Data mining; Classification; Bayesian networks; Markov blanket classifiers	CLASSIFICATION RULE DISCOVERY; LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION	ABC-Miner is a Bayesian classification algorithm based on the Ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic. The algorithm learns Bayesian network Augmented Naive-Bayes (BAN) classifiers, where the class node is the parent of all the nodes representing the input variables. However, this assumes the existence of a dependency relationship between the class variable and all the input variables, and this relationship is always a type of "causal" (rather than "effect") relationship, which restricts the flexibility of the algorithm to learn. In this paper, we extended the ABC-Miner algorithm to be able to learn the Markov blanket of the class variable. Such a produced model has a more flexible Bayesian network classifier structure, where it is not necessary to have a (direct) dependency relationship between the class variable and each of the input variables, and the dependency between the class and the input variables varies from "causal" to "effect" relationships. In this context, we propose two algorithms: ABC-Miner+(1), in which the dependency relationships between the class and the input variables are defined in a separate phase before the dependency relationships among the input variables are defined, and ABC-Miner+(2), in which the two types of dependency relationships in the Markov blanket classifier are discovered in a single integrated process. Empirical evaluations on 33 UCI benchmark datasets show that our extended algorithms outperform the original version in terms of predictive accuracy, model size and computational time. Moreover, they have shown a very competitive performance against other well-known classification algorithms in the literature.

This offers unprecedented information for archaeological research. To extract the maximum of useful archaeological information from it, however, a number of problems have to be solved. Major problems relate to data redundancy and the visualization of the large amount of data. This makes data mining approaches necessary, as well as efficient data visualization tools. Additional problems relate to data quality. Indeed, the upwelling electromagnetic radiation is recorded in small spectral bands that are only about ten nanometers wide. The signal received by the sensor is, thus quite low compared to sensor noise and possible atmospheric perturbations. The often small, instantaneous field of view (IFOV)-essential for archaeologically relevant imaging spectrometer datasets-further limits the useful signal stemming from the ground. The combination of both effects makes radiometric smoothing techniques mandatory. The present study details the functionality of a MATLAB (R)-based toolbox, called ARCTIS (ARChaeological Toolbox for Imaging Spectroscopy), for filtering, enhancing, analyzing, and visualizing imaging spectrometer datasets. The toolbox addresses the above-mentioned problems. Its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to allow non-experts in remote sensing to extract a wealth of information from imaging spectroscopy for archaeological research.

The method is intended to enhance understanding of travellers' behaviour during monitoring the smart card data. In order to supplement absent behavioural attributes in the smart card data, this study developed a data fusion methodology of smart card data with the person trip survey data with the naive Bayes probabilistic model. A model for estimating the trip purpose is derived from the person trip survey data. By using the model, trip purposes are estimated as supplementary behavioural attributes of the trips observed in the smart card data. The validation analysis showed that the proposed method successfully estimated the trip purposes in 86.2% of the validation data. The empirical data mining analysis showed that the proposed methodology can be applied to find and interpret the behavioural features observed in the smart card data which had been difficult to obtain from each independent dataset.

Thus the aim of this work was to visualize and quantify, through X-ray CT scan, the pores distribution in an oxidic Latosol submitted to a conservation management system with different gypsum doses. Three random trenches were dug lengthwise along the plant row in a very clayey gibbsitic dystrophic Red Latosol, subjected to the following gypsum levels: G0: absence of gypsum; G7: 7 Mg ha(-1) and G28: 28 Mg ha(-1) of additional gypsum, applied to the surface of the plant row. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in plexiglass tubes at depths of 0.20-0.34, 0.80-0.94 and 1.50-1.64 m after six years of coffee cultivation for quantification of 3D pores obtained by X-ray CT scan. The spatial variability of the soil structure was evaluated by semivariograms generated by 3D images in grayscale. Distribution of the detectable pore diameter was conducted by data mining. Statistical analyzes employed packages 'geoR' to semivariogram and 'randomForest' for data mining in R language. A greater spatial continuity of the pores occurred in the G7 at the three depths. The combined effects of the management system promoted a greater spatial variability of the soil structure in the G28 treatment. Based on geostatistical analyses, it can be infer that the adoption of the system under study promoted changes in the pore network in all directions (X, Y and Z), however with better pores continuity in the vertical direction( Z).

These methods can avoid the drawbacks of the conventional two-step approach and provide an efficient way. The prefix tree itself can be utilized as an index structure for finding the current support of an association rule. While all of the currently frequent itemsets are monitored by the prefix tree, a traversal stack is employed to efficiently enumerate all association rules. In the on-line environment, a user may be interested in finding those association rules whose antecedents or consequents are fixed as a specific itemset. For this purpose, two additional methods, namely Assoc-X and Assoc-Y, are introduced. Finally, the proposed methods are compared by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics.

Data mining is also of interest to research communities outside computer science as there is a need to harvest data from various domains incorporating domain-specific factors. These and other issues motivate PhD students to pursue core and applied research in data mining along with stream data management, big data, cloud computing, Web knowledge discovery, domain-specific techniques and more. A PhD forum on data mining provides an excellent platform for doctoral students to present imminent research and get valuable feedback from experts. In addition it gives them the opportunity to disseminate the results of their work among fellow researchers, and publish their novel contributions at an early stage. IEEE ICDM hosts such a PhD forum for doctoral students with a data mining focus. This article describes the content of the work presented at the ICDM 2013 PhD forum. It also gives a brief overview of the organization of this forum. The article thus provides a panorama of recent doctoral student work in data mining that would be of interest to researchers in database management and related areas.

One is to provide an appealing semiparametric framework in which to model unknown distributional shapes, as an alternative to, say, the kernel density method. The other is to use the mixture model to provide a probabilistic clustering of the data into g clusters corresponding to the g components in the mixture model. In both situations, there is the question of how many components to include in the normal mixture model. We review various methods that have been proposed to answer this question.

This article provides a survey of the available literature on a variant of pattern mining, namely erasable itemset (EI) mining. EI mining was first presented in 2009 and META is the first algorithm to solve this problem. Since then, a number of algorithms, such as VME, MERIT, and dMERIT+, have been proposed for mining EI. MEI, proposed in 2014, is currently the best algorithm for mining EIs. In this study, the META, VME, MERIT, dMERIT+, and MEI algorithms are described and compared in terms of mining time and memory usage.

This new scenario can be defined by means of those problems that cannot be effectively or efficiently addressed using the standard computing resources that we currently have. We must emphasize that Big Data does not just imply large volumes of data but also the necessity for scalability, i.e., to ensure a response in an acceptable elapsed time. When the scalability term is considered, usually traditional parallel-type solutions are contemplated, such as the Message Passing Interface or high performance and distributed Database Management Systems. Nowadays there is a new paradigm that has gained popularity over the latter due to the number of benefits it offers. This model is Cloud Computing, and among its main features we has to stress its elasticity in the use of computing resources and space, less management effort, and flexible costs. In this article, we provide an overview on the topic of Big Data, and how the current problem can be addressed from the perspective of Cloud Computing and its programming frameworks. In particular, we focus on those systems for large-scale analytics based on the MapReduce scheme and Hadoop, its open-source implementation. We identify several libraries and software projects that have been developed for aiding practitioners to address this new programming model. We also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of MapReduce, in contrast to the classical solutions in this field. Finally, we present a number of programming frameworks that have been proposed as an alternative to MapReduce, developed under the premise of solving the shortcomings of this model in certain scenarios and platforms.

A Security-enabled Grid System for MINDS Distributed Data Mining	JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING			English	Article						Distributed Data Mining; Security-enabled Grid; Access Control; MINDS		Interest has been increasing in mining information from a huge amount of data for various purposes such as business processes, scientific discoveries, and security. MINDS (Minnesota INtrusion Detection System) is a tool utilizing data mining techniques to identify both known and unknown network intrusions. While performing well with a high degree of accuracy in detecting intrusions, MINDS is intrinsically limited due to its centralized design. At the same time, there are increasing needs for coordinating multiple distributed sites to find correlations of suspicious events and for sharing distributed anomaly data in different administrative domains since network intrusions become more sophisticated and harder to identify by a single site analysis. In this work, we consider a distributed model of MINDS to eliminate the limitations that the current MINDS suffers from due to its centralized nature. We utilize Grid technologies to achieve the distribution of services. In addition, we develop security frameworks for authentication and access control since it is important to preserve privacy and sensitivity of data regardless of distribution. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we also present our experimental results conducted in a local testbed with four nodes and in a wide-area setting in PlanetLab with 20 nodes geographically dispersed.

In this paper, we demonstrate that regression trees, a popular data-analysis and data-mining technique, can be used to effectively reveal individuals' sensitive data. This problem, which we call a regression attack, has not been addressed in the data privacy literature, and existing privacy-preserving techniques are not appropriate in coping with this problem. We propose a new approach to counter regression attacks. To protect against privacy disclosure, our approach introduces a novel measure, called digression, which assesses the sensitive value disclosure risk in the process of building a regression tree model. Specifically, we develop an algorithm that uses the measure for pruning the tree to limit disclosure of sensitive data. We also propose a dynamic value-concatenation method for anonymizing data, which better preserves data utility than a user-defined generalization scheme commonly used in existing approaches. Our approach can be used for anonymizing both numeric and categorical data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world financial, economic, and healthcare data. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective in protecting data privacy while preserving data quality for research and analysis.

A predicted variable is the logarithm of the monthly sum of seismic energy induced in a longwall area. The set of predictors include seven quantitative and qualitative variables describing some mining and geological conditions and earlier seismicity in longwalls. Two machine learning methods have been used to develop the models: boosted regression trees and neural networks. Two types of model validation have been applied: on a random validation sample and on a time-based validation sample. The set of a few selected variables enabled nonlinear regression models to be built which gave relatively small prediction errors, taking the complex and strongly stochastic nature of the phenomenon into account. The article presents both the models of periodic forecasting for the following month as well as long-term forecasting.

Death Anxiety in Hospitalized End-of-Life Patients as Captured from a Structured Electronic Health Record Differences by Patient and Nurse Characteristics	RESEARCH IN GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING			English	Article							OLDER-ADULTS; ATTITUDES; CARE	The nursing outcomes of hospitalized patients whose plans of care include death anxiety, which is a diagnosis among patients at the end-of-life, are obscure. The authors of the current article applied data mining techniques to nursing plan-of-care data for patients diagnosed with death anxiety, as defined by North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International, from four different hospitals to examine nursing care outcomes and associated factors. Results indicate that <50% of patients met the expected outcome of comfortable death. Gerontology unit patients were more likely to meet the expected outcome than patients from other unit types, although results were not statistically significant. Younger patients (i.e., age < 65) had a lower chance of meeting the outcome compared with older patients (i.e., age = 65) (chi(2)(1) = 9.266, p < 0.004). Longer stays improved the chances of meeting the outcome (chi(2)(2) = 6.47, p < 0.04). Results indicate that death anxiety outcomes are suboptimal and suggest the need to better educate clinicians about diagnosing and treating death anxiety among patients who face the end-of-life transition.

Several algorithms have been proposed to uncover phosphorylation motifs, whereas the problem of efficiently discovering a set of significant motifs with sufficiently high coverage and non-redundancy still remains unsolved. Here we present a novel notion called conditional phosphorylation motifs. Through this new concept, the motifs whose over-expressiveness mainly benefits from its constituting parts can be filtered out effectively. To discover conditional phosphorylation motifs, we propose an algorithm called C-Motif for a non-redundant identification of significant phosphorylation motifs. C-Motif is implemented under the Apriori framework, and it tests the statistical significance together with the frequency of candidate motifs in a single stage. Experiments demonstrate that C-Motif outperforms some current algorithms such as MMFPh and Motif-All in terms of coverage and non-redundancy of the results and efficiency of the execution. The source code of C-Motif is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmotif/.

The first analytical expression to estimate photometric redshifts suggested by a machine	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; catalogues; galaxies: distances and redshifts	CATALOG; GALAXIES	We report the first analytical expression purely constructed by a machine to determine photometric redshifts (z(phot)) of galaxies. A simple and reliable functional form is derived using 41 214 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10) spectroscopic sample. The method automatically dropped the u and z bands, relying only on g, r and i for the final solution. Applying this expression to other 1417 181 SDSS-DR10 galaxies, with measured spectroscopic redshifts (z(spec)), we achieved a mean <(z(phot) - z(spec))/(1 + z(spec))> less than or similar to 0.0086 and a scatter sigma(z(phot-zspec))/(1+ (zspec)) less than or similar to 0.045 when averaged up to z less than or similar to 1.0. The method was also applied to the PHAT0 data set, confirming the competitiveness of our results when faced with other methods from the literature. This is the first use of symbolic regression in cosmology, representing a leap forward in astronomy-data-mining connection.

Data mining using a microRNA array database suggested that let-7d microRNA may be associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) malignant progression. Here, we performed further analyses to determine whether let-7d is functionally linked to RCC malignancy. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the level of mature let-7d in RCC clinical specimens and its correlation with clinicopathological data. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to characterize the stroma of RCC. Let-7d overexpressing RCC cell lines combined with mouse models bearing cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts were used to assess the functional role of let-7d in vitro and in vivo. Results: Downregulation of let-7d in clinical RCC samples was associated with advanced tumor grade and T stage and increased vascular invasion. An inverse relationship between let-7d expression and macrophage infiltration was found in clinical RCC samples. Functional studies indicated that ectopic expression of let-7d significantly inhibited RCC cell proliferation, migration, and peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) recruitment in vitro, as well as tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor macrophage infiltration in vivo. In silico analysis and subsequent experimental validation confirmed collagen, type III, alpha 1 (COL3A1) and C-C subfamily chemokine member CCL7 as direct let-7d target genes. The addition of COL3A1 and CCL7 counteracted the inhibitory effects of let-7d on RCC cell proliferation, migration, and PBMC recruitment. The inhibition of let-7d increased cell proliferation, migration, and PBMC recruitment by the enhanced expression of COL3A1 and CCL7 genes in vitro. The mRNA levels of COL3A1 and CCL7 were inversely correlated with let-7d level in RCC clinical specimens. Conclusions: These results suggest that let-7d may suppress RCC growth, metastasis, and tumor macrophage infiltration at least partially through targeting COL3A1 and CCL7.

Different procedures have been proposed to detect such interactions. Which approach is best for explaining the risk of developing disease is unclear. This study sought to elucidate the genetic interaction landscape in candidate genes for MDD by conducting a SNP-SNP interaction analysis using an exhaustive search through 3,704 SNP-markers in 1,732 cases and 1,783 controls provided from the GAIN MDD study. We used three different methods to detect interactions, two logistic regressions models (multiplicative and additive) and one data mining and machine learning (MDR) approach. Results: Although none of the interaction survived correction for multiple comparisons, the results provide important information for future genetic interaction studies in complex disorders. Among the 0.5% most significant observations, none had been reported previously for risk to MDD. Within this group of interactions, less than 0.03% would have been detectable based on main effect approach or an a priori algorithm. We evaluated correlations among the three different models and conclude that all three algorithms detected the same interactions to a low degree. Although the top interactions had a surprisingly large effect size for MDD (e. g. additive dominant model P-uncorrected = 9.10E-9 with attributable proportion (AP) value = 0.58 and multiplicative recessive model with P-uncorrected = 6.95E-5 with odds ratio (OR estimated from beta 3) value = 4.99) the area under the curve (AUC) estimates were low (< 0.54). Moreover, the population attributable fraction (PAF) estimates were also low (< 0.15). Conclusions: We conclude that the top interactions on their own did not explain much of the genetic variance of MDD. The different statistical interaction methods we used in the present study did not identify the same pairs of interacting markers. Genetic interaction studies may uncover previously unsuspected effects that could provide novel insights into MDD risk, but much larger sample sizes are needed before this strategy can be powerfully applied.

We exploit fine-grained drug related adverse event information extracted by text mining from electronic medical records (EMRs) to stratify patients based on their adverse events and to determine adverse event co-occurrences. Methods: We analyzed the similarity of adverse event profiles of 2347 patients extracted from EMRs from a mental health center in Denmark. The patients were clustered based on their adverse event profiles and the similarities were presented as a network. The set of adverse events in each main patient cluster was evaluated. Co-occurrences of adverse events in patients (p-value < 0.01) were identified and presented as well. Results: We found that each cluster of patients typically had a most distinguishing adverse event. Examination of the co-occurrences of adverse events in patients led to the identification of potentially interesting adverse event correlations that may be further investigated as well as provide further patient stratification opportunities. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach in pharmacovigilance to stratify patients based on fine-grained adverse event profiles, which also makes it possible to identify adverse event correlations. Used on larger data sets, this data-driven method has the potential to reveal unknown patterns concerning adverse event occurrences.

It is used to compress a database into a tree structure which stores only large items. When data are modified, it, however, needs to process all transactions in a batch way. In the past, the prelarge-tree structure was proposed to incrementally mine association rules efficiently. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to maintain this structure when records in an original database are modified. The proposed maintenance algorithm is based on the pre-large concepts, which are defined by a lower support threshold and an upper support threshold. Due to the pruning properties of pre-large concepts, the proposed approach can reduce the rescan number of an original database when records are modified. It can thus obtain good execution performance for pre-large tree maintenance, especially when each time a small number of records are modified. Although experimental results show that the proposed prelarge-tree maintenance algorithm has good performance for handling modified records, the proposed algorithm needs to maintain nodes of pre-large items in the tree structure. This is the additional overhead, which is a trade-off between execution time and tree complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A taxonomy is used to aggregate data items into higher-level concepts and to discover frequent recurrences among data items at different granularity levels. However, since traditional high-level itemsets may also represent the knowledge covered by their lower-level frequent descendant itemsets, the expressiveness of high-level itemsets can be rather limited. To overcome this issue, this article proposes two novel itemset types, called Expressive Generalized Itemset (EGI) and Maximal Expressive Generalized Itemset (Max-EGI), in which the frequency of occurrence of a high-level itemset is evaluated only on the portion of data not yet covered by any of its frequent descendants. Specifically, EGI s represent, at a high level of abstraction, the knowledge associated with sets of infrequent itemsets, while Max-EGIs compactly represent all the infrequent descendants of a generalized itemset. Furthermore, we also propose an algorithm to discover Max-EGIs at the top of the traditionally mined itemsets. Experiments, performed on both real and synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we study the influence maximization problem of finding a small subset of nodes in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. We propose a novel information diffusion model CTMC-ICM, which introduces the theory of Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) into the Independent Cascade Model (ICM). Furthermore, we propose a new ranking metric named SpreadRank generalized by the new information propagation model CTMC-ICM. We experimentally demonstrate the new ranking method that can, in general, extract nontrivial nodes as an influential node set that maximizes the spread of information in a social network and is more efficient than a distance-based centrality.

This paper proposes a CP-tree (Compressible-prefix tree) that can be effectively employed in finding frequent itemsets over an online data stream. Unlike a prefix tree, a node of a CP-tree can maintain a concise synopsis that can be used to trace the supports of several itemsets together. As the number of itemsets that are traced by a node of a CP-tree is increased, the size of a CP-tree becomes smaller. However, the result of a CP-tree becomes less accurate since the estimated supports of those itemsets that are traced together by a node of a CP-tree may contain possible false positive or negative errors. Based on this characteristic, the size of a CP-tree can be controlled by merging or splitting the nodes of a CP-tree, which allows the utilization of a confined memory space as much as possible. Therefore, the accuracy of a CP-tree is maximized at all times for a confined memory space. Furthermore, a CP-tree can trace a concise set of representative frequent itemsets that can collectively represent the set of original frequent itemsets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A fast, accurate, and robust resolution of the Colebrook-White equation is, in particular, necessary for scientific intensive computations. In this study, the performance of some artificial intelligence approaches, including gene expression programming (GEP), which is a variant of genetic programming (GP); adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS); and artificial neural network (ANN) has been compared to the M5 model tree, which is a data mining technique and, to most available approximations, is based on root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R). Results show that Serghides and Buzzelli approximations with RMSE (0.00002), MAE (0.00001), and R (0.99999) values had the best performances. Among the data mining and artificial intelligence approaches, the GEP with RMSE (0.00032), MAE (0.00026), and R (0.99953) values performed better. However, all 20 explicit approximations except Wood, Churchill (full range of turbulence including laminar regime) and Rau and Kumar estimated the friction factor more accurately than the GEP.

The tin atom is penta-coordinated to assume trigonal-bipyramidal geometry. Using in silico derived parameters; the objective of our study is to design and synthesize promiscuous antibacterials potent enough to combat resistance. Among various synthesized organotin (IV) complexes, compound 5 was found as potent antibacterial agent against various bacterial strains. Further lead optimization of drug-like properties was evaluated through in silico predictions. Data mining and computational analysis were utilized to derive compound promiscuity phenomenon to avoid drug attrition rate in designing antibacterials. Xanthine oxidase and human glucose-6-phosphatase were found as only true positive off-target hits by ChEMBL database and others utilizing similarity ensemble approach. Propensity towards alpha-3 receptor, human macrophage migration factor and thiazolidinedione were found as false positive off targets with E-value = > 10(-4) for compound 1, 3 and 4. Further, displaying positive drug-drug interaction of compound 1 as uricosuric was validated by all databases and docked protein targets with sequence similarity and compositional matrix alignment via BLAST software. Promiscuity of the compound 5 was further confirmed by in silico binding to different antibacterial targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Su, XQ; Hu, JQ; Huang, S; Ning, K				Su, Xiaoquan; Hu, Jianqiang; Huang, Shi; Ning, Kang			Rapid comparison and correlation analysis among massive number of microbial community samples based on MDV data model	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORE GUT MICROBIOME; SOIL; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; HUMANS; TOOLS	The research in microbial communities would potentially impact a vast number of applications in "bio"-related disciplines. Large-scale analyses became a clear trend in microbial community studies, thus it is increasingly important to perform efficient and in-depth data mining for insightful biological principles from large number of samples. However, as microbial communities are from different sources and of different structures, comparison and data-mining from large number of samples become quite difficult. In this work, we have proposed a data model to represent large-scale comparison of microbial community samples, namely the "Multi-Dimensional View" data model (the MDV model) that should at least include 3 aspects: samples profile (S), taxa profile (T) and meta-data profile (V). We have also proposed a method for rapid data analysis based on the MDV model and applied it on the case studies with samples from various environmental conditions. Results have shown that though sampling environments usually define key variables, the analysis could detect bio-makers and even subtle variables based on large number of samples, which might be used to discover novel principles that drive the development of communities.

However, it is still a challenging task to perform attribute reduction on massive data. During the process of attribute reduction on massive data, the key to improving the reduction efficiency is the effective computation of equivalence classes and attribute significance. Aiming at this problem, we propose several parallel attribute reduction algorithms in this paper. Specifically, we design a novel structure of < key, value > pair to speed up the computation of equivalence classes and attribute significance and parallelize the traditional attribute reduction process based on MapReduce mechanism. The different parallelization strategies of attribute reduction are also compared and analyzed from the theoretic view. Abundant experimental results demonstrate the proposed parallel attribute reduction algorithms can perform efficiently and scale well on massive data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We extract the image features of hail echo areas and rainstorm echo areas from radar reflectivity images. By analyzing both the differences in single feature between hail and rainstorm and the classified complementarity among different features, we determine the effective image features, including the intensity and texture features, to identify the hail and rainstorm. The hail and rainstorm objective recognition model can be established through the data mining of the extracted sample features and sounding data by using the Rough Set Theory. Through the test and identification of the 362 test samples, the hit ratio of hail reaches 93.29% and the hit ratio of rainstorm reaches 89.07%. The false alarm ratios of hail and rainstorms can be also at a low level. Compared with those from the PUP system, the experimental results from the present system show that it has a good effect to identify and classify hail and rainstorm by using the radar reflectivity image features.

Diffusion maps and other nonlinear data-mining techniques provide powerful tools to visualize the distribution of structures in conformation space. The resulting low-dimensional representations help in partitioning conformation space, and in constructing Markov state models that capture the conformational dynamics. In an initial step, we use diffusion maps to reduce the dimensionality of the conformational dynamics of Ala5. The resulting pretreated data are then used in a clustering step. The identified clusters show excellent overlap with clusters obtained previously by using the backbone dihedral angles as input, with small-but nontrivial-differences reflecting torsional degrees of freedom ignored in the earlier approach. We then construct a Markov state model describing the conformational dynamics in terms of a discrete-time random walk between the clusters. We show that by combining fuzzy C-means clustering with a transition-based assignment of states, we can construct robust Markov state models. This state-assignment procedure suppresses short-time memory effects that result from the non-Markovianity of the dynamics projected onto the space of clusters. In a comparison with previous work, we demonstrate how manifold learning techniques may complement and enhance informed intuition commonly used to construct reduced descriptions of the dynamics in molecular conformation space.

J	Siniscalchi, SM; Svendsen, T; Lee, CH				Siniscalchi, Sabato Marco; Svendsen, Torbjorn; Lee, Chin-Hui			An artificial neural network approach to automatic speech processing	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Deep neural networks; Acoustic feature modeling; Connectionist automatic speech recognition; Automatic language recognition	LANGUAGE IDENTIFICATION; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; MARKOV-CHAINS; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; PREDICTION; MODEL; NETS; ASR	An artificial neural network (ANN) is a powerful mathematical framework used to either model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or find patterns in data. It is based on an interconnected group of artificial neurons, and it employs a connectionist approach to computation when processing information. ANNs have been successfully used for a great variety of applications, such as decision making, quantum chemistry, radar systems, face identification, gesture recognition, handwritten text recognition, medical diagnosis, financial applications, robotics, data mining, and e-spam filtering. In the speech community, neural architectures have been used since the beginning of the 1980s, and ANNs have been proven useful to accomplish several speech processing tasks, e.g., to extract linguistically motivated features, to perform speech detection, and to generate local scores to be used for different goals. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use of ANNs for speech applications due to a major advance made in pre-training the weights in deep neural networks (DNNs). It seems that a new trend to move the speech technology forward through the use of NNs has begun, and it can therefore be instructive to review key ANN applications to automatic speech processing. In this paper, several ANN-based applications for speech processing will be presented, ranging from speech attribute extraction to phoneme estimation and/or classification. Furthermore, it will be shown that ANNs play a key role in several important speech applications, such as large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and automatic language recognition. The goal of the paper is to summarize chief ANN approaches to speech processing using the experience gathered in the last seven years in our laboratories. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compositional complexity of the mitochondrial proteome of a unicellular eukaryote (Acanthamoeba castellanii, supergroup Amoebozoa) rivals that of animals, fungi, and plants	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Mitochondria; Proteome; Evolution; Protist; Tandem mass spectrometry	PENTATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT PROTEINS; MALATE SYNTHASE/ISOCITRATE LYASE; ALGA CYANIDIOSCHYZON-MEROLAE; ORGANELLAR DNA-POLYMERASES; GLYOXYLATE CYCLE ENZYMES; HORIZONTAL GENE-TRANSFER; RNA EDITING FACTORS; 5S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; EUGLENA-GRACILIS; TARGETING SEQUENCES	We present a combined proteomic and bioinformatic investigation of mitochondrial proteins from the amoeboid protist Acanthamoeba castellanii, the first such comprehensive investigation in a free-living member of the supergroup Amoebozoa. This protist was chosen both for its phylogenetic position (as a sister to animals and fungi) and its ecological ubiquity and physiological flexibility. We report 1033 A. castellanii mitochondrial protein sequences, 709 supported by mass spectrometry data (676 nucleus-encoded and 33 mitochondrion-encoded), including two previously unannotated mtDNA-encoded proteins, which we identify as highly divergent mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Other notable findings include duplicate proteins for all of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle which, along with the identification of a mitochondrial malate synthase-isocitrate lyase fusion protein, suggests the interesting possibility that the glyoxylate cycle operates in A. castellanii mitochondria. Additionally, the A. castellanii genome encodes an unusually high number (at least 29) of mitochondrion-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, organellar RNA metabolism factors in other organisms. We discuss several key mitochondrial pathways, including DNA replication, transcription and translation, protein degradation, protein import and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, highlighting similarities and differences in these pathways in other eukaryotes. In compositional and functional complexity, the mitochondrial proteome of A. castellanii rivals that of multicellular eukaryotes. Biological significance Comprehensive proteomic surveys of mitochondria have been undertaken in a limited number of predominantly multicellular eukcaryotes. This phylogenetically narrow perspective constrains and biases our insights into mitochondrial function and evolution, as it neglects protists, which account for most of the evolutionary and functional diversity within eukaryotes. We report here the first comprehensive investigation of the mitochondrial proteome in a member (A. castellanii) of the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa. Through a combination of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and in silico data mining, we have retrieved 1033 candidate mitochondrial protein sequences, 709 having MS support. These data were used to reconstruct the metabolic pathways and protein complexes of A. castellanii mitochondria, and were integrated with data from other characterized mitochondrial proteomes to augment our understanding of mitochondrial proteome evolution. Our results demonstrate the power of combining direct proteomic and bioinformatic approaches in the discovery of novel mitochondrial proteins, both nucleus-encoded and mitochondrion-encoded, and highlight the compositional complexity of the A. castellanii mitochondrial proteome, which rivals that of animals, fungi and plants.

Proteomic study reveals a functional network of cancer markers in the G1-Stage of the breast cancer cell cycle	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Cell cycle; Cancer markers; Proteomics; Mass spectrometry	MOLECULAR-BASIS; PROLIFERATION; APOPTOSIS; ADHESION; POINT; GENE	Background: Cancer cells are characterized by a deregulated cell cycle that facilitates abnormal proliferation by allowing cells to by-pass tightly regulated molecular checkpoints such as the G1/S restriction point. To facilitate early diagnosis and the identification of new drug targets, current research efforts focus on studies that could lead to the development of protein panels that collectively can improve the effectiveness of our response to the detection of a life-threatening disease. Methods: Estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells were cultured and arrested by serum deprivation in the G1-stage of the cell cycle, and fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The protein extracts were trypsinized and analyzed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (MS), and the data were interpreted with the Thermo Electron Bioworks software. Biological characterization of the data, selection of cancer markers, and identification of protein interaction networks was accomplished with a combination of bioinformatics tools provided by GoMiner, DAVID and STRING. Results: The objective of this work was to explore via MS proteomic profiling technologies and bioinformatics data mining whether randomly identified cancer markers can be associated with the G1-stage of the cell cycle, i.e., the stage in which cancer cells differ most from normal cells, and whether any functional networks can be identified between these markers and placed in the broader context of cell regulatory pathways. The study enabled the identification of over 2000 proteins and 153 cancer markers, and revealed for the first time that the G1-stage of the cell cycle is not only a rich source of cancer markers, but also a host to an intricate network of functional relationships within the majority of these markers. Three major clusters of interacting proteins emerged: (a) signaling, (b) DNA repair, and (c) oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusions: The identification of cancer marker regulatory components that act not alone, but within networks, represents an invaluable resource for elucidating the moxlecular mechanisms that govern the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, as well as for catalyzing the development of protein panels with biomarker and drug target potential, screening tests with improved sensitivity and specificity, and novel cancer therapies aimed at pursuing multiple drug targets.

A global data-mining exercise on the biomedical literature can establish the phenotypic profile of genes with respect to their connection to disease phenotypes. The importance of protein-protein interaction networks in the genetic heterogeneity of common diseases or complex traits is becoming increasingly recognized. Thus, the development of a network-based approach combined with phenotypic profiling would be useful for disease gene prioritization. Results: We developed a random-set scoring model and implemented it to quantify phenotype relevance in a network-based disease gene-prioritization approach. We validated our approach based on different gene phenotypic profiles, which were generated from PubMed abstracts, OMIM, and GeneRIF records. We also investigated the validity of several vocabulary filters and different likelihood thresholds for predicted protein-protein interactions in terms of their effect on the network-based gene-prioritization approach, which relies on text-mining of the phenotype data. Our method demonstrated good precision and sensitivity compared with those of two alternative complex-based prioritization approaches. We then conducted a global ranking of all human genes according to their relevance to a range of human diseases. The resulting accurate ranking of known causal genes supported the reliability of our approach. Moreover, these data suggest many promising novel candidate genes for human disorders that have a complex mode of inheritance. Conclusion: We have implemented and validated a network-based approach to prioritize genes for human diseases based on their phenotypic profile. We have devised a powerful and transparent tool to identify and rank candidate genes. Our global gene prioritization provides a unique resource for the biological interpretation of data from genome-wide association studies, and will help in the understanding of how the associated genetic variants influence disease or quantitative phenotypes.

Licorice is described as 'National Venerable Master' in Chinese medicine and plays paradoxical roles, i.e. detoxification/strengthen efficacy and inducing/enhancing toxicity. Therefore, licorice was called "Two-Face" herb in this paper. The aim of this study is to discuss the paradoxical roles and the perspective usage of this "Two-Face" herb using data mining and frequency analysis. More than 96,000 prescriptions from Chinese Formulae Database were selected. The frequency and the prescription patterns were analyzed using Microsoft SQL Server 2000. Data mining methods (frequent itemsets) were used to analyze the regular patterns and compatibility laws of the constituent herbs in the selected prescriptions. The result showed that licorice (Radix glycyrrhizae) was the most frequently used herb in Chinese Formulae Database, other frequently used herbs including Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang gui), Radix et rhizoma ginseng (Ren shen), etc. Toxic herbs such as Radix aconiti lateralis praeparata (Fu zi), Rhizoma pinelliae (Ban xia) and Cinnabaris (Zhu sha) are top 3 herbs that most frequently used in combination with licorice. Radix et rhizoma ginseng (Ren shen), Poria (Fu ling), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Dang gui) are top 3 nontoxic herbs that most frequently used in combination with licorice. Moreover, Licorice was seldom used with sargassum (Hai Zao), Herba Cirsii Japonici (Da Ji), Euphorbia kansui (Gan Sui) and Flos genkwa (Yuan Hua), which proved the description of contradictory effect of Radix glycyrrhizae and these herbs as recorded in Chinese medicine theory. This study showed the principle pattern of Chinese herbal drugs used in combination with licorice or not. The principle patterns and special compatibility laws reported here could be useful and instructive for scientific usage of licorice in clinic application. Further pharmacological and chemical researches are needed to evaluate the efficacy and the combination pattern of these Chinese herbs.

FRANCHETII; ANGULATA; STEROIDS	Physalins, uniquely discovered from genus physalis, showed significant bioactivities in many aspects. It is therefore very important for the exploration of natural resources rich of physalins. However, there is no efficient approach for rapid discovery and identification of this class of compounds due to their structural complexity. To address the issue, the fragmentation pathways and correspondingly fragmentation rules of physalins in negative MS/MS mode were thoroughly investigated in this study using seven physalin standards. As a result, diagnostic ions for the rapid screening of physalins and classification of different types of physalins were determined based on their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. On top of that, an integrated approach using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS together with a novel three-step data mining strategy was developed for the systematic analysis of physalins in complex samples. Consequently, 46 physalins including 20 novel ones were efficiently discovered and identified from the crude extracts of Ph. alkekengi calyx. The present study laid a foundation for future study of different parts of Ph. alkekengi and other physalis species with regard to rapid discovery of novel physalins. In addition, this study provided a base for establishing a quality control method of the raw materials of Ph. alkekengi according to the profile of physalins. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bao, JP; Yuan, RY; Bao, Z				Bao, Junpeng; Yuan, Ruiyu; Bao, Zhe			An improved alignment-free model for dna sequence similarity metric	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						DNA sequence similarity; Clustering; Alignment-free model; Classifications of nucleotide bases	WORD FREQUENCIES; PROTEIN; SEARCH; SETS	Background: DNA Clustering is an important technology to automatically find the inherent relationships on a large scale of DNA sequences. But the DNA clustering quality can still be improved greatly. The DNA sequences similarity metric is one of the key points of clustering. The alignment-free methodology is a very popular way to calculate DNA sequence similarity. It normally converts a sequence into a feature space based on words' probability distribution rather than directly matches strings. Existing alignment-free models, e. g. k-tuple, merely employ word frequency information and ignore many types of useful information contained in the DNA sequence, such as classifications of nucleotide bases, position and the like. It is believed that the better data mining results can be achieved with compounded information. Therefore, we present a new alignment-free model that employs compounded information to improve the DNA clustering quality. Results: This paper proposes a Category-Position-Frequency (CPF) model, which utilizes the word frequency, position and classification information of nucleotide bases from DNA sequences. The CPF model converts a DNA sequence into three sequences according to the categories of nucleotide bases, and then yields a 12-dimension feature vector. The feature values are computed by an entropy based model that takes both local word frequency and position information into account. We conduct DNA clustering experiments on several datasets and compare with some mainstream alignment-free models for evaluation, including k-tuple, DMk, TSM, AMI and CV. The experiments show that CPF model is superior to other models in terms of the clustering results and optimal settings. Conclusions: The following conclusions can be drawn from the experiments. (1) The hybrid information model is better than the model based on word frequency only. (2) For DNA sequences no more than 5000 characters, the preferred size of sliding windows for CPF is two which provides a great advantage to promote system performance. (3) The CPF model is able to obtain an efficient stable performance and broad generalization.

Some users do not develop dependence or other problems, whereas others do. Many factors are associated with the occurrence of cannabis-related disorders. This makes it difficult to identify key risk factors and markers to profile at-risk cannabis users using traditional hypothesis-driven approaches. Therefore, the use of a data-mining technique called binary recursive partitioning is demonstrated in this study by creating a classification tree to profile at-risk users. Methods: 59 variables on cannabis use and drug market experiences were extracted from an internet-based survey dataset collected in four European countries (Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands and Sweden), n = 2617. These 59 potential predictors of problematic cannabis use were used to partition individual respondents into subgroups with low and high risk of having a cannabis use disorder, based on their responses on the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test. Both a generic model for the four countries combined and four country-specific models were constructed. Results: Of the 59 variables included in the first analysis step, only three variables were required to construct a generic partitioning model to classify high risk cannabis users with 65-73% accuracy. Based on the generic model for the four countries combined, the highest risk for cannabis use disorder is seen in participants reporting a cannabis use on more than 200 days in the last 12 months. In comparison to the generic model, the country-specific models led to modest, nonsignificant improvements in classification accuracy, with an exception for Italy (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Using recursive partitioning, it is feasible to construct classification trees based on only a few variables with acceptable performance to classify cannabis users into groups with low or high risk of meeting criteria for cannabis use disorder. The number of cannabis use days in the last 12 months is the most relevant variable. The identified variables may be considered for use in future screeners for cannabis use disorders.

Researchers need to efficiently and effectively collaborate and make decisions by meaningfully assembling, mining and analyzing available large-scale volumes of complex multi-faceted data residing in different sources. In line with related research directives revealing that, in spite of the recent advances in data mining and computational analysis, humans can easily detect patterns which computer algorithms may have difficulty in finding, this paper reports on the practical use of an innovative web-based collaboration support platform in a biomedical research context. Arguing that dealing with data-intensive and cognitively complex settings is not a technical problem alone, the proposed platform adopts a hybrid approach that builds on the synergy between machine and human intelligence to facilitate the underlying sense-making and decision making processes. User experience shows that the platform enables more informed and quicker decisions, by displaying the aggregated information according to their needs, while also exploiting the associated human intelligence.

This paper presents an empirical case study on the mining of association rules in tourist attraction visits, registered for 15 days by the Bluetooth tracking methodology. This way, this paper aims to be a methodological contribution to the field of spatiotemporal tourism behavior research by demonstrating the potential of ad-hoc sensing networks in the non-participatory measurement of small-scale movements. An extensive filtering procedure is followed by an exploratory analysis, analyzing the discovered associations for different visitor segments and additionally visualizing them in 'visit pattern maps'. Despite the limited duration of the tracking period, we were able to discover interesting associations and further identified a tendency of visitors to rarely combine visits in the center with visits outside of the city center. We conclude by discussing both the potential of the employed methodology as well as its further issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the former aims at making accurate predictions after deeming an underlying structure in data-which requires the presence of a teacher during the learning phase-the latter aims at discovering regular-occurring patterns beneath the data without making any a priori assumptions concerning their underlying structure. The pure supervised model can construct a very accurate predictive model from data streams. However, in many real-world problems this paradigm may be ill-suited due to (1) the dearth of training examples and (2) the costs of labeling the required information to train the system. A sound use case of this concern is found when defining data replication and partitioning policies to store data emerged in the Smart Grids domain in order to adapt electric networks to current application demands (e.g., real time consumption, network self adapting). As opposed to classic electrical architectures, Smart Grids encompass a fully distributed scheme with several diverse data generation sources. Current data storage and replication systems fail at both coping with such overwhelming amount of heterogeneous data and at satisfying the stringent requirements posed by this technology (i.e., dynamic nature of the physical resources, continuous flow of information and autonomous behavior demands). The purpose of this paper is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to enhance the performance of data storage in Smart Grids. More specifically we have improved the eXtended Classifier System for Clustering (XCSc) algorithm to present a hybrid system that mixes data replication and partitioning policies by means of an online clustering approach. Conducted experiments show that the proposed system outperforms previous proposals and truly fits with the Smart Grid premises. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Website phishing can be described as mimicking a trusted website to obtain sensitive information from online users such as usernames and passwords. Black lists, white lists and the utilisation of search methods are examples of solutions to minimise the risk of this problem. One intelligent approach based on data mining called Associative Classification (AC) seems a potential solution that may effectively detect phishing websites with high accuracy. According to experimental studies, AC often extracts classifiers containing simple "If-Then" rules with a high degree of predictive accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the problem of website phishing using a developed AC method called Multi-label Classifier based Associative Classification (MCAC) to seek its applicability to the phishing problem. We also want to identify features that distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones. In addition, we survey intelligent approaches used to handle the phishing problem. Experimental results using real data collected from different sources show that AC particularly MCAC detects phishing websites with higher accuracy than other intelligent algorithms. Further, MCAC generates new hidden knowledge (rules) that other algorithms are unable to find and this has improved its classifiers predictive performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It partitions a set of objects in such a manner that objects in the same clusters are more similar to each another than objects in the different cluster according to certain predefined criteria. K-means is simple yet an efficient method used in data clustering. However, K-means has a tendency to converge to local optima and depends on initial value of cluster centers. In the past, many heuristic algorithms have been introduced to overcome this local optima problem. Nevertheless, these algorithms too suffer several short-comings. In this paper, we present an efficient hybrid evolutionary data clustering algorithm referred to as K-MCI, whereby, we combine K-means with modified cohort intelligence. Our proposed algorithm is tested on several standard data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository and its performance is compared with other well-known algorithms such as K-means, K-means++, cohort intelligence (CI), modified cohort intelligence (MCI), genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), ant colony optimization (ACO), honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The simulation results are very promising in the terms of quality of solution and convergence speed of algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The DWT enables an efficient multiresolution description of SAR images due to its geometric and stochastic features. A 2-D DWT, a real 2-D oriented dual tree wavelet transform (2-D RODTWT) and an oriented dual tree complex wavelet transform (2-D ODTCWT) were used for the estimation of subband features. First and second moments, entropy, coding gain, and fractal dimension were used for the nonparametric approach. A parametric approach considers a Gauss Markov Random Field model for feature extraction. A database with 2000 images representing 20 different classes with 100 images per class was used for classification efficiency assessment. Several SAR scenes were divided into small patches with dimension of 200 x 200 pixels. 10% and 20% of the test images per class were used during the learning stage. Supervised learning using a support vector machine was used for all experiments. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods had superior performances compared with (GLCM) and log comulants of Fourier transform. Amongst the proposed methods, the nonparametric features within oriented dual tree complex wavelet transform gave the best results for classes when categorizing SAR images.

Despite this perception, there is limited scientific evidence and poor statistical support of this assumption. This study aims at testing whether there is such a cause-effect relationship between A&D testing and post-accident reduction, and how to quantify it. The methodology applied data-mining techniques together with classical statistics hypothesis testing. It covers a wide range of data concerning accidents, alcohol and drug tests, biographical and occupational records of a large railway transportation company in Portugal, for a period of 51/2 years. Results give sound statistical evidence of individual's accident risk decrease after being tested, by quantifying the relations between A&D testing and post-testing accidents. Results also estimate the optimal testing frequency that balances testing costs and accident reduction. Optimum rates of tests per year per worker are in the ranges ]0.5-1.0] in white-collars and professions at large, and ]0.0-0.5] in operations/technical personnel. The fraction of accident victims that are prevented by the application of optimal frequencies are around 59% for workers onboard trains, 72% for those working near trains, and 85% for white-collars. Testing at the optimal frequency generates net savings of at least 15:1, in onboard personnel. In conclusion, testing for alcohol and drugs at workplace, at random and by surprise, has a statistically significant preventive effect in overall professions, but is stronger within white-collars.

Development of ternary diagrams for estimating water retention properties using geostatistical approaches	GEODERMA			English	Article						Field capacity; Geostatistics; Soil texture; Pedotransfer functions; Wilting point	CLASS PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SOIL HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; BULK-DENSITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; TEXTURE; MODEL; IRRIGATION; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION	Most pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have adopted soil texture information as the main predictor to estimate soil hydraulic properties, whether inputs are defined in terms of the relative proportion of different grain size particles or texture-based classifications. The objective of this study was to develop ternary diagrams for estimating soil water retention (theta) at -33 and -1500 kPa matric potentials, corresponding to the field capacity and wilting point, respectively, from particle size distribution using two geostatistical approaches. The texture triangle was divided into a 1% grid of soil texture composition resulting in 4332 different soil textures. Measured soil water retention values determined in 742 soil horizons/layers located in Portugal were then used to develop and validate the hydraulic ternary diagrams. The development subset included two-thirds of the data, and the validation subset the remaining samples. The measured soil water content values were displayed in the ternary diagram according to the coordinates given by the particles size distribution determined in the same soil samples. The volumetric water content values were then predicted for the entire ternary diagram using two different geostatistical interpolation algorithms (ordinary kriging and the empirical best linear unbiased predictor). Uncertainty analysis resulted in a root mean square error below 0.040 and 0.034 cm(3) cm(-3) when comparing the interpolated water contents at -33 and -1500 kPa matric potential values, respectively, with the measured ones included in the validation dataset. The estimation variance calculated with both methods was also considered to access the uncertainty of the predictions. The available water content of Portuguese soils was then derived from theta(-33) (kPa) and theta(-1500) (kPa) ternary diagrams developed with both approaches. The hydraulic ternary diagrams may thus serve as simplified tools for estimating water retention properties from particle size distribution and eventually serve as an alternative to the traditional statistical regression and data mining techniques used to derive PTFs.

For incomplete data these approximations are not unique. In this paper we investigate properties of three well-known generalizations of approximations: singleton, subset and concept. These approximations were recently further generalized as to include an additional parameter alpha, interpreted as a probability. In this paper we report novel properties of singleton, subset and concept probabilistic approximations. Additionally, we validated such approximations experimentally. Our main objective was to test which of the singleton, subset and concept probabilistic approximations are the most useful for data mining. Our conclusion is that, for a given incomplete data set, all three approaches should be applied and the best approach should be selected as a result often-fold cross validation. Finally, we conducted experiments on complexity of rule sets and the total number of singleton, subset and concept approximations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To achieve the noise reduction effect in boundary image matching, we exploit the moving average transform of time-series matching. We are motivated by a simple intuition that the moving average transform might reduce the noise of boundary images as well as that of time-series data. To confirm this intuition, we first propose a new notion of k-order image matching, which applies the moving average transform to boundary image matching. A boundary image can be represented as a sequence in the time-series domain, and our k-order image matching identifies similar boundary images in this time-series domain by comparing the k-moving average transformed sequences. We then propose an index-based method that efficiently performs k-order image matching on a large image database, and formally prove its correctness. We also formally analyze the relationship of orders and their matching results and present an interactive approach of controlling the noise reduction effect. Experimental results show that our k-order image matching exploits the noise reduction effect well, and our index-based method outperforms the sequential scan by one or two orders of magnitude. These results indicate that our k-order image matching and its index-based solution provide a very practical way of realizing the noise control boundary image matching. To our best knowledge, the proposed interactive approach for large-scale image databases is the first attempt to solve the noise control problem in the time-series domain rather than the image domain by exploiting the efficient time-series matching techniques. Thus, our approach can be widely used in removing other types of distortions in image matching areas.

It is difficult to decide the uncertainty relationship among nodes since traditional models are not meaningful in uncertain networks, and the inherent computational complexity of the problems with uncertainty is always intractable. In this paper, we study how to capture uncertainty in networks by transforming a series of snapshots of a network to an uncertain graph. A novel sampling scheme is also proposed which enables the development of efficient algorithms to measure uncertainty in networks. Considering the practical aspects of neighborhood relationship in real networks, a framework is introduced to transform an uncertain network into a deterministic weighted network where the weights on edges can be measured by Jaccard-like index. The comprehensive experimental evaluation results on real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.

Understanding how nodes interconnect in large graphs is an essential problem in many fields. In order to find connecting nodes between two nodes or two groups of source nodes in huge graphs, we propose a parallelized data-mining algorithm to get the shortest path between nodes in a social network based on HBase distributed key/value store. Our algorithm can achieve the shortest path among different nodes in network under the parallel environment. We analyze the social network model by this algorithm first, and then optimize the output from cloud platform by using the intermediary degrees and degree central algorithm. Finally, with a simulated social network, we validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The experiment results indicate that our algorithm can improve the efficiency of parallel breath-first search (BSF).

Recent findings Critical care medicine is, as an especially data-rich specialty, becoming acutely cognizant not only of its historic deficits in data utilization but also of its enormous potential for capturing, mining, and leveraging such data into well-designed decision support modalities as well as the formulation of robust best practices. Summary Modern electronic medical records create an opportunity to design complete and functional data systems that can support clinical care to a degree never seen before. Such systems are often referred to as 'datadriven,' but a better term is 'optimal data systems' (ODS). Here we discuss basic features of an ODS and its benefits, including the potential to transform clinical prediction and decision support.

Sequential patterns can be applied in many domains to analyze the customer or user behaviors, such as basket analysis, biological data or web click streams. Conventional approaches may re-mine the updated database in batch mode while sequences are changed. The fast updated sequential pattern (FUSP)-tree was proposed to update the discovered sequential patterns whether for sequence insertion or deletion. The original database is required to be rescanned if it is necessary to maintain the small sequence that was not kept in the FUSP tree. Pre-large concepts were proposed to maintain the dynamic data mining that outperforms the FUP concepts. In this paper, we adopted the pre-large concepts to the FUSP-tree structure for sequence insertion. A FUSP tree is built in advance to keep the large 1-sequences for later maintenance. The pre-large sequences are also kept to reduce the movement from large to small and vice versa. When the number of inserted sequences is smaller than the safety bound of the pre-large concepts, better results can be obtained by the proposed incremental algorithm for sequence insertion in dynamic databases.

As wafer fabrication has been increasingly complicated in nano technologies, many factors including recipe, process, tool, and chamber with the multicollinearity affect the yield that are hard to detect and interpret. Although design of experiment (DOE) is a cost effective approach to consider multiple factors simultaneously, it is difficult to follow the design to conduct experiments in real settings. Alternatively, data mining has been widely applied to extract potential useful patterns for manufacturing intelligence. However, because hundreds of factors must be considered simultaneously to accurately characterize the yield performance of newly released technology and tools for diagnosis, data mining requires tremendous time for analysis and often generates too many patterns that are hard to be interpreted by domain experts. To address the needs in real settings, this study aims to develop a retrospective DOE data mining that matches potential designs with a huge amount of data automatically collected in semiconductor manufacturing to enable effective and meaningful knowledge extraction from the data. DOE can detect high-order interactions and show how interconnected factors respond to a wide range of values. To validate the proposed approach, an empirical study was conducted in a semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated its practical viability.

J	Xiao, YH; Wu, SY; Qi, LQ				Xiao, Yunhai; Wu, Soon-Yi; Qi, Liqun			Nonmonotone Barzilai-Borwein Gradient Algorithm for -Regularized Nonsmooth Minimization in Compressive Sensing	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Nonsmooth optimization; Nonconvex optimization; Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm; Nonmonotone line search; l(1) regularization; Compressive sensing	L(1)-REGULARIZED LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ROBUST UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES; LINE SEARCH TECHNIQUE; INTERIOR-POINT METHOD; SPARSE RECONSTRUCTION; UNCONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION; THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM; INVERSE PROBLEMS; SIGNAL RECOVERY; DESCENT METHOD	This study aims to minimize the sum of a smooth function and a nonsmooth -regularized term. This problem as a special case includes the -regularized convex minimization problem in signal processing, compressive sensing, machine learning, data mining, and so on. However, the non-differentiability of the -norm causes more challenges especially in large problems encountered in many practical applications. This study proposes, analyzes, and tests a Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm. At each iteration, the generated search direction demonstrates descent property and can be easily derived by minimizing a local approximal quadratic model and simultaneously taking the favorable structure of the -norm. A nonmonotone line search technique is incorporated to find a suitable stepsize along this direction. The algorithm is easily performed, where each iteration requiring the values of the objective function and the gradient of the smooth term. Under some conditions, the proposed algorithm appears globally convergent. The limited experiments using some nonconvex unconstrained problems from the CUTEr library with additive -regularization illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs quite satisfactorily. Extensive experiments for -regularized least squares problems in compressive sensing verify that our algorithm compares favorably with several state-of-the-art algorithms that have been specifically designed in recent years.

In order to facilitate better usage of emails and explore business potentials in emailing, various data mining techniques have been applied on email data. In this paper, we present a brief survey of the major research efforts on email mining. To emphasize the differences between email mining and general text mining, we organize our survey on five major email mining tasks, namely spam detection, email categorization, contact analysis, email network property analysis and email visualization. Those tasks are inherently incorporated into various usages of emails. We systematically review the commonly used techniques and also discuss the related software tools available.

J	Koufakou, A				Koufakou, Anna			Mining non-derivable hypercliques	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hyperclique; Non-derivable itemset; Frequent itemset mining; Dense data; Skewed support distribution	CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS	A hyperclique (Xiong et al. in Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on data mining, pp 387-394, 2003) is an itemset containing items that are strongly correlated with each other, based on a user-specified threshold. Hypercliques (HCs) have been successfully used in a number of applications, for example, clustering (Xiong et al. in Proceedings of the 4th SIAM international conference on data mining, pp 279-290, 2004) and noise removal (Xiong et al. in IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng 18(3):304-319, 2006). Even though HC has been shown to respond well to datasets with skewed support distribution and low support threshold, it may still grow very large for dense datasets and lower h-confidence threshold. In this paper, we propose a new pruning method based on combining HCs and non-derivable itemsets (NDIs) (Calders and Goethals in Proceedings of the PKDD international conference on principles of data mining and knowledge discovery, pp 74-85, 2002) in order to substantially reduce the amount of generated HCs. Specifically, we propose a new collection of HCs, called non-derivable hypercliques (NDHCs). The NDHC collection is a lossless representation of HCs, that is, given the itemsets in NDHCs, we can generate the complete HC collection and their support, without additional scanning of the dataset. We present an efficient algorithm to mine all NDHC sets, NDHCMiner, and an algorithm to derive all HC sets and their support from NDHCs, NDHCDeriveAll. We experimentally compare our collection, NDHC with HC, with respect to runtime performance as well as total number of generated sets, using real and artificial data. We also show comparisons with another condensed representation of HCs, maximal hyperclique patterns (MHPs). Our experiments show that the NDHC collection offers substantial advantages over HCs, and even MHPs, especially for dense datasets and lower h-confidence values.

J	Joshi, D; Soh, LK; Samal, A; Zhang, J				Joshi, Deepti; Soh, Leen-Kiat; Samal, Ashok; Zhang, Jing			A dissimilarity function for geospatial polygons	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dissimilarity function; Polygons; Spatial data mining; Regionalization; Polygonal clustering	TOPOLOGICAL RELATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; LINE	Similarity plays an important role in many data mining tasks and information retrieval processes. Most of the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms depend on using a dissimilarity function that measures the pair-wise similarity between the objects within the dataset. However, traditionally most of the similarity functions fail to adequately treat all the spatial attributes of the geospatial polygons due to the incomplete quantitative representation of structural and topological information contained within the polygonal datasets. In this paper, we propose a new dissimilarity function known as the polygonal dissimilarity function (PDF) that comprehensively integrates both the spatial and the non-spatial attributes of a polygon to specifically consider the density, distribution, and topological relationships that exist within the polygonal datasets. We represent a polygon as a set of intrinsic spatial attributes, extrinsic spatial attributes, and non-spatial attributes. Using this representation of the polygons, PDF is defined as a weighted function of the distance between two polygons in the different attribute spaces. In order to evaluate our dissimilarity function, we compare and contrast it with other distance functions proposed in the literature that work with both spatial and non-spatial attributes. In addition, we specifically investigate the effectiveness of our dissimilarity function in a clustering application using a partitional clustering technique (e.g. -medoids) using two characteristically different sets of data: (a) Irregular geometric shapes determined by natural processes, i.e., watersheds and (b) semi-regular geometric shapes determined by human experts, i.e., counties.

We challenge this assumption, arguing that we can improve the analysis by vitalizing data. In this paper, this principle is used to develop a new clustering algorithm. Inspired by herd behavior, the clustering method is a synergistic approach using collective intelligence called Herd Clustering (HC). The novel part is laid in its first stage where data instances are represented by moving particles. Particles attract each other locally and form clusters by themselves as shown in the case studies reported. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the performance of HC is compared to other state-of-the art clustering methods on more than thirty datasets using four performance metrics. An application for DNA motif discovery is also conducted. The results support the effectiveness of HC and thus the underlying philosophy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current virtual metrology model is mainly based on hypothesis-verification methods that depend on engineers' skills and updating of the model in accordance with situation changes in tools and processes. We propose a precise photolithography process control method using virtual metrology. In our method, we extract the current virtual metrology model by data mining, thus making updation is unnecessary. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Despite recent efforts, the challenge remains, due to the lack of an inherently meaningful measure of pairwise similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel variable-order Markov framework, named weighted conditional probability distribution (WCPD), to model clusters of categorical sequences. We propose an efficient and effective approach to solve the challenging problem of model initialization. To initialize the WCPD model, we propose to use a first-order Markov model built on a weighted fuzzy indicator vector representation of categorical sequences, which we call the WFI Markov model. Based on a cascade optimization framework that combines the WCPD and WFI models, we design a new divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm for clustering categorical sequences. Experimental results on data sets from three different domains demonstrate the promising performance of our models and clustering algorithm.

Cost-Sensitive Online Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cost-sensitive classification; online learning; online gradient descent; online anomaly detection	ALGORITHMS; PERCEPTRON	Both cost-sensitive classification and online learning have been extensively studied in data mining and machine learning communities, respectively. However, very limited study addresses an important intersecting problem, that is, "Cost-Sensitive Online Classification". In this paper, we formally study this problem, and propose a new framework for Cost-Sensitive Online Classification by directly optimizing cost-sensitive measures using online gradient descent techniques. Specifically, we propose two novel cost-sensitive online classification algorithms, which are designed to directly optimize two well-known cost-sensitive measures: (i) maximization of weighted sum of sensitivity and specificity, and (ii) minimization of weighted misclassification cost. We analyze the theoretical bounds of the cost-sensitive measures made by the proposed algorithms, and extensively examine their empirical performance on a variety of cost-sensitive online classification tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed technique for solving several online anomaly detection tasks, showing that the proposed technique could be a highly efficient and effective tool to tackle cost-sensitive online classification tasks in various application domains.

However, in many scenarios, we need to measure the relatedness between objects with different types. With the surge of study on heterogeneous networks, the relevance measure on objects with different types becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we study the relevance search problem in heterogeneous networks, where the task is to measure the relatedness of heterogeneous objects (including objects with the same type or different types). A novel measure HeteSim is proposed, which has the following attributes: (1) a uniform measure: it can measure the relatedness of objects with the same or different types in a uniform framework; (2) a path-constrained measure: the relatedness of object pairs are defined based on the search path that connects two objects through following a sequence of node types; (3) a semi-metric measure: HeteSim has some good properties (e.g., self-maximum and symmetric), which are crucial to many data mining tasks. Moreover, we analyze the computation characteristics of HeteSim and propose the corresponding quick computation strategies. Empirical studies show that HeteSim can effectively and efficiently evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous objects.

Geometric biclustering (GBC) method is used to reduce the complexity of the NP-complete biclustering algorithm. This paper studies three commonly used modern platforms including multi-core CPU, GPU and FPGA to accelerate this GBC algorithm. By analyzing the parallelizing property of the GBC algorithm, we design 1) a multi-threaded software running on a server grade multi-core CPU system, 2) a CUDA program for GPU to accelerate the GBC algorithm, and 3) a novel parameterizable and scalable hardware architecture implemented on an FPGA. Genes microarray pattern analysis is employed as an example to demonstrate performance comparisons on different platforms. In particular, we compare the speed and energy efficiency of the three proposed methods. We found that 1) GPU achieves the highest average speedup of 48x compared to single-threaded GBC program, 2) Our FPGA design can achieve higher speedup of 4x for the computation for large microarray, and 3) FPGA consumes the least energy, which is about 3.53x more efficient than the single-threaded GBC program.

J	Ikram, A; Qamar, U				Ikram, Aqdas; Qamar, Usman			A rule-based expert system for earthquake prediction	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Earthquake; Data mining; Prediction; Predicate logic; Expert system; Association rules		Earthquake is a natural disaster which causes extensive damage as well as the death of thousands of people. Earthquake professionals for many decades have recognized the benefits to society from reliable earthquake predictions. Techniques like: mathematical modelling, hydrology analysis, ionosphere analysis and even animal responses have been used to forecast a quake. Most of these techniques rely on certain precursors like, stress or seismic activity. Data mining techniques can also be used for prediction of this natural hazard. Data mining consists of evolving set of techniques such as association rule mining that can be used to extract valuable information and knowledge from massive volumes of data. The aim of this study is to predict a subsequent earthquake from the data of the previous earthquake. This is achieved by applying association rule mining on earthquake data from 1979 to 2012. These associations are polished using predicate-logic techniques to draw stimulating production-rules to be used with a rule-based expert system. Prediction process is done by an expert system, which takes only current earthquake attributes to predict a subsequent earthquake. The rules generated for predicting the earthquake are mathematically validated as well as tested on real life earthquake data. Results from our study show that the proposed rule-based expert system is able to detect 100 % of earthquakes which actually occurred within 15 hours at-most within a defined range, depth and location. This work solely relies on previous earthquake data for predicting the next.

We employed a support vector machine, logistic regression, and a C5.0 decision tree to construct a classification model of breast cancer patients' survival rates, and used a 10-fold cross-validation approach to identify the model. The results show that the establishment of classification tools for the classification of the models yielded an average accuracy rate of more than 90 % for both; the SVM provided the best method for constructing the three categories of the classification system for the survival mode. The results of the experiment show that the three methods used to create the classification system, established a high accuracy rate, predicted a more accurate survival ability of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and could be used as a reference when creating a medical decision-making frame.

The model is a response to a number of requirements, ranging from incorporating essential clinical diagnostic semantics to the integration of data mining for the process of identifying candidate diseases that best explain a set of clinical features. We introduce two major components, which we find essential to the construction of an integral differential diagnosis recommendation model: the evidence-based recommender component and the proximity-based recommender component. Both approaches are driven by disease diagnosis ontologies designed specifically to enable the process of generating diagnostic recommendations. These ontologies are the disease symptom ontology and the patient ontology. The evidence-based diagnosis process develops dynamic rules based on standardized clinical pathways. The proximity-based component employs data mining to provide clinicians with diagnosis predictions, as well as generates new diagnosis rules from provided training datasets. This article describes the integration between these two components along with the developed diagnosis ontologies to form a novel medical differential diagnosis recommendation model. This article also provides test cases from the implementation of the overall model, which shows quite promising diagnostic recommendation results.

Through this work, we also assessed the contribution of the data mining method to the understanding of factors associated with the dissemination of infectious diseases and their spatiotemporal spread. Methods We applied contextual sequential pattern extraction techniques to epidemiological and meteorological data to identify the most significant climatic factors for dengue fever, and we investigated the relevance of the extracted patterns for the early warning of dengue outbreaks in French Guiana. Results The maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, global brilliance, and cumulative rainfall were identified as determinants of dengue outbreaks, and the precise intervals of their values and variations were quantified according to the epidemiologic context. The strongest significant correlations were observed between dengue incidence and meteorological drivers after a 4-6-week lag. Discussion We demonstrated the use of contextual sequential patterns to better understand the determinants of the spatiotemporal spread of dengue fever in French Guiana. Future work should integrate additional variables and explore the notion of neighborhood for extracting sequential patterns. Conclusions Dengue fever remains a major public health issue in French Guiana. The development of new methods to identify such specific characteristics becomes crucial in order to better understand and control spatiotemporal transmission.

Genetic improvement and marker-assisted breeding of castor bean have been slowed owing to the lack of abundant and efficient molecular markers. As co-dominant markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are useful for genetic evaluation and molecular breeding. The recently released whole-genome sequence of castor bean provides useful genomic resources for developing markers on a genome-wide scale. In the present study, the distribution and frequency of microsatellites in the castor bean genome were characterised and numerous SSR markers were developed using genomic data mining. In total, 18,647 SSR loci at a density of one SSR per 18.89 Kb in the castor bean genome sequence (representing approximately 352.27 Mb) were identified. Dinucleotide repeats were the most frequently observed microsatellites, although the AAT repeat motif was also prevalent. Using six cultivars as screening samples, 670 polymorphic SSR markers from 1,435 primer pairs (46.7 %) were developed. Trinucleotide motif loci contained a higher proportion of polymorphisms (48.5 %) than dinucleotide motif loci (39.2 %). The polymorphism level in the SSR loci was positively correlated with the increasing number of repeat units in the microsatellites. The phylogenetic relationship among 32 varieties was evaluated using the developed SSR markers. Cultivars developed at the same institute clustered together, suggesting that these cultivars have a narrow genetic background. The large number of SSR markers developed in this study will be useful for genetic mapping and for breeding improved castor-oil plants. These markers will also facilitate genetic and genomic studies of Euphorbiaceae.

The effects of N source concentration and NH4+/NO3- ratio were evaluated in a full-fattorial (FF) experiment. N concentrations of 10, 20, 40 and 60 mM, and NH4+/NO3- ratios of 0, 0.11, 0.20 and 0.33 (ratio of NH4+ in total N source) were tested. Several peaks could be identified as PGs, of which, 16 could be putatively identified from the MS/MS/MS spectra. N source concentration and NH4+/NO3- ratio had significant effects on the metabolome, their effects on individual PGs were different despite these metabolites were of the same biosynthethic class. Chief PGs were plantamajoside and acteoside (verbascoside), their highest concentrations were 3.54 +/- 0.83% and 1.30 +/- 0.40% of dry weight, on media 10(0.33) and 40(0.33), respectively. NH4+/NO3- ratio and N source concentration effects were examined on a set of 89 NPs. For most NPs, high increases in abundance were observed compared to Murashige-Skoog medium. Abundances of 42 and 10 NPs were significantly influenced by the N source concentration and the NH4+/NO3- ratio, respectively. Optimal media for production of different NP clusters were 10(0), 10(0.11) and 40(0.33). Interaction was observed between NH4+/NO3- ratio and N source concentration for many NPs. It was shown in simulated experiments, that one-factor at a time (OFAT) experimental designs lead to sub-optimal media compositions for production of many NPs, and alternative experimental designs (e.g. FF) should be preferred when optimizing medium N source for optimal yield of NPs. If using OFAT, the N source concentration is to be optimized first, followed by NH4+/NO3- ratio, as this reduces the likeliness of suboptimal yield results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ENDOGENOUS GENE; METHYLATION; PLANTS; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; RNA; DRM	In this study, we identified eight DNA MTase genes in maize and the diversity of expression patterns of them was presented by EST mining, microarray and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in promoting genomic stability through diverse biological processes including regulation of gene expression during development and chromatin organization. Although this important biological process is mainly regulated by several conserved Cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases encoded by a smaller multigene family in plants, investigation of the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the C5-MTase-encoding gene family have been characterized in multiple plant species including Arabidopsis, rice, carrot and wheat. However, little is known regarding the C5-MTase-encoding genes in the entire maize genome. Here, genome-wide identification and expression profile analyses of maize C5-MTase-encoding genes (ZmMETs) were performed from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the orthologs from the three species (maize, Arabidopsis and rice) were categorized into four classes. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on 6 of all 10 chromosomes with three chromosomal/segmental duplication events, suggesting that gene duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize C5-MTase-encoding gene family. Furthermore, EST expression data mining, microarray data and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments have demonstrated that these genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmMET genes family. Overall, our study will serve to present signification insights to explore the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene expression and function and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants.

They belong to the major receptor-like kinase (RLK) family in plants. Given their architecture and connection to the cell wall, WAKs are thought to perceive and propagate extracellular signals. This study reports the characterization of the WAK family in a woody species based on the v3.0 genome assembly of Populus trichocarpa. In silico analysis revealed a total of 175 PtWAK sequences classified into four groups based on protein domains. Of the PtWAKs, 91.5 % were found in tandem-duplicated clusters contributing to the expansion of the family in poplar. Microarray and EST expression data mining revealed contrasting temporal and spatial expression patterns in stress treatments for several WAK members. The WAKs in poplar form the largest WAK family encountered to date in plants. The combination of phylogenetic and transcriptional data showed that members in nonexpanded clusters were mainly expressed in developmental processes, whereas PtWAKs that had evolved independently in a species-specific way were structured in clusters and were involved in resistance responses. This paper offers an overview of WAK family structure in P. trichocarpa, which will be useful for further functional analysis of the PtWAK family.

J	Vo, B; Le, T; Hong, TP; Le, B				Bay Vo; Tuong Le; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Bac Le			An effective approach for maintenance of pre-large-based frequent-itemset lattice in incremental mining	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent itemsets; Lattice; Incremental mining; Pre-large concept	ASSOCIATION RULES; PATTERN TREES; ALGORITHM; BITTABLEFI	Incremental mining has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its usefulness in online applications. Many algorithms have thus been proposed for incrementally mining frequent itemsets. Maintaining a frequent-itemset lattice (FIL) is difficult for databases with large numbers of frequent itemsets, especially huge databases, due to the storage of links of nodes in the lattice. However, generating association rules from a FIL has been shown to be more effective than traditional methods such as directly generating rules from frequent itemsets or frequent closed itemsets. Therefore, when the number of frequent itemsets is not huge (i.e., they can be stored in the lattice without excessive memory overhead), the lattice-based approach outperforms approaches which mine association rules from frequent itemsets/frequent closed itemsets. However, incremental algorithms for building FILs have not yet been proposed. This paper proposes an effective approach for the maintenance of a FIL based on the pre-large concept in incremental mining. The building process of a FIL is first improved using two proposed theorems regarding the paternity relation between two nodes in the lattice. An effective approach for maintaining a FIL with dynamically inserted data is then proposed based on the pre-large and the diffset concepts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the batch approach for building a FIL in terms of execution time.

J	Xylogiannopoulos, KF; Karampelas, P; Alhajj, R				Xylogiannopoulos, Konstantinos F.; Karampelas, Panagiotis; Alhajj, Reda			Analyzing very large time series using suffix arrays	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Suffix arrays; Repeated patterns detection; Data mining; Time series; DNA analysis	CONSTRUCTION	Suffix arrays form a powerful data structure for pattern detection and matching. In a previous work, we presented a novel algorithm (COV) which is the only algorithm that allows the detection of all repeated patterns in a time series by using the actual suffix array. However, the requirements for storing the actual suffix strings even on external media makes the use of suffix arrays impossible for very large time series. We have already proved that using the concept of Longest Expected Repeated Pattern (LERP) allows the actual suffices to be stored in linear capacity O(n) on external media. The repeated pattern detection using LERP has analogous time complexity, and thus makes the analysis of large time series feasible and limited only to the size of the external media and not memory. Yet, there are cases when hardware limitations might be an obstacle for the analysis of very larger time series of size comparable to hard disk capacity. With the Moving LERP (MLERP) method introduced in this paper, it is possible to analyze very large time series (of size tens or hundreds thousands times larger than what the LERP can analyze) by maximal utilization of the available hardware. Further, when empirical knowledge related to the distribution of repeated pattern's length is available, the proposed method (MLERP) can achieve better time performance compared to the standard LERP method and definitely much better than using any other pattern matching algorithm and applying brute force techniques which are unfeasible in logical (human) time frame. Thus, we may argue that MLERP is a very useful tool for detecting all repeated patterns in a time series regardless of its size and hardware limitations.

Data Mining in Psychological Treatment Research: A Primer on Classification and Regression Trees	JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						classification and regression trees; CART; exploratory data analysis; data mining	SELECTION; PTSD	Data mining of treatment study results can reveal unforeseen but critical insights, such as who receives the most benefit from treatment and under what circumstances. The usefulness and legitimacy of exploratory data analysis have received relatively little recognition, however, and analytic methods well suited to the task are not widely known in psychology. With roots in computer science and statistics, statistical learning approaches offer a credible option: These methods take a more inductive approach to building a model than is done in traditional regression, allowing the data greater role in suggesting the correct relationships between variables rather than imposing them a priori. Classification and regression trees are presented as a powerful, flexible exemplar of statistical learning methods. Trees allow researchers to efficiently identify useful predictors of an outcome and discover interactions between predictors without the need to anticipate and specify these in advance, making them ideal for revealing patterns that inform hypotheses about treatment effects. Trees can also provide a predictive model for forecasting outcomes as an aid to clinical decision making. This primer describes how tree models are constructed, how the results are interpreted and evaluated, and how trees overcome some of the complexities of traditional regression. Examples are drawn from randomized clinical trial data and highlight some interpretations of particular interest to treatment researchers. The limitations of tree models are discussed, and suggestions for further reading and choices in software are offered.

Hidden Costs of Poor Image Quality: A Radiologist's Perspective	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Image quality; outcomes analysis; data mining; quality assurance	PHYSICIANS; FREQUENCY; SAFETY; IMPACT	Although image quality is a well-recognized component in the successful delivery of medical imaging services, it has arguably declined over the past decade owing to several technical, economic, cultural, and geographic factors. To improve quality, the radiologist community must take a more proactive role in image quality analysis and optimization; these require analysis of not just the single step of image acquisition but the entire imaging chain. Radiologists can benefit through improved report accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and workflow efficiency. The derived data-driven analyses offer an objective means for provider performance analysis, which can help combat commoditization trends and self-referral by nonradiologist providers.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been used as an effective elicitor to enhance the production of these compounds. However, the molecular mechanism of MeJA-mediated tanshinone and salvianolic acid biosynthesis remains unclear. The transcriptional profiles of S. miltiorrhiza leaves at 12h (T12) after MeJA elicitation and mock-treated leaves (T0) were generated using the Illumina deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) strategy to detect the changes in gene expression in response to MeJA. In total, 37 647 unique sequences were obtained from about 21 million reads, and 25 641 (71.53%) of these sequences were annotated based on the blast searches against the public databases. A total of 5287 unique sequences were expressed differentially between the samples of T0 and T12, which covered almost all the known genes involved in tanshinone and phenolic acid biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza. Many of the transcription factors (e.g. MYB, bHLH and WRKY) and genes involved in plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction were expressed differentially in response to the MeJA induction. Importantly, three and four candidate cytochrome P450s (P450s) that could be involved in the tanshinone and phenolic acid biosynthesis, respectively, were selected from the RNA-seq data based on co-expressed pattern analysis with SmCPS1/SmKSL1 and SmRAS, which are the key genes responsible for biosynthesis. This comprehensive investigation of MeJA-induced gene expression profiles can shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the MeJA-mediated bioactive compound biosynthesis and regulation in S. miltiorrhiza.

A Density-focused Support Vector Data Description Method	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						support vector data description; one-class classification; density; novelty detection; data mining	NOVELTY DETECTION; CLASSIFIER	In novelty detection, support vector data description (SVDD) is a one-class classification technique that constructs a boundary to differentiate novel from normal patterns. However, boundaries constructed by SVDD do not consider the density of the data. Data points located in low density regions are more likely to be novel patterns because they are remote from their neighbors. This study presents a density-focused SVDD (DFSVDD), for which its boundary considers both shape and the dense region of the data. Two distance measures, the kernel distance and the density distance, are combined to construct the DFSVDD boundary. The kernel distance can be obtained by solving a quadratic optimization, while support vectors are used to obtain the density distance. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed DFSVDD and was then compared with the traditional SVDD. The proposed method performed better than SVDD in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Because of its sound statistical basis and intuitive use of visual displays, SPC has been extensively used in manufacturing and health care and service industries. Deploying SPC involves both a technical aspect and a proper environment for continuous improvement activities based on management support and worker empowerment. Many of the commonly used SPC tools, including histograms, fishbone diagrams, scatter plots, and defect concentration diagrams, were proposed prior to the advent of microcomputers as efficient methods to record and visualize data for single (or few) variable(s) processes. As the volume, variety, and velocity of data continues to evolve, there are opportunities to supplement and improve these methods for understanding and visualizing process variation. In this paper, we propose enhancements to some of the basic quality tools that can be easily applied with a desktop computer. We demonstrate how these updated tools can be used to better characterize, understand, and/or diagnose variation in a case study involving a US manufacturer of structural tubular metal products. Finally, we create the quality visualization toolkit to allow practitioners to implement some of these visualization tools without the need for training, extensive statistical background, and/or specialized statistical software.

Therefore, we propose an anonymous e-rental protocol based on ID-based cryptography and near field communication technology, with particular focus on vehicle rentals. Our contributions include: (1) Anonymity. Users' real identity is hidden from the rental service providers. (2) Unlinkability. Rental service providers cannot find the relation between two rental records. (3) Traceability. As full anonymity is not always desirable, traceability allows disclosure of a malicious user's identity, whereas other users' privacy remains unviolated. Rental service providers can request TTP to reveal users' identity with a legal warrant. (4) Flexibility. Users choose their preferred service providers and vehicles. (5) Anonymous payment. Rental service providers cannot associate users' identity with the financial transactions.

Recent scholarship has focused on the new modes of reasoning brought about by hi-tech' forms analysis such as data mining, graph visualization and the algorithmic treatment of big data. While this article recognizes the increasing influence of these techniques, it argues they should not overshadow much more low-tech modalities through which a large part of counterterrorism work takes place. Low-tech counter-terrorism, based on qualitative methods and conjectural reasoning, still matters. Drawing on the case of French domestic intelligence services and based on qualitative interviews, observations and declassified documents, this article shows that the practices of security professionals, rooted in traditional institutional habituses developed over time, are largely in continuity with previous low-tech' forms of police work. In a context in which the uses of digital security technologies have generated discussions about politics and ethics, this article suggests that traditional techniques of intelligence gathering and processing therefore still merit a great amount of attention.

Furthermore, additional structure candidates have been obtained using data mining. For each of the structure candidates, a local optimization on the ab initio level using density-functional theory (LDA, hybrid B3LYP) and the Hartree--Fock (HF) method was performed, and we find that several of the modifications may be experimentally accessible. In the high-pressure regime, we identify a post-perovskite phase in the CaIrO3 type, not previously observed in CaMnO3. Similarly, calculations at effective negative pressure predict a phase transition from the orthorhombic perovskite to an ilmenite-type (FeTiO3) modification of CaMnO3.

Using open-access taxonomic and spatial information to create a comprehensive database for the study of Mammalian and avian livestock and pet infections	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE			English	Article						Database; Disease; Pathogen; Zoonosis; Emerging; Surveillance	HOST-RANGE; DISEASES; EMERGENCE; WILDLIFE; HEALTH; SURVEILLANCE; PATHOGENS; RISK	What are all the species of pathogen that affect our livestock? As 6 out of every 10 human pathogens came from animals, with a good number from livestock and pets, it seems likely that the majority that emerge in the future, and which could threaten or devastate human health, will come from animals. Only 10 years ago, the first comprehensive pathogen list was compiled for humans; we still have no equivalent for animals. Here we describe the creation of a novel pathogen database, and present outputs from the database that demonstrate its value. The ENHanCEd Infectious Diseases database (EID2) is open-access and evidence-based, and it describes the pathogens of humans and animals, their host and vector species, and also their global occurrence. The EID2 systematically collates information on pathogens into a single resource using evidence from the NCBI Taxonomy database, the NCBI Nucleotide database, the NCBI MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) library and PubMed. Information about pathogens is assigned using data-mining of meta-data and semi-automated literature searches. Here we focus on 47 mammalian and avian hosts, including humans and animals commonly used in Europe as food or kept as pets. Currently, the EID2 evidence suggests that: Within these host species, 793 (30.5%) pathogens were bacteria species, 395 (15.2%) fungi, 705 (27.1%) helminths, 372 (14.3%) protozoa and 332 (12.8%) viruses. The odds of pathogens being emerging compared to not emerging differed by taxonomic division, and increased when pathogens had greater numbers of host species associated with them, and were zoonotic rather than non-zoonotic. The odds of pathogens being zoonotic compared to non-zoonotic differed by taxonomic division and also increased when associated with greater host numbers. The pathogens affecting the greatest number of hosts included: Escherichia coli, Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma gondii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Rabies virus, Staphylococcus aureus, Neospora caninum and Echinococcus granulosus. The pathogens of humans and domestic animal hosts are characterised by 4223 interactions between pathogen and host species, with the greatest number found in: humans, sheep/goats, cattle, small mammals, pigs, dogs and equids. The number of pathogen species varied by European country. The odds of a pathogen being found in Europe compared to the rest of the world differed by taxonomic division, and increased if they were emerging compared to not emerging, or had a larger number of host species associated with them.

In such information services, a large amount of data related to vehicles and drivers has been accumulated in the data centre and been analysed to provide proper information to drivers. Towards such technical trends surrounding vehicles, a cyber physical system for vehicle applications is proposed here. In the proposed system, the expected continuous spiral information flow for vehicles and drivers is described. In the data centre, accumulated information has been analysed by intelligent information processing of data mining, then finally extracted information has been provided to drivers through a human-machine interface. According to the progress of information processing technologies surrounding vehicles, the current situation and challenges of typical technological areas to realize the system are discussed. Several research activities towards potential new services for drivers are also introduced, mainly based on personal adaptation, big data analysis and web mining.

The nine chromosomes selected (#1, 4, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 21 and X) cover a wide range in size and gene density and compose 40% of the total human genome. Radial positioning of the chromosome territories (CT) was size dependent with certain of the CT more peripheral in CA1a. Each CT was in close proximity (interaction) with a similar number of other CT except the inactive CTXi. It had lower levels of interchromosomal partners in 10A which increased strikingly in CA1a. Major alterations from 10A to CA1a were detected in the pairwise interaction profiles which were subdivided into five types of altered interaction profiles: overall increase, overall decrease, switching from 1 to >2, vice versa or no change. A global data mining program termed the chromatic median calculated the most probable overall association network for the entire subset of CT. This interchromosomal network was drastically altered in CA1a with only 1 of 20 shared connections. We conclude that CT undergo multiple and preferred interactions with other CT in the cell nucleus and form preferred albeit probabilistic interchromosomal networks. This network of interactions is highly altered in malignant human breast cells. It is intriguing to consider the relationship of these alterations to the corresponding changes in the gene expression program of these malignant cancer cells.

In this paper, spatial big data mining is presented under the characteristics of geomatics and big data. First, spatial big data attracts much attention from the academic community, business industry, and administrative governments, for it is playing a primary role in addressing social, economic, and environmental issues of pressing importance. Second, humanity is submerged by spatial big data, such as much garbage, heavy pollution and its difficulties in utilization. Third, the value in spatial big data is dissected. As one of the fundamental resources, it may help people to recognize the world with population instead of sample, along with the potential effectiveness. Finally, knowledge discovery from spatial big data refers to the basic technologies to realize the value of big data, and relocate data assets. And the uncovered knowledge may be further transformed into data intelligences.

METHODS: Clinical issues based on data mining models were comprehensively summarized from four significant elements of the clinical studies: symptoms, symptom patterns, herbs, and efficacy. Existing problems were further generalized to determine the relevant factors of the performance of data mining models, e.g. data type, samples, parameters, variable labels. Combining these relevant factors, the TCM clinical data features were compared with regards to statistical characters and informatics properties. Data models were compared simultaneously from the view of applied conditions and suitable scopes. RESULTS: The main application problems were the inconsistent data type and the small samples for the used data mining models, which caused the inappropriate results, even the mistake results. These features, i.e. advantages, disadvantages, satisfied data types, tasks of data mining, and the TCM issues, were summarized and compared. CONCLUSION: By aiming at the special features of different data mining models, the clinical doctors could select the suitable data mining models to resolve the TCM problem. (C) 2014 JTCM.

J	Widener, MJ; Li, WW				Widener, Michael J.; Li, Wenwen			Using geolocated Twitter data to monitor the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food references across the US	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Food deserts; Twitter; Nutrition; Spatial analysis; Public health	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; VEGETABLE INTAKE; ENVIRONMENT; RISK; DESERTS; OBESITY; ACCESSIBILITY; INTERNET; DISEASE; TWEETS	Mining the social media outlet Twitter for geolocated messages provides a rich database of information on people's thoughts and sentiments about myriad topics, like public health. Examining this spatial data has been particularly useful to researchers interested in monitoring and mapping disease outbreaks, like influenza. However, very little has been done to utilize this massive resource to examine other public health issues. This paper uses an advanced data-mining framework with a novel use of social media data retrieval and sentiment analysis to understand how geolocated tweets can be used to explore the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food across the contiguous United States. Additionally, tweets are associated with spatial data provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) of low-income, low-access census tracts (e.g. food deserts), to examine whether tweets about unhealthy foods are more common in these disadvantaged areas. Results show that these disadvantaged census tracts tend to have both a lower proportion of tweets about healthy foods with a positive sentiment, and a higher proportion of unhealthy tweets in general. These findings substantiate the methods used by the USDA to identify regions that are at risk of having low access to healthy foods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A distributed privacy-preserving regularization network committee machine of isolated Peer classifiers for P2P data mining	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Distributed data mining; Committee machines; Regularization neural networks; Peer-to-peer; Privacy-preserving		For distributed data mining in peer-to-peer systems this work describes a completely asynchronous, scalable and privacy-preserving committee machine. Regularization neural networks are used for all the Peer classifiers and the combiner committee in an embedded architecture. The proposed method builds the committee machine using the large amounts of training data distributed over the peers, without moving the data, and with little centralized coordination. At the end of the training phase no Peer will know anything else besides its own local data. This privacy-preserving obligation is a challenging problem for trainable combiners but is crucial in real world applications. Only classifiers are transmitted to other peers to validate their data and send back average accuracy rates in a classical asynchronous peer-to-peer execution cycle. Here the validation set for one classifier becomes the training set of the other and vice versa. From this entirely distributed and privacy-preserving mutual validation a coarse-grained asymmetric mutual validation matrix can be formed to map all Peer members. We demonstrate here that it is possible to exploit this matrix to efficiently train another regularization network as the combiner committee machine.

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to detect useful biological knowledge hidden under the large volumes of DNA/RNA sequences and structures, literature and other biological and biomedical data, to gain a greater insight into their relationships and, therefore, to enhance the discovery and the comprehension of biological processes. In order to fully exploit the new opportunities that emerge, novel data and text mining techniques have to be developed to effectively address the fundamental biological issue of managing and uncovering meaningful patterns and correlations from these large biological and biomedical data repositories. In this work, we propose an effective data mining technique for analysing biological and biomedical data. The proposed mining process is efficient enough to be applied to various types of biological and biomedical data. To prove the concept, we experiment with applying the data mining technique into two distinct areas, including biomedical text documents and data. In addition, based on the proposed approach, we develop two mining tools, namely the Bio Search Engine and the Genome-Based Population Clustering.

A large empirical dataset from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey with 98,175 records was used in our study. After pre-processing, partitioning and balancing the data, the refined dataset of 31,704 records was modeled by Decision Trees (including C5.0 and CHAID), and Neural Networks. The performances of the models are analyzed using various measures including accuracy, G-mean, and Area under ROC curve. We concluded that the CHAID classifier returns the best G-mean and AUC measures for top performing predictive models ranging from 76% to 85%, and 0.812 to 0.942 units, respectively. We also identify a small set of 5 non-trivial attributes among a primary set of 66 attributes to identify the top 5% of the high cost population. The attributes are the individual's overall health perception, age, history of blood cholesterol check, history of physical/sensory/mental limitations, and history of colonic prevention measures. The small set of attributes are what we call non-trivial and does not include visits to care providers, doctors or hospitals, which are highly correlated with expenditures and does not offer new insight to the data. The results of this study can be used by healthcare data analysts, policy makers, insurer, and healthcare planners to improve the delivery of health services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jandel, M				Jandel, Magnus			Decision support for releasing anonymised data	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Anonymisation; De-anonymisation; Privacy-preserving data mining; Privacy-preserving data publishing; Decision support	DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY; INFORMATION; ANONYMIZATION	For legal and privacy reasons it is often prescribed that data bases containing sensitive personal data can be published only in anonymised form. History shows, however, that the privacy of anonymised data in many cases is easily broken by de-anonymisation attacks. This paper defines guiding principles for decisions about releasing anonymised data and provides a simple process for analysing de-anonymisation risk and for making decisions about publishing anonymised personal data. At the heart of this process is an information-theoretic de-anonymisation feasibility limit that is independent of the details of both the anonymisation procedure and the adversarial de-anonymisation algorithms. This feasibility limit relates the adversarial mutual information of the anonymised data and the attacker's background information to the number of records in the anonymised data base and the acceptable risk of privacy violations. Based on this result, we explain, discuss and exemplify the process for making decisions about releasing anonymised data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bulkeley, K				Bulkeley, Kelly			Digital dream analysis: A revised method	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Dreams; Dream content; Content analysis; Word searching; Data mining		This article demonstrates the use of a digital word search method designed to provide greater accuracy, objectivity, and speed in the study of dreams. A revised template of 40 word search categories, built into the website of the Sleep and Dream Database (SDDb), is applied to four "classic" sets of dreams: The male and female "Norm" dreams of Hall and Van de Castle (1966), the "Engine Man" dreams discussed by Hobson (1988), and the "Barb Sanders Baseline 250" dreams examined by Domhoff (2003). A word search analysis of these original dream reports shows that a digital approach can accurately identify many of the same distinctive patterns of content found by previous investigators using much more laborious and time-consuming methods. The results of this study emphasize the compatibility of word search technologies with traditional approaches to dream content analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To meet this challenge, advanced analytics through data mining approaches has been applied to predict and explain the leading causes of variation in heat rates and the opacity of the flue gas exhaust emissions, which are key factors in measuring the overall efficiency of the power plant. The results from a case study from a coal-fired power plant in Thailand demonstrate the practical validity of our approaches. The key finding contributes to identifying parameters that are the key determinants of excessive heat rates and opacity levels. Thus, corrective and preventive actions related to those parameters can be regularly evaluated and monitored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A data-driven approach is employed to construct the relationship between input and output parameters using data collected from a commercial building. Computational intelligence algorithms are applied to solve the non-parametric model. Experiments are conducted to analyze performance of the three computational intelligence algorithms. The experiment results indicate that particle swarm optimization and harmony search algorithms are suitable for solving the proposed optimization model. Three case studies of HVAC performance optimization based on simulation are presented. The computational results demonstrate that simultaneous minimization of energy and room temperature ramp rate is more beneficial than minimization of energy only. The proposed approach is implemented to demonstrate its capability of saving energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Practitioners searching EHRs need to phrase their queries carefully, as the record might use synonyms or other related words. In this paper we show that an automatic query expansion method based on the Unified Medicine Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus improves the results of a robust baseline when searching EHRs. Materials and methods: The method uses a graph representation of the lexical units, concepts and relations in the UMLS Metathesaurus. It is based on random walks over the graph, which start on the query terms. Random walks are a well-studied discipline in both Web and Knowledge Base datasets. Results: Our experiments over the TREC Medical Record track show improvements in both the 2011 and 2012 datasets over a strong baseline. Discussion: Our analysis shows that the success of our method is due to the automatic expansion of the query with extra terms, even when they are not directly related in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The terms added in the expansion go beyond simple synonyms, and also add other kinds of topically related terms. Conclusions: Expansion of queries using related terms in the UMLS Metathesaurus beyond synonymy is an effective way to overcome the gap between query and document vocabularies when searching for patient cohorts.

The set of variables should be small and, at the same time, should provide reliable discrimination of the classes. The method for the discriminating power evaluation that enables a comparison between different sets of variables will be useful in the search for the set of variables. Results: A new approach to feature selection is presented. Two methods of evaluation of the data discriminating power of a feature set are suggested. Both of the methods implement self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the newly introduced exponents of the degree of data clusterization on the SOM. The first method is based on the comparison of intraclass and interclass distances on the map. Another method concerns the evaluation of the relative number of best matching unit's (BMUs) nearest neighbors of the same class. Both methods make it possible to evaluate the discriminating power of a feature set in cases when this set provides nonlinear discrimination of the classes.

A general framework for time series data mining based on event analysis: Application to the medical domains of electroencephalography and stabilometry	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical data mining; Time series analysis; Event; Classification; Electroencephalography; Stabilometry	NEURAL-NETWORK SYSTEM; TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; INFERENCE; CLASSIFIERS; PATTERNS; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION	There are now domains where information is recorded over a period of time, leading to sequences of data known as time series. In many domains, like medicine, time series analysis requires to focus on certain regions of interest, known as events, rather than analyzing the whole time series. In this paper, we propose a framework for knowledge discovery in both one-dimensional and multidimensional time series containing events. We show how our approach can be used to classify medical time series by means of a process that identifies events in time series, generates time series reference models of representative events and compares two time series by analyzing the events they have in common. We have applied our framework on time series generated in the areas of electroencephalography (EEG) and stabilometry. Framework performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and the results confirmed that the proposed schema has potential for classifying EEG and stabilometric signals. The proposed framework is useful for discovering knowledge from medical time series containing events, such as stabilometric and electroencephalographic time series. These results would be equally applicable to other medical domains generating iconographic time series, such as, for example, electrocardiography (ECG). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data Integration Protocol In Ten-steps (DIPIT): A new standard for medical researchers	METHODS			English	Article						Data integration; Data linkage; Merging; Data aggregation; Data mining; Standard	BIOMEDICAL DATA INTEGRATION; MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES; MISSING DATA; RECORD LINKAGE; HEALTH DATA; INFORMATION; SERVICES; OUTCOMES; TRIALS; CLAIMS	Introduction: The exponential increase in data, computing power and the availability of readily accessible analytical software has allowed organisations around the world to leverage the benefits of integrating multiple heterogeneous data files for enterprise-level planning and decision making. Benefits from effective data integration to the health and medical research community include more trustworthy research, higher service quality, improved personnel efficiency, reduction of redundant tasks, facilitation of auditing and more timely, relevant and specific information. The costs of poor quality processes elevate the risk of erroneous outcomes, an erosion of confidence in the data and the organisations using these data. To date there are no documented set of standards for best practice integration of heterogeneous data files for research purposes. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe a set of clear protocol for data file integration (Data Integration Protocol In Ten-steps; DIPIT) translational to any field of research. Methods and results: The DIPIT approach consists of a set of 10 systematic methodological steps to ensure the final data are appropriate for the analysis to meet the research objectives, legal and ethical requirements are met, and that data definitions are clear, concise, and comprehensive. This protocol is neither file specific nor software dependent, but aims to be transportable to any data-merging situation to minimise redundancy and error and translational to any field of research. DIPIT aims to generate a master data file that is of the optimal integrity to serve as the basis for research analysis. Conclusion: With linking of heterogeneous data files becoming increasingly common across all fields of medicine, DIPIT provides a systematic approach to a potentially complex task of integrating a large number of files and variables. The DIPIT protocol will ensure the final integrated data is consistent and of high integrity for the research requirements, useful for practical application across all fields of medical research.

Identifying risk factors for the disease progression and capturing the disease characteristics have received increasing attentions in the health informatics research. In data mining area, risk factors are features of the data and diagnostic results can be regarded as the labels to train a model for a regression or classification task. We develop a general framework based on the heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) for the risk factor (RF) analysis that can be used for informative RF selection and the prediction of osteoporosis. The RF selection is a task designed for ranking and explaining the semantics of informative RFs for preventing the disease and improving the understanding of the disease. Predicting the risk of osteoporosis in a prospective and population-based study is a task for monitoring the bone disease progression. We apply a variety of well-trained deep belief network (DBN) models which inherit the following good properties: (1) pinpointing the underlying causes of the disease in order to assess the risk of a patient in developing a target disease, and (2) discriminating between patients suffering from the disease and without the disease for the purpose of selecting RFs of the disease. A variety of DBN models can capture characteristics for different patient groups via a training procedure with the use of different samples. The case study shows that the proposed method can be efficiently used to select the informative RFs. Most of the selected RFs are validated by the medical literature and some new RFs will attract interests across the medical research. Moreover, the experimental analysis on a real bone disease data set shows that the proposed framework can successfully predict the progression of osteoporosis. The stable and promising performance on the evaluation metrics confirms the effectiveness of our model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In each cycle, the equipment operates to generate heat to raise the room temperature and shuts down when the desired temperature is reached. This research studies the cyclic characteristics of typical gas burning furnaces. Each cycle is divided into runtime and idle states. The runtime process is further decomposed into three phases: startup, stable operation and shutdown. The measured data shows that the length of runtime in each cycle remains constant but idle time varies from cycle to cycle responding to outdoor environmental conditions. Four Data Mining Algorithms (DMAs) including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to analyze the relationship between cycle idle time and weather conditions based on actual minute-by-minute electricity usage data of two furnaces in a residential house and weather data from the near-by weather station for a period of four months (January to April 2011). The obtained results show that SVM and ANN provide more accurate predictions of idle time. Parametric correlation analysis indicates that indoor-outdoor temperature difference and wind speed are two key parameters affecting cycle idle time. The obtained results on the cyclic characteristics of a heating equipment provide essential information for estimate heating energy demand according to weather conditions, determining the equipment's energy efficiency, and diagnosing potential faults in its operation.

A data-mining approach is presented in this paper for modeling and short-term prediction of the complicated non-linear system. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) ensemble performs best among the data mining algorithms discussed in this paper. A clustering-based method from preprocessing input data to construct the prediction models is proposed to decreases the prediction errors and the computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a practical case study with both modeling and short-term prediction. The analytical results showed that the method was capable of reducing the prediction errors for modeling and short-term prediction by 11.05% and 12.21%, respectively, comparing with the models built without clustering method.

The method is tested in a medium office building. The average percentage of correctly classified individual behavior instances is 90.29%. The average correlation coefficient between the predicted group schedule and the ground truth is 0.94. The experimental result also shows a fairly consistent group occupancy schedule, while capturing the diversified individual behavior in using office appliances. Compared to the occupancy schedule used in the Department of Energy prototype medium office building models, the learned schedule has a 36.67-50.53% lower occupancy rate for different weekdays. The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption impact of this discrepancy is investigated by simulating the prototype EnergyPlus models across 17 different climate zones. The simulation result shows that the occupancy schedules' impact on the building HVAC energy consumption has large variations for the buildings under different climate conditions.

The prediction models were constructed using 768 experimental datasets from the literature with 8 input parameters and 2 output parameters (cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL)). Comparison results showed that the ensemble approach (SVR +ANN) and SVR were the best models for predicting CL and HL, respectively, with mean absolute percentage errors below 4%. Compared to previous works, the ensemble model and SVR model further obtained at least 39.0% to 65.9% lower root mean square errors, respectively, for CL and HL prediction. This study confirms the efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach when predicting CL and HL in building design stage. The analytical results support the feasibility of using the proposed techniques to facilitate early designs of energy conserving buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Chinese medicine doctors (CMDs) follow the traditional treatment rules to select or administer these diverse Chinese medicine formulae. The main purpose of our study was to explore data on the frequency of medication and medication habits by CMDs for the treatment of URTIs with Chinese herbs and Chinese medicine formulae. Methods: The TCM treatments for patients consulting with an URTIs were analyzed from the National Health Insurance Research Database using the appropriate codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses for Taiwan in 2009. A data mining and association rules, were used to analyze co-prescriptions of TCM for patients with URTIs. Results: For 472,005 patients who sought the treatment of URTIs, a total of 46,805 patients with URTIs received TCM treatments, of these 29,052 patients sought both TCM and Western medication treatments. Of the URTIs patients who had received a TCM treatment, 79% presented with an acute common cold, 9% had influenza, and 9% had acute upper respiratory infections. Furthermore, 53.89% of the sample were aged between 20 and 49 years, and 62.84% were women, 3.56% of the patients used Yin-Qiao-San and 2.76% used Jie-Geng. Yin-Qiao-San and Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang were the most commonly combinations of prescriptions for patients with URTIs. Conclusions: The patients experiencing URTIs were more likely to request TCM treatment if their symptoms were mild and they were women. The Chinese medicine doctors treating URTIs generally followed TCM theory. A coding system for TCM diagnostic classifications could improve evaluations of TCM treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

We developed a NLP-based goal elicitation approach within the context of KAOS goal-oriented requirements engineering method. The hierarchical relationships among goals are inferred by automatically building taxonomies from extracted goals. We use smart metering system as a case study to investigate the proposed approach. Smart metering system is an important subsystem of the next generation of power systems (smart grids). Goals are extracted by semantically parsing the grammar of goal-related phrases in abstracts of research publications. The results of this case study show that the developed approach is an effective way to model goals for complex systems, and in particular, for the research-intensive complex systems.

A total of 1742 calving records were used. Proportions of correctly detected difficult and easy calvings in a test set were 75.0%, 92.0% and 75.0%, 77.3%, for heifers and multiparous cows, respectively. The key predictors of calving difficulty were: pregnancy length, body condition score index, calving age, proportion of Holstein-Friesian genes (for heifers) as well as calving and calving-to-conception intervals, mean daily milk yield, fat and protein content in milk and 4%-fat corrected milk yield (for cows). The data mining method used in this study allowed us to obtain the models of good quality, confirmed by their relatively high effectiveness of detecting dystoiic animals.

When the operating context changes, one may fine-tune the by-default (incontextual) prediction or may even abstain from predicting a value (a reject). Global reframing solutions, where the same function is applied to adapt the estimated outputs to a new cost context, are possible solutions here. An alternative approach, which has not been studied in a comprehensive way for regression in the knowledge discovery and data mining literature, is the use of a local (e. g., probabilistic) reframing approach, where decisions are made according to the estimated output and a reliability, confidence, or probability estimation. In this article, we advocate for a simple two-parameter (mean and variance) approach, working with a normal conditional probability density. Given the conditional mean produced by any regression technique, we develop lightweight "enrichment" methods that produce good estimates of the conditional variance, which are used by the probabilistic (local) reframing methods. We apply these methods to some very common families of cost-sensitive problems, such as optimal predictions in (auction) bids, asymmetric loss scenarios, and rejection rules.

Among other tasks, matrix factorizations are often used to separate global structure from noise. This, however, requires solving the "model order selection problem" of determining the proper rank of the factorization, that is, to answer where fine-grained structure stops, and where noise starts. Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF)-where data, factors, and matrix product are Boolean-has in recent years received increased attention from the data mining community. The technique has desirable properties, such as high interpretability and natural sparsity. Yet, so far no method for selecting the correct model order for BMF has been available. In this article, we propose the use of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for this task. Besides solving the problem, this well-founded approach has numerous benefits; for example, it is automatic, does not require a likelihood function, is fast, and, as experiments show, is highly accurate. We formulate the description length function for BMF in general-making it applicable for any BMF algorithm. We discuss how to construct an appropriate encoding: starting from a simple and intuitive approach, we arrive at a highly efficient data-to-model-based encoding for BMF. We extend an existing algorithm for BMF to use MDL to identify the best Boolean matrix factorization, analyze the complexity of the problem, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation to study its behavior.

J	Riondato, M; Upfal, E				Riondato, Matteo; Upfal, Eli			Efficient Discovery of Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets through Sampling with Tight Performance Guarantees	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Association rules; data mining; frequent itemsets; sampling; VC-dimension	VC-DIMENSION; CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM	The tasks of extracting (top-K) Frequent Itemsets (FIs) and Association Rules (ARs) are fundamental primitives in data mining and database applications. Exact algorithms for these problems exist and are widely used, but their running time is hindered by the need of scanning the entire dataset, possibly multiple times. High-quality approximations of FIs and ARs are sufficient for most practical uses. Sampling techniques can be used for fast discovery of approximate solutions, but works exploring this technique did not provide satisfactory performance guarantees on the quality of the approximation due to the difficulty of bounding the probability of under- or oversampling any one of an unknown number of frequent itemsets. We circumvent this issue by applying the statistical concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension to develop a novel technique for providing tight bounds on the sample size that guarantees approximation of the (top-K) FIs and ARs within user-specified parameters. The resulting sample size is linearly dependent on the VC-dimension of a range space associated with the dataset. We analyze the VC-dimension of this range space and show that it is upper bounded by an easy-to-compute characteristic quantity of the dataset, the d-index, namely, the maximum integer d such that the dataset contains at least d transactions of length at least d such that no one of them is a superset of or equal to another. We show that this bound is tight for a large class of datasets. The resulting sample size is a significant improvement over previous known results. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique on real and artificial datasets, demonstrating the practicality of our methods, and showing that they achieve even higher quality approximations than what is guaranteed by the analysis.

J	Tang, JL; Liu, H				Tang, Jiliang; Liu, Huan			Feature Selection for Social Media Data	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Feature selection; social media data; social context	GENE SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; REGULARIZATION; MODEL	Feature selection is widely used in preparing high-dimensional data for effective data mining. The explosive popularity of social media produces massive and high-dimensional data at an unprecedented rate, presenting new challenges to feature selection. Social media data consists of (1) traditional high-dimensional, attribute-value data such as posts, tweets, comments, and images, and (2) linked data that provides social context for posts and describes the relationships between social media users as well as who generates the posts, and so on. The nature of social media also determines that its data is massive, noisy, and incomplete, which exacerbates the already challenging problem of feature selection. In this article, we study a novel feature selection problem of selecting features for social media data with its social context. In detail, we illustrate the differences between attribute-value data and social media data, investigate if linked data can be exploited in a new feature selection framework by taking advantage of social science theories. We design and conduct experiments on datasets from real-world social media Web sites, and the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of feature selection. Further experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of user-user and user-post relationships manifested in linked data on feature selection, and research issues for future work will be discussed.

Traditional approaches are based on the assumption that there is a global-level organization in the network. However, in many scenarios, each node is the bearer of complex information and cannot be classified in disjoint clusters. The top-down global view of the partition approach is not designed for this. Here, we represent this complex information as multiple latent labels, and we postulate that edges in the networks are created among nodes carrying similar labels. The latent labels are the communities a node belongs to and we discover them with a simple local-first approach to community discovery. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm, assuming that each node is aware of the label it shares with each of its connections. The local communities are merged hierarchically, unveiling the modular organization of the network at the global level and identifying overlapping groups and groups of groups. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping community discovery and found that our new method advances in the chosen scenarios in the quality of the obtained communities. We perform a test on benchmark and on real-world networks, evaluating the quality of the community coverage by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata attached to the nodes, which we consider external information about the latent labels. We also provide an explanation about why real-world networks contain overlapping communities and how our logic is able to capture them. Finally, we show how our method is deterministic, is incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on real-world scale networks.

In recent years, with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objects in real-world graphs, how to leverage not only structural but also attribute information for clustering attributed graphs becomes a new challenge. Most existing works took a distance-based approach. They proposed various distance measures to fuse structural and attribute information and then applied standard techniques for graph clustering based on these distance measures. In this article, we take an alternative view and propose a novel Bayesian framework for attributed graph clustering. Our framework provides a general and principled solution to modeling both the structural and the attribute aspects of a graph. It avoids the artificial design of a distance measure in existing methods and, furthermore, can seamlessly handle graphs with different types of edges and vertex attributes. We develop an efficient variational method for graph clustering under this framework and derive two concrete algorithms for clustering unweighted and weighted attributed graphs. Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art distance-based method, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

In the second one, a scheme based on data mining techniques is proposed to characterize the errors between a P-1 and a P-2 finite element Particle-In-Cell approach. Beyond these examples, this original approach should operate in all cases where intricate numerical simulations like for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations take a central part.

An ontology-based Web mining method for unemployment rate prediction	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Unemployment rate prediction; Search engine query data; Domain ontology; Web mining; Neural networks; Support vector regressions	MODEL; NEWS; SYSTEM	Unemployment rate is one of the most critical economic indicators. By analyzing and predicting unemployment rate, government officials can develop appropriate labor market related policies in response to the current economic situation. Accordingly, unemployment rate prediction has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. The main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel ontology-based Web mining framework that leverages search engine queries to improve the accuracy of unemployment rate prediction. The proposed framework is underpinned by a domain ontology which captures unemployment related concepts and their semantic relationships to facilitate the extraction of useful prediction features from relevant search engine queries. In addition, state-of-the-art feature selection methods and data mining models such as neural networks and support vector regressions are exploited to enhance the effectiveness of unemployment rate prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline forecasting approaches that have been widely used for unemployment rate prediction. Our empirical findings also confirm that domain ontology and search engine queries can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of unemployment rate prediction. A unique advantage of the proposed framework is that it not only improves prediction performance but also provides human comprehensible explanations for the changes of unemployment rate. The business implication of our research work is that government officials and human resources managers can utilize the proposed framework to effectively analyze unemployment rate, and hence to better develop labor market related policies.

It constitutes an overview of empirical evidence behind key objectives of the potential adoption of LA/EDM in generic educational strategic planning. We examined the literature on experimental case studies conducted in the domain during the past six years (2008-2013). Search terms identified 209 mature pieces of research work, but inclusion criteria limited the key studies to 40. We analyzed the research questions, methodology and findings of these published papers and categorized them accordingly. We used non-statistical methods to evaluate and interpret findings of the collected studies. The results have highlighted four distinct major directions of the LA/EDM empirical research. We discuss on the emerged added value of LA/EDM research and highlight the significance of further implications. Finally, we set our thoughts on possible uncharted key questions to investigate both from pedagogical and technical considerations.

J	Fang, G; Wu, Y				Fang, Gang; Wu, Yue			A General Framework Based on Composite Granules for Mining Association Rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Repartitioning frequent attributes; mixed radix information system; composite granules; granular computing; general data mining	CANDIDATE GENERATION; FREQUENT PATTERNS; DATABASE	At present many algorithms for mining association rules have been proposed, but most of them are only suitable for discovering specific frequent itemsets from characteristic data sets on the appointed environments, namely, these algorithms are not general enough when mining association rules. In this paper, a general framework based on composite granules for mining association rules is proposed, which is a general data mining model without appointed restriction from frequent itemsets, data sets or mining environments and so on. An iterative method is efficiently applied to the general mining framework for discovering frequent itemsets, which adopts repartitioning frequent attributes to iteratively reconstruct the mixed radix information system for reducing a relational database. In order that the framework for discovering frequent itemsets has a generality, in discussing and establishing the general mining framework, this paper introduces a novel conception and data model, namely, a mixed radix information system is applied to describe a relational database, and a composite granules is used to build a specific relationship between an information system and a mixed radix information system, which can hold the same extension and simultaneously exist in two different information systems. The mixed radix information system can help the general framework to reduce information data and improve the performance of the framework for generating frequent itemsets. The composite granules model can create a relationship between an information granule and a digital information granule, and help the framework for computing the support to avoid reading the database repeatedly or using the complex data structure. Finally, a new taxonomy is presented to verify the generality and the high efficiency of the mining framework and all the experiments based on the taxonomy indicate that the general mining framework has the required generality, and the performance of the framework is better than these classical mining frameworks.

The RBF model is used for regression analysis tasks. The novel aspect of the proposed protocol lies to the fact that it assumes a malicious user model and does not use homomorphic cryptographic methods, which are inherently only suited for a semi-trusted user environment. The performance analysis shows that the communication overhead is low enough to warranty its use while the computational complexity is identical in most cases with the centralized computation scenario (e.g. a trusted third party). The accuracy of the output model is only marginally subpar to a centralized computation on the union of all datasets.

Land usage classification: a hierarchical neural network approach	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; PATTERN	The classification of land usage in mountain grassland bovine areas is important for the management of forage production and grazing in grass-based livestock systems. The present paper proposes a novel, hierarchical neural network-based approach towards the classification of land usage in these areas. A survey of 72 farms was conducted in the Massif Central (France). Information was gathered on geographical characteristics and cutting and/or grazing practices on three general groups of fields: cut only, cut and grazed and grazed only fields. To classify land usage, the data were clustered and visualized in a hierarchical fashion. This was done by using a novel method for the analysis and classification of data based on growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM). Self-organizing maps (SOM) have been shown to be successful for the analysis of highly dimensional input data in data mining applications as well as for data visualization. Moreover, the hierarchical architecture of the GHSOM is more flexible than a single SOM in the adaptation process to input data, capturing inherent hierarchical relationships among them. Experimental results show the utility of this approach.	[Palomo, E.

Radial positioning of the chromosome territories (CTs) was independent of gene density, but size dependent. While no changes in radial positioning during the cell cycle were detected, there were stage-specific differences between cell types. Each CT was in close proximity (interaction) with a similar number of other CT except the gene rich CT17 which had significantly more interactions. Furthermore, CT17 was a member of the highest pairwise CT combinations with multiple interactions. Major differences were detected in the pairwise interaction profiles of MCF10A versus WI38 including cell cycle alterations from G1 to S. These alterations in interaction profiles were subdivided into five types: overall increase, overall decrease, switching from 1 to >= 2 interactions, vice versa, or no change. A global data mining program termed the chromatic median determined the most probable overall association network for the entire subset of CT. This probabilistic interchromosomal network was nearly completely different between the two cell lines. It was also strikingly altered across the cell cycle in MCF10A, but only slightly in WI38. We conclude that CT undergo multiple and preferred interactions with other CT in the nucleus and form preferred -albeit probabilistic-interchromosomal networks. This network of interactions is altered across the cell cycle and between cell types. It is intriguing to consider the relationship of these alterations to the corresponding changes in the gene expression program across the cell cycle and in different cell types.

The use of data mining to assist crop protection decisions on kiwifruit in New Zealand	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Machine learning; Data mining; Pest management; Decision support	MACHINE; DAMAGE; SPAIN	Data mining algorithms were used to develop models to forecast the outcome of leafroller pest monitoring decisions on 'Hayward' kiwifruit crops in New Zealand. Using industry spray diary and pest monitoring data gathered at an orchard block level for compliance purposes, 80 attributes (independent variables) were created in three categories from the spray diary data: (1) individual insecticide applications applied during 2-week time windows, (2) groups of insecticide applications within time periods prior to or after fruit set and (3) orchard management attributes. Five machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine) and one statistical method (Logistic regression) (classifiers) were used to develop models to forecast insecticide application decisions for leafroller control, by predicting whether pest monitoring results were above or below a spray threshold. Models to forecast 2011 spraying decisions were trained on 2008 and 2009 data and tested on 2010 data. Forecasts were made for spray and no-spray decisions based upon pre-determined acceptable rates of precision (proportion of correct decisions in test results). Orchard blocks in which a forecast could not be made to a prescribed degree of precision were recommended to be monitored, which is the normal practice. Spray decisions could not be forecast to an acceptable degree of precision, but decisions not to spray were successfully forecast for 49% of the blocks to a precision of 98% (AdaBoost) and 70% of the blocks to a precision of 95% (Naive Bayes). Models with as few as four attributes gave useful forecasts, and orchard management attributes were the most important determinants of model forecasting accuracy. The potential for this methodology to assist with pest spray forecasting using customised data sets is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hill, M.

While developmental pathways such as canonical Wnt signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition have received much attention, our understanding of the role of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in tumor progression remains rudimentary. Protein components of PCP, including a subset that overlaps with the canonical Wnt pathway, partition in polarized epithelial cells along the planar axis and are required for the establishment and maintenance of lateral epithelial polarity. Significant insight into PCP regulation of developmental and cellular processes has come from analysis of the functions of the core PCP scaffolding proteins Vangl1 and Vangl2. In particular, studies on zebrafish and with Looptail (Lp) mice, which harbor point mutations in Vangl2 that alter its trafficking and localization, point to roles for the PCP pathway in maintaining cell polarization along both the apical-basal and planar axes as well as in collective cell motility and invasiveness. Recent findings have suggested that the Vangls can promote similar processes in tumor cells. Initial data-mining efforts suggest that VANGL1 and VANGL2 are dysregulated in human cancers, and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients whose tumors exhibit elevated VANGL1 expression suffer from shortened overall survival. Overall, evidence is beginning to accumulate that the heightened cellular motility and invasiveness associated with PCP reactivation may contribute to the malignancy of some cancer subtypes.

FLI1 Expression is Correlated with Breast Cancer Cellular Growth, Migration, and Invasion and Altered Gene Expression	NEOPLASIA			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; ETS FAMILY; PDEF EXPRESSION; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; TUMORS; TISSUE; ROLES; MEGAKARYOPOIESIS; PROLIFERATION	ETS factors have been shown to be dysregulated in breast cancer. ETS factors control the expression of genes involved in many biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. FLI1 is an ETS protein aberrantly expressed in retrovirus-induced hematological tumors, but limited attention has been directed towards elucidating the role of FLI1 in epithelial-derived cancers. Using data mining, we show that loss of FLI1 expression is associated with shorter survival and more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer. Gain and loss of function cellular studies indicate the inhibitory effect of FLI1 expression on cellular growth, migration, and invasion. Using Fli1 mutant mice and both a transgenic murine breast cancer model and an orthotopic injection of syngeneic tumor cells indicates that reduced Fli1 contributes to accelerated tumor growth. Global expression analysis and RNA-Seq data from an invasive human breast cancer cell line with over expression of either FLI1 and another ETS gene, PDEF, shows changes in several cellular pathways associated with cancer, such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. This study demonstrates a novel role for FLI1 in epithelial cells. In addition, these results reveal that FLI1 down-regulation in breast cancer may promote tumor progression.

Conjugative plasmids of the IncA/C incompatibility group have become a substantial threat due to their broad host-range, the extended spectrum of antimicrobial resistance they confer, their prevalence in enteric bacteria and their very efficient spread by conjugation. However, their biology remains largely unexplored. Using the IncA/C conjugative plasmid pVCR94 Delta X as a prototype, we have investigated the regulatory circuitry that governs IncA/C plasmids dissemination and found that the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD is essential for the expression of plasmid transfer genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with exonuclease digestion (ChIP-exo) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, we have identified the sequences recognized by AcaCD and characterized the AcaCD regulon. Data mining using the DNA motif recognized by AcaCD revealed potential AcaCD-binding sites upstream of genes involved in the intracellular mobility functions (recombination directionality factor and mobilization genes) in two widespread classes of genomic islands (GIs) phylogenetically unrelated to IncA/C plasmids. The first class, SGI1, confers and propagates multidrug resistance in Salmonella enterica and Proteus mirabilis, whereas MGIVmi1 in Vibrio mimicus belongs to a previously uncharacterized class of GIs. We have demonstrated that through expression of AcaCD, IncA/C plasmids specifically trigger the excision and mobilization of the GIs at high frequencies. This study provides new evidence of the considerable impact of IncA/C plasmids on bacterial genome plasticity through their own mobility and the mobilization of genomic islands.

Generalization is widely used in privacy-preserving data mining and can also be viewed as a natural way of compressing a dataset. In min-max generalization problems, the input consists of data items with weights and a lower bound wlb, and the goal is to partition individual items into groups of weight at least w(lb) while minimizing the maximum weight of a group. The rules of legal partitioning are specific to a problem. Du et al. consider several problems in this vein: (1) partitioning a graph into connected subgraphs, (2) partitioning unstructured data into arbitrary classes, and (3) partitioning a two-dimensional array into contiguous rectangles (subarrays) that satisfy these weight requirements. We significantly improve approximation ratios for all the problems considered by Du et al. and provide additional motivation for these problems. Moreover, for the first problem, whereas Du et al. give approximation algorithms for specific graph families, namely, 3-connected and 4-connected planar graphs, no approximation algorithm that works for all graphs was known prior to this work.

Despite the prolific growth of web-based resources, systematic evaluation and assessment of their efficacy remains limited. We used clickstream analytics, a widely available method for tracking website visitors and their behavior, to evaluate >60,000 visits over three years to an educational website focused on ecology. Visits originating from search engine queries were a small proportion of the traffic, suggesting the need to actively promote websites to drive visitation. However, the number of visits referred to the website per social media post varied depending on the social media platform and the quality of those visits (e.g., time on site and number of pages viewed) was significantly lower than visits originating from other referring websites. In particular, visitors referred to the website through targeted promotion (e. g., inclusion in a website listing classroom teaching resources) had higher quality visits. Once engaged in the site's core content, visitor retention was high; however, visitors rarely used the tutorial resources that serve to explain the site's use. Our results demonstrate that simple changes in website design, content and promotion are likely to increase the number of visitors and their engagement. While there is a growing emphasis on using the web to broaden the impacts of biological research, time and resources remain limited. Clickstream analytics provides an easily accessible, relatively fast and quantitative means by which those engaging in educational outreach can improve upon their efforts.

Because of the uncertainty and nonlinearity, short-term traffic flow forecasting could be a challenging task. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) could be a good solution to this issue as it is possible to obtain a higher forecasting accuracy within relatively short time through this tool. Traditional methods for traffic flow forecasting generally based on a separated single point. However, it is found that traffic flows from adjacent intersections show a similar trend. It indicates that the vehicle accumulation and dissipation influence the traffic volumes of the adjacent intersections. This paper presents a novel method, which considers the travel flows of the adjacent intersections when forecasting the one of the middle. Computational experiments show that the proposed model is both effective and practical. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To achieve this, customers likely to defect need to be identified so that they can be approached with tailored incentives or other bespoke retention offers. Such strategies call for predictive models capable of identifying customers with higher probabilities of defecting in the relatively near future. A review of the extant literature on customer churn models reveals that although several predictive models have been developed to model churn in B2C contexts, the B2B context in general, and non-contractual settings in particular, have received less attention in this regard. Therefore, to address these gaps, this study proposes a data-mining approach to model noncontractual customer churn in B2B contexts. Several modeling techniques are compared in terms of their ability to predict true churners. The best performing data-mining technique (boosting) is then applied to develop a profit maximizing retention campaign.

These documents, written in natural language, provide valuable information during the software development stage, but also in future maintenance and evolution tasks. DMOSS3 is a toolkit designed to systematically assess the quality of non source code content found in software packages. The toolkit handles a package as an attribute tree, and performs several tree traverse algorithms through a set of plugins, specialized in retrieving specific metrics from text, gathering information about the software. These metrics are later used to infer knowledge about the software, and composed together to build reports that assess the quality of specific features. This paper discusses the motivations for this work, continues with a description of the toolkit implementation and design goals. This is followed by an example of its usage to process a software package, and the produced report.

In Singapore, an average of 1490 woman (29%) were diagnosed with breast cancer and the number of cases has been steadily increasing from 2005 to 2009. Breast cancers are on a trajectory to become the greatest proportion of cancers deaths. The probability of men contracting breast cancer is about 100 times lower than the risk for women, but the survival rate of breast cancer for men is about the same as for women. This survival rate depends on in which stage the cancer was detected. In general, the rates get better the earlier the cancer is detected. Therefore, an early diagnosis is very important to increase the live span of a patient. Objectives: To develop a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to detect cancer cells from mammogram images. Perform data mining on these images to characterize and classify normal, benign and malignant breast tumors. Methods: Prior to feature extraction, the mammogram images were standardized through pre-processing. The feature extraction itself was carried out using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). After that, we identified normal, benign and malignant breast tumors with the help of different classifiers. Results: The results of the feature extraction step were subjected to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, which assessed their significance. Only clinically significant features were used for classification. From all the classifier we have analyzed, the Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC) provided the best result. It can diagnose the three classes with 82.9% of accuracy, 94.9% of Positive Predictive Value (PPV), 96.7% for sensitivity and 94.4% for specificity. Conclusion: Mammography based CAD systems can aid practitioners during their task of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

The presence of such motifs is usually associated with key biological functions. However, the identification of structural motifs is far from easy. Unlike motifs in sequences, which have conserved bases, structural motifs have common structure arrangements even if the underlying sequences are different. Over the past few years, hundreds of algorithms have been published for the discovery of sequential motifs, while less work has been done for the structural motifs case. Current structural motif discovery algorithms are limited in terms of accuracy and scalability. In this paper, we present an incremental and scalable algorithm for discovering RNA secondary structure motifs, namely IncMD. We consider the structural motif discovery as a frequent pattern mining problem and tackle it using a modified a priori algorithm. IncMD uses data structures, trie-based linked lists of prefixes (LLP), to accelerate the search and retrieval of patterns, support counting, and candidate generation. We modify the candidate generation step in order to adapt it to the RNA secondary structure representation. IncMD constructs the frequent patterns incrementally from RNA secondary structure basic elements, using nesting and joining operations. The notion of a motif group is introduced in order to simulate an alignment of motifs that only differ in the number of unpaired bases. In addition, we use a cluster beam approach to select motifs that will survive to the next iterations of the search. Results indicate that IncMD can perform better than some of the available structural motif	[Badr, Ghada; Al-Turaiki, Isra; Mathkour, Hassan] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Badr, Ghada] Univ & Res Dist, IRI City Sci Res & Technol Applicat, Alexandria, Egypt; [Turcotte, Marcel] Univ Ottawa, Fac Engn, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada	Badr, G (reprint author), King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.	badrghada@hotmail.com; ialturaiki@ksu.edu.sa; turcotte@eecs.uottawa.ca; mathkour@ksu.edu.sa			National Plan for Sciences and Technology, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [12-BIO2605-02]	This research has been supported by the National Plan for Sciences and Technology, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Project No. 12-BIO2605-02).

Since social learning is a key element of scalable education on MOOC and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is on understanding forum activities. Two salient features of these activities drive our research: (1) high decline rate: for each course studied, the volume of discussion declined continuously throughout the duration of the course; (2) high-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30 percent of the courses produced new threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Further, a substantial portion of these discussions are not directly course-related. In our analysis, we investigate factors that are associated with the decline of activity on MOOC forums, and we find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we first use linear regression models to analyze the forum activity count data over time, and make a number of observations; for instance, the teaching staff's active participation in the discussions is correlated with an increase in the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and to design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Further, our algorithm is compared against two baselines using human evaluation from Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Typically, this person may sometimes forget completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In order to provide automatic assistance for the smart home resident through the embedded electronically controllable actuators and make the smart home resident able to live independently at home we propose to calculate a possibilistic logical space for correct realization of activities, which may be represented in form of a multivariable problem. Regardless from the physical entity (modality and location) of the intelligence source and the quantity of individuals who perform the activities; per each possible goal or activity, we consider a unique source of intelligence (for example a social mind) who directs the order of fuzzy events that occur in the ambient environment, then the plan behind world actuations is modeled applying extensions of the fuzzy logic. The main key point that we deal with is the analysis of the observations in order to make inferences about possible simultaneous activities that may be planned and realized by one or more individuals; so that we can reason in the cases the parallel activities are interrupted.

Classification with cluster-based Bayesian multi-nets using Ant Colony Optimisation	SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Data mining; Ant Colony Optimisation; Bayesian network classifiers; Cluster-based Bayesian multi-nets	NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; INDUCTION; KNOWLEDGE	Bayesian multi-net (BMN) classifiers consist of several local models, one for each data subset, to model asymmetric, more consistent dependency relationships among variables in each subset This paper extends an earlier work of ours and proposes several contributions to the field of clustering-based BMN classifiers, using Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO). First, we introduce a new medoid-based method for ACO-based clustering in the Ant-ClustB(MB) algorithm to learn BMNs. Both this algorithm and our previously introduced Ant-ClustB(IB) for instance-based clustering have their effectiveness empirically compared in the context of the "cluster-then-learn" approach, in which the ACO clustering step completes before learning the local BN classifiers. Second, we propose a novel "cluster-with-learn" approach, in which the ACO meta-heuristic performs the clustering and the BMN learning in a synergistic fashion. Third, we adopt the latter approach in two new ACO algorithms: ACO-ClustE(IB), using the instance-based method, and ACO-ClustB(MB), using the medoid-based method. Empirical results are obtained on 30 UCI datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, this research will focus on poor data quality that may be resulted from poor data acquisition process, and how to improve SOT Data quality utilizing CRISP-DM methodology. This research found that the data contain some quality issues including missing values, negative values, useless attributes, and outliers that may affect analysis result and conclusion. At the end, this research proves that Data Quality Mining processes and algorithms can improve data quality, which expected to contribute to SKK Migas data analysis improvement.

This industry involves many industries in value chain including transportations, tour operators, hotels, restaurants, and souvenirs. There are a large numbers of inbound tourist's travels to Thailand, this number mostly increased each year. Identifying tourist demands might be helpful to manage with the supply fulfillment. This study proposed an inbound tourist model by using data mining technique: classification algorithm. Data collections were undertaken from numbers of inbound AEC tourists who came to Thailand via Suwanaphum airport. The proposed model can be applied to understand the demand of inbound tourists in Thailand in order to develop appropriate strategic plans and marketing management not only for Thai tourism but also AEC Tourism. Future research for data mining of tourism data is also suggested.

We have developed a more powerful data mining methodology, to predict axillary lymph node (AxLN) metastasis and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in primary breast cancer patients. We developed websites to use these tools. The tools calculate the probability of AxLN metastasis (AxLN model) and pathological complete response to NAC (NAC model). As a calculation algorithm, we employed a decision tree-based prediction model known as the alternative decision tree (ADTree), which is an analog development of if-then type decision trees. An ensemble technique was used to combine multiple ADTree predictions, resulting in higher generalization abilities and robustness against missing values. The AxLN model was developed with training datasets (n=148) and test datasets (n=143), and validated using an independent cohort (n=174), yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.768. The NAC model was developed and validated with n=150 and n=173 datasets from a randomized controlled trial, yielding an AUC of 0.787. AxLN and NAC models require users to input up to 17 and 16 variables, respectively. These include pathological features, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and imaging findings. Each input variable has an option of "unknown," to facilitate prediction for cases with missing values. The websites developed facilitate the use of these tools, and serve as a database for accumulating new datasets.

They aim to give insight into the underlying urban phenomena linked to city dynamics and generally rely on data-mining tools to extract meaningful patterns from the huge volume of data recorded by such complex systems. This paper presents one such tool through the introduction of a family of generative models based on Poisson mixtures to automatically analyse and find temporal-based clusters in Origin/Destination flow-data. Such an approach may provide latent factors that reveal how regions of different usage interact over time. More generally, the proposed methodology can be used to cluster edges of temporal valued-graphs with respect to their temporal profiles and is thus particularly suited to mine patterns in dynamic Origin/Destination matrices commonly encountered in the field of transport. An in-depth analysis of the results of the proposed models was carried out on two months of trips data recorded on the Velib' Bike-Sharing System of Paris to validate the approach.

Neuropeptides encoded by the genomes of the Akoya pearl oyster Pinctata fucata and Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas: a bioinformatic and peptidomic survey	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Pinctada fucata; Crassostrea gigas; Molluscs; Circular dichroism; Egg-laying hormone; Feed circuit activating peptide; Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; High-performance liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Neuropeptides	DICHROISM SPECTROSCOPIC DATA; PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; APGWAMIDE-RELATED PEPTIDES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SEPIA-OFFICINALIS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; LYMNAEA-STAGNALIS; RFAMIDE NEUROPEPTIDES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BIVALVE MOLLUSK	Background: Oysters impart significant socio-ecological benefits from primary production of food supply, to estuarine ecosystems via reduction of water column nutrients, plankton and seston biomass. Little though is known at the molecular level of what genes are responsible for how oysters reproduce, filter nutrients, survive stressful physiological events and form reef communities. Neuropeptides represent a diverse class of chemical messengers, instrumental in orchestrating these complex physiological events in other species. Results: By a combination of in silico data mining and peptide analysis of ganglia, 74 putative neuropeptide genes were identified from genome and transcriptome databases of the Akoya pearl oyster, Pinctata fucata and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, encoding precursors for over 300 predicted bioactive peptide products, including three newly identified neuropeptide precursors PFGx8amide, RxIamide and Wx3Yamide. Our findings also include a gene for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and two egg-laying hormones (ELH) which were identified from both oysters. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis supports similar global organization of these mature peptides. Computer-based peptide modeling of the molecular tertiary structures of ELH highlights the structural homologies within ELH family, which may facilitate ELH activity leading to the release of gametes. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that oysters possess conserved molluscan neuropeptide domains and overall precursor organization whilst highlighting many previously unrecognized bivalve idiosyncrasies. This genomic analysis provides a solid foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional characterization of these molluscan neuropeptides can be conducted to further stimulate advances in understanding the ecology and cultivation of oysters.

In fact, although this activity has a great importance for the consequences that produces in terms of responsibility and allocation of economic resources, it is solely based on the quantification of some variables without specifying methods or analytical procedures. In this paper, after an instrumental survey of the road environment, we applied data mining techniques that consider the 'vagueness' of the analysed scenario. The type of algorithms used, therefore, permits to quantify a degree of membership (among 0 and 1) of a road to the groupings provided and to prepare any corrective action in order to direct the final result towards a specific class with greater precision. In addition, this method is very flexible and willing to contain new variables or observations at different times with great easiness. Moreover, the geographical location of the individual observations, as it was done also in this research, can be transferred to a GIS system, with a positive impact on maintenance programs.

Current approaches in analysing these data are unable to capture collective behaviour and correlations among moving objects. An example of these types of patterns is moving flocks. This article develops an improved algorithm for mining such patterns following a frequent pattern discovery approach, a well-known task in traditional data mining. It uses transaction-based data representation of trajectories to generate a database that facilitates the application of scalable and efficient frequent pattern mining algorithms. Results were compared with an existing method (Basic Flock Evaluation or BFE) and are demonstrated for both synthetic and real data sets with a large number of trajectories. The results illustrate a significant performance increase. Furthermore, the improved algorithm has been embedded into a visual environment that allows manipulation of input parameters and interactive recomputation of the resulting flocks. To illustrate the visual environment a data set containing 30 years of tropical cyclone tracks with 6 hourly observations is used. The example illustrates how the visual environment facilitates exploration and verification of flocks by changing the input parameters and instantly showing the spatio-temporal distribution of the resulting flocks in the Space-Time Cube and interactively selecting, querying and saving the resulting flocks for further analysis and verification.

If no application-specific knowledge about the nature of the time series is available, general purpose time series similarity measures can be used as kernel functions in SVM. The article compares several possible similarity measures, namely the linear Euclidean, triangle, polynomial probabilistic (with two variants), and shape space distances (SSD), as well as the nonlinear measures dynamic time warping (DTW), longest common subsequences, and time warp edit distance (TWED). Nonlinear (i.e., "elastic") measures take a nonlinear scaling of the time series in the time domain into account. First, these measures are used in combination with a nearest neighbor classifier, then the various similarity measures are taken to compute the kernel matrices for SVM. Simulation experiments with twenty publicly available benchmark data sets show, that with regard to classification accuracy, TWED performs very well over all measures, while SSD is the best linear measure. SSD has the lowest run-times, the fastest nonlinear measure is DTW. These claims are further investigated by applying statistical tests. With the results presented in this article and results from related investigations that are considered as well, we want to support practitioners or scholars in answering the following question: Which measure should be looked at first if accuracy is the most important criterion, if an application is time-critical, or if a compromise is needed?

An active learning paradigm based on a priori data reduction and organization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Active learning; Image annotation; Machine learning; Data mining	AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANNOTATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; PATH; SELECTION; RETRIEVAL; SVMS	In the past few years, active learning has been reasonably successful and it has drawn a lot of attention. However, recent active learning methods have focused on strategies in which a large unlabeled dataset has to be reprocessed at each learning iteration. As the datasets grow, these strategies become inefficient or even a tremendous computational challenge. In order to address these issues, we propose an effective and efficient active learning paradigm which attains a significant reduction in the size of the learning set by applying an a priori process of identification and organization of a small relevant subset. Furthermore, the concomitant classification and selection processes enable the classification of a very small number of samples, while selecting the informative ones. Experimental results showed that the proposed paradigm allows to achieve high accuracy quickly with minimum user interaction, further improving its efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Before or during their courses the academic institutions try to estimate the percentage of successful students. But is it possible to predict the success rate of students enrolled in their courses? Are there any specific student characteristics, which can be associated with the student success rate? Is there any relevant student data available to HEIs on the basis of which they could predict the student success rate? The answers to the above research questions can generally be obtained using data mining tools. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms work best with large data sets, while student data, available to HEIs, related to courses are limited and falls into the category of small data sets. Thus, the study focuses on data mining for small student data sets and aims to answer the above research questions by comparing two different data mining tools. The conclusions of this study are very promising and will encourage HEIs to incorporate data mining tools as an important part of their higher education knowledge management systems.

Analyzing this conduction facilitates the forecasting of future traffic situation; therefore, a navigation system can reduce traffic congestion and improve transportation mobility. This study describes a methodology for traffic conduction analysis modeling based on extracting important time-related conduction rules using a type of evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Network Programming (GNP). The extracted rules construct a useful model for forecasting future traffic situations and analyzing traffic conduction.

Illuminating the Origins of Spectral Properties of Green Fluorescent Proteins via Proteochemometric and Molecular Modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						green fluorescent protein; proteochemometrics; chromophore; data mining; molecular modeling	QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY; MELANOCORTIN RECEPTORS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; STRUCTURAL BASIS; GFP CHROMOPHORE; GENE-EXPRESSION; AMINO-ACIDS; WILD-TYPE; AEQUOREA	Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has immense utility in biomedical imaging owing to its autofluorescent nature. In efforts to broaden the spectral diversity of GFP, there have been several reports of engineered mutants via rational design and random mutagenesis. Understanding the origins of spectral properties of GFP could be achieved by means of investigating its structure-activity relationship. The first quantitative structure-property relationship study for modeling the spectral properties, particularly the excitation and emission maximas, of GFP was previously proposed by us some years ago in which quantum chemical descriptors were used for model development. However, such simplified model does not consider possible effects that neighboring amino acids have on the conjugated pi-system of GFP chromophore. This study describes the development of a unified proteochemometric model in which the GFP chromophore and amino acids in its vicinity are both considered in the same model. The predictive performance of the model was verified by internal and external validation as well as gamma-scrambling. Our strategy provides a general solution for elucidating the contribution that specific ligand and protein descriptors have on the investigated spectral property, which may be useful in engineering novel GFP variants with desired characteristics.

J	Weggler, BA; Groger, T; Zimmermann, R				Weggler, Benedikt A.; Groeger, Thomas; Zimmermann, Ralf			Advanced scripting for the automated profiling of two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry data from combustion aerosol	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Hyphenated Techniques in Chromatography and Separation Technology	JAN 29-31, 2014	Bruges, BELGIUM			Comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography; Data mining; Ship fuel combustion; Aerosol	ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; PARTICULATE MATTER; CLIMATE	Multidimensional gas chromatography is an appropriate tool for the non-targeted and comprehensive characterisation of complex samples generated from combustion processes. Particulate matter (PM) emission is composed of a large number of compounds, including condensed semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). However, the complex amount of information gained from such comprehensive techniques is associated with difficult and time-consuming data analysis. Because of this obstacle, two-dimensional gas chromatography still receives relatively little use in aerosol science [1-4]. To remedy this problem, advanced scripting algorithms based on knowledge-based rules (KBRs) were developed in-house and applied to GCxGC-TOFMS data. Previously reported KBRs and newer findings were considered for the development of these algorithms. The novelty of the presented advanced scripting tools is a notably selective search criterion for data screening, which is primarily based on fragmentation patterns and the presence of specific fragments. Combined with "classical" approaches based on retention times, a fast, accurate and automated data evaluation method was developed, which was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for type 1 and type 2 errors. The method's applicability was further tested for PM filter samples obtained from ship fuel combustion. Major substance classes, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), alkanes, benzenes, esters and ethers, can be targeted. This approach allows the classification of approximately 75% of the peaks of interest within real PM samples. Various conditions of combustion, such as fuel composition and engine load, could be clearly characterised and differentiated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In contrast to well-known measures from the literature, our approach considers the general shape of a time series rather than standard distance of function (value) comparison. The new distance was used in classification with the nearest neighbor rule. Now we improve on our previous technique by adding the second derivative. In order to provide a comprehensive comparison, we conducted a set of experiments, testing effectiveness on 47 time series datasets from a wide variety of application domains. Our experiments show that this new method provides a significantly more accurate classification on the examined datasets.

Topic modeling for cluster analysis of large biological and medical datasets	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society (MCBIOS)	MAR 06-08, 2014	Stillwater, OH	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc	Oklahoma State Univ		GENE-EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; CANCER	Background: The big data moniker is nowhere better deserved than to describe the ever-increasing prodigiousness and complexity of biological and medical datasets. New methods are needed to generate and test hypotheses, foster biological interpretation, and build validated predictors. Although multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis may allow researchers to identify groups, or clusters, of related variables, the accuracies and effectiveness of traditional clustering methods diminish for large and hyper dimensional datasets. Topic modeling is an active research field in machine learning and has been mainly used as an analytical tool to structure large textual corpora for data mining. Its ability to reduce high dimensionality to a small number of latent variables makes it suitable as a means for clustering or overcoming clustering difficulties in large biological and medical datasets. Results: In this study, three topic model-derived clustering methods, highest probable topic assignment, feature selection and feature extraction, are proposed and tested on the cluster analysis of three large datasets: Salmonella pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) dataset, lung cancer dataset, and breast cancer dataset, which represent various types of large biological or medical datasets. All three various methods are shown to improve the efficacy/effectiveness of clustering results on the three datasets in comparison to traditional methods. A preferable cluster analysis method emerged for each of the three datasets on the basis of replicating known biological truths. Conclusion: Topic modeling could be advantageously applied to the large datasets of biological or medical research. The three proposed topic model-derived clustering methods, highest probable topic assignment, feature selection and feature extraction, yield clustering improvements for the three different data types. Clusters more efficaciously represent truthful groupings and subgroupings in the data than traditional methods, suggesting that topic model-based methods could provide an analytic advancement in the analysis of large biological or medical datasets.

However, existing stock prediction models adopt feature selection algorithms that rely on correlation analysis. This paper is the first to apply observational data-based causal analysis to stock prediction. Causalities represent direct influences between various stock features (important for stock analysis), while correlations cannot distinguish direct influences from indirect ones. This study proposes the causal feature selection (CFS) algorithm to select more representative features for better stock prediction modeling. CFS first identifies causalities between variables and then, based on the results, generates a feature subset. Based on 13-year data from the Shanghai Stock Exchanges, comparative experiments were conducted between CFS and three well-known feature selection algorithms, namely, principal component analysis (PCA), decision trees (DT; CART), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). CFS performs best in terms of accuracy and precision in most cases when combined with each of the seven baseline models, and identifies 18 important consistent features. In conclusion, CFS has considerable potential to improve the development of QI product. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A common structural motif for such probes consists of a reporter that can be attached by copper(I)-catalyzed 1,2,3-triazole formation between terminal alkynes and azides to a reactive headgroup. Here we introduce the synthesis and application of the new thiazole-based, azide-tagged reporter 4-(3-azidopropoxy)-5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl) thiazole for fluorescence, UV and mass spectrometry (MS) detection. This small fluorescent reporter bears a bromine functionalization facilitating the automated data mining of electrospray ionization MS runs by monitoring for its characteristic isotope signature. We demonstrate the universal utility of the reporter for the detection of an alkyne-modified small molecule by LC-MS and for the visualization of a model protein by in-gel fluorescence. The novel probe advantageously compares with commercially available azide-modified fluorophores and a brominated one. The ease of synthesis, small size, stability, and the universal detection possibilities make it an ideal reporter for activity-based protein profiling and functional metabolic profiling.

However, the prognostic significance of CXCL1 expression in breast cancer has not been fully characterized. Fibroblasts are important cellular components of the breast tumor microenvironment, and recent studies indicate that this cell type is a potential source of CXCL1 expression in breast tumors. The goal of this study was to further characterize the expression patterns of CXCL1 in breast cancer stroma, determine the prognostic significance of stromal CXCL1 expression, and identify factors affecting stromal CXCL1 expression. Methods: Stromal CXCL1 protein expression was analyzed in 54 normal and 83 breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry staining. RNA expression of CXCL1 in breast cancer stroma was analyzed through data mining in www.Oncomine.org. The relationships between CXCL1 expression and prognostic factors were analyzed by univariate analysis. Co-immunofluorescence staining for CXCL1, a-Smooth Muscle Actin (alpha-SMA) and Fibroblast Specific Protein 1 (FSP1) expression was performed to analyze expression of CXCL1 in fibroblasts. By candidate profiling, the TGF-beta signaling pathway was identified as a regulator of CXCL1 expression in fibroblasts. Expression of TGF-beta and SMAD gene products were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and data mining analysis. The relationships between stromal CXCL1 and TGF-beta signaling components were analyzed by univariate analysis. Carcinoma associated fibroblasts isolated from MMTV-PyVmT mammary tumors were treated with recombinant TGF-beta and analyzed for CXCL1 promoter activity by luciferase assay, and protein secretion by ELISA. Results: Elevated CXCL1 expression in breast cancer stroma correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence and decreased patient survival. By co-immunofluorescence staining, CXCL1 expression overlapped with expression of a-SMA and FSP1 proteins. Expression of stromal CXCL1 protein expression inversely correlated with expression of TGF-beta signaling components. Treatment of fibroblasts with TGF-beta suppressed CXCL1 secretion and promoter activity. Conclusions: Increased CXCL1 expression in breast cancer stroma correlates with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, CXCL1 expression is localized to a-SMA and FSP1 positive fibroblasts, and is negatively regulated by TGF-beta signaling. These studies indicate that decreased TGF-beta signaling in carcinoma associated fibroblasts enhances CXCL1 expression in fibroblasts, which could contribute to breast cancer progression.

Around 40% of afflicted patients remain without a molecular diagnosis after exclusion of known genes. The advent of high-throughput sequencing has opened avenues to the discovery of new implicated genes, but a working list of prioritized candidate genes is necessary to deal with the complexity of analyzing large-scale sequencing data. Here we used an integrative data mining strategy to analyze the genetic network linked to myopathies, derive specific signatures for inherited myopathy and related disorders, and identify and rank candidate genes for these groups. Training sets of genes were selected after literature review and used in Manteia, a public web-based data mining system, to extract disease group signatures in the form of enriched descriptor terms, which include functional annotation, human and mouse phenotypes, as well as biological pathways and protein interactions. These specific signatures were then used as an input to mine and rank candidate genes, followed by filtration against skeletal muscle expression and association with known diseases. Signatures and identified candidate genes highlight both potential common pathological mechanisms and allelic disease groups. Recent discoveries of gene associations to diseases, like B3GALNT2, GMPPB and B3GNT1 to congenital muscular dystrophies, were prioritized in the ranked lists, suggesting a posteriori validation of our approach and predictions. We show an example of how the ranked lists can be used to help analyze high-throughput sequencing data to identify candidate genes, and highlight the best candidate genes matching genomic regions linked to myopathies without known causative genes. This strategy can be automatized to generate fresh candidate gene lists, which help cope with database annotation updates as new knowledge is incorporated.

J	Baker, DM; Valleron, AJ				Baker, David M.; Valleron, Alain-Jacques			An open source software for fast grid-based data-mining in spatial epidemiology (FGBASE)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article						Computational epidemiology; Cluster; Environmental factors; Software; Geographical grid; Type 1 diabetes	DISEASE CLUSTERS; TYPE-1; PATHOGENESIS; ASSOCIATION; RISK	Background: Examining whether disease cases are clustered in space is an important part of epidemiological research. Another important part of spatial epidemiology is testing whether patients suffering from a disease are more, or less, exposed to environmental factors of interest than adequately defined controls. Both approaches involve determining the number of cases and controls (or population at risk) in specific zones. For cluster searches, this often must be done for millions of different zones. Doing this by calculating distances can lead to very lengthy computations. In this work we discuss the computational advantages of geographical grid-based methods, and introduce an open source software (FGBASE) which we have created for this purpose. Methods: Geographical grids based on the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection are well suited for spatial epidemiology because they preserve area: each cell of the grid has the same area. We describe how data is projected onto such a grid, as well as grid-based algorithms for spatial epidemiological data-mining. The software program (FGBASE), that we have developed, implements these grid-based methods. Results: The grid based algorithms perform extremely fast. This is particularly the case for cluster searches. When applied to a cohort of French Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients, as an example, the grid based algorithms detected potential clusters in a few seconds on a modern laptop. This compares very favorably to an equivalent cluster search using distance calculations instead of a grid, which took over 4 hours on the same computer. In the case study we discovered 4 potential clusters of T1D cases near the cities of Le Havre, Dunkerque, Toulouse and Nantes. One example of environmental analysis with our software was to study whether a significant association could be found between distance to vineyards with heavy pesticide. None was found. In both examples, the software facilitates the rapid testing of hypotheses. Conclusions: Grid-based algorithms for mining spatial epidemiological data provide advantages in terms of computational complexity thus improving the speed of computations. We believe that these methods and this software tool (FGBASE) will lower the computational barriers to entry for those performing epidemiological research.

Development of application-specific adjacency models using fuzzy cognitive map	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Graph adjacency matrix; Fuzzy cognitive map	ELECTRICITY DEMAND; CLIMATE; LOAD	Neural regression provides a rapid solution to modeling complex systems with minimal computation effort. Recurrent structures such as fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) enable for drawing cause effect relationships among system variables assigned to graph nodes. Accordingly, the obtained matrix of edges, known as adjacency model, represents the overall behavior of the system. With this, there are many applications of semantic networks in data mining, computational geometry, physics-based modeling, pattern recognition, and forecast. This article examines a methodology for drawing application-specific adjacency models. The idea is to replace crisp neural weights with functions such as polynomials of desired degree, a property beyond the current scope of neural regression. The notion of natural adjacency matrix is discussed and examined as an alternative to classic neural adjacency matrix. There are examples of stochastic and complex engineering systems mainly in the context of modeling residential electricity demand to examine the proposed methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Indeterminate constants in numerical approximations of PDEs: A pilot study using data mining techniques	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Error estimates; Data mining; Finite element; Vlasov-Maxwell		Rolle's theorem, and therefore, Lagrange and Taylor's theorems are responsible for the inability to determine precisely the error estimate of numerical methods applied to partial differential equations. Basically, this comes from the existence of a non unique unknown point which appears in the remainder of Taylor's expansion. In this paper we consider the case of finite elements method. We show in detail how Taylor's theorem gives rise to indeterminate constants in the a priori error estimates. As a consequence, we highlight that classical conclusions have to be reformulated if one considers local error estimate. To illustrate our purpose, we consider the implementation of P-1 and P-2 finite elements method to solve Vlasov-Maxwell equations in a paraxial configuration. If the Bramble-Hilbert theorem claims that global error estimates for finite elements P-2 are "better" than the P-1 ones, we show how data mining techniques are powerful to identify and to qualify when and where local numerical results of P-1 and P-2 are equivalent.

Solar power generation utilizes a large number of PV cells connected in series and in parallel in an array, and that are physically distributed across a large field. When a PV module is faulted or partial shading occurs, the PV system sees a nonuniform distribution of generated electrical power and thermal profile, and the generation of multiple maximum power points (MPPs). If left untreated, this reduces the overall power generation and severe faults may propagate, resulting in damage to the system. In this paper, a thermal camera is employed for fault detection and a new MPPT scheme is developed to alter the operating point to match an optimized MPP. Extensive data mining is conducted on the images from the thermal camera in order to locate global MPPs. Based on this, a virtual MPPT is set out to find the global MPP. This can reduce MPPT time and be used to calculate the MPP reference voltage. Finally, the proposed methodology is experimentally implemented and validated by tests on a 600-W PV array.

It is inspired by few trees in the forests which can survive for several decades, while other trees could live for a limited period. In FOA, seeding procedure of the trees is simulated so that, some seeds fall just under the trees, while others are distributed in wide areas by natural procedures and the animals that feed on the seeds or fruits. Application of the proposed algorithm on some benchmark functions demonstrated its good capability in comparison with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Also we tested the performance of FOA on feature weighting as a real optimization problem and the results of the experiments showed the good performance of FOA in some data sets from the UCI repository.

Then predictions are made from the mappings of the most similar subsequences, and the prediction error statistic is used for the EMH assessment. The predictions are assessed on simulated price paths composed of stochastic trend and chaotic deterministic time series, and real financial data of 18 world equity markets and the GBP/USD exchange rate. The main results establish that the proposed algorithm can capture the deterministic structure in simulated series, confirm the validity of EMH on the examined equity indices, and indicate that prediction of the exchange rates using PIPs and DTW could beat at cases the prediction of last available price.

J	Gyssens, M; Niepert, M; Van Gucht, D				Gyssens, Marc; Niepert, Mathias; Van Gucht, Dirk			On the completeness of the semigraphoid axioms for deriving arbitrary from saturated conditional independence statements	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Conditional independence statement; Saturated conditional independence statement; Axiom system; Semigraphoid axioms; Soundness; Completeness; Databases	DEPENDENCIES; INFERENCE; ALGORITHMS	Conditional independence (CI) statements occur in several areas of computer science and artificial intelligence, e.g., as embedded multivalued dependencies in database theory, disjunctive association rules in data mining, and probabilistic CI statements in probability theory. Although, syntactically, such constraints can always be represented in the form I(A, B vertical bar C), with A, B, and C subsets of some universe S, their semantics is very dependent on their interpretation, and, therefore, inference rules valid under one interpretation need not be valid under another. However, all aforementioned interpretations obey the so-called semigraphoid axioms. In this paper, we consider the restricted case of deriving arbitrary CI statements from so-called saturated ones, i.e., which involve all elements of S. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition under which the semigraphoid axioms are also complete for such derivations. Finally, we apply these results to the examples mentioned above to show that, for these semantics, the semigraphoid axioms are both sound and complete for the derivation of arbitrary CI statements from saturated ones.

Automatic kernel clustering with bee colony optimization algorithm	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Automatic clustering; Bee colony optimization; Kernel function	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; PATTERNS	Cluster analysis is important in data mining, especially if there is unsupervised data. Recently, many clustering methods have been proposed. Unfortunately, most of these require the definition of the number of clusters, in advance. This study addresses this weakness by proposing a new automatic clustering algorithm: automatic kernel clustering with bee colony optimization (AKC-BCO). AKC-BCO determines the appropriate number of clusters and assigns data points to correct clusters. This is accomplished by the kernel function, which increases clustering capability. This method is validated using several benchmark data sets. The result is compared with several existing automatic clustering methods. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed AKC-BCO is more stable and accurate than others. Furthermore, the proposed method is also applied to a real-world medical problem.

Dynamic classification system in large-scale supervision of energy efficiency in buildings	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						District heating; FDD; Knowledge dynamics; Information entropy; Rough sets	BILLING SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; MODEL	Data mining and knowledge discovery applied to the billing data provide the diagnostic instruments for the evaluation of energy use in buildings connected to a district heating network. To ensure the validity of an algorithm-based classification system, the dynamic properties of a sequence of partitions for consecutive detected events were investigated. The information regarding the dynamic properties of the classification system refers to the similarities between the supervised objects and migrations that originate from the changes in the building energy use and loss similarity to their neighbourhood and thus represents the refinement of knowledge. In this study, we demonstrate that algorithm-based diagnostic knowledge has dynamic properties that can be exploited with a rough set predictor to evaluate whether the implementation of classification for supervision of energy use aligns with the dynamics of changes of district heating-supplied building properties. Moreover, we demonstrate the refinement of the current knowledge with the previous findings and we present the creation of predictive diagnostic systems based on knowledge dynamics with a satisfactory level of classification errors, even for non-stationary data.

By data mining the Penaeus monodon EST database, two type I crustins, carcininPm1 and 2, and ten type II crustins, crustinPm1-10, were identified. The abundant crustins were crustinPm1, 4 and 7, each with variation in the length of Gly-rich repeat among its members. A few crustinPm1, 4 and 7 with deletion in the Cys-rich region were also observed. Furthermore, the crustinPm4 with the longest N-terminal Gly-rich region was characterized. The crustinPm4 allelic genes were expressed mainly from the hemocytes. Its expression was up-regulated readily by WSSV infection and gradually decreased to normal level afterwards. The recombinant crustinPm4-1 (rcrustinPm4-1) isoform was produced using the Escherichia coli expression system and tested for its antimicrobial activity. The rcrustinPm4-1 was able to inhibit the growth of a Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus megaterium but not Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. It also inhibited the growth of two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli 363 and Vibrio harveyi 639 at lower potency. The rcrustinPm4-1 affected the WSSV infection because the expression of an intermediate early gene ie1 in WSSV-infected hemocyte cell culture was reduced. It was shown further that the rcrustinPm4-1 could delay by about one and a half days the manifestation of disease by WSSV. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They contain different functional areas originally defined by planning and then reshaped by actual needs and use by the inhabitants. Estimating the functions of urban space is of significant importance for detecting urban problems, evaluating planning strategies, and supporting policy making. In light of the potential of data mining and spatial analysis techniques for urban analysis, this paper proposes a method to infer urban functions at the building level using transportation data obtained from surveys and smart card systems. Specifically, we establish a two-step framework making use of the spatial relationships between trips, stops, and buildings. Firstly, information about the travel purposes for daily activities is deduced using passengers' mobility patterns based on a probabilistic Bayesian model. Secondly, building functions are inferred by linking daily activities to the buildings surrounding the stops based on spatial statistics. We demonstrate the proposed method using large-scale public transportation data from two areas of Singapore. Our method is applied to identify building functions at building level. The result is verified with master plan, street view, and investigated data, and limitations are identified. Our work shows that the presented method is applicable in practice with a good accuracy. In a broader context, it shows the effectiveness of applying integrated techniques to combine multi-source data in order to make insights about social activities and complex urban space.

J	Otoiu, A; Titan, E; Dumitrescu, R				Otoiu, Adrian; Titan, Emilia; Dumitrescu, Remus			Are the variables used in building composite indicators of well-being relevant? Validating composite indexes of well-being	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Well-being; Composite indicators; Economic indicators; Cluster analysis; Data mining; GDP; HDI; Happy Planet Index; Legatum Prosperity Index	HAPPY; INEQUALITY; HAPPINESS	This paper explores the relevance of the variables that define well-being and human progress and makes a quantitative inquiry into the validity of three of the well-known and well-documented composite indicators of well-being: the Human Development Index (HDI), the Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI) and the Happy Planet Index (HPI). After choosing the key variables that describe most of the objective and subjective dimensions of well-being, we perform cluster analysis to come up with an optimal grouping of countries based on their multidimensional performance on well-being. A comparison of the classifications obtained with the three indexes invalidates the HPI, confirms results obtained for the HDI, and validates for the first time the LPI as a reliable measure of well-being. The optimal cluster structure yields robust results, which correct the rank discrepancies between the HDI and LPI for a large number of countries. It also proves that a robust ranking of countries based on multidimensional well-being can be achieved with a relatively small number of variables, which mitigates the risk of including variables that are not reliable and/or not available for a significant number of countries. The fact that cluster analysis generates results based on similarities between observations and not on computed values based on the aggregation of variables helps overcome problems that may occur due to the distribution of variables and increases its value as a validation method. Therefore, validation results achieved through cluster analysis are more robust and help to achieve a good check of the validity and relevance of the composite indexes, provide an objective perspective that can guide policy-makers and the public in making a fair assessment of actual levels of well-being, and avoid unfounded claims that may overstate it and delay or postpone measures to increase it.

In order to perform reliable and trusted vehicular communications, one requirement is to ensure peer vehicle credibility by means of validating digital certificate attached to messages that are transmitted by other vehicles. However, in vehicular communication systems, certificate validation is more time consuming than in traditional networks because each vehicle receives a large number of messages in a short period. Another concern is the unsuccessful delivery of information between vehicles and other entities on the road due to their high mobility rate. For these reasons, we seek new solutions that will aid in speeding up the process of certificate validation. In this article, we propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme using the concept of clustering from data mining that can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of k-Means clustering to boost the efficiency of certificate validation, thereby enhancing the security of a vehicular ad hoc network. Additionally, a comprehensive security analysis for this scheme is presented; the analysis shows that this scheme can effectively improve the validation of certificates and thus increase the communication security in vehicular ad hoc networks.

Often unsupervised, the clustering task received a huge interest when reinforced by different kinds of inputs provided by the user. This paper presents an approach giving the possibility to incorporate business knowledge in order to guide the clustering algorithm. A formalization of the fact that an intuitive a priori prioritization of the variables might exist, is presented in this paper and applied in a direct marketing context using recent data. By providing the analyst with a new approach offering different clustering perspectives, this paper proposes a straightforward way to apply constrained clustering with soft attribute-level constraints based on feature order preferences.

Lateral load bearing capacity modelling of piles in cohesive soils in undrained conditions: An intelligent evolutionary approach	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Evolutionary data mining; Lateral load bearing capacity; Piles in cohesive soils	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION; UNSATURATED SOILS; DRIVEN PILES; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR	The complex behaviour of fine-grained materials in relation with structural elements has received noticeable attention from geotechnical engineers and designers in recent decades. In this research work an evolutionary approach is presented to create a structured polynomial model for predicting the undrained lateral load bearing capacity of piles. The proposed evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) techniqueis an evolutionary data mining methodology that generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from raw data. It can operate on large quantities of data in order to capture nonlinear and complex relationships between contributing variables. The developed model allows the user to gain a clear insight into the behaviour of the system. Field measurement data from literature was used to develop the proposed EPR model. Comparison of the proposed model predictions with the results from two empirical models currently being implemented in design works, a neural network-based model from literature and also the field data shows that the EPR model is capable of capturing, predicting and generalizing predictions to unseen data cases, for lateral load bearing capacity of piles with very high accuracy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of individual contributing parameters and their contribution to the predictions made by the proposed model. The merits and advantages of the proposed methodology are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparative study of classifier ensembles for bankruptcy prediction	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Credit scoring; Classifier ensembles; Data mining; Machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CREDIT SCORING MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREES; STRATEGIES; TASKS	The aim of bankruptcy prediction in the areas of data mining and machine learning is to develop an effective model which can provide the higher prediction accuracy. In the prior literature, various classification techniques have been developed and studied, in/with which classifier ensembles by combining multiple classifiers approach have shown their outperformance over many single classifiers. However, in terms of constructing classifier ensembles, there are three critical issues which can affect their performance. The first one is the classification technique actually used/adopted, and the other two are the combination method to combine multiple classifiers and the number of classifiers to be combined, respectively. Since there are limited, relevant studies examining these aforementioned disuses, this paper conducts a comprehensive study of comparing classifier ensembles by three widely used classification techniques including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees (DT) based on two well-known combination methods including bagging and boosting and different numbers of combined classifiers. Our experimental results by three public datasets show that DT ensembles composed of 80-100 classifiers using the boosting method perform best. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test also demonstrates that DT ensembles by boosting perform significantly different from the other classifier ensembles. Moreover, a further study over a real-world case by a Taiwan bankruptcy dataset was conducted, which also demonstrates the superiority of DT ensembles by boosting over the others.

This article proposes to use a novel data mining technique, namely, evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), to predict degradation of concrete subject to sulphuric acid attack. A comprehensive dataset from literature is collected to train and develop an EPR model for this purpose. The results show that the EPR model can successfully predict mass loss of concrete specimens exposed to sulphuric acid. Parametric studies show that the proposed model is capable of representing the degree to which individual contributing parameters can affect the degradation of concrete. The developed EPR model is compared with a model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and the advantageous of the EPR approach over ANN is highlighted. In addition, based on the developed EPR model and using an optimisation technique, the optimum concrete mixture to provide maximum resistance against sulphuric acid attack has been identified.

Therefore, customer churn prediction has become an essential issue in telecommunication business. In such competitive business a reliable customer predictor will be regarded priceless. This paper has employed data mining classification techniques including Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine so as to compare their performances. Using the data of an Iranian mobile company, not only were these techniques experienced and compared to one another, but also we have drawn a parallel between some different prominent data mining software. Analyzing the techniques' behavior and coming to know their specialties, we proposed a hybrid methodology which made considerable improvements to the value of some of the evaluations metrics. The proposed methodology results showed that above 95% accuracy for Recall and Precision is easily achievable. Apart from that a new methodology for extracting influential features in dataset was introduced and experienced. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ligeiro, R				Ligeiro, Rui			Monitoring applications: An immune inspired algorithm for software-fault detection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial immune system; Fault detection; Fault injection; Reinforcement learning; Monitoring; Metrics	TOOLS	Large-scale software systems are in general difficult to manage and monitor. In many cases, these systems display unexpected behavior, especially after being updated or when changes occur in their environment( operating system upgrades or hardware migrations, to name a few). Therefore, to handle a changing environment, it is desirable to base fault detection and performance monitoring on self-adaptive techniques. Several studies have been carried out in the past which, inspired on the immune system, aim at solving complex technological problems. Among them, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, system security and data mining are problems that have been addressed in this framework. There are similarities between the software fault detection problem and the identification of the pathogens that are found in natural immune systems. Being inspired by vaccination and negative and clonal selection observed in these systems, we developed an effective self-adaptive model to monitor software applications analyzing the metrics of system resources.

The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 and federal criteria of 'Meaningful use' stage 1 mandated e-prescribing to be used by eligible providers in order to access Medicaid and Medicare incentive payments. Inappropriate prescribing has been identified as a preventable cause of at least 20% of drug-related adverse events. A few studies reported system-related errors and have offered targeted recommendations on improving and enhancing e-prescribing system. Objective: This study aims to enhance efficiency of the e-prescribing system by shortening the medication list, reducing the risk of inappropriate selection of medication, as well as in reducing the prescribing time of physicians. Method: 103.48 million prescriptions from Taiwan's national health insurance claim data were used to compute Diagnosis-Medication association. Furthermore, 100,000 prescriptions were randomly selected to develop a smart medication recommendation model by using association rules of data mining. Results and conclusion: The important contribution of this model is to introduce a new concept called Mean Prescription Rank (MPR) of prescriptions and Coverage Rate (CR) of prescriptions. A proactive medication list (PML) was computed using MPR and CR. With this model the medication drop-down menu is significantly shortened, thereby reducing medication selection errors and prescription times. The physicians will still select relevant medications even in the case of inappropriate (unintentional) selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To efficiently resolve the ambiguity frequently arising in available information and do more justice to the essential fuzziness in human judgment and preference, the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to describe the fuzzy assessments of transaction data. Then, combining the concepts of fuzzy set theory and the priori algorithms, the interesting item sets are found to construct the association rules. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the computational process of proposed data mining algorithm. By utilizing this data mining algorithm, the decision-makers' fuzzy assessments with various rating attitudes can be taken into account in the data mining process to assure more convincing and accurate knowledge discovery.

Evaluation of queuing systems for knowledge-based simulation of construction processes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction; Infrastructure; Simulation; Discrete event simulation; Queue; Queue discipline; Wireless data collection; Data mining; Knowledge; Ultra wideband	PRIORITY-QUEUES; OPERATIONS	During the course of a construction project, there are many situations in which formation of waiting lines or queues is inevitable. The effect of resource delays in queues on the overall project completion time and cost has motivated researchers to employ simulation for analysis of queuing systems in order to identify the best operational strategies to reduce the time wasted in queues. Providing proper and timely input data with high spatial and temporal accuracy for queuing systems simulation enhances the reliability of decisions made based upon the simulation output. Hence, the presented paper describes a methodology for collecting and mining of spatiotemporal data corresponding to the interactions of queue entities to extract computer interpretable knowledge for simulation input modeling. The developed framework was validated using empirical datasets collected from a series of experiments. The extracted relevant knowledge from the queuing system entities was used to update corresponding simulation models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial and temporal data coverage, better quality and reliability of data modelling and data driven techniques have resulted in more favourable acceptance by the hydrodynamic community. The data mining tools and techniques are being applied in variety of hydro-informatics applications ranging from data mining for pattern discovery to data driven models and numerical model error correction. The present study explores the feasibility of applying mutual information theory by evaluating the amount of information contained in observed and prediction errors of non-tidal barotropic numerical modelling (i.e. assuming that the hydrodynamic model, available at this point, is best representation of the physics in the domain of interest) by relating them to variables that reflect the state at which the predictions are made such as input data, state variables and model output. In addition, the present study explores the possibility of employing 'genetic programming' (GP) as an offline data driven modelling tool to capture the sea level anomaly (SLA) dynamics and then using them for updating the numerical model prediction in real time applications. These results suggest that combination of data relationship analysis and GP models helps to improve the forecasting ability by providing information of significant predicative parameters. It is found that GP based SLA prediction error forecast model can provide significant improvement when applied as data assimilation schemes for updating the SLA prediction obtained from primary hydrodynamic models.

The method is applied to the tropical Atlantic. Prior data mining on a complete dataset shows that latitude and sea surface salinity are the most relevant surface parameters in the prediction of salinity profiles. A classification using a self-organizing map learned on a large multivariate dataset is able to retrieve the most probable vertical salinity profiles from the surface parameters only. Both in situ and modelled oceanic data are used to evaluate the results. The reconstruction misses some salinity features in areas with high time-space variability in which the limited available dataset was unable to provide the complete variability ranges during the learning process. However, apart from these restricted areas, the salinity profiles are reproduced with correlations greater than 0.95 for most of the profiles of the test set. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, PL; Chai, J; Zhang, L; Wang, DB				Chen, Penglai; Chai, Jing; Zhang, Lu; Wang, Debin			Development and Application of a Chinese Webpage Suicide Information Mining System (Sims)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Suicide; News; Blogs; Data mining; Support system	CELEBRITY SUICIDE; INTERNET SEARCHES; MEDIA COVERAGE; HEALTH INFORMATION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PREVENTION; IMPACT; JAPAN; POPULATION; IDEATION	Objectives This study aims at designing and piloting a convenient Chinese webpage suicide information mining system (SIMS) to help search and filter required data from the internet and discover potential features and trends of suicide. Methods SIMS utilizes Microsoft Visual Studio2008, SQL2008 and C# as development tools. It collects webpage data via popular search engines; cleans the data using trained models plus minimum manual help; translates the cleaned texts into quantitative data through models and supervised fuzzy recognition; analyzes and visualizes related variables by self-programmed algorithms. Results The SIMS developed comprises such functions as suicide news and blogs collection, data filtering, cleaning, extraction and translation, data analysis and presentation. SIMS-mediated mining of one-year webpage revealed that: peak months and hours of web-reported suicide events were June-July and 10-11 am respectively, and the lowest months and hours, September-October and 1-7 am; suicide reports came mostly from Soho, Tecent, Sina etc.; male suicide victims over counted female victims in most sub-regions but southwest China; homes, public places and rented houses were the top three places to commit suicide; poisoning, cutting vein and jumping from building were the most commonly used methods to commit suicide; love disputes, family disputes and mental diseases were the leading causes. Conclusions SIMS provides a preliminary and supplementary means for monitoring and understanding suicide. It proposes useful aspects as well as tools for analyzing the features and trends of suicide using data derived from Chinese webpages. Yet given the intrinsic "dual nature" of internet-based suicide information and the tremendous difficulties experienced by ourselves and other researchers, there is still a long way to go for us to expand, refine and evaluate the system.

Translation of off-target effects: prediction of ADRs by integrated experimental and computational approach	TOXICOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Review							VALVULAR HEART-DISEASE; ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS; SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY; CHEMICAL-BIOLOGY; NETWORK; DISCOVERY; SYSTEMS; CARDIOTOXICITY; MECHANISMS; PARADIGM	Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are associated with most drugs, often discovered late in drug development and sometimes only during extended course of clinical use. They are linked either to the therapeutic target or pathway, or could emerge as the consequence of known or unknown off-target effect(s) of a drug or drug combinations. ADRs are a major burden on patients, medical professionals and the society in general. Discovery of intolerable ADRs during clinical trials significantly contributes to high attrition rates with associated rising costs. Thus, prediction of ADRs at the early stage of drug discovery is an emerging approach; however, it remains a challenging task to identify the mode of action of drug candidates which might lead to ADRs. We review here the implementation of in vitro and in silico tools streamlined for the prediction of ADRs as early as the target/lead identification and lead optimization phases of the drug discovery process. This integrated approach has been developed during the past decade by both academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry with the aim to provide toxicological analysis, assessment and ranking of drug candidates on a broad scale. The major aim is to be able to mitigate targets associated with ADRs earlier and guide chemistry to address the therapeutic and side effects in parallel. The major components of this effort are (1) experimental approach: early in vitro safety profiling linked to (2) computational toxicology algorithms and models utilizing statistics, data mining, cheminformatics and system biology. The third component embraces the translational aspect for clinical ADRs, which includes in vivo exposure. In this review we focus on the prediction of the integrated molecular network approach.

It also shows a new method for measuring the structural similarity between classes. A dynamic link library (DLL) file is an executable file used in the Windows operating system that allows applications to share codes and other resources to perform particular tasks. In this paper, we classify different malware by the data mining of the DLL files used by the malware. Since the malware families are evolving quickly, they present many new problems, such as how to link them to other existing malware families. The experiment shows that our GHSOM-based structural classification can solve these issues and generate a malware classification tree according to the similarity of malware families.

In this article we conduct a systematic investigation of previous research to provide a content-driven review of the literature, and to provide future research direction. We use the textual data mining software Leximancer to identify dominant concepts and themes underlying project governance research. Our findings indicate that agency and stakeholder theories have been adapted to the project governance context to a greater extent than other theories. Furthermore, we find differences in project governance research, published in project management journals compared to general management, IT and engineering journals. We conclude the paper by presenting a framework that links governance theories to the multiple organizational levels relevant to project governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Daneshpazhouh, A; Sami, A				Daneshpazhouh, Armin; Sami, Ashkan			Entropy-based outlier detection using semi-supervised approach with few positive examples	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Data mining; Fraud detection; Outlier detection; Semi-supervised learning	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; ALGORITHMS	Outlier detection is an important problem in data mining that aims to discover useful exceptional and unusual patterns hidden in large data sets. Fraud detection, time series monitoring, intrusion detection and medical condition monitoring are some of the most common applications of outlier detection. Most existing outlier detection methods are based on supervised or unsupervised learning while some others use semi-supervised approaches. However, in many real world applications, there are not enough labeled data for training and only a few positive labeled samples are available. This paper presents an entropy-based solution. The proposed method consists of two phases. First, reliable negative examples are extracted from positive and unlabeled data and then, as the second phase, the entropy-based outlier detection algorithm is employed to detect top N outliers. Many experiments on real and synthetic data sets are performed. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrated superiority of the proposed outlier detection method in comparison of unsupervised state-of-the-art outlier detection strategies.

J	Perner, P				Perner, Petra			A Method for Supporting the Domain Expert by the Interpretation of Different Decision Trees Learnt from the Same Domain	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						decision tree induction; explanation; similarity measure; decision tree; comparison	NETWORKS	Data mining methods are widely used across many disciplines to identify patterns, rules, or associations among huge volumes of data. Data mining methods with explanation capability such as decision tree induction are preferred in many domains. The aim of this paper is to discuss how to deal with the result of decision tree induction methods. This paper has been prompted by the fact that domain experts are able to use the tools for decision tree induction but have great difficulties in interpreting the results. When the domain expert has learnt two decision trees that are from the same domain but based on different data sets as a result of further data collection, he is faced with the problem of how to interpret the different trees. The comparison of two decision trees is therefore an important issue as the user needs such a comparison in order to understand what has changed. We have proposed to provide him with a measure of correspondence between the two trees that allows him to judge if he can accept the changes or not. In this paper, we propose a proper similarity measure. In case of a low similarity value, the expert has evidence to start exploring the reason for this change. Often, he can find things in the data acquisition that might have resulted in some noise and might be fixed. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

After SsCR was overexpressed in E. coli BL21, recombinant E. coli CCZU-A13 with high reductase activity and excellent stereoselectivity for the reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) into ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((R)-CHBE) was screened using one high-throughput colorimetric screening strategy. After the reaction optimization, a highly stereoselective bioreduction of COBE into (R)-CHBE (>99% ee) with the resting cells of E. coli CCZU-A13 was successfully demonstrated in n-butyl acetate-water (10:90, v/v) biphasic system. Biotransformation of 600 mM COBE for 8 h in the biphasic system, (R)-CHBE (>99% ee) could be obtained in the high yield of 100%. Moreover, the broad substrate specificity in the reduction of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds was also found. Significantly, E. coli CCZU-A13 shows high potential in the industrial production of (R)-CHBE (>99% ee) and its derivatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tran, A; Truong, T; Le, B				Anh Tran; Tin Truong; Bac Le			Simultaneous mining of frequent closed itemsets and their generators: Foundation and algorithm	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Closed itemset; Generator; Association rule; Frequent itemset; Data mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; LATTICES; SYSTEMS	Closed itemsets and their generators play an important role in frequent itemset and association rule mining. They allow a lossless representation of all frequent itemsets and association rules and facilitate mining. Some recent approaches discover frequent closed itemsets and generators separately. The Close algorithm mines them simultaneously but it needs to scan the database many times. Based on the properties and relationships of closed itemsets and generators, this study proposes GENCLOSE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets and generators simultaneously. The level-wise search over an ItemsetObject-setGenerator-Tree enumerates the generators by using a necessary and sufficient condition to produce (i+1)-item generators from i-item generators. This condition, based on transaction (object) sets that can be efficiently implemented using diffsets, is very convenient and reliably proved. In the search, pre-closed itemsets are gradually extended using three proposed extension operators. It is shown that these itemsets produce the expected closed itemsets. Extensive experiments on many benchmark databases confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, synchrophasors could change this paradigm by enabling new features, the phase-angle differences, which are well-known measures of system stress, with the added potential to increase system visibility. The paper develops a systematic approach to baseline the phase-angles versus actual transfer limits across system interfaces and enable synchrophasor-based situational awareness (SBSA). Statistical methods are first used to determine seasonal exceedance levels of angle shifts that can allow real-time scoring and detection of atypical conditions. Next, key buses suitable for SBSA are identified using correlation and partitioning around medoid (PAM) clustering. It is shown that angle shifts of this subset of 15% of the network backbone buses can be effectively used as features in ensemble decision tree-based forecasting of seasonal security margins across critical interfaces.

Parameter estimation is implemented adaptively and optimally through a constrained bi-level programming method. The slave programming determines positions of knots and coefficients of the B-spline by minimizing the error of B-spline regression. The master programming model determines the number of knots through a regularized function, which balances model accuracy and model complexity. This bi-level programming method produces the best fitting to speed-density observations under specific order of splines and possesses great flexibility to accommodate the exhibited nonlinearity in speed-density relationships. Jam density can be estimated naturally using spline TSM, which is sometimes hardly obtainable in many other TSM. Derivative continuity up to one order lower than the highest spline degree can be preserved, a desirable property in some application. A five-regime B-spline model is found to exist for generalized speed-density relationships to accommodate five traffic operating conditions: free flow, transition, synchronized flow, stop and go traffic, and jam condition. A typical two-regime B-spline form is also explicitly given, depending only on free-flow speed, optimal speed, optimal density, and jam density. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper presents a framework and data mining technique that directly identifies the region of interest (ROI) from the POD modes and determines relevant feature for targeted visualization and learning. Two key elements in the procedure are described, including (1) POD to reduce data dimensions and to decouple the time-averaged and time-varying flow structures in high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data with non-uniform grids, and (2) feature mining, including clustering-based data mining and filtering to detect both mean and unsteady flow features in the ROI. The rationale and benefits of our POD-compatible feature detection for fast scalable feature extraction are discussed. Case studies of vortex extraction are undertaken to validate the present approach. The POD accurately captures the characteristic flow structures and provides useful insight into the underlying flow phenomena. The feature mining module is capable of identifying key features in the ROI (3-10 % of the original data) for focused visualization, discovery, and learning.

In this study, 180 female quails in three different seasons (summer, winter and autumn) which were obtained from a selection line and a control line were used. 1141 hatching eggs collected from quails which were hosted on two different types of cages (160-240 cm(2)/quail) during a week at 12 weeks of age have formed the material of study. Classification algorithms used in the study are YSA, RBF Network, Naive Bayes, KStar, and Ridor algorythms, respectively. In the comparison of the models formed according to these algorithms, Kappa statistic, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Square Root Error (MSE), Relative Absolute Error (RAE), Relative Square Root Error (RSE) performance criteria were used. As a result of analysis, it has been seen in the comparison made that the model formed according to Ridor algorithm that has MAD: 0.002, MSE: 0.05, RAE: 1.07%, RSE: 14.50% and Kappa: 0.98 performance criteria values, respectively, has made the classification with minimum error. With this study conducted, it was determined that 85% of the quail eggs fertile and 15% of them has low reproduction capacity with the accurate classification success of 99.73%.

Flatness is a key geometrical feature of strip products in a cold rolling process. In order to achieve good flatness, it is necessary to reveal the factors that often influence the flatness quality, to develop a general flatness pattern predictionmodel that can handle the varying operating condition during the rolling of products with different specifications and to realize an effective flatness feedback control strategy. This paper develops a practical data mining-based flatness pattern prediction method for cold rolling process with varying operating condition. Firstly, the high-dimensional process measurements are projected onto a low-dimensional space (i.e., the latent variable space) using locality preserving projection method; at the same time, the Legendre orthogonal polynomials are used to extract the basic flatness patterns by projecting the high-dimensional flatness measurements into several flatness characteristic coefficients. Secondly, a mixture probabilistic linear regression model is adopted to describe the relationships between the latent variables and the flatness characteristic coefficients. Case study is conducted on a real steel rolling process. Results show that the developed method has not only the satisfactory prediction performance, but good potentials to improve process understanding and strip flatness quality.

Many parallel algorithms for such applications are synchronous algorithms which need strict synchronization between iterations to ensure their correctness, making the performance sensitive to computational skews in each iteration. Current load balancing approaches may alleviate the effect of computational skew, but cannot completely solve the problem. As a result, for many applications, the skews in each iteration still exist and they are accumulated, seriously affecting the completion time of these applications. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to make synchronous iterative computing applications themselves have the ability to tolerate the negative effects of unresolved computational skews. This approach divides a large computational task in a computing node or worker into a number of sub-tasks which only depend on the states of a few objects from the previous iteration. This allows the sub-tasks in subsequent iterations to proceed in advance whenever the states of related data objects are available. Consequently, the idle time caused by strict synchronization is reduced and the overall performance is thus enhanced. Experimental results show that this approach can improve the overall performance by up to 2.45x in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

As one of main branches in data mining, data stream clustering has received much attention over the past decade. Most existing data stream clustering techniques count on Euclidean distance metric for finding similar objects and hence produce spherical clusters which are not always suitable to represent the data. Moreover, in most of the real world problems, we come across the data of varying density which cannot be handled by density-based clustering techniques. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering technique called Hyper-Ellipsoidal Clustering for Evolving data Stream (HECES) based on the recently proposed HyCARCE algorithm. In HECES, a few modifications in the HyCARCE algorithm are made for handling stream clustering problem: sliding window model is used to handle incoming stream of data to minimize the impact of the obsolete information on recent clustering results; shrinkage technique is used to avoid the singularity issue in finding the covariance of correlated data; a novel technique for merging the initial ellipsoids is used to obtain the final clusters instead of a computationally intensive process of expansion and adjustment. HECES relies on Mahalanobis distance metric to cluster the data points and hence results in ellipsoidal shaped clusters. It can successfully handle data of varying density. Experiments on various synthetic and real datasets for clustering streaming data provide a comparative validation of our approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inter-cluster separation which is widely used in classification algorithms, however, is rarely considered in a clustering process. In this paper, We present a new discriminative subspace kmeans-type clustering algorithm (DSKmeans), which integrates the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separation simultaneously. Different to traditional weighting kmeans-type algorithms, a 3-order tensor is constructed to evaluate the importance of different features in order to integrate the aforementioned two types of information. First, a new objective function for clustering is designed. To optimize the objective function, the corresponding updating rules for the algorithm are then derived analytically. The properties and performance of DSKmeans are investigated on several numerical and categorical data sets. Experimental results corroborate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art kmeans-type clustering algorithms with respects to four metrics: Accuracy, RandIndex, Fscore and Normal Mutual Information(NMI).

Many approaches to extracting data from the Web have been designed to solve specific problems and operate in ad-hoc domains. Other approaches, instead, heavily reuse techniques and algorithms developed in the field of Information Extraction. This survey aims at providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of Web Data Extraction. We provided a simple classification framework in which existing Web Data Extraction applications are grouped into two main classes, namely applications at the Enterprise level and at the Social Web level. At the Enterprise level, Web Data Extraction techniques emerge as a key tool to perform data analysis in Business and Competitive Intelligence systems as well as for business process re-engineering. At the Social Web level, Web Data Extraction techniques allow to gather a large amount of structured data continuously generated and disseminated by Web 2.0, Social Media and Online Social Network users and this offers unprecedented opportunities to analyze human behavior at a very large scale. We discuss also the potential of cross-fertilization, i.e., on the possibility of re-using Web Data Extraction techniques originally designed to work in a given domain, in other domains.

MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						Preconception health; Electronic health record; Clinical data mining; Health information accuracy	CLINICAL DECISION-SUPPORT; FOLIC-ACID FORTIFICATION; PRIMARY-CARE; SUPPLEMENT; DISORDERS	To explore the potential of an integrated outpatient electronic health record (EHR) for preconception health optimization. An automated case-finding EHR-derived algorithm was designed to identify women of child-bearing age having outpatient encounters in an 85-site, integrated health system. The algorithm simultaneously cross-referenced multiple discrete data fields to identify selected preconception factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, teratogen use including ACE inhibitors, multivitamin supplementation, anemia, renal insufficiency, untreated sexually transmitted infection, HIV positivity, and tobacco, alcohol or illegal drug use). Surveys were mailed to a random sample of patients to obtain their self-reported health profiles for these same factors. Concordance was assessed between the algorithm output, survey results, and manual data abstraction. Between 8/2010-2/2012, 107,339 female outpatient visits were identified, from which 29,691 unique women were presumed to have child-bearing potential. 19,624 (66 %) and 8,652 (29 %) had 1 or a parts per thousand yen2 health factors, respectively while only 1,415 (5 %) had none. Using the patient survey results as a reference point, health-factor agreement was similar comparing the algorithm (85.8 %) and the chart abstraction (87.2 %) results. Incorrect or missing data entries in the EHR encounters were largely responsible for discordances observed. Preconception screening using an automated algorithm in a system-wide EHR identified a large group of women with potentially modifiable preconception health conditions. The issue most responsible for limiting algorithm performance was incomplete point of care documentation. Accurate data capture during patient encounters should be a focus for quality improvement, so that novel applications of system-wide data mining can be reliably implemented.

Data-mining analyses were performed to assess the impact of age on liver event reporting frequency with different phenotypes and agents. Methods: 236 drugs associated with hepatotoxicity were evaluated using the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) of the relative reporting ratio with 90% confidence interval (EB05 and EB95) calculated for the age groups: 0-17, 18-64, and >= 65 years (or elderly), for overall, serious (acute liver failure), hepatocellular, and cholestatic liver injury, using the WHO Safety Report Database. Results: Overall, cases of age 0-17, 18-64, and 65 years or older comprised 6%, 62%, and 32% of liver event reports. Acute liver failure and hepatocellular injury were more frequently reported among children compared to adults and the elderly while reports with cholestatic injury were more frequent among the elderly (p < 0.00001). A potential to cause mitochondrial dysfunction was more prevalent among the drugs with increased pediatric reporting frequency while high lipophilicity and biliary excretion were more common among the drugs associated with higher reporting frequency in the elderly. Conclusion: Age-specific phenotypes and potential drug properties associated with age-specific hepatotoxicity were identified in reported liver events; further analyses are warranted.

Future Internet of Things: open issues and challenges	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						Future Internet of Things; Data mining; Cloud computing	SENSOR NETWORKS; SMART OBJECTS; ARCHITECTURE; TECHNOLOGY; OPPORTUNITIES; OPTIMIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT; DATABASES; FRAMEWORK	Internet of Things (IoT) and its relevant technologies have been attracting the attention of researchers from academia, industry, and government in recent years. However, since the requirements of the IoT are quite different from what the Internet today can offer, several innovative techniques have been gradually developed and incorporated into IoT, which is referred to as the Future Internet of Things (FIoT). Among them, how to extract "data'' and transfer them into "knowledge'' from sensing layer to application layer has become a vital issue. This paper begins with an overview of IoT and FIoT, followed by discussions on how to apply data mining and computational intelligence to FIoT. An intelligent data management framework inspired by swarm optimization will then given. Finally, open issues and future trends of this field will be addressed.

In practice, a data transformation process is often needed to preserve privacy. However, data transformation would introduce a data quality issue. In this case, the impact on data quality due to the data transformation should be estimated and made clear to the user of the data transformation process. In this article, we consider the problem of k-anonymization transformation in associative classification. The privacy preservation and data quality issues are considered in twofold. First, we propose a frequency-based data quality metric to represent the data quality for associative classification. Second, a novel heuristic algorithm, namely minimum classification correction rate transformation, is proposed. The algorithm is guided by the classification correction rate of the given datasets. We validate our proposed metric and algorithm with University of California-Irvine repository datasets. The experiment results have shown that our proposed metric can effectively demonstrate the data quality for associative classification. The results also show that the proposed algorithm is not only efficient but also highly effective.

Data-driven healthcare: from patterns to actions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Big data; analytics; data mining; preventive care		The era of big data opens up new opportunities in personalised medicine, preventive care, chronic disease management and in telemonitoring and managing of patients with implanted devices. The rich data accumulating within online services and internet companies provide a microscope to study human behaviour at scale, and to ask completely new questions about the interplay between behavioural patterns and health. In this paper, we shed light on a particular aspect of data-driven healthcare: autonomous decision-making. We first look at three examples where we can expect data-driven decisions to be taken autonomously by technology, with no or limited human intervention. We then discuss some of the technical and practical challenges that can be expected, and sketch the research agenda to address them.

An Algorithm-Centric Energy-Aware Design Methodology	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; energy profiling; energy-aware computing	EFFICIENT; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	The goal of this brief is to present a unique top-down design methodology for developing energy-aware algorithms based on energy profiling. The key idea revolves around identifying and measuring components of code with high energy consumption. There are two major contributions of this brief: 1) a method for identifying components with high energy consumption in compute-intensive applications. To this end, we target operations called kernels, which are frequently used operations in the algorithm; 2) a method for estimating software energy for the identified software components, in particular for kernels and load/store operations. The energy evaluation method involves isolated code with assembly injection. Furthermore, to ensure reliable results, we use physical energy measurements conducted on specially instrumented circuit boards to provide actual and not just simulated measurements. To evaluate the proposed methods, we conducted two case studies using data mining algorithms: K-nearest neighbors and linear regression. The results highlight the contributions of kernels and memory energy to total energy.

A total of 898 human proteins were identified, of which 62.2% were predicted to be released or shed from cells. The identified proteins were compared with tissue proteomes to find candidate proteins whose expressions were elevated in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues as revealed by (i) quantitative proteomic analysis based on cICAT and mTRAQ or (ii) data mining of immunohistochemical images piled in Human Protein Atlas database. By applying various stringent criteria, 11 candidate proteins were selected. Among these, we validated an significant increase (p = 0.0018) of melanotransferrin (TRFM) at the plasma level of CRC patients through Western blotting, using 130 plasma samples containing 30 healthy controls, 80 CRC patients, and 20 patients of other diseases. Finally, we measured the expression level of TRFM in 325 plasma samples containing 77 healthy controls and 228 CRC patients (34.6 +/- 4.2 ng/mL and 67.0 +/- 6.4 ng/mL, p < 0.0001) through ELISA and demonstrated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.723 (p < 0.0001) with a 92.5% specificity, 48.2% sensitivity, and 95.7% positive predictive value. Furthermore, unlike CEA and PAI-1, up-regulation of TRFM in pathological stages I & II groups compared with stages III & IV groups lead us to expect the use TRFM for early-stage diagnosis of CRC. In this study, we suggest TRFM as a potential serological marker for CRC and expect our discovery strategy to help identify highly cancer-specific and body-fluid-accessible biomarkers.

To uncover serologic biomarkers that alone or in combination could reliably detect IC in this population, IgG antibodyreactivity profiles to the Candida albicans intracellular proteome were examined by serological proteome analysis (SERPA) and data mining procedures in a training set of 24 non-neutropenic patients. Despite the high interindividual molecular heterogeneity, unsupervised clustering analyses revealed that serum 22-IgG antibodyreactivity patterns differentiated IC from non-IC patients. Univariate analyses further highlighted that 15 out of the 22 SERPA-identified IgG antibodies could be useful candidate IC biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of one of these candidates (anti-Hsp90 IgG antibodies) was validated using an ELISA prototype in a test set of 59 non-neutropenic patients. We then formulated an IC discriminator based on the combined immunoproteomic fingerprints of this and another SERPA-detected and previously validated IC biomarker (anti-Eno1 IgG antibodies) in the training set. Its consistency was substantiated using their ELISA prototypes in the test set. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses showed that this two-biomarker signature accurately identified IC in non-neutropenic patients and provided better IC diagnostic accuracy than the individual biomarkers alone. We conclude that this serum IgG antibody signature directed against C. albicans Hsp90 and Eno1, if confirmed prospectively, may be useful for IC diagnosis in non-neutropenic patients.

The effects of co-morbidity in defining major depression subtypes associated with long-term course and severity	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Co-morbidity; data mining; depression subtypes; depression symptom profiles; elastic net; machine learning; predictive modeling; risk assessment	RECURSIVE PARTITIONING ANALYSIS; LARGE-SAMPLE; DISORDER; PREDICTORS; INPATIENTS; REMISSION; RISK; REGULARIZATION; SUICIDALITY; POPULATION	Background. Although variation in the long-term course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing symptom subtype distinctions, recent research suggests that prediction can be improved by using machine learning methods. However, it is not known whether these distinctions can be refined by added information about co-morbid conditions. The current report presents results on this question. Method. Data came from 8261 respondents with lifetime DSM-IV MDD in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Outcomes included four retrospectively reported measures of persistence/severity of course (years in episode; years in chronic episodes; hospitalization for MDD; disability due to MDD). Machine learning methods (regression tree analysis; lasso, ridge and elastic net penalized regression) followed by k-means cluster analysis were used to augment previously detected subtypes with information about prior co-morbidity to predict these outcomes. Results. Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors. Conclusions. Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion.

Timeliness (ie, the ability of the signal detection process to detect signals prior to any regulator) was taken as a main component of effectiveness. Over this 5-year period, 568 (about 17%) of the 3481 signals submitted by the safety management team at the signal escalation boards were identified as new or changing signals. Of these 568 signals, 53 (10%) were detected first by health authorities (a quarter of which were class signals). In conclusion, the signal detection process at Novartis Pharmaceuticals could detect at least 9 of 10 signals prior to them being detected by health authorities.

Anomaly Detection from Incomplete Data	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Anomaly detection; mobile phone; correlation-based clustering; anomaly trajectory	FRAMEWORK; EVENTS	Anomaly detection (a.k.a., outlier or burst detection) is a well-motivated problem and a major data mining and knowledge discovery task. In this article, we study the problem of population anomaly detection, one of the key issues related to event monitoring and population management within a city. Through studying detected population anomalies, we can trace and analyze these anomalies, which could help to model city traffic design and event impact analysis and prediction. Although a significant and interesting issue, it is very hard to detect population anomalies and retrieve anomaly trajectories, especially given that it is difficult to get actual and sufficient population data. To address the difficulties of a lack of real population data, we take advantage of mobile phone networks, which offer enormous spatial and temporal communication data on persons. More importantly, we claim that we can utilize these mobile phone data to infer and approximate population data. Thus, we can study the population anomaly detection problem by taking advantages of unique features hidden in mobile phone data. In this article, we present a system to conduct Population Anomaly Detection (PAD). First, we propose an effective clustering method, correlation-based clustering, to cluster the incomplete location information from mobile phone data (i.e., from mobile call volume distribution to population density distribution). Then, we design an adaptive parameter-free detection method, R-scan, to capture the distributed dynamic anomalies. Finally, we devise an efficient algorithm, BT-miner, to retrieve anomaly trajectories. The experimental results from real-life mobile phone data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the proposed methods are realized as a pilot system in a city in China.

Vast, but largely untapped, Earth and life science data resources offer a potentially revolutionary alternative "abductive" approach to investigate Earth's co-evolving geosphere and biosphere. We therefore advocate a strategic, data-driven program for accelerated scientific discovery.

In this paper we illustrate the benefits of a data mining inspired approach to statistically analysing a bespoke data set, the academic multicentre randomised control trial, UK Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST-UK), with a view to discovering new insights distinct from the original hypotheses of the trial. We consider post-stroke mortality prediction as a function of days since stroke onset, showing that the time scales that best characterise changes in mortality risk are most naturally defined by examination of the mortality curve. We show that certain risk factors differentiate between very short term and intermediate term mortality. In particular, we show that age is highly relevant for intermediate term risk but not for very short or short term mortality. We suggest that this is due to the concept of frailty. Other risk factors are highlighted across a range of variable types including socio-demographics, past medical histories and admission medication. Using the most statistically significant risk factors we build predictive classification models for very short term and short/intermediate term mortality.

Automatic extraction and categorization of Faenza Codex figurations	EARLY MUSIC			English	Article						Faenza Codex; pattern discovery; figuration; diminution; computational music analysis; data mining		The Faenza Codex contains highly diverse instrumental figurations in the Ars Nova style and is unique in its sharp jump from simple melodic skeleton lines to extremely elaborate figurations (a diminution can accommodate up to 20 notes per one melodic note). This makes the manuscript an interesting candidate on which to build a figuration dictionary, here extracted through computer-aided analysis. The dictionary was based on the diminution part only, using statistical considerations, without any presuppositions about the compositional origins of the pieces (French/Italian, secular/sacred, one or many scribes). We hope that it will serve as a point of reference for the talented performer-improviser of early 15th-century music. The final section of the article makes use of the extracted figurations as a way to assess the homogeneity of the Faenza Codex pieces based on hierarchical clustering.

Body Shadowing and Furniture Effects for Accuracy Improvement of Indoor Wave Propagation Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Indoor propagation; calibration; measurements; neural network; data mining	COMMUNICATION	Generally empirical models are developed on the basis of measurements achieved in empty buildings. But in practice human bodies and furniture presence induce a considerable fluctuation leading to huge differences between predictions and real measurements. In this paper a new indoor large scale path loss empirical model is presented. The model design, in addition to the considered phenomena in conventional empirical formulation, integrates additional suggestions recommended by electromagnetic techniques such as body shadowing and furniture effects. To achieve this work, a large number of experimental measurements have been carried on and saved in consequently voluminous databases. Their management and exploitation have considered data mining and especially neural networks to perform the new model called neural model. To prove model enhancement and accuracy we compare the "neural model" predictions with measurements. Obtained results show that the mean error is close to zero, the standard deviation is about 4.47 dB with a correlation factor of 97%.

Opportunities for Radiation-Dose Optimization Through Standardized Analytics and Decision Support	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Radiation safety; data mining; decision support	IONIZING-RADIATION; CT; EXPOSURE; PATIENT; SCANS; RISK	Although the potential for adverse clinical outcomes related to medical radiation have been well documented for over a century, several relatively recent trends have increased awareness of radiation safety in medical imaging. These include expanded CT applications and utilization, increased patient attention on radiation carcinogenesis, and a wide array of legislative and societal radiation initiatives, created partly in response to media reports of CT-induced radiation complications. With this heightened radiation awareness and scrutiny comes a unique and timely opportunity for the collective medical-imaging community to incorporate comparative radiation metrics and analysis directly into routine workflow and reporting. If properly performed, a number of benefits could in theory be derived, including improved clinical outcomes, creation of data-driven best practice guidelines, opportunities for enhanced education and research, dose-reduction technology innovation, and reversal of existing commoditization trends.Copyright (C) 2014 American College of Radiology	Baltimore VA Med Ctr, Dept Diagnost Imaging, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA	Reiner, BI (reprint author), Baltimore VA Med Ctr, Dept Diagnost Imaging, 22 N Greene St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.	breiner1@comcast.net						20	0	0	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA	1546-1440			J AM COLL RADIOL	J.

Data analysis techniques have been proposed in the last 50 years in the economic, legal, statistical, and, recently, in the data mining literature. This is not surprising, since discrimination analysis is a multidisciplinary problem, involving sociological causes, legal argumentations, economic models, statistical techniques, and computational issues. The objective of this survey is to provide a guidance and a glue for researchers and anti-discrimination data analysts on concepts, problems, application areas, datasets, methods, and approaches from a multidisciplinary perspective. We organize the approaches according to their method of data collection as observational, quasi-experimental, and experimental studies. A fourth line of recently blooming research on knowledge discovery based methods is also covered. Observational methods are further categorized on the basis of their application context: labor economics, social profiling, consumer markets, and others.

Simulating alternative coastal futures using a GIS-ANN web application	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scenario building; Public participation; Coastal urban areas management; GIS; Artificial neural network; Multilayer perceptron; Web application	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION GIS; DECISION-MAKING; PPGIS	In this paper, we demonstrate the use of scenario building in the context of contested land use visions. We examine a small coastal community located 20 kms south of Lisbon. In Almada - Trafaria/Costa da Caparica, competing stakeholders such as central government, local government, environmental NGO's and private companies each have competing development visions for the area. These include the development of recreation and leisure facilities, a container terminal and the re-naturalization of unused land. We illustrate the added value of the GIS-ANN tool in steering negotiations between these different visions and the potential of a scenario building web application as a tool for problem solving. The emergence of user-created GIS-based web content in Planning has transformed passive users and consumers of geospatial information into active contributors to the development of spatial visions of the future. It allows stakeholders to gauge alternative future land uses thus making planning and decision-making processes potentially more transparent and democratic. In this paper, we detail a new method that enhances GIS-web-based public participation. We build on a combination of GIS basic capabilities and the data mining methods of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), namely Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) packaged in a friendly (GUI) user interface that runs on the Google Earth platform. Users will be able to articulate different spatial development scenarios for a specific area, to conduct sensitivity analyses for various competing scenarios and to explore causal connections between them.

This approach is based (1) on a domain knowledge discretization (quality classes) of physico-chemical and biological parameters, and (2) on an extraction of temporal patterns used as discriminant features to link physico-chemistry with biology in river sampling sites. For each bio-index quality value, we obtained a set of significant discriminant features. We used them to identify the physico-chemical characteristics that impact on different biological dimensions according to their presence in extracted knowledge. The experiments meet with the domain knowledge and also highlight significant mismatches between physico-chemical and biological quality classes. Then, we discuss about the interest of using discriminant temporal patterns for the exploration and the analysis of temporal environmental data such as hydro-ecological databases.

These safety data are sometimes published as a condensed summary for the few compounds that reach the market, but the majority of studies are never made public and are often difficult to access in an automated way, even sometimes within the owning company itself. It is evident from many academic and industrial examples, that useful data mining and model development requires large and representative data sets and careful curation of the collected data. In 2010, under the auspices of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the eTOX project started with the objective of extracting and sharing preclinical study data from paper or pdf archives of toxicology departments of the 13 participating pharmaceutical companies and using such data for establishing a detailed, well-curated database, which could then serve as source for read-across approaches (early assessment of the potential toxicity of a drug candidate by comparison of similar structure and/or effects) and training of predictive models.

This challenges compound data mining efforts and makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions from data analysis. We have aimed to investigate the influence of individual parameters and data confidence levels on compound selection and property assessment. Therefore, alternative sets of bioactive compounds were systematically extracted from ChEMBL on the basis of iteratively expanding selection criteria with increasing stringency covering a variety of search parameters. The sequential application of criteria for the selection of high-confidence compound data was order-independent, as expected. Furthermore, the influence of separately applied selection criteria was analyzed. Criteria that largely influenced compound selection and compound promiscuity rates were identified. In the presence of stringent selection criteria and high data confidence, many compounds with likely assay artifacts or liabilities were eliminated from further consideration. Taken together, the findings of our analysis emphasize the need to carefully consider search parameters related to target organisms, confidence level of activity, and activity measurements and suggest reliable protocols for compound data mining.

J	Rahman, MA; Islam, MZ				Rahman, Md Anisur; Islam, Md Zahidul			A hybrid clustering technique combining a novel genetic algorithm with K-Means	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; Genetic algorithm; K-Means; Cluster evaluation; Data mining	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; VALIDITY INDEXES; EXPRESSION DATA; CLASSIFICATION	Many existing clustering techniques including K-Means require a user input on the number of clusters. It is often extremely difficult for a user to accurately estimate the number of clusters in a data set. The genetic algorithms (GAs) generally determine the number of clusters automatically. However, they typically choose the genes and the number of genes randomly. If we can identify the right genes in the initial population then GAs have better possibility to produce a high quality clustering result than the case when we randomly choose the genes. We propose a novel GA based clustering technique that is capable of automatically finding the right number of clusters and identifying the right genes through a novel initial population selection approach. With the help of our novel fitness function, and gene rearrangement operation it produces high quality cluster centers. The centers are then fed into K-Means as initial seeds in order to produce an even higher quality clustering solution by allowing the initial seeds to readjust as needed. Our experimental results indicate a statistically significant superiority (according to the sign test analysis) of our technique over five recent techniques on twenty natural data sets used in this study based on six evaluation criteria.

To cope with this issue, classification techniques robust to noisy data are needed. Bayesian approaches are known to be fairly robust to noise. However, to compute probability estimates state-of-the-art Bayesian approaches adopt a lazy pattern-based strategy, which shows some limitations when coping data affected by a notable amount of noise. This paper proposes RIB (Robust Itemset-based Bayesian classifier), a novel eager and pattern-based Bayesian classifier which discovers frequent itemsets from training data and exploits them to build accurate probability estimates. Enforcing a minimum frequency of occurrence on the considered itemsets reduces the sensitivity of the probability estimates to noise. Furthermore, learning a Bayesian Network that also considers high-order dependences among data usually neglected by traditional Bayesian approaches appears to be more robust to noise and data overfitting than selecting a small subset of patterns tailored to each test instance. The experiments demonstrate that RIB is, on average, more accurate than most state-of-the-art classifiers, Bayesian and not, on benchmark datasets in which different kinds and levels of noise are injected. Furthermore, its performance on the same datasets prior to noise injection is competitive with that of state-of-the-art classifiers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For example, the energy used might not be billed due to illegal manipulation or a breakdown in the customer's measurement equipment. These types of losses are called non-technical losses (NTLs), and these losses are usually greater than the losses that are due to the distribution infrastructure (technical losses). Traditionally, a large number of studies have used data mining to detect NTLs, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that involve the use of a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) that is created based on the knowledge and expertise of the inspectors. In the present study, a KBS was built that is based on the knowledge and expertise of the inspectors and that uses text mining, neural networks, and statistical techniques for the detection of NTLs. Text mining, neural networks, and statistical techniques were used to extract information from samples, and this information was translated into rules, which were joined to the rules that were generated by the knowledge of the inspectors. This system was tested with real samples that were extracted from Endesa databases. Endesa is one of the most important distribution companies in Spain, and it plays an important role in international markets in both Europe and South America, having more than 73 million customers.

Unfortunately, current trajectory information is not yet sufficiently rich to support classification of user transportation modes. In this paper, we propose a method that employs both the Global Positioning System and accelerometer data from smart devices to classify user outdoor transportation modes. The classified modes include walking, bicycling, and motorized transport, in addition to the motionless (stationary) state, for which we provide new depth analysis. In our classification, stationary mode has two sub-modes: stay (remaining in the same place for a prolonged time period; e. g., in a parked vehicle) and wait (remaining at a location for a short period; e. g., waiting at a red traffic light). These two sub-modes present different semantics for data mining applications. We use support vector machines with parameters that are optimized for pattern recognition. In addition, we employ ant colony optimization to reduce the dimension of features and analyze their relative importance. The resulting classification system achieves an accuracy rate of 96.31% when applied to a dataset obtained from 18 mobile users.

APT is, therefore, very well suited for the analysis of a nanostructured specimen such as matrix-embedded nanoparticles, ultra-thin films and junctions, grain boundaries, and others. This presentation will emphasize these capabilities, describing three methods of data mining that can be used to fully exploit APT: (i) Visualization of atomic lattice planes in crystalline specimens, (ii) the determination of iso-concentration surfaces and proximity histograms derived thereof, and (iii) a cluster identification algorithm based on maximum-atom separations. These approaches will be illustrated by means of different types of samples: a crystalline tungsten specimen, a Fe/Cr/Fe multilayer system, Si nanocrystals embedded in a silicon oxide matrix, and Mg clustering in GaN. The results demonstrate clearly that sub-nm-sized structures can be characterized by APT. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study surveyed a sample of 610 older people in Taipei City. The respondents rated the degree of importance of 18 indicators, and their degree of satisfaction with 35 items, which were derived from these 18 indicators relating to age-friendly transportation. Rough Sets Theory (RST) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) were used as qualitative and quantitative data mining approaches. Useful and simple decision rules regarding the perspective of age-friendly transportation can be obtained using RST. These decision rules involve policy implications. The application of IPA further facilitated the focuses of improvement strategies. Subsequently, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to evaluate improvement strategies. The results showed that the focuses and the priority ranking of the strategy scenarios were (1) training for bus drivers; (2) enhancing the universal design of transport stops and stations; (3) enhancing the quality of transit information and providing more pedestrian scrambles; (4) education for drivers and enforcement of driving rules; and (5) providing more age-friendly vehicles. Two out of five strategy scenarios are related to driver behavior. We strongly recommend that the future policy focus be on requiring people to be competent and courteous drivers.

In this study, we proposed a new method by merging mathematical data analysis with feed forward back propagation neural network utilizing post-fracturing data. The model preference is thereby based on the correlation coefficients of several selected independent variables against production performance. The solution to this expense is a tool that can identify restimulation candidates quickly and economically. We employ two mathematical analysis techniques to filter several independent yet influential parameters as inputs. These parameters are supposed to be primary factors with high impact on potential production improvement. Then we use these well data to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict post-fracture production. The errors of the best samples should decrease consistently along with the training samples. A minimal error of the training sets is not necessary because over-fitting of the network could be memorizing rather than generalizing. The testing results showed that there is higher than 80% prediction accuracy, which is good enough for decision making. This methodology gives credible prediction results when it is applied in Zhongyuan oilfield and provides the operators with useful recommendations to make decisions for restimulation.

Comparison of WAVENET and ANN for predicting the porosity obtained from well log data	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						porosity; neural network; activation function; wavelet; wavelet neural network; wavenet	WAVELET NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHAOTIC TIME-SERIES; PERMEABILITY PREDICTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; RESERVOIR; SYSTEM	Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.

In the present study, the implementation of the intact therapeutic agent into two different initial testing procedures based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is reported, along with the characterization of urinary metabolites by electrospray ionization-high resolution/high accuracy (tandem) mass spectrometry. For GC-MS analyses, urine samples were subjected to liquid-liquid extraction sample preparation, while LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted by established dilute-and-inject' approaches. Both screening methods were validated for trimetazidine concerning specificity, limits of detection (0.5-50ng/mL), intra-day and inter-day imprecision (<20%), and recovery (41%) in case of the GC-MS-based method. In addition, major metabolites such as the desmethylated trimetazidine and the corresponding sulfoconjugate, oxo-trimetazidine, and trimetazidine-N-oxide as identified in doping control samples were used to complement the LC-MS/MS-based assay, although intact trimetazidine was found at highest abundance of the relevant trimetazidine-related analytes in all tested sports drug testing samples. Retrospective data mining regarding doping control analyses conducted between 1999 and 2013 at the Cologne Doping Control Laboratory concerning trimetazidine revealed a considerable prevalence of the drug particularly in endurance and strength sports accounting for up to 39 findings per year.

For example, Facebook offers a service allowing marketers to utilize users' posts to automatically generate advertisements. The effectiveness of this practice depends on the ability to accurately predict a post's influence on its readers. For an advertising strategy of this nature, the influence of a post is determined jointly by the features of the post, such as contents and time of creation, and the features of the author of the post. We propose two models for predicting the influence of a post using both sources of influence, post-and author-related features, as predictors. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed predictive features improve prediction accuracy, and the models are effective in predicting the influence score. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chien, CF; Chuang, SC				Chien, Chen-Fu; Chuang, Shih-Chung			A Framework for Root Cause Detection of Sub-Batch Processing System for Semiconductor Manufacturing Big Data Analytics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Sub-batch processing system; big data analytics; root cause detection; data mining; longitudinal data analysis	ROUGH SET-THEORY; CYCLE TIME; REGRESSION; INTELLIGENCE; SELECTION; YIELD; FORECAST; INDUSTRY; MODELS; TOOL	Root cause detecting and rapid yield ramping for advanced technology nodes are crucial to maintain competitive advantages for semiconductor manufacturing. Since the data structure is increasingly complicated in a fully automated wafer fabrication facility, it is difficult to diagnose the whole production system for fault detection. A number of approaches have been proposed for fault diagnosis and root cause detection. However, many constraints in real settings restrict the usage of conventional approaches, due to the big data with complicated data structure. In particular, a batch may not be considered as a run in the present sub-batch processing system for wafer fabrication, in which the processing paths of the wafers in a batch could be different. Motivated by realistic needs, this paper aims to develop a root cause detection framework for the sub-batch processing system. Briefly, the proposed framework consists of three phases: data preparation, data dimension reduction, and the sub-batch processing model construction and evaluation. The proposed approach has been validated by a sequence of simulations and an empirical study conducted in a leading semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan. The results have shown practical viability of the proposed approach. Indeed, the developed approach is incorporated in the engineering data analysis system in this case company.

Classification of breast tissue based on spectral features of impedance loci has frequently been done to classify malignant tissue with further requirement of more complex classification methodologies needed to improve the characterisation. In current study, tissue classification is done using in vivo electrical impedance data of 18 human subjects, from four quadrants of breast, palm, nail, arm, bicep and classified using algorithms involving machine learning methodologies, specifically support vector machines (SVMs) that are supervised learning models. They consist of learning algorithms based on the principal of structural risk minimisation. Two methodologies of SVM have been used in this study: with data binning and data pruning and without data binning and data pruning. Data binning and data pruning have improved the sensitivity of the SVM from 76.76 to 89.23%, but the specificity has decreased from 76.23 to 74.15%. This is a pilot study towards testing the reliability of the developed electrical impedance measuring system and developing a data mining-based decision making system into an electrical impedance spectroscopy system, to help users (physicians) with tissue classification leading to reliable objective decision making.

Besides positive association rules, negative association rule mining, which find out negation relationships of frequent item-sets are also important. The importance of negative association rule mining is accounted in customer-driven domains such as market basket analysis for identifying products that conflict with each other. In multi-database mining context, mining negation relation among item-sets and synthesizing global negative association rules from multiple data sources located in different places are having importance in arriving decisions both at strategic and branch levels. This paper made an attempt for synthesizing global negative association rules which are voted by most of the participating data sources while mining multiple data sources. Experimental data are employed to test the theoretical analysis of the proposal using UCI machine learning repository data set. The space and time complexity analysis presented in the paper show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

J	Abbasimehr, H; Setak, M; Tarokh, M				Abbasimehr, Hossein; Setak, Mostafa; Tarokh, Mohammad			A Comparative Assessment of the Performance of Ensemble Learning in Customer Churn Prediction	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Churn prediction; data mining; classification; ensemble learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; SERVICES; EMAILS; SYSTEM	Customer churn is a main concern of most firms in all industries. The aim of customer churn prediction is detecting customers with high tendency to leave a company. Although, many modeling techniques have been used in the field of churn prediction, performance of ensemble methods has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative assessment of the performance of four popular ensemble methods, i.e., Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting based on four known base learners, i.e., C4.5 Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Reduced Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER). Furthermore, we have investigated the effectiveness of two different sampling techniques, i.e., oversampling as a representative of basic sampling techniques and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) as a representative of advanced sampling techniques. Experimental results show that SMOTE doesn't increase predictive performance. In addition, the results show that the application of ensemble learning has brought a significant improvement for individual base learners in terms of three performance indicators i.e., AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Particularly, in our experiments, Boosting resulted in the best result among all other methods. Among the four ensemble methods Boosting RIPPER and Boosting C4.5 are the two best methods. These results indicate that ensemble methods can be a best candidate for churn prediction tasks.

J	Onali, E; Ginesti, G				Onali, Enrico; Ginesti, Gianluca			Pre-adoption market reaction to IFRS 9: A cross-country event-study	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY			English	Article							FINANCIAL CRISIS; CONTRIBUTE	We are the first to examine the market reaction to 13 announcement dates related to IFRS 9 for over 5400 European listed firms. We find an overall positive reaction to the introduction of IFRS 9. The regulation is particularly beneficial to shareholders of firms in countries with weaker rule of law and a smaller divergence between local GAAP and IAS 39. Bootstrap simulations rule out the possibility that sampling error or data mining are driving our findings. Our main findings are also robust to confounding events and the extent of the media coverage for each event. These results suggest that investors perceive the new regulation as shareholder-wealth enhancing and-support the view-that stronger comparability across accounting standards of European firms is beneficial to international investors and outweighs the costs of poorer firm-specific information.

During management of these projects, a vast amount of data is collected and discarded without being analyzed to extract useful knowledge. To address this issue, an integrated proposed methodology is developed based on a five-step knowledge discovery in data (KDD) model. First, a synthesis of previous research is presented. Second, an inclusive analysis of the industrial construction domain and labor resources data is performed. Third, the concept of predefined progressable work packages is introduced for consistent data collection. Fourth, a prototype data warehouse is built using the snowflake schema to centrally store the collected data and produce dynamic online analytical processing (OLAP) reports and graphs. Fifth, data mining techniques are applied to extract useful knowledge from large sets of real projects' data. Results show that the developed methodology is capable of gathering valuable knowledge from previously unanalyzed data that significantly improves current resource management practices.

The importance of mitochondrial SSRs (mtSSRs) in fields like population genetics, plant phylogenetics and genome mapping motivated us to develop MitoSatPlant, a repository of plant mtSSRs. It contains information for perfect, imperfect and compound SSRs mined from 92 mitochondrial genomes of green plants, available at NCBI (as of 1 Feb 2014). A total of 72,798 SSRs were found, of which PCR primers were designed for 72,495 SSRs. Among all sequences, tetranucleotide repeats (26,802) were found to be most abundant whereas hexanucleotide repeats (2751) were detected with least frequency. MitoSatPlant was developed using SQL server 2008 and can be accessed through a front end designed in ASP.Net. It is an easy to use, user-friendly database and will prove to be a useful resource for plant scientists. To the best of our knowledge MitoSatPlant is the only database available for plant mtSSRs and can be freely accessed at http://compubio.in/mitosatplant/.

It is obvious that identifying the main risk factors and determining their qualitative and quantitative rates is essential to the implementation of effective safety management. The main purpose of this study is to use the new risk management methods for occupational accidents and improve work safety. Recent research shows that data mining techniques are powerful tools in assessing the risk of occupational accidents; by combining previous methods, such as the coefficients of accident assessment which are used to assess an organization's safety and data mining models. This study attempts to present a new risk assessment method for occupational accidents. The results show that the proposed method could identify and evaluate critical points with a high level of accuracy. A practical application of the method is also presented in which the workplaces at most risk in 2010 are identified and the risk level for each category is determined. Then, repeating the procedure for 2011, critical points based on previous data are determined, and a list of workplaces requiring periodic inspections in 2012 is produced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores key principles of comparative effectiveness analysis-in particular, how radiologic comparative and cost-effectiveness studies differ from other clinical trials. Exemplary studies are reviewed to show how comparative effectiveness has been implemented in radiology and how future studies might be conducted. Finally, the article closes with a discussion of several additional key themes relevant to quality and value in clinical radiology going forward. CONCLUSION. Comparative effectiveness is likely to require a paradigm shift in thinking within the discipline. For new radiologic applications to be accepted, we will need to show at least a significant change in treatment planning and at best a meaningful change in patient outcomes. This shift will require a forward-thinking approach to robust evidence generation for new imaging modalities or indications and the inclusion of other modes of value demonstration such as clinical decision support and intelligent data mining.

Accurate forecasting is a great help for companies in making the best decisions in terms of unit commitment, production, and maintenance planning. It is necessary for the companies to have prior foresight of future demand with adequate accuracy. Some data mining algorithms play the greatest role in predicting the demand forecasting. As a regular data-driven method, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are popular in energy forecasting. This paper investigated the application of the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a forecasting tool for predicting the energy demand in Turkey. The benefit of the proposed model is forecasting energy needs through the evaluation of ANFIS application using data sets processed with principle component analysis (PCA) and collected from the energy forecast shootout (EFS) and Ministry of Natural Resources Turkey. The results showed that the hybrid ANFIS model based upon fuzzy logic (FL) and ANN performed efficiently in term of forecast accuracy. Thus, it could be regarded as an alternative method in energy forecasting. Finally, the application of ANFIS in a long term energy forecasting was provided, and the results were interpreted.

Privacy-preserving trajectory stream publishing	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material						Data sharing; Data mining; Privacy protection; Spatio-temporal databases; Data stream	ANONYMITY	Recent advancement in mobile computing and sensory technology has facilitated the possibility of continuously updating, monitoring, and detecting the latest location and status of moving individuals. Spatio-temporal data generated and collected on the fly are described as trajectory streams. This work is motivated by the concern that publishing individuals' trajectories on the fly may jeopardize their privacy. In this paper, we illustrate and formalize two types of privacy attacks against moving individuals. We devise a novel algorithm, called Incremental Trajectory Stream Anonymizer (ITSA), for incrementally anonymizing a sequence of sliding windows on trajectory stream. The sliding windows are dynamically updated with joining and leaving individuals. The sliding windows are updated by using an efficient data structure to accommodate massive volume of data. We conducted extensive experiments on simulated and real-life data sets to evaluate the performance of our method. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly lowers runtime compared to existing methods, and efficiently scales when handling massive data sets.

Systems Biology aims to the comprehensive knowledge of the structure, dynamics, control and design that define a given biological system. Systems Biology benefits from the continuous advances in the omics sciences, based on high-throughput and high-content technologies, as well as on bioinformatic tools for data mining and integration. The Systems Biology approach is becoming gradually used to propose and to test comprehensive models of aging, both at the level of the immune system and the whole organism. In this way, immune aging may be described by a dynamic view of the states and interactions of every individual cell and molecule of the immune system and their role in the context of aging and longevity. This mini-review presents a panoramics of the current strategies, tools and challenges for applying Systems Biology to immune aging. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal of this study is to take a preliminary step toward informing future decision making by applying data-mining techniques to identify similar days in the National Airspace System in terms of the cause and location of historically implemented ground delay programs. In the first part of this study, a modified K-means clustering algorithm was applied to all days from 2010 through 2012, resulting in the identification of 45 national-level daily clusters that represent unique combinations of historically implemented ground delay programs. The second part of this study focused on verifying the stated causes of the historical ground delay programs. Findings from this initial study indicated that it is possible to identify similar days under which the National Airspace System operates, and clustering techniques appear to be promising methods for identifying the major causes of ground delay programs.

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using techniques from machine learning and data mining to determine the future vacancy risks for individual properties and for neighborhoods using a variety of structural, demographic, socioeconomic, and city activity features with high accuracy. Within a larger systems-of-systems framework that we develop, these predictive analytics will allow a city to move from decision-making based on 'educated anecdotes' and reactive strategies aimed at the most urgent need, to policy development based on informed, holistic insight and proactive interventions that prevent and reverse decline.

Their advances can be assessed using patent indicators and text mining techniques. The aim of this study was at analyzing the advances in nanocellulose based on indicators compiled from patents filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 2000 to 2012. Assignees, technological subjects, highly cited patents, applications and types of nanocellulose were obtained by mining structured and unstructured data. The results highlighted the different interests in the USA market, mainly after 2007. Mined terms from titles and abstracts could add further information to the analysis. However, although the method applied was useful, it was not sufficient to identify all applications and types of nanocellulose involved in the sample analyzed, therefore it is recommended that other document parts be included in future analyses.

As DTW has quadratic time complexity, the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a parallel approach for DTW on a heterogeneous platform with a graphics processing unit (GPU). In order to exploit fine-grained data-level parallelism, we propose a specific parallel decomposition in DTW. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization technique called diamond tiling to improve the utilization of threads. Results show that our approach substantially reduces computational time.

Databases created with Saada come with a rich Web interface and an Application Programming Interface (API). They support the four most common VU services. Such databases can mix various categories of data in multiple collections. They allow a direct access to the original data while providing a homogeneous view thanks to an internal data model compatible with the characterization axis defined by the VO.

Massive Atomics for Massive Parallelism on GPUs	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						Performance; Management; GPU; Atomics; Parallelism; Concurrency		One important type of parallelism exploited in many applications is reduction type parallelism. In these applications, the order of the read-modify-write updates to one shared data object can be arbitrary as long as there is an imposed order for the read-modify-write updates. The typical way to parallelize these types of applications is to first let every individual thread perform local computation and save the results in thread-private data objects, and then merge the results from all worker threads in the reduction stage. All applications that fit into the map reduce framework belong to this category. Additionally, the machine learning, data mining, numerical analysis and scientific simulation applications may also benefit from reduction type parallelism. However, the parallelization scheme via the usage of thread-private data objects may not be viable in massively parallel GPU applications. Because the number of concurrent threads is extremely large (at least tens of thousands of), thread-private data object creation may lead to memory space explosion problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with shared data object management for reduction type parallelism on GPUs. Our approach exploits fine-grained parallelism while at the same time maintaining good programmability. It is based on the usage of intrinsic hardware atomic instructions. Atomic operation may appear to be expensive since it causes thread serialization when multiple threads atomically update the same memory object at the same time. However, we discovered that, with appropriate atomic collision reduction techniques, the atomic implementation can outperform the non-atomics implementation, even for benchmarks known to have high performance non-atomics GPU implementations. In the meantime, the usage of atomics can greatly reduce coding complexity as neither thread-private object management or explicit thread-communication (for the shared data objects protected by atomic operations) is necessary.

However, its performance depends crucially on the distance function used to compute distance between samples. In this paper, we first define the concept of sample's neighborhood and present two related criteria according to neighborhood influence. Then, the influence of sample's neighborhood is comprehensively considered when computing the distances between the query and training samples. Finally, we propose an improved nearest neighbor classification algorithm via fusing neighborhood information. The proposed method can precisely characterize the distance among samples as well as enhance the predictive power of classifier to some extent. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm basically outperforms classical nearest neighbor classifier and some other state-of-the-art classification methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subsequently characterized spectroscopically, and its catalytic properties were assessed. Substrate profiling of the P450(LaMO) revealed that it was a versatile catalyst, exhibiting hydroxylation and epoxidation activities as well as O-dealkylation and asymmetric sulfoxidation activities. Diverse compounds, including alkylbenzenes, aromatic bicyclic molecules, and terpenoids, were shown to be hydroxylated by P450(LaMO). Such diverse catalytic activities are uncommon for the bacterial P450s, and the P450(LaMO) -mediated stereoselective hydroxylation of inactivated CH bondsubiquitous and relatively unreactive in organic moleculesis particularly unusual. The self-sufficient nature of P450(LaMO), coupled with its broad substrate range, highlights it as an ideal template for directed evolution towards various applications.

Here, a data mining workflow based on MS/MS precursor lists targeting only signals related to bacterial metabolism is established using LC-MS data of crude extracts from shaking flask fermentations. The devised method is not biased toward specific compound classes or structural features and is capable of increasing the information content of LC-MS/MS analyses by directing fragmentation events to signals of interest. The approach is thus contrary to typical auto-MS2 setups where precursor ions are usually selected according to signal intensity, which is regarded as a drawback for metabolite discovery applications when samples contain many overlapping signals and the most intense signals do not necessarily represent compounds of interest. In line with this, the method described here achieves improved MS/MS scan coverage for low-abundance precursor ions not captured by auto-MS2 experiments and thereby facilitates the search for new secondary metabolites in complex biological samples. To underpin the effectiveness of the approach, the identification and structure elucidation of two new myxobacterial secondary metabolite classes is reported.

Post-licensure surveillance of trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine in adults, United States, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), July 2005-June 2013	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine safety; Post-licensure surveillance; Live attenuated influenza vaccine	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES ACIP; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; SMALLPOX VACCINATION; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; SAFETY DATA; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVENTION; GUIDELINES; COLLECTION	Background: Trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed and recommended for use in 2003 in children and adults 2-49 years of age. Post-licensure safety data have been limited, particularly in adults. Methods: We searched Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from July 1,2005-June 30, 2013 (eight influenza seasons) in adults aged >= 18 years old. We conducted descriptive analyses and clinically reviewed serious reports (i.e., death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, or permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events (AEs) that were reported more frequently than expected. We calculated crude AE reporting rates to VAERS by influenza season. Results: During the study period, VAERS received 1207 LAIV3 reports in adults aged 18-49 years old; 107 (8.9%) were serious, including four death reports. The most commonly reported events were expired drug administered (n = 207, 17%), headache (n = 192, 16%), and fever (n = 133, 11%). The most common diagnostic categories for non-fatal serious reports were neurological (n = 40, 39%), cardiovascular (n = 14, 14%), and other non-infectious conditions (n = 20, 19%). We noted a higher proportion of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and cardiovascular reports in the Department of Defense (DoD) population compared to the civilian population. Data mining detected disproportional reporting of ataxia (n = 15); clinical review revealed that ataxia was a component of diverse clinical entities including GBS. Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports are reassuring, the only unexpected safety concern for LAIV3 identified was a higher than expected number of GBS reports in the DoD population, which is being investigated. Reports of administration of expired LAIV3 represent administration errors and indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding the approved indications. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a new rating model based on a support vector machine with monotonicity constraints derived from the prior knowledge of financial experts. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets show that the proposed method, not only data driven but also domain knowledge oriented, can help correct the loss of monotonicity in data occurring during the collecting process, and performs better than the conventional counterpart.

Most Ant Colony Optimization based classifiers can only deal with discrete attributes and need a pre-processing discretization step in case of numeric attributes. We propose an adaptation of AntMiner+ for rule mining which intrinsically handles numeric attributes. We describe the new approach and compare it to the existing algorithms. The proposed method achieves comparable results with existing methods on UCI datasets, but has advantages on datasets with strong interactions between numeric attributes. We analyse the effect of parameters on the classification accuracy and propose sensible defaults. We describe application of the new method on a real world medical domain which achieves comparable results with the existing method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bioactivity data on pIC(50) of 973 AIs were employed in the construction of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models using COR relation And Logic (CORAL) software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) in which molecular structures are represented by the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notation. Symbols inherently present in SMILES nomenclatures describe the presence of molecular fragments and therefore represent a facile approach that essentially eliminate the need to geometrically optimize molecular structures or the hassle of computing and selecting molecular descriptors. Predictive models were built in accordance with the OECD principles. Monte Carlo optimization of correlation weights of such molecular fragments provides pertinent information on structural constituents for correlating with the aromatase inhibitory activity. Results from different splits and data sub-sets indicated reliable models for predicting and interpreting the origins of aromatase inhibitory activities with the correlation coefficient (R-2) and cross-validated correlation coefficient (Q(2)) in ranges of 0.6271-0.7083 and 0.6218-0.7024, respectively. Insights gained from constructed models could aid in the future design of aromatase inhibitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: African American (N = 1,021), 683 women and 338 men, 50 to 75 years completed a telephone survey addressing demographics, colorectal cancer screening, cancer attitudes, and cancer related cultural attitudes. Several data analytics methods were applied and evaluated. Among them, results from associative data mining identified key variables and logistic regression was used to confirm associations to screening adherence. Results: Sets of co-occurring variables identified by associative data mining methods are extracted to further study differences between adherent and non-adherent groups. Logistic regressions suggested four variables were significantly associated with adherence: healthcare provider colonoscopy recommendation, prevention services at the place health care is usually sought, a history of colitis, and a history of polyps. Conclusions: The findings suggest a streamlined set of issues and concerns that may be used by providers advising patients or developing colorectal cancer intervention strategies for older African Americans. The data suggest the continued importance of healthcare provider recommendation to screen. It is important that providers give a clear recommendation to screen regardless of the test ultimately selected and should advise all patients that family history and the absence of symptoms or colitis do not eliminate the value of screening.

Often only a fraction of this information is used for peptide/protein identification, whereas a significant proportion of the peaks in a spectrum remain unexplained. In this paper we explore how a specific class of data mining techniques termed "frequent itemset mining" can be employed to discover patterns in the unassigned data, and how such patterns can help us interpret the origin of the unexpected/unexplained peaks. Results: First a model is proposed that describes the origin of the observed peaks in a mass spectrum. For this purpose we use the classical correlative database search algorithm. Peaks that support a positive identification of the spectrum are termed explained peaks. Next, frequent itemset mining techniques are introduced to infer which unexplained peaks are associated in a spectrum. The method is validated on two types of experimental proteomic data. First, peptide mass fingerprint data is analyzed to explain the unassigned peaks in a full scan mass spectrum. Interestingly, a large numbers of experimental spectra reveals several highly frequent unexplained masses, and pattern mining on these frequent masses demonstrates that subsets of these peaks frequently co-occur. Further evaluation shows that several of these co-occurring peaks indeed have a known common origin, and other patterns are promising hypothesis generators for further analysis. Second, the proposed methodology is validated on tandem mass spectrometral data using a public spectral library, where associations within the mass differences of unassigned peaks and peptide modifications are explored. The investigation of the found patterns illustrates that meaningful patterns can be discovered that can be explained by features of the employed technology and found modifications. Conclusions: This simple approach offers opportunities to monitor accumulating unexplained mass spectrometry data for emerging new patterns, with possible applications for the development of mass exclusion lists, for the refinement of quality control strategies and for a further interpretation of unexplained spectral peaks in mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry.

This paper shows that liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-HRMS) associated with the data mining tools developed for metabolomics can address this issue by enabling (i) targeted analyses of pollutants, (ii) detection of untargeted and unknown xenobiotics, and (iii) detection of metabolites useful for the characterization of food matrices. A proof-of-concept study was performed on 76 honey samples. Targeted analysis indicated that 35 of 83 targeted molecules were detected in the 76 honey samples at concentrations below regulatory limits. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomic-like analyses highlighted 12 chlorinated xenobiotics, 1 of which was detected in lavender honey samples and identified as 2,6-dichlorobenzamide, a metabolite of dichlobenil, a pesticide banned in France since 2010. Lastly, multivariate statistical analyses discriminated honey samples according to their floral origin, and six discriminating metabolites were characterized thanks to the MS/MS experiments.

ELM has been widely used in the applications of pattern recognition and data mining for its extremely fast training speed and highly recognition rate. But in most of real-world applications, there are irregular distributions and outlier problems which lower the classification rate of ELM (kernel ELM). This is mainly because: (1) Overfitting caused by outliers and unreasonable selections of activation function and kernel function and (2) the labeled sample size is small and we do not making full use of the information of unlabeled data either. Against problem one, this paper proposes a robust activation function (RAF) based on analyzing several different activation functions in-depth. RAF keeps the output of activation function away from zero as much as possible and minimizes the impacts of outliers to the algorithm. Thus, it improves the performance of ELM (kernel ELM); simultaneously, RAF can be applied to other kernel methods and a neural network learning algorithm. Against problem two, we propose a semi-supervised kernel ELM (SK-ELM). Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RAF and SK-ELM outperform the ELM which use other activation functions and semi-supervised (kernel) ELM methods.

Furthermore, real-world data applications usually present a class distribution where the samples that belong to one class, which is precisely the main interest, are hugely outnumbered by the samples of the other classes. This circumstance, known as the class imbalance problem, complicates the learning process as the standard learning techniques do not correctly address this situation. In this work, we analyse the performance of several techniques used to deal with imbalanced datasets in the big data scenario using the Random Forest classifier. Specifically, oversampling, undersampling and cost-sensitive learning have been adapted to big data using MapReduce so that these techniques are able to manage datasets as large as needed providing the necessary support to correctly identify the underrepresented class. The Random Forest classifier provides a solid basis for the comparison because of its performance, robustness and versatility. An experimental study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the diverse algorithms considered. The results obtained show that there is not an approach to imbalanced big data classification that outperforms the others for all the data considered when using Random Forest. Moreover, even for the same type of problem, the best performing method is dependent on the number of mappers selected to run the experiments. In most of the cases, when the number of splits is increased, an improvement in the running times can be observed, however, this progress in times is obtained at the expense of a slight drop in the accuracy performance obtained. This decrement in the performance is related to the lack of density problem, which is evaluated in this work from the imbalanced data point of view, as this issue degrades the performance of classifiers in the imbalanced scenario more severely than in standard learning.

We illustrate a novel method that addresses both these tasks in geophysical applications. The method is designed for numeric data routinely sampled through a sensor network. It extends the traditional time series forecasting theory by accounting for the spatial information of geophysical data. In particular, a forecasting model is computed incrementally by accounting for the temporal correlation of data which exhibit a spatial correlation in the recent past. For each sensor the observed value is compared to its spatial-aware forecast, in order to identify the outliers. Finally, the spatial correlation of outliers is analyzed, in order to classify changes and reduce the number of false anomalies. The performance of the presented method is evaluated in both artificial and real data streams. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We use a various collection of mathematical and statistical methodologies (estimated correlation matrix and principal component analysis) to capture these correlations. Our results show that there exist different degrees of correlation between commodities. We also demonstrate, through data mining analysis, that there are hidden correlations between some commodities. Indeed, some commodities' price behaviours are very similar in trend. Our results contribute to a better understanding of agricultural prices' behaviours by producers, investors and market intermediaries. The results contribute to a more efficient strategic asset allocation process within agricultural markets.

By using recent developments in data mining, it is a question of the classification of heterogeneous data in order to sort hedge funds by risk class. In practical terms, risk levels relative to measures of histogram-valued data on VaR are calculated as an aid to decision-making. The empirical study was carried out on 1023 HFR-based hedge funds, where we had estimated monthly ARMA-GARCH or asymmetric GARCH VaR and CVaR measures between 01 January 2003 and 31 December 2008. We identify two sub-periods: from 2003 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2008 in order to identify a recovery period after the 2001-2002 crisis and the impact of the 2007-2008 crisis. First, the symbolic approach allows us to construct the measures of histogram-valued data on VaR by optimizing the definition of categories. A symbolic principal component analysis shows that the indices coming from the VaR of the GARCH and asymmetrical GARCH are the most pertinent. Second, we apply a criterion of inter-class inertia and retain a partitioning of hedge funds into three classes by dynamic K-means cluster analysis. For each of our sub-periods and for each class, a risk level is defined on the basis of the categories of the most discriminating variable.

In this study, extensive data-mining and PCR amplification confirmed that there are at least six Sus genes (CitSus1-6) in the citrus genome. Gene structure and phylogeny analysis showed an evolutionary consistency with other plant species. The six Sus genes contain 12-15 exons and 11-14 introns and were evenly distributed into the three plant Sus groups (CitSus1 and CitSus2 in the Sus I group, CitSus3 and CitSus6 in the Sus II group, and CitSus4 and CitSus5 in the Sus III group). Transcripts of these six CitSus genes were subsequently examined. For tissues and organs, CitSus1 and 2 were predominantly expressed in fruit juice sacs (JS) whereas CitSus3 and 4 were predominantly expressed in early leaves (immature leaves), and CitSus5 and 6 were predominantly expressed in fruit JS and in mature leaves. During fruit development, CitSus5 transcript increased significantly and CitSus6 transcript decreased significantly in fruit JS. In the fruit segment membrane (SM), the transcript levels of CitSus2 and 5 were markedly higher and the abundant levels of CitSus3 and 6 gradually decreased. Moreover, transcript levels of CitSus1-4 examined were higher and the CitSus5 transcript level was lower in the fruit SM than in fruit JS, while CitSus6 had a similar transcript level in fruit JS and SM. In addition, transcripts of CitSus1-6 responded differently to dehydration in mature leaves or to mild drought stress in fruit JS and SM. Finally, the possible roles of Sus genes in the regulation of sugar accumulation are discussed; however, further study is required.

Potential hazards need to be identified in order to protect raw water resources. We propose a non-parametric data mining technique for exploring the presence of total coliforms (TC) in a groundwater abstraction well and its relationship to readily available, continuous time series of hydrometric monitoring parameters (seven year records of precipitation, river water levels, and groundwater heads). The original monitoring parameters were used to create an extensive generic dataset of explanatory variables by considering different accumulation or averaging periods, as well as temporal offsets of the explanatory variables. A classification tree based on the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) recursive partitioning algorithm revealed statistically significant relationships between precipitation and the presence of TC in both a production well and a nearby monitoring well. Different secondary explanatory variables were identified for the two wells. Elevated water levels and short-term water table fluctuations in the nearby river were found to be associated with TC in the observation well. The presence of TC in the production well was found to relate to elevated groundwater heads and fluctuations in groundwater levels. The generic variables created proved useful for increasing significance levels. The tree-based model was used to predict the occurrence of TC on the basis of hydrometric variables.

Our theory explains all the findings of Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003a) and confirms the theoretical possibility of a spurious regression bias. The theory developed in the article has important implications with respect to existing inferential theories in predictive regressions. We also propose a simple diagnostic test to detect potential spurious regression bias in empirical analysis.

The detection task is extremely difficult because of physical limitations of nuclear radiation detectors, shielding by intervening cargo materials, and the presence of background noise. We aim at enhancing the capabilities of detectors with algorithmic methods specifically tailored for nuclear data. This paper describes a novel graph-theory-based methodology for this task. This research considers for the first time the utilization of supervised normalized cut (SNC) for data mining and classification of measurements obtained from plastic scintillation detectors that are of particularly low resolution. Specifically, the situation considered here is for when both energy spectra and the time dependence of such data are acquired. We present here a computational study, comparing the supervised normalized cut method with alternative classification methods based on support vector machine (SVM), specialized feature-reducing SVMs (i.e., 1-norm SVM, recursive feature elimination SVM, and Newton linear program SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The study evaluates the performance of the suggested method in binary and multiple classification problems of nuclear data. The results demonstrate that the new approach is on par or superior in terms of accuracy and much better in computational complexity to SVM (with or without dimension or feature reduction) and LDA with principal components analysis as preprocessing. For binary and multiple classifications, the SNC method is more accurate, more robust, and is computationally more efficient by a factor of 2-80 than the SVM-based and LDA methods.

Accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer from acquired images is dependent on the expertise and experience of ultrasonographers or physicians, and is therefore, associated with inter observer variabilities. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) techniques use a number of different data mining techniques to automatically predict the presence or absence of cancer, and therefore, are more reliable and accurate. A review of published literature in the field of CAD based ovarian cancer detection indicates that many studies use ultrasound images as the base for analysis. The key objective of this work is to propose an effective adjunct CAD technique called GyneScan for ovarian tumor detection in ultrasound images. In our proposed data mining framework, we extract several texture features based on first order statistics, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and run length matrix. The significant features selected using t-test are then used to train and test several supervised learning based classifiers such as Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). We evaluated the developed framework using 1300 benign and 1300 malignant images. Using 11 significant features in KNN/PNN classifiers, we were able to achieve 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in detecting ovarian tumor. Even though more validation using larger databases would better establish the robustness of our technique, the preliminary results are promising. This technique could be used as a reliable adjunct method to existing imaging modalities to provide a more confident second opinion on the presence/absence of ovarian tumor.	[Acharya, U.

Tracking the degradation of fresh orange juice and discrimination of orange varieties: An example of NMR in coordination with chemometrics analyses	FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fresh orange juice; H-1 NMR fingerprint; Multivariate data analysis; Food degradation	H-1-NMR SPECTROSCOPY; QUALITY-CONTROL; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTRA; MARKER	Brazil is currently the largest exporter of concentrated orange juice and, unlike the other exporter countries, the domestic consumption is mainly based on the fresh orange juice. The quality control by evaluating the major chemical constituents under the influence of the most important factors, such as temperature and storage time of the product, is very important in this context. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and time on the degradation of fresh orange juice for 24 h, by using H-1 NMR technique and chemometric tools for data mining. The storage conditions at 24 h led to the production of the formic, fumaric and acetic acids; and an increase of succinic and lactic acids and ethanol, which were observed at low concentration at the initial time. Furthermore, analysis by PCA has successfully distinguished the juice of different species/varieties as well as the metabolites responsible for their separation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lin, SC; Chen, PS; Chang, CC				Lin, Shu-Chiung; Chen, Patrick S.; Chang, Chia-Ching			A novel method of mining network flow to detect P2P botnets	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; P2P Communication; Botnet		Botnets are a serious threat to cyber-security. As a consequence, botnet detection has become an important research topic in network protection and cyber-crime prevention. P2P botnets are one of the most malicious zombie networks, as their architecture imitates P2P software. Characteristics of P2P botnets include (1) the use of multiple controllers to avoid single-point failure; (2) the use of encryption to evade misuse detection technologies; and (3) the capacity to evade anomaly detection, usually by initiating numerous sessions without consuming substantial bandwidth. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel data mining method. First, we identify the differences between P2P botnet behavior and normal network behavior. Then, we use these differences to tune the data-mining parameters to cluster and distinguish normal Internet behavior from that lurking P2P botnets. This method can identify a P2P botnet without breaking the encryption. Furthermore, the detection system can be deployed without altering the existing network architecture, and it can detect the existence of botnets in a complex traffic mix before they attack. The experimental results reveal that the method is effective in recognizing the existence of botnets. Accordingly, the results of this study will be of value to information security academics and practitioners.

PCA tries to project the data into lower dimensional space while preserving the intrinsic information hidden in the data as much as possible. Disadvantage of PCA is that, extracted principal components (PCs) are linear combination of all features, hence PCs are may still contaminated with noise in the data. To address this problem we propose a modified version of PCA called noise free PCA (NFPCA), in which regularization is introduced during the PCs extraction step to mitigate the effect of noise. Potentials of the proposed method is assessed in two important application of high-dimensional molecular data: classification and survival prediction. Multiple publicly available real-world data sets are used for this illustration. Experimental results show that, the NFPCA produce highly informative than the ordinary PCA method. This is largely due to the fact that the NFPCA suppress the effect of noise in the PCs more efficiently with minimum information lost. The NFPCA is a promising alternative to existing PCA approaches not only in terms of highly informative PCs, but also its relatively cheap computational cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ali, OG; Ariturk, U				Ali, Ozden Gur; Ariturk, Umut			Dynamic churn prediction framework with more effective use of rare event data: The case of private banking	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Dynamic churn prediction; Data mining; Customer retention; Private banking; Customer relationship management; Rare event; Sampling; Training data generation	CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE; RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS; FINANCIAL SERVICES; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; DEFECTION; SELECTION; SETS	Customer churn prediction literature has been limited to modeling churn in the next (feasible) time period. On the other hand, lead time specific churn predictions can help businesses to allocate retention efforts across time, as well as customers, and identify early triggers and indicators of customer churn. We propose a dynamic churn prediction framework for generating training data from customer records, and leverage it for predicting customer churn within multiple horizons using standard classifiers. Further, we empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a case study about private banking customers in a European bank. The proposed framework includes customer observations from different time periods, and thus addresses the absolute rarity issue that is relevant for the most valuable customer segment of many companies. It also increases the sampling density in the training data and allows the models to generalize across behaviors in different time periods while incorporating the impact of the environmental drivers. As a result, this framework significantly increases the prediction accuracy across prediction horizons compared to the standard approach of one observation per customer; even when the standard approach is modified with oversampling to balance the data, or lags of customer behavior features are added as additional predictors. The proposed approach to dynamic churn prediction involves a set of independently trained horizon-specific binary classifiers that use the proposed dataset generation framework. In the absence of predictive dynamic churn models, we had to benchmark survival analysis which is used predominantly as a descriptive tool. The proposed method outperforms survival analysis in terms of predictive accuracy for all lead times, with a much lower variability. Further, unlike Cox regression, it provides horizon specific ranking of customers in terms of churn probability which allows allocation of retention efforts across customers and time periods.

Traditional data mining methods often require the experts in analytic domains to annotate the data. However, it is expensive and usually takes a long time. Crowdsourcing enables the use of heterogeneous background knowledge from volunteers and distributes the annotation process to small portions of efforts from different contributions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-arts on the crowdsourcing for data mining in recent years. We first review the challenges and opportunities of data mining tasks using crowdsourcing, and summarize the framework of them. Then we highlight several exemplar works in each component of the framework, including question designing, data mining and quality control. Finally, we conclude the limitation of crowdsourcing for data mining and suggest related areas for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MD has been used in Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) to develop classification scheme for systems having dichotomous states or categories. In MTS, selection of important features or variables to improve classification accuracy is done using Signal-to-Noise (SIN) ratios and Orthogonal Arrays (OAs). OAs has been reviewed for limitations in handling large number of variables. Secondly, penalty for over-fitting or regularization is not included in the feature selection process for the MTS classifier. Besides, there is scope to enhance the utility of MTS to a classification-cum-causality analysis method by adding comprehensive information about the underlying process which generated the data. This paper proposes to select variables based on maximization of degree-of-dependency between Subset of System Variables (SSVs) and system classes or categories (R). Degree-of-dependency, which reflects goodness-of-model and hence goodness of the SSV, is measured by conditional probability of system states on subset of variables. Moreover, a suitable regularization factor equivalent to L-0 norm is introduced in an optimization problem which jointly maximizes goodness-of-model and effect of regularization. Dependency between SSVs and R is modeled via the equivalent sets of Rough Set Theory. Two new variants of MTS classifier are developed and their performance in terms of accuracy of classification is evaluated on test datasets from five case studies. The proposed variants of MTS are observed to be performing better than existing MTS methods and other classification techniques found in literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of available features to build a good model for classification or prediction, while the class-imbalance problem arises when the class distribution is too skewed. Both issues have been independently studied in the literature, and a plethora of methods to address high dimensionality as well as class-imbalance has been proposed. The aim of this work is to simultaneously explore both issues, proposing a family of methods that select those attributes that are relevant for the identification of the target class in binary classification. We propose a backward elimination approach based on successive holdout steps, whose contribution measure is based on a balanced loss function obtained on an independent subset. Our experiments are based on six highly imbalanced microarray data sets, comparing our methods with well-known feature selection techniques, and obtaining a better prediction with consistently fewer relevant features.

Traditional splitting criteria such as information gain are sensitive to class distribution. In order to overcome the weakness, Hellinger Distance Decision Trees (HDDT) is proposed by Cieslak and Chawla. Despite HDDT outperforms the traditional decision trees, however, there may be other skew-insensitive splitting criteria. In this paper, we propose some new skew-insensitive splitting criteria which can be used in the construction of decision trees and applied a comprehensive empirical evaluation framework testing against commonly used sampling and ensemble methods, considering performance across 58 datasets. Based on the experimental results, we demonstrate the superiority of these skew-insensitive decision trees on the datasets with high imbalanced level and competitive performance on the datasets with low imbalanced level and K-L divergence-based decision tree (KLDDT) is the most robust among these skew-insensitive decision trees in the presence of class imbalance, especially when combined with SMOTE. Thus, we recommend the use of KLDDT with SMOTE when learning from high imbalanced datasets. Finally, we used these skew-insensitive decision trees to build the diagnosis model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in traditional Chinese Medicine. The results show that KLDDT is the most effective method.

Although efforts related to the healthcare applications exist in the current literature, there is a significant lack of investigation on the performance of such systems, when applied in error prone and limited resource wireless environments. This paper aimed to address this need by porting a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to a WSN simulation framework. The considered FIS is implemented on TelosB motes and evaluates the health status of a monitored person, in an energy conserving manner. A distributed implementation of the above FIS is also proposed, comprising an additional contribution of this paper, based on an objective function, attempting to reduce the network congestion and balance the energy consumption between network nodes. This work presents a thorough performance evaluation of the FIS under the distributed and the centralized approach, while varying the communication conditions and highlighting the advantages of the distributed execution of the FIS, leading to packet loss gain and transmission gain up to 67% and 25% respectively. The networking benefits from the distributed approach are reflected to the FIS performance. Respective results and comparative evaluation against Matlab simulations reveal strong dependencies of the application's performance to critical WSN network parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effective computation of feature selection is important for improving the classification performance. In rough set theory, many feature selection algorithms have been proposed to process static incomplete data. However, feature values in an incomplete data set may vary dynamically in real-world applications. For such dynamic incomplete data, a classic (non-incremental) approach of feature selection is usually computationally time-consuming. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose an incremental approach for feature selection, which can accelerate the feature selection process in dynamic incomplete data. We firstly employ an incremental manner to compute the new positive region when feature values with respect to an object set vary dynamically. Based on the calculated positive region, two efficient incremental feature selection algorithms are developed respectively for single object and multiple objects with varying feature values. Then we conduct a series of experiments with 12 UCI real data sets to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms compare favorably with that of applying the existing non-incremental methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mathematically modeling this question is surprisingly intricate when the underlying conjunctions, e.g., of predicates, are non-commutative. Potential applications of this question occur in data-mining, a field in which pattern-matching is important and commonly used. This paper uses ideas from enriched categories over monoidal categories to address such issues and enable pattern-matching techniques to extend to many-valued contexts equipped with non-commutative conjunctions: first, we consider the notion of a set enriched by a po-monoid L, which turns out to be a set equipped with an L-valued preorder; second, we extend the notion of enriched functors to formulate the appropriate definition of "variable-basis morphisms" between preordered sets over different lattice-theoretic bases; third, we construct the notion of topological systems enriched with many-valued preorders and use their extent spaces to motivate and formulate enriched (or preordered) topological spaces the compatibility or enrichment axioms for such systems and spaces model the programming question stated above using non-commutative tensor products. En route are determined a number of related notions and results: many-valued antisymmetry characterizes the L-T-0 separation axiom; many-valued preorders are categorically topological, and many-valued partial orders are monotopological; enriched topological spaces form a topological category; a large inventory of example classes is provided, including programming examples and an extensive discussion of examples based on the L-spectra of complete po-groupoids; and each of these related developments is provided a suitable lattice-theoretic and categorical foundation.

Bridge scour, a dynamic phenomenon that varies according to numerous factors (e.g., water depth, flow angle and strength, pier and abutment shape and width, material properties of the sediment), is a major cause of bridge failure and is critical to the total construction and maintenance costs of bridge building. Accurately estimating the equilibrium depths of local scouring near piers and abutments is vital for bridge design and management. Therefore, an efficient technique that can be used to enhance the estimation capability, safety, and cost reduction when designing and managing bridge projects is required. This study investigated the potential use of genetic algorithm (GA)-based support vector regression (SVR) model to predict bridge scour depth near piers and abutments. An SVR model developed by using MATLAB (R) was optimized using a GA, maximizing generalization performance. Data collected from the literature were used to evaluate the bridge scour depth prediction accuracy of the hybrid model. To demonstrate the capability of the computational model, the GA-SVR modeling results were compared with those obtained using numeric predictive models (i.e., classification and regression tree, chi-squared automatic interaction detector, multiple regression, artificial neural network, and ensemble models) and empirical methods. The proposed hybrid model achieved error rates that were 81.3% to 96.4% more accurate than those obtained using other methods. The GA-SVR model effectively outperformed existing methods and can be used by civil engineers to efficiently design safer and more cost-effective bridge substructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate the problem as a mathematical model using integer programming that is a typical combination problem with a solution space exponentially related to the problem size. A variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem with near-optimal solutions. Computational experiments are performed to test the VNS algorithm against a benchmark problem set. The results show that the VNS algorithm is an effective approach for solving the MTFWS problem, capable of discovering many large-one frequent itemset with time-windows (FITW) with a larger time-coverage rate than the lower bounds, thus laying a good foundation for mining ARTW.

The starting point for the forecasting models comprised results derived from an analysis of different features of soil and plants, collected from 139 locations in an area covering 100 km(2) around a lead-zinc ore mining and processing plant ('Boleslaw'), at Bukowno in southern Poland. In addition, the lead content was determined in the tissues and organs of 110 small rodents (mainly mice) caught in the same area. The prediction models, elaborated with the use of classification algorithms, forecasted with high probability the class (range) of pollution in animal tissues and organs with lead, based on various soil and plant properties of the study area. However, prediction models which use multilayer neural networks made it possible to calculate the content of lead (predicted versus measured) in animal tissues and organs with an excellent correlation coefficient.

This opinion paper provides a perspective on the contributions and future opportunities of the eddy covariance method. First, the paper discusses the pros and cons of this method relative to other methods used to measure the exchange of trace gases between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, it discusses how the use of eddy covariance method has grown and evolved. Today, more than 400 flux measurement sites are operating world-wide and the duration of the time series exceed a decade at dozens of sites. Networks of tower sites now enable scientists to ask scientific questions related to climatic and ecological gradients, disturbance, changes in land use, and management. The paper ends with discussions on where the field of flux measurement is heading. Topics discussed include role of open access data sharing and data mining, in this new era of big data, and opportunities new sensors that measure a variety of trace gases, like volatile organic carbon compounds, methane and nitrous oxide, and aerosols, may yield.

A Framework of Data-Enabled Science for Evaluation of Material Damage Based on Acoustic Emission	JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION			English	Article						Multivariate analysis; Random damage; Source physics; Big Data; Probabilistic entropy; Statistics	MOMENT TENSOR ANALYSIS; ACRYLIC BONE-CEMENT; MULTICOMPONENT VARIATE; RESIDUAL-STRESS; SIGNAL ANALYSIS; FRACTURE; BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITES; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	Analytics of 'Big Data' has been so promising that it is thought to be a new frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity in science and business. Vast amounts of material damage data constitute a unique set of "Big Data" which are generated from damage events when materials are under applied stress, and their occurrence is strongly related to the source physics. Such data forms fundamental "information infrastructure" such that the ensemble of these events can be used as the basis for evaluating the state of material damage, thereby making data-enabled material damage evaluation a new frontier for innovation. Presently, data-enabled digital analytics of material damage is in its infancy and is much needed to advance our understanding of damage physics, which has, for the most part, been overlooked by the classical deterministic approaches. In this article, we propose a framework of data-enabled science for evaluating material damage that includes the introduction of a 3S principle to guide the efforts, and a global damage variate D, which is a multivariate data matrix of random damage with its rows and columns being observations (spectrum) and scale (time series) vectors, respectively, of the real world damage. This multivariate damage data matrix facilitates the systematic employment of standard methods of multivariate statistics and data mining techniques. The proposed framework was implemented by examples taken from typical engineering materials using acoustic emission. The examples revealed that; (1) damage events are interactive and significantly correlated; (2) they form different ensembles in different loading stages implicating damage mechanisms, and (3) their phenomenological behavior can be modeled numerically. The information entropy of multiscale damage matrices revealed a trajectory of damage state that provides a new means to quantify real world material damage. We also highlight some promising research topics related to other digital analytics that can be used for the investigation of material damage.

Of daemons and men: A file system approach towards intrusion detection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Information security; Machine learning; Data mining; File system; Anomaly detection	CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; SUPPORT; MODELS; CALLS	We present (FIDS)-D-2 a file system, host based anomaly detection system that monitors Basic Security Module (BSM) audit records and determines whether a web server has been compromised by comparing monitored activity generated from the web server to a normal usage profile. Additionally, we propose a set of features extracted from file system specific BSM audit records, as well as an IDS that identifies attacks based on a decision engine that employs one-class classification using a moving window on incoming data. We have used two different machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and our evaluation is performed on real-world datasets collected from three web servers and a honeynet. Results are very promising, since FI2DS detection rates range between 91% and 95.9% with corresponding false positive rates ranging between 8.1 x 10(-2) % and 9.3 x 10(-4) %. Comparison of (FIDS)-D-2 to another state-of-the-art filesystem-based IDS, FWRAP, indicates higher effectiveness of the proposed IDS in all three datasets. Within the context of this paper FI2DS is evaluated for the web daemon user; nevertheless, it can be directly extended to model any daemon-user for both intrusion detection and postmortem analysis.

Automatic offloading of mobile applications into the cloud by means of genetic programming	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Mobile computing; Cloud computing; Genetic programming; Data mining		The limited battery life of modern mobile devices is one of the key problems limiting their use. Even if the offloading of computation onto cloud computing platforms can considerably extend battery duration, it is really hard not only to evaluate the cases where offloading guarantees real advantages on the basis of the requirements of the application in terms of data transfer, computing power needed, etc., but also to evaluate whether user requirements (i.e. the costs of using the cloud services, a determined QoS required, etc.) are satisfied. To this aim, this paper presents a framework for generating models to make automatic decisions on the offloading of mobile applications using a genetic programming (GP) approach. The GP system is designed using a taxonomy of the properties useful to the offloading process concerning the user, the network, the data and the application. The fitness function adopted permits different weights to be given to the four categories considered during the process of building the model. Experimental results, conducted on data sets representing different categories of mobile applications, permit the analysis of the behavior of our algorithm in different applicative contexts. Finally, a comparison with the state of the art of the classification algorithm establishes the goodness of the approach in modeling the offloading process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tang, J; Liu, H				Tang, Jiliang; Liu, Huan			An Unsupervised Feature Selection Framework for Social Media Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Unsupervised feature selection; linked data; social media; pseudo labels; social dimension regularization	CLASSIFICATION; MODELS	The explosive usage of social media produces massive amount of unlabeled and high-dimensional data. Feature selection has been proven to be effective in dealing with high-dimensional data for efficient learning and data mining. Unsupervised feature selection remains a challenging task due to the absence of label information based on which feature relevance is often assessed. The unique characteristics of social media data further complicate the already challenging problem of unsupervised feature selection, e. g., social media data is inherently linked, which makes invalid the independent and identically distributed assumption, bringing about new challenges to unsupervised feature selection algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of feature selection for social media data in an unsupervised scenario. In particular, we analyze the differences between social media data and traditional attribute-value data, investigate how the relations extracted from linked data can be exploited to help select relevant features, and propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework, LUFS, for linked social media data. We systematically design and conduct systemic experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on data sets from real-world social media websites. The empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of our proposed framework.

While a bulk of research has focused on mining evolutionary patterns of homogeneous networks (e.g., networks of friends), however, most real-world networks are heterogeneous, containing objects of different types, such as authors, papers, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multityped objects can capture richer information than that on single-typed objects alone. For example, studying co-evolution of authors, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper, we study mining co-evolution of multityped objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks, called star networks, and examine how the multityped objects influence each other in the network evolution. A hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model-based evolution model is proposed, which detects the co-evolution of multityped objects in the form of multityped cluster evolution in dynamic star networks. An efficient inference algorithm is provided to learn the proposed model. Experiments on several real networks (DBLP, Twitter, and Delicious) validate the effectiveness of the model and the scalability of the algorithm.

In the particular case of hierarchically organized items and generalized association rules connecting them, a measure that dealt appropriately with the hierarchy would be advantageous. Here we present the further developments of a new class of such hierarchical interestingness measures and compare them with a large set of conventional measures and with three hierarchical pruning methods from the literature. The aim is to find interesting pairwise generalized association rules connecting the concepts of multiple ontologies. Interested in the broad empirical evaluation of interestingness measures, we compared the rules obtained by 37 methods on four real world data sets against predefined ground truth sets of associations. To this end, we adopted a framework of instance-based ontology matching and extended the set of performance measures by two novel measures: relation learning recall and precision which take into account hierarchical relationships.

J	Fulcher, BD; Jones, NS				Fulcher, Ben D.; Jones, Nick S.			Highly Comparative Feature-Based Time-Series Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Time-series analysis; classification; data mining	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATION; SELECTION	A highly comparative, feature-based approach to time series classification is introduced that uses an extensive database of algorithms to extract thousands of interpretable features from time series. These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large data sets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the data sets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the data set, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.

In the ATO system, manufacturers keep inventory at the component and module level, and postpone product differentiation until the final stage of production. However, most research on modularity assumes that modules are already known in advance. In fact, in the ATO system, the determination of which components should be pre-assembled as modules mainly depends on the types and volumes of products ordered by customers. That is, module composition and volume should be derived dynamically from the product database based on updated customer orders. To bridge this gap, a two-stage cost-based module mining method for the assemble-to-order strategy is proposed. The first stage determines which sets of components can be formed (pre-assembled) as modules based on a list of customer orders. In the second stage, a cost-based selection approach is developed to evaluate the total cost of each module implementation project generated from the set of feasible modules. The module implementation project with the lowest cost is thus found and suggested to production managers.

Pipeline for illumination correction of images for high-throughput microscopy	JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY			English	Article						Fluorescence microscopy; high-throughput microscopy; illumination correction; shading correction; vignetting	SHADING CORRECTION; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; SCREENS; CELLS; LIGHT	The presence of systematic noise in images in high-throughput microscopy experiments can significantly impact the accuracy of downstream results. Among the most common sources of systematic noise is non-homogeneous illumination across the image field. This often adds an unacceptable level of noise, obscures true quantitative differences and precludes biological experiments that rely on accurate fluorescence intensity measurements. In this paper, we seek to quantify the improvement in the quality of high-content screen readouts due to software-based illumination correction. We present a straightforward illumination correction pipeline that has been used by our group across many experiments. We test the pipeline on real-world high-throughput image sets and evaluate the performance of the pipeline at two levels: (a) Z-factor to evaluate the effect of the image correction on a univariate readout, representative of a typical high-content screen, and (b) classification accuracy on phenotypic signatures derived from the images, representative of an experiment involving more complex data mining. We find that applying the proposed post-hoc correction method improves performance in both experiments, even when illumination correction has already been applied using software associated with the instrument. To facilitate the ready application and future development of illumination correction methods, we have made our complete test data sets as well as open-source image analysis pipelines publicly available. This software-based solution has the potential to improve outcomes for a wide-variety of image-based HTS experiments.	[Singh, S.; Bray, M. -A.; Jones, T. R.; Carpenter, A.

J	Van Hecke, B; He, D; Qu, YZ				Van Hecke, Brandon; He, David; Qu, Yongzhi			On the Use of Spectral Averaging of Acoustic Emission Signals for Bearing Fault Diagnostics	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							PERIODIC WAVEFORMS; VIBRATION; GEARBOX; EXTRACTION; SENSORS; SYSTEM	For years, vibration analysis has been the industry standard for bearing fault diagnosis. However, due to the various advantages over vibration based techniques, the quantification of acoustic emission (AE) for bearing health diagnosis has been an area of interest for recent years. Additionally, most AE based methodologies to date utilize data mining technologies. Presented in this paper is a new approach, combining a heterodyne based frequency reduction technique, time synchronous resampling, and spectral averaging to process AE signals and compute condition indicators (CIs) for bearing fault diagnostics. First, the heterodyne based frequency reduction technique allows the AE signal frequency to be down shifted from several MHz to less than 50 kHz, which approaches that of vibration based methodologies. Next, the sampled AE signals are band pass filtered to retain the useful information related to the bearing defects. Last, a trigger signal is utilized to time synchronously resample the AE signals to allow the calculation of a spectral average and the extraction and evaluation of CIs for bearing fault diagnosis. The technique presented in this paper is validated using the AE signals of seeded fault steel bearings on a bearing test rig. Presented is an effective AE based approach validated to diagnose all four fault types: inner race, outer race, ball, and cage. Moreover, the effectiveness of the presented approach is established through the comparison of both AE and vibration data.

EvoMiner: frequent subtree mining in phylogenetic databases	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Pattern discovery; Maximum agreement subtree; Phylogenetics; Evolutionary bioinformatics	MAXIMUM AGREEMENT SUBTREE; PATTERN-GROWTH METHODS; CANDIDATE GENERATION; COMMON ANCESTORS; BINARY-TREES; ALGORITHMS; CONSENSUS; DISCOVERY; INFERENCE; CONGRUENCE	The problem of mining collections of trees to identify common patterns, called frequent subtrees (FSTs), arises often when trying to interpret the results of phylogenetic analysis. FST mining generalizes the well-known maximum agreement subtree problem. Here we present EvoMiner, a new algorithm for mining frequent subtrees in collections of phylogenetic trees. EvoMiner is an Apriori-like levelwise method, which uses a novel phylogeny-specific constant-time candidate generation scheme, an efficient fingerprinting-based technique for downward closure, and a lowest-common-ancestor-based support counting step that requires neither costly subtree operations nor database traversal. Our algorithm achieves speedups of up to 100 times or more over Phylominer, the current state-of-the-art algorithm for mining phylogenetic trees. EvoMiner can also work in depth-first enumeration mode to use less memory at the expense of speed. We demonstrate the utility of FST mining as a way to extract meaningful phylogenetic information from collections of trees when compared to maximum agreement subtrees and majority-rule trees-two commonly used approaches in phylogenetic analysis for extracting consensus information from a collection of trees over a common leaf set.

Its advantage over existing general methods is that all subsets of input features are perturbed, so interactions and redundancies between features are taken into account. Furthermore, when explaining an additive model, the method is equivalent to commonly used additive model-specific methods. We illustrate the method's usefulness with examples from artificial and real-world data sets and an empirical analysis of running times. Results from a controlled experiment with 122 participants suggest that the method's explanations improved the participants' understanding of the model.

Electronic health records are richer than older data sources (such as spontaneous report records) and thus are ideal for ADR mining. However, current data mining methods, such as disproportionality ratios and temporal itemset mining, ignore certain important aspects of the longitudinal data in patient records. In this paper, we highlight two specific problems with current methods, which we name temporal and contextual sensitivity, and discuss why these two properties are vital to mining patterns from longitudinal data. We also propose two sensitive longitudinal rate comparison measures, which utilize condition occurrence rates and length of drug eras, for mining ADRs from this type of data. These novel methods are then used to rank potential ADRs, along with existing state-of-the-art methods, under many simulated yet realistic datasets. In 48 out of 60 experiments, the proposed longitudinal rate comparison methods significantly outperform other methods in mining known ADRs from other drug / condition pairs.

This review compares the reliability and efficiency of the culture-dependent screening methods currently used for the isolation of ligninolytic prokaryotes. Isolated prokaryotes exhibiting lignin-degrading potential are presented according to their phylogenetic groups. With the development of bioinformatics, culture-independent techniques are emerging that allow larger-scale data mining for ligninolytic prokaryotic functions but today, these techniques still have some limits. In this work, two phylogenetic affiliations of isolated prokaryotes exhibiting ligninolytic potential and laccase-encoding prokaryotes were determined on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences, providing a comparative view of results obtained by the two types of screening techniques. The combination of laboratory culture and bioinformatics approaches is a promising way to explore lignin-degrading prokaryotes.

In this study, we characterise the gene, protein and pattern of expression of a related protein called secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein-proline-glutamine-rich 1 (SCPPPQ1). The Scpppq1 gene resides within the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (Scpp) cluster. SCPPPQ1 is a highly conserved, 75-residue, secreted protein rich in proline, leucine, glutamine and phenylalanine. In silico data mining has revealed no correlation to any known sequences. Northern blotting of various rat tissues suggests that the expression of Scpppq1 is restricted to tooth and associated tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses show that the protein is expressed during the late maturation stage of amelogenesis and in the junctional epithelium where it localises to an atypical basal lamina at the cell-tooth interface. This discrete localisation suggests that SCPPPQ1, together with AMTN and ODAM, participates in structuring the basal lamina and in mediating attachment of epithelia cells to mineralised tooth surfaces.

The aggregated data collection from distributed environment for feature selection makes the problem of accessing the relevant inputs of individual data records. Preserving the privacy of individual data is often critical issue in distributed data mining. In this paper, it proposes the privacy preservation of individual data for both feature and sub-feature selection based on data mining techniques and fuzzy probabilities. For privacy purpose, each party maintains their privacy as the instruction of data miner with the help of fuzzy probabilities as alias values. The techniques have developed for own database of data miner in distributed network with fuzzy system and also evaluation of sub-feature value included for the processing of data mining task. The feature selection has been explained by existing data mining techniques i.e., gain ratio using fuzzy optimization. The estimation of gain ratio based on the relevant inputs for the feature selection has been evaluated within the expected upper and lower bound of fuzzy data set. It mainly focuses on sub-feature selection with privacy algorithm using fuzzy random variables among different parties in distributed environment. The sub-feature selection is uniquely identified for better class prediction. The algorithm provides the idea of selecting sub-feature using fuzzy probabilities with fuzzy frequency data from data miner's database. The experimental result shows performance of our findings based on real world data set.

Even so, the issue still deserves investigation because of the continued introduction of novel storage devices such as solid-state drives (SSDs), which have different characteristics from traditional hard disks. We propose novel IO workload characterization and classification schemes, aiming at addressing three major issues: (i) deciding right mining algorithms for IO traffic analysis, (ii) determining a feature set to properly characterize IO workloads, and (iii) defining essential IO traffic classes state-of-the-art storage devices can exploit in their internal management. The proposed characterization scheme extracts basic attributes that can effectively represent the characteristics of IO workloads and, based on the attributes, finds representative access patterns in general workloads using various clustering algorithms. The proposed classification scheme finds a small number of representative patterns of a given workload that can be exploited for optimization either in the storage stack of the operating system or inside the storage device.

This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group. We evaluate and demonstrate the new approach with case studies of U.S. migration data and experiments with synthetic data.

Given a set of street-level images and (location, city-attribute-value) pairs of measurements, we first identify visual elements in the images that are discriminative of the attribute. We then train a predictor by learning a set of weights over these elements using non-linear Support Vector Regression. To perform these operations efficiently, we implement a scalable distributed processing framework that speeds up the main computational bottleneck (extracting visual elements) by an order of magnitude. This speedup allows us to investigate a variety of city attributes across 6 different American cities. We find that indeed there is a predictive relationship between visual elements and a number of city attributes including violent crime rates, theft rates. housing prices, population density, tree presence. graffiti presence, and the perception of danger. We also test human performance for predicting theft based on street-level images and show that our predictor outperforms this baseline with 33% higher accuracy on average. Finally, we present three prototype applications that use our system to (1) define the visual boundary of city neighborhoods, (2) generate walking directions that avoid or seek out exposure to city attributes, and (3) validate user-specified visual elements for prediction.

Identifying Splicing Regulatory Elements with de Bruijn Graphs	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						combinatorics; sequences; literature data mining; probability; machine learning; graphs and networks; algorithms; computational molecular biology	PRE-MESSENGER-RNA; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; HUMAN GENES; IDENTIFICATION; ENHANCERS; MOTIFS; DEFINITION; SITES; CODE; DISCOVERY	Splicing regulatory elements (SREs) are short, degenerate sequences on pre-mRNA molecules that enhance or inhibit the splicing process via the binding of splicing factors, proteins that regulate the functioning of the spliceosome. Existing methods for identifying SREs in a genome are either experimental or computational. Here, we propose a formalism based on de Bruijn graphs that combines genomic structure, word count enrichment analysis, and experimental evidence to identify SREs found in exons. In our approach, SREs are not restricted to a fixed length (i.e., k-mers, for a fixed k). As a result, we identify 2001 putative exonic enhancers and 3080 putative exonic silencers for human genes, with lengths varying from 6 to 15 nucleotides. Many of the predicted SREs overlap with experimentally verified binding sites. Our model provides a novel method to predict variable length putative regulatory elements computationally for further experimental investigation.

The recent advent of passive data collection technologies, e.g.,automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL), has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. However, most AFC and AVL systems are not designed for transit performance measures, implying that additional data processing and visualization procedures are needed to improve both data usability and accessibility. This study attempts to develop a data-driven platform for online transit performance monitoring. The primary data sources come from the AFC and AVL systems in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded. The individual transit rider's origin and destination can be estimated by utilizing a series of data-mining techniques, which are then incorporated into a regional-map platform for transit performance measures. A multilevel framework is proposed to calculate the network-level speed, route-level travel time reliability, stop-level ridership, and headway variance. These statistics are interactively displayed on a map through a simplified transit GIS data model. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science initiative for data-driven transportation research and applications.

CHAID as a multivariate method has an automatic classification capacity to analyze large numbers of landslide conditioning factors. Moreover, it results two or more nodes for each independent variable, where every node contains numbers of presence or absence of landslides (dependent variable). Other DT methods such as Quick, Unbiased, Efficient Statistic Tree (QUEST) and Classification and Regression Trees (CRT) are not able to produce multi branches based tree. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to use CHAID method to perform the best classification fit for each conditioning factors, then, combined it with logistic regression (LR) to find the corresponding coefficients of best fitting function that assess the optimal terminal nodes. In the first step, a landslide inventory map with 296 landslide locations were extracted from various sources over the Pohang-Kyeong Joo catchment (South Korea). Then, the inventory was randomly split into two datasets, 70% was used for training the models, and the remaining 30% was used for validation purpose. Thirteen landslide conditioning factors were used for the susceptibility modeling. Then, CHAID was applied and revealed that some conditioning factors such as altitude, soil drain, soil texture and TWI, as terminal nodes and reflected the best classification fit. Then, a proposed ensemble technique was applied and the interpretations of the coefficients showed that the relationship between the decision tree branch nodes distance from drain, soil drain, and TWI, respectively, leads to better consequences assessment of landslides in the current study area. The validation results showed that both success and prediction rates, 75 and 79%, respectively. This study proved the efficiency and reliability of ensemble DT and LR model in landslide susceptibility mapping.

Forecasting hurricane-induced power outage durations	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Data mining; Hurricanes; Power outages; Random forests; Power restoration	DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; PREDICTION; STORMS	Accurate estimates of the duration of power outages caused by hurricanes prior to landfall are valuable for utility companies and government agencies that wish to plan and optimize their restoration efforts. Accurate pre-storm estimates are also important information for customers and operators of other infrastructures systems, who rely heavily on electricity. Traditionally, utilities make restoration plans based on managerial judgment and experience. However, skillful outage forecast models are conducive to improved decision-making practices by utilities and can greatly enhance storm preparation and restoration management procedures of power companies and emergency managers. This paper presents a novel statistical approach for estimating power outage durations that is 87 % more accurate than existing models in the literature. The power outage duration models are developed and carefully validated for outages caused by Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Ivan in a central Gulf Coast state. This paper identifies the key variables in predicting hurricane-induced outage durations and their degree of influence on predicting outage restoration for the utility company service area used as our case study.

J	Chen, CH; Li, AF; Lee, YC				Chen, Chun-Hao; Li, Ai-Fang; Lee, Yeong-Chyi			Actionable high-coherent-utility fuzzy itemset mining	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy set; Utility fuzzy itemsets; High-coherent-utility fuzzy itemset; Membership function; Domain-driven data mining	MULTIPLE MINIMUM SUPPORTS; ASSOCIATION RULES; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK	Many fuzzy data mining approaches have been proposed for finding fuzzy association rules with the predefined minimum support from quantitative transaction databases. Since each item has its own utility, utility itemset mining has become increasingly important. However, common problems with existing approaches are that an appropriate minimum support is difficult to determine and that the derived rules usually expose common-sense knowledge, which may not be interesting from a business point of view. This study thus proposes an algorithm for mining high-coherent-utility fuzzy itemsets to overcome problems with the properties of propositional logic. Quantitative transactions are first transformed into fuzzy sets. Then, the utility of each fuzzy itemset is calculated according to the given external utility table. If the value is larger than or equal to the minimum utility ratio, the itemset is considered as a high-utility fuzzy itemset. Finally, contingency tables are calculated and used for checking-whether a high-utility fuzzy itemset satisfies four criteria. If so, it is a high-coherent-utility fuzzy itemset. Experiments on the foodmart and simulated datasets are made to show that the derived itemsets by the proposed algorithm not only can reach better profit than selling them separately, but also can provide fewer but more useful utility itemsets for decision-makers.

In the hypersonic vehicle, the airframe and the engine are highly integrated. In the current survey, the research progress in the MDO approach has been reviewed comprehensively from four primary techniques, namely the design of experiments, the surrogate modeling, the optimization method and the MDO framework, and its application to the aerospace engineering has been summarized from its category as well. The concurrent subspace optimization approach is the most popular method in the aerospace engineering for its easy implementation, and following is the collaborative optimization approach. The multi-level optimization approach has attracted a growing attention due to its high efficiency. In conclusion, some promising research recommendations have been put forward, namely the combination of the low- and high-fidelity optimization approaches, the consideration of the uncertainty analysis and the MDO approach coupled with the data mining techniques.

Financial institutions are motivated by the need to meet increased regulatory requirements for risk measurement and capital reserves. This paper describes and demonstrates a model to support risk management of accounts receivable. We present a decision support model for a large bank enabling assessment of risk of default on the part of loan recipients. A credit scoring model is presented to assess account creditworthiness. Alternative methods of risk measurement for fault detection are compared, and a logistic regression model selected to analyze accounts receivable risk.

Recent data have revealed that toll-like receptors and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLRs) function to maintain homeostasis between the host microbiome and mucosal immunity. The NLR proteins are a diverse class of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors. In humans, only about half of the identified NLRs have been adequately characterized. The majority of well-characterized NLRs participate in the formation of a multiprotein complex, termed the inflammasome, which is responsible for the maturation of interleukin-1 and interleukin-18. However, recent observations have also uncovered the presence of a novel subgroup of NLRs that function as positive or negative regulators of inflammation through modulating critical signaling pathways, including NF-B. Dysregulation of specific NLRs from both proinflammatory and inhibitory subgroups have been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in genetically susceptible human populations. Our own preliminary retrospective data mining efforts have identified a diverse range of NLRs that are significantly altered at the messenger RNA level in colons from patients with IBD. Likewise, studies using genetically modified mouse strains have revealed that multiple NLR family members have the potential to dramatically modulate the immune response during IBD. Targeting NLR signaling represents a promising and novel therapeutic strategy. However, significant effort is necessary to translate the current understanding of NLR biology into effective therapies.

A taxonomy to guide research on the application of data mining to fraud detection in financial statement audits	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Auditing; Fraud; Data mining	MANAGEMENT; RISK; FRAMEWORK	This paper explores the application of data mining techniques to fraud detection in the audit of financial statements and proposes a taxonomy to support and guide future research. Currently, the application of data mining to auditing is at an early stage of development and researchers take a scatter-shot approach, investigating patterns in financial statement disclosures, text in annual reports and MD&As, and the nature of journal entries without appropriate guidance being drawn from lessons in known fraud patterns. To develop structure to research in data mining, we create a taxonomy that combines research on patterns of observed fraud schemes with an appreciation of areas that benefit from productive application of data mining.

The problem with current methods to detect human behaviour changes is the use of supervised techniques that require human intervention. This work proposes an automatic data mining method based on physical activity measurements. Abnormal human behaviour is detected as an increase or decrease of the physical activity according to the historical data. Human behaviour is evaluated in real time grading its abnormality.

Hence, OSNs are also an important-and popular-subject for research. To perform research based on real-life evidence, however, researchers may need to access OSN data, such as texts and files uploaded by users and connections among users. This raises significant ethical problems. Currently, there are no clear ethical guidelines, and researchers may end up (unintentionally) performing ethically questionable research, sometimes even when more ethical research alternatives exist. For example, several studies have employed "fake identities" to collect data from OSNs, but fake identities may be used for attacks and are considered a security issue. Is it legitimate to use fake identities for studying OSNs or for collecting OSN data for research? We present a taxonomy of the ethical challenges facing researchers of OSNs and compare different approaches. We demonstrate how ethical considerations have been taken into account in previous studies that used fake identities. In addition, several possible approaches are offered to reduce or avoid ethical misconducts. We hope this work will stimulate the development and use of ethical practices and methods in the research of online social networks.

Although existing algorithms mining frequent patterns from the data are useful for persistent databases, they have some limitations of data mining from dynamic data arising from the continuous, unbounded and high speed characteristics of data streams. To identify useful frequent patterns in data streams, this paper proposes a frequent pattern network and a new method for discovering frequent patterns through the approximation of frequency counting on the network. The frequent pattern network, whose vertices and edges represent summarized information of transaction data, provides a user-centered environment based on the process of continuously mining frequent patterns because the proposed network is a small and compact data structure, and flexible for minimum support value. The experimental results show that proposed method is more efficient than FP-growth and Apriori methods, and the discussion of memory usage demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method.

Radiology Reporting: A Closed-Loop Cycle from Order Entry to Results Communication	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Reporting; speech recognition; computerized physician order entry (CPOE); decision support; results communication; data mining	RECOGNITION	With the increasing prevalence of PACS over the past decade, face-to-face image review among health care providers has become a rarity. This change has resulted in increasing dependence on fast and accurate communication in radiology. Turnaround time expectations are now conveyed in minutes rather than hours or even days. Ideal modern radiology communication is a closed-loop cycle with multiple interoperable applications contributing to the final product. The cycle starts with physician order entry, now often performed through the electronic medical record, with clinical decision support to ensure that the most effective imaging study is ordered. Radiology reports are now almost all in electronic format. The majority are produced using speech recognition systems. Optimization of this software use can alleviate some, if not all, of the inherent user inefficiencies in this type of reporting. Integrated third-party software applications that provide data mining capability are extremely helpful in both academic and clinical settings. The closed-loop ends with automated communication of imaging results. Software products for this purpose should facilitate use of levels of alert, automated escalation to providers, and recording of audit trails of reports received. The multiple components of reporting should be completely interoperable with each other, as well as with the PACS, the RIS, and the electronic medical record. This integration will maximize radiologist efficiency and minimize the possibility of communication error.

One example is BioAssay Ontology (BAO) for systematic classification of assays based on screening setup and metadata annotations. In this article we report a high-throughput screening (HTS) against phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide translocase (MraY), an attractive antibacterial drug target involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. The screen resulted in novel chemistry identification using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. To address a subset of the false positive hits, a frequent hitter analysis was performed using an approach in which MraY hits were compared with hits from similar assays, previously used for HTS. The MraY assay was annotated according to BAO and three internal reference assays, using a similar assay design and detection technology, were identified. Analyzing the assays retrospectively, it was clear that both MraY and the three reference assays all showed a high false positive rate in the primary HTS assays. In the case of MraY, false positives were efficiently identified by applying a method to correct for compound interference at the hit-confirmation stage. Frequent hitter analysis based on the three reference assays with similar assay method identified additional false actives in the primary MraY assay as frequent hitters. This article demonstrates how assays annotated using BAO terms can be used to identify closely related reference assays, and that analysis based on these assays clearly can provide useful data to influence assay design, technology, and screening strategy.

Modeling significant factors affecting commuters' perspectives and propensity to use the new proposed metro service in Doha	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						public transit; commuters' willingness to use public transit; commuters' satisfaction; service quality; travel mode choice		The Qatari government introduced a major public transport project titled the Doha Metro system to address the fast growing transportation demands in Qatar's urban areas and to be ready for the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup. To benefit from this new metro system in reducing traffic congestion problems in Doha, it must be attractive with a reasonable level of service to attract large numbers of car users to switch to the new metro. This goal can be achieved by a better understanding of the user's needs and expectations in Qatar. This paper aims to identify and quantify the significant factors affecting commuters' perspectives, preferences and tendencies to use this new metro network for their daily trips in the future. The data used for the analysis was obtained from a self-reported questionnaire survey carried out among a sample of commuters living in Doha. Different data mining techniques were employed including conditional distributions and two-way analysis. In addition, logistic regression and structural equation modeling approaches were developed. The results revealed that the location of metro stations, the metro station's features, the metro's features, gender, the number of daily trips, the purpose of trips, and the average duration of trips in Doha were the significant factors that affected commuters' willingness and tendency to use the new metro system. The results of this study provide authorities and decision makers in Doha with valuable insights that should be taken into consideration prior to implementing the new metro service to ensure its success.

N-cadherin prevents the premature differentiation of anterior heart field progenitors in the pharyngeal mesodermal microenvironment	CELL RESEARCH			English	Article						N-cadherin; anterior heart field; cardiac progenitor cells; premature differentiation; Wnt signaling; microenvironment	BETA-CATENIN; STEM-CELLS; CARDIOVASCULAR PROGENITORS; CARDIAC PROGENITORS; OUTFLOW TRACT; ARTERIAL POLE; 2ND HEART; PATHWAY; MUSCLE; EXPRESSION	The cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the anterior heart field (AHF) are located in the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM), where they expand, migrate and eventually differentiate into major cell types found in the heart, including cardiomyocytes. The mechanisms by which these progenitors are able to expand within the PM microenvironment without premature differentiation remain largely unknown. Through in silico data mining, genetic loss-of-function studies, and in vivo genetic rescue studies, we identified N-cadherin and interaction with canonical Wnt signals as a critical component of the microenvironment that facilitates the expansion of AHF-CPCs in the PM. CPCs in N-cadherin mutant embryos were observed to be less proliferative and undergo premature differentiation in the PM. Notably, the phenotype of N-cadherin deficiency could be partially rescued by activating Wnt signaling, suggesting a delicate functional interaction between the adhesion role of N-cadherin and Wnt signaling in the early PM microenvironment. This study suggests a new mechanism for the early renewal of AHF progenitors where N-cadherin provides additional adhesion for progenitor cells in the PM, thereby allowing Wnt paracrine signals to expand the cells without premature differentiation.

J	Cai, YX; Wang, X; Hu, KZ; Dong, MZ				Cai, Yongxiang; Wang, Xin; Hu, Kezhen; Dong, Mingzhe			A data mining approach to finding relationships between reservoir properties and oil production for CHOPS	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Reservoir property; Production performance; Fuzzy curve ranking; Association rule mining	HEAVY OIL; ASSOCIATION RULE; COLD PRODUCTION; FUZZY CURVES; IDENTIFICATION; SURFACES; MODEL	Cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) is a primary oil extraction process for heavy crude oil and reservoir properties are key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of CHOPS. However, identification of the key reservoir properties and quantification of the relationships between the reservoir properties and the oil production are still challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of a data mining approach for finding quantitative relationships between various reservoir properties and oil production for CHOPS. The approach includes four steps: firstly, a set of reservoir properties are identified to describe reservoir characteristics through a petrophysical analysis. In addition to common parameters, such as porosity and permeability, two new parameters - a fluid mobility factor and the maximum inscribed rectangular of net pay (MIRNP) - are proposed. Secondly, three new parameters to describe the production performance of wells are proposed: the peak value, effective life cycle and effective yield. Next, the fuzzy ranking method is used to rank the importance of the identified reservoir properties in terms of oil production. Finally, association rule mining is used to obtain quantitative relationships between reservoir property variables and the production performance of wells. The proposed methods have been applied for 118 wells in the Sparky Formation of the Lloydminster heavy oil field in Alberta. The result shows that the production performance of wells in the area could be described and predicted by using the found quantitative relations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This contribution reports a complementary approach that can be applied to paleoenvironmental research. The choice to use a machine learning method, here regression trees (RT), relied in the ability to learn complex patterns, integrating multiple types of data with different statistical distributions to obtain a knowledge model of geochemical behavior along a paleo-platform. The Late Jurassic epioceanic deposits under scope are represented by six stratigraphic sections located in SE Spain and on the Majorca Island. The used database comprises a total of 1960 data points corresponding to eight variables (stable C and O isotopes, the elements Ca, Mg, Sr, Fe, Mn and skeletal content). This study uses RT models in which the predictive variables are the geochemical proxies, whilst skeletal content is used as a target variable. The resulting model is data driven, explaining variations in the target variable and providing additional information on the relative importance of each variable to each prediction, as well as its corresponding threshold values. The obtained RT revealed a structured distribution of samples, organized either by stratigraphic section or sets of nearby sections. Averaged estimated skeletal abundance confirmed the initial observations of higher skeletal content for the most distal sections with estimated values from 18% to 27%. In contrast, lower skeletal abundance from 5% to 15% is proposed for the remaining sections. The geochemical variable that best discriminates this major trend is delta O-18, at a threshold value of -0.2 parts per thousand, interpreted as evidence for separation of water-mass properties across the studied areas.

AromaDeg, a novel database for phylogenomics of aerobic bacterial degradation of aromatics	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DIOXYGENASE GENE; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; SPHINGOMONAS-PAUCIMOBILIS; EXTRADIOL DIOXYGENASES; PROTEIN FAMILIES; EVOLUTION; BIODEGRADATION; PATHWAY	Understanding prokaryotic transformation of recalcitrant pollutants and the in-situ metabolic nets require the integration of massive amounts of biological data. Decades of biochemical studies together with novel next-generation sequencing data have exponentially increased information on aerobic aromatic degradation pathways. However, the majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of key catabolic protein families and of proteins of documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given protein family of AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization of individual protein superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses the deficiencies of homology-based protein function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways. We pursue in future the expansion of AromaDeg to other enzyme families involved in aromatic degradation and its regular update.

This is a result of the continuing development of storage technology, including increased storage capacity in consumer devices and cloud storage services, and an increase in the number of devices seized per case. Consequently, this has led to increasing backlogs of evidence awaiting analysis, often many months to years, affecting even the largest digital forensic laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power, distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods to address the digital forensic data volume challenge.

This algorithm, called comprehensible grammar-based algorithm for subgroup discovery (CGBA-SD), combines the requirements of discovering comprehensible rules with the ability to mine expressive and flexible solutions owing to the use of a context-free grammar. Each rule is represented as a derivation tree that shows a solution described using the language denoted by the grammar. The algorithm includes mechanisms to adapt the diversity of the population by self-adapting the probabilities of recombination and mutation. We compare the approach with existing evolutionary and classic subgroup discovery algorithms. CGBA-SD appears to be a very promising algorithm that discovers comprehensible subgroups and behaves better than other algorithms as measures by complexity, interest, and precision indicate. The results obtained were validated by means of a series of nonparametric tests.

During a 5 year period (2006-2010) in Iran, an average of 3.4 pillion passengers are killed daily due to motorcycle crashes. This study investigated the main factors influencing crash severity of this group of road users. Method: The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method was employed to analyze the injury severity of pillion passengers in Iran over a 4 year period (2009-2012). Results: The predictive accuracy of the model built with a total of 16 variables was 74%, which showed a considerable improvement compared to previous studies. The results indicate that area type, land use, and injured part of the body (head, neck, etc.) are the most influential factors affecting the fatality of motorcycle passengers. Results also show that helmet usage could reduce the fatality risk among motorcycle passengers by 28%. Practical Applications: The findings of this study might help develop more targeted countermeasures to reduce the death rate of motorcycle pillion passengers.

Based on an information diffusion model (IDM) improved by a genetic algorithm, a new algorithm (GIDM) is established for interpolating and forecasting monthly discharge time series; the input variables are the rainfall and runoff values observed during the previous time period. The genetic operators are carefully designed to avoid premature convergence and local optima problems while searching for the optimal window width (a parameter of the IDM). In combination with fuzzy inference, the effectiveness of the GIDM is validated using long-term observations. Conventional IDMs are also included for comparison. On the Yellow River or Yangtze River, twelve gauging stations are discussed, and the results show that the new method can simulate the observations more accurately than traditional IDMs, using only 50% or 33.33% of the total data for training. The low density of observations and the difficulties in information extraction are key problems for hydrometeorological research. Therefore, the GIDM may be a valuable tool for improving water management and providing the acceptable input data for hydrological models when available measurements are insufficient.

Because of the almost infinite number of drug-like organic molecules, bench-based experimental chemogenomics methods are not generally feasible. Several in silico chemogenomics models have therefore been developed for high-throughput screening of large numbers of drug candidate compounds and target proteins. In previous studies, we described two novel bi-modal PLS approaches. These methods provide a significant advantage in that they enable direct connections to be made between biological activities and ligand and protein descriptors. In this special issue, we review these two PLS-based approaches using two different chemogenomics datasets for illustration. We then compare the predictive and interpretive performance of the two methods using the same congeneric data set.

This novel data source contains valuable information (e.g., geo-location, time and date, type of places) on human activities. While the data is tremendously beneficial in modeling human activity patterns, it is also greatly useful in inferring planning related variables such as a city's land use characteristics. This paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the possibility and validity of utilizing large-scale social media check-in data to infer land use types by applying the state-of-art data mining techniques. Two inference approaches are proposed and tested in this paper: the unsupervised clustering method and supervised learning method. The land use inference is conducted in a uniform grid level of 200 by 200 m. The methods are applied to a case study of New York City. The validation result confirms that the two approaches effectively infer different land use types given sufficient check-in data. The encouraging result demonstrates the potential of using social media check-in data in urban land use inference, and also reveals the hidden linkage between the human activity pattern and the underlying urban land use pattern.

This is the result of elevated metabolic rates in the highly proliferative cancer cells, in conjunction with often greatly increased rates of net cellular acid extrusion. Studies in various cancers have suggested that while the acid extrusion mechanisms employed are generally the same as those in healthy cells, the specific transporters upregulated vary with the cancer type. The main such transporters include Na+/H+ exchangers, various HCO3- transporters, H+ pumps, and lactate-H+ cotransporters. The mechanisms leading to their dysregulation in cancer are incompletely understood but include changes in transporter expression levels, trafficking and membrane localization, and posttranslational modifications. In turn, accumulating evidence has revealed that in addition to supporting their elevated metabolic rate, their increased acid efflux capacity endows the cancer cells with increased capacity for invasiveness, proliferation, and chemotherapy resistance. The pancreatic duct exhibits an enormous capacity for acid-base transport, rendering pHi dysregulation a potentially very important topic in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC - accounting for about 90% of all pancreatic cancers - has one of the highest cancer mortality rates known, and new diagnostic and treatment options are highly needed. However, very little is known about whether pH regulation is altered in PDAC and, if so, the possible role of this in cancer development. Here, we review current models for pancreatic acid-base transport and pH homeostasis and summarize current views on acid-base dysregulation in cancer, focusing where possible on the few studies to date in PDAC. Finally, we present new data-mining analyses of acid-base transporter expression changes in PDAC and discuss essential directions for future work.

J	D'Oca, S; Hong, TZ				D'Oca, Simona; Hong, Tianzhen			A data-mining approach to discover patterns of window opening and closing behavior in offices	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Data mining; Behavioral pattern; Occupant behavior; Office buildings; Window closing; Window opening	THERMAL COMFORT; NATURAL VENTILATION; OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR; USER BEHAVIOR; ENERGY USE; BUILDINGS; SIMULATION; MODELS; THERMOSTATS; PREDICT	Understanding the relationship between occupant behaviors and building energy consumption is one of the most effective ways to bridge the gap between predicted and actual energy consumption in buildings. However effective methodologies to remove the impact of other variables on building energy consumption and isolate the leverage of the human factor precisely are still poorly investigated. Moreover, the effectiveness of statistical and data mining approaches in finding meaningful correlations in data is largely undiscussed in literature. This study develops a framework combining statistical analysis with two data-mining techniques, cluster analysis and association rules mining, to identify valid window operational patterns in measured data. Analyses are performed on a data set with measured indoor and outdoor physical parameters and human interaction with operable windows in 16 offices. Logistic regression was first used to identify factors influencing window opening and closing behavior. Clustering procedures were employed to obtain distinct behavioral patterns, including motivational, opening duration, interactivity and window position patterns. Finally the clustered patterns constituted a base for association rules segmenting the window opening behaviors into two archetypal office user profiles for which different natural ventilation strategies as well as robust building design recommendations that may be appropriate. Moreover, discerned working user profiles represent more accurate input to building energy modeling programs, to investigate the impacts of typical window opening behavior scenarios on energy use, thermal comfort and productivity in office buildings.

About 30% of patients do not respond to this therapy for unknown reasons. In this study, we aimed at the identification and classification of CRT responder by the use of genetic variants and clinical parameters. Methods and Results-Of 1421 CRT patients, 207 subjects were consecutively selected, and CRT responder and nonresponder were matched for their baseline parameters before CRT. Treatment success of CRT was defined as a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume >15% at follow-up echocardiography compared with left ventricular end-systolic volume at baseline. All other changes classified the patient as CRT nonresponder. A genetic association study was performed, which identified 4 genetic variants to be associated with the CRT responder phenotype at the allelic (P<0.035) and genotypic (P<0.031) level: rs3766031 (ATPIB1), rs5443 (GNB3), rs5522 (NR3C2), and rs7325635 (TNFSF11). Machine learning algorithms were used for the classification of CRT patients into responder and nonresponder status, including combinations of the identified genetic variants and clinical parameters. Conclusions-We demonstrated that rule induction algorithms can successfully be applied for the classification of heart failure patients in CRT responder and nonresponder status using clinical and genetic parameters. Our analysis included information on alleles and genotypes of 4 genetic loci, rs3766031 (ATPIB1), rs5443 (GNB3), rs5522 (NR3C2), and rs7325635 (TNFSF11), pathophysiologically associated with remodeling of the failing ventricle.

Live-cell imaging has revealed a remarkable heterogeneity in CCP assembly kinetics, which can be used as an intrinsic source of mechanistic information on CCP regulation but also poses several major problems for unbiased analysis of CME dynamics. The backbone of unveiling the molecular control of CME is an imaging-based inventory of the full diversity of individual CCP behaviors, which requires detection and tracking of structural fiduciaries and regulatory proteins with an accuracy of >99.9%, despite very low signals. This level of confidence can only be achieved by combining appropriate imaging modalities with self-diagnostic computational algorithms for image analysis and data mining.

However, commercial exploitation of shale gas in China is in the very early stages, in sharp contrast to that in the United States. Patents related to shale gas exploitation are analyzed by using data mining and patent maps. The findings show that shale gas exploitation involves complex technologies that technological accumulation is a long-term process. Despite decades of rapid growth, significant technology gaps still exist for Chinese enterprises and technological factors could be the bottleneck of China's exploitation of its massive shale gas resources. Meanwhile, foreign enterprises have applied for a large number of patents in China. Chinese enterprises might have to obtain licenses from foreign patent holders, which could have important implications for shale gas exploitation in China.

The mechanism of regulation of PRL-3 remains obscure. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a latent transcriptional factor, has also been often found to be activated in AML. We first identified STAT3-consensus-binding sites in the promoter of PRL-3 genes. Then we experimentally validated the direct binding and transcriptional activation. We applied shRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression approaches in STAT3(-/-) liver cells and leukemic cells to validate the functional regulation of PRL-3 by STAT3. A STAT3 core signature, derived through data mining from publicly available gene expression data, was employed to correlate PRL-3 expression in large AML patient samples. We discovered that STAT3 binds to the -201 to -210 region of PRL-3, which was conserved between human and mouse. Importantly, P-3 protein was significantly reduced in mouse STAT3-knockout liver cells compared with STAT3 wild type counterparts, and ectopic expression of STAT3 in these cells led to a pronounced increase in PRL-3 protein. We demonstrated that STAT3 functionally regulated PRL-3, and STAT3 core signature was enriched in AML with high PRL-3 expression. Targeting either STAT3 or PRL-3 reduced leukemic cell viability. Silencing PRL-3 impaired invasiveness and induced leukemic cell differentiation. In conclusion, PRL-3 was transcriptionally regulated by STAT3. The STAT3/PRL-3 regulatory loop contributes to the pathogenesis of AML, and it might represent an attractive therapeutic target for antileukemic therapy.

The conventional distance relaying scheme fails miserably in protecting transmission lines including flexible AC transmission systems controllers such as UPFC and further, the protection issues become more challenging when wind-farm is integrated. The proposed protection scheme extracts features from the instantaneous voltage and current signals from both ends of the transmission line using discrete Fourier transform based pre-processor and computes corresponding differential features. The differential features are used to build the fault classification tree using a data-mining algorithm known as DT. Further, the fuzzy membership functions are drawn using the DT thresholds and the corresponding fuzzy rule-base is developed for final relaying decision. The proposed technique has been extensively tested (in MATLAB environment) for single circuit and double circuit transmission lines including UPFC and wind-farms with wide variations in operating conditions. The test results indicate that the proposed DT-induced fuzzy rule-based relaying scheme is highly reliable and robust for protection of complex transmission line including UPFC and wind-farm.

Numerous efficient algorithms exist that are able to discover various types of patterns in large datasets. Unfortunately, the problem of identifying patterns that are genuinely interesting to a particular user remains challenging. Current approaches generally require considerable data mining expertise or effort from the data analyst, and hence cannot be used by typical domain experts. To address this, we introduce a generic framework for interactive learning of user-specific pattern ranking functions. The user is only asked to rank small sets of patterns, while a ranking function is inferred from this feedback by preference learning techniques. Moreover, we propose a number of active learning heuristics to minimize the effort required from the user, while ensuring that accurate rankings are obtained. We show how the learned ranking functions can be used to mine new, more interesting patterns. We demonstrate two concrete instances of our framework for two different pattern mining tasks, frequent itemset mining and subgroup discovery. We empirically evaluate the capacity of the algorithm to learn pattern rankings by emulating users. Experiments demonstrate that the system is able to learn accurate rankings, and that the active learning heuristics help reduce the required user effort. Furthermore, using the learned ranking functions as search heuristics allows discovering patterns of higher quality than those in the initial set. This shows that machine learning techniques in general, and active preference learning in particular, are promising building blocks for interactive data mining systems.

Understanding and controlling regime switching in molecular diffusion	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Diffusion can be strongly affected by ballistic flights (long jumps) as well as long-lived sticking trajectories (long sticks). Using statistical inference techniques in the spirit of Granger causality, we investigate the appearance of long jumps and sticks in molecular-dynamics simulations of diffusion in a prototype system, a benzene molecule on a graphite substrate. We find that specific fluctuations in certain, but not all, internal degrees of freedom of the molecule can be linked to either long jumps or sticks. Furthermore, by changing the prevalence of these predictors with an outside influence, the diffusion of the molecule can be controlled. The approach presented in this proof of concept study is very generic and can be applied to larger and more complex molecules. Additionally, the predictor variables can be chosen in a general way so as to be accessible in experiments, making the method feasible for control of diffusion in applications. Our results also demonstrate that data-mining techniques can be used to investigate the phase-space structure of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.

Di Cristina'' Children's Hospital of Palermo. Increased rotavirus activity usually occurred from the beginning of winter to mid-spring. G1P[8] rotaviruses were the prevalent strains in most of the years and were only occasionally overcome by G9P[8], G4P[8] or G2P[4]. The circulation of non-G1P[8] strains was discontinuous and fluctuating. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an heterogeneous population of viruses within each genotype, with different lineages and sublineages emerging over the time. Amino acid substitutions in both VP7 and VP8* antigenic epitopes were generally associated with different lineages/sublineages, emerging sequentially and replacing partially or completely the former strains. The present study summarises one of the longest surveillance activities conducted in the European continent, offering a useful temporal observatory of rotavirus epidemiology and strains variation and evolution in a settled population.

Most previous approaches have set a single minimum support threshold for all events to assume they have similar frequencies which is not practical for real-world applications. Instead of setting a single minimum support threshold for all events, Chen et al. proposed an FP-tree-like algorithm to allow multiple minimum supports for reflecting the natures of the events. However, such a tree-based algorithm encountered an efficiency problem while period length is long or event sequential orders in period segments are varied. Under the circumstance, many tree branches are created and much execution time is spent to find partial periodic patterns. In this paper, we thus propose a projection-based algorithm which examines only prefix subsequences and projects only corresponding postfix subsequences with multiple minimum supports to quickly find the partial periodic patterns in a recursive process. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the previous one.

J	Yun, U; Yoon, E				Yun, Unil; Yoon, Eunchul			An Efficient Approach for Mining Weighted Approximate Closed Frequent Patterns Considering Noise Constraints	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; approximate bound; weighted approximate closed pattern mining; noise constraints	MULTIPLE MINIMUM SUPPORTS; DATA STREAMS; SLIDING WINDOW; SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM; TREES	Based on the frequent pattern mining, closed frequent pattern mining and weighted frequent pattern mining have been studied to reduce the search space and discover important patterns. In the previous definition of weighted closed patterns, supports of patterns are only considered to compute the closures of the patterns. It means that the closures of weighted frequent patterns cannot be perfectly checked. Moreover, the usefulness of weighted closed frequent patterns depends on the presence of frequent patterns that have supersets with the exactly same weighted support. However, from the errors such as noise, slight changes in items' supports or weights by them have significantly negative effects on the mining results, which may prevent us from obtaining exact and valid analysis results since the errors can break the original characteristics of items and patterns. In this paper, to solve the above problems, we propose a concept of robust weighted closed frequent pattern mining, and an approximate bound is defined on the basis of the concept, which can relax requirements for precise equality among patterns' weighted supports. Thereafter, we propose a weighted approximate closed frequent pattern mining algorithm which not only considers the two approaches but also suggests fault tolerant pattern mining in the noise constraints. To efficiently mine weighted approximate closed frequent patterns, we suggest pruning and subset checking methods which reduce search space. We also report extensive performance study to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, memory usage, scalability, and quality of patterns in our algorithm.

J	Polese, G				Polese, Giuseppe			A decision support system for Evidence Based Medicine	JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING			English	Article						EBM; Decision Support Systems; Data mining; Data warehousing	VISUAL DATA; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; MINING OUTCOMES; VISUALIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; FRAMEWORK	We present a decision support system to let medical doctors analyze important clinical data, like patients medical history, diagnosis, or therapy, in order to detect common patterns of knowledge useful in the diagnosis process. The underlying approach mainly exploits case-based reasoning (CBR), which is useful to extract knowledge from previously experienced cases. In particular, we used sequence data mining to detect common patterns in patients histories and to highlight the effects of medical practices, based on evidence. We also exploited data warehousing techniques, such OLAP queries to let medical doctor analyze diagnosis along several measures, and recent visual data integration approaches and tools to effectively support the complex task of integrating and reconciling data from different medical data sources. In addition, due to massive presence of textual information within the clinical records of many hospitals, text mining techniques have been devised. In particular, we performed lexical analysis of free text in order to extract discriminatory terms and to derive encoded information. Finally, the system provides user friendly mechanisms to manage the protection of confidential medical data. System validation has been performed, mainly focusing on usability issues, by running experiments based on a large database from a primary public hospital. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prior to the Oral Therapy, What Do We Know About HCV-4 in Egypt: A Randomized Survey of Prevalence and Risks Using Data Mining Computed Analysis	MEDICINE			English	Article							HEPATITIS-C VIRUS; UMBILICAL HERNIA; SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI; TREATMENT RESPONSE; LIVER-CIRRHOSIS; VIRAL CLEARANCE; GENOTYPE 4; INFECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PROGRESSION	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects over 180 million people worldwide and it's the leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is classified into seven major genotypes and a series of subtypes. In general, HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) is common in the Middle East and Africa, where it is responsible for more than 80% of HCV infections. Although HCV-4 is the cause of approximately 20% of the 180 million cases of chronic hepatitis C worldwide, it has not been a major subject of research yet. The aim of the current study is to survey the morbidities and disease complications among Egyptian population infected with HCV-4 using data mining advanced computing methods mainly and other complementary statistical analysis. Six thousand six hundred sixty subjects, aged between 17 and 58 years old, from different Egyptian Governorates were screened for HCV infection by ELISA and qualitative PCR. HCV-positive patients were further investigated for the incidence of liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices. Obtained data were analyzed by data mining approach. Among 6660 subjects enrolled in this survey, 1018 patients (15.28%) were HCV-positive. Proportion of infected-males was significantly higher than females; 61.6% versus 38.4% (P = 0.0052). Around two-third of infected-patients (635/1018; 62.4%) were presented with liver cirrhosis. Additionally, approximately half of the cirrhotic patients (301/635; 47.4%) showed degrees of large esophageal varices (LEVs), with higher variceal grade observed in males. Age for esophageal variceal development was 47 +/- 1. Data mining analysis yielded esophageal wall thickness (>6.5 mm), determined by conventional U/S, as the only independent predictor for esophageal varices. This study emphasizes the high prevalence of HCV infection among Egyptian population, in particular among males. Egyptians with HCV-4 infection are at a higher risk to develop cirrhotic liver and esophageal varices. Data mining, a new analytic technique in medical field, shed light in this study on the clinical importance of esophageal wall thickness as a useful predictor for risky esophageal varices using decision tree algorithm.

A public, open Western Europe database of shoreline undulations based on imagery	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Shoreline undulations; Open data; Western Europe; Geographic feature; Data-mining	ALONGSHORE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; WAVE CLIMATE; SAND WAVES; LAND-USE; LONGSHORE SANDWAVES; POSITIONAL ACCURACY; GOOGLE EARTH; LONG POINT; LAKE-ERIE; BEACH	Beaches around the world frequently exhibit a wide variety of shoreline morphological features of different dimensions, and increasing attention has been focused on shoreline undulations in recent years. Shoreline undulations (SUs) are medium to large spatial-scale features with longshore dimensions ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters and cross-shore widths ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. This work presents a public, open database with a total of 294 sites showing SUs identified using Google Earth Imagery along 50,000 km of Western European and Northwestern African coasts. Insights from regional, geometrical and hydrodynamic analyses are also presented to explore the potential of using the methodology for geographic studies occupying large extensions. The database contains information on 17 fields and is shared in a suitable and open format. Denmark exhibits the most features, followed by Spain and Italy. SUs ranging from 50 to 100 m in length and below 25 m in width are predominant, whereas SUs larger than 1000 m in length and 50 m in width are of minor importance. A total of 223 (76%) sites exhibit a series of one, two or three individual undulations, whereas the rest show more than three. The existence of SUs greatly depends on the tidal range, with lower (higher) tidal ranges indicating a higher (lower) number of undulations. A detailed analysis for the Spanish case was performed focusing on the relation between the presence of SUs and climate variables. The results show that SUs are more frequent where the wave energy is lower and the wave periods are shorter. An additional data mining analysis with association rules was conducted to corroborate the relationships between variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data. We extend the current state-of-the-art method for recommendations based on matrix factorization under a normal distribution assumption by allowing for different distributions which are more suitable to model this kind of data. In particular, we use the Poisson, the inverse Gaussian and the gamma distribution as extensions. The experimental evaluation with three realworld data sets shows the improved performance of our approach and we demonstrate the merit of using various distributions depending on the respective data set.

In view of the bottleneck of Apriori algorithm, two new algorithms are proposed in this paper. The first is AprioriN algorithm based on arrays, which converts the operation on database to the operation on memory via coding. The second is a high performance association rule mining algorithm based on FP-tree, which accelerates the speed of traverse itemsets by adding an extra data structure. During the second scan of the database, a matrix is generated to save frequent 2-itemsets when the basic FP-tree is created. This paper attempts the improved algorithms to improve the efficiency.

J	Vu, L; Alaghband, G				Vu, Lan; Alaghband, Gita			Novel parallel method for association rule mining on multi-core shared memory systems	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; Multi-core; Shared memory; Association rule mining; Parallel algorithm; Databases		Association rule mining (ARM) is an important task in data mining with many practical applications. Current methods for association rule mining have shown unstable performance for different database types and under-utilize the benefits of multi-core shared memory machines. In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a novel parallel method for finding frequent patterns, the most computational intensive phase of ARM. Our proposed method, named ShaFEM, combines two mining strategies and applies the most appropriate one to each data subset of the database to efficiently adapt to the data characteristics and run fast on both sparse and dense databases. In addition, our newlock-free design minimizes the synchronization needs and maximizes the data independence to enhance the scalability. The new structure lends itself well to dynamic job scheduling resulting in a well-balanced load on the new multi-core shared memory architectures. We have evaluated ShaFEM on 12-core multi-socket servers and found that our method run up to 5.8 times faster and consumes memory up to 7.1 times less than the state-of-the-art parallel method. For some test cases, ShaFEM can save up to 4.9 days of execution time over the compared method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lambert, I; Oberhaensli, R				Lambert, Ian; Oberhaensli, Roland			Towards more effective risk reduction: Catastrophic tsunami	EPISODES			English	Article								The International Union of Geological Sciences (JUGS) is evaluating whether there are additional geoscientific activities that would be beneficial in helping mitigate the impacts of tsunami. Public concerns about poor decisions and inaction, and advances in computing power and data mining call for new scientific approaches. Three fundamental requirements for mitigating impacts of natural hazards are defined. These are: (1) improvement of process-oriented understanding, (2) adequate monitoring and optimal use of data, and (3) generation of advice based on scientific, technical and socio-economic expertise. International leadership/coordination is also important. To increase the capacity to predict and mitigate the impacts of tsunami and other natural hazards a broad consensus is needed. The main needs include the integration of systematic geological inputs - identifying and studying paleo-tsunami deposits for all subduction zones; optimising coverage and coordination of geodetic and seismic monitoring networks; underpinning decision making at national and international scales by developing appropriate mechanisms for gathering, managing and communicating authoritative scientific and technical advice information; international leadership for coordination and authoritative statements of best approaches. All these suggestions are reflected in the Sendai Agreement, the collective views of the experts at the International Workshop on Natural Hazards, presented later in this volume.

Methods: This study was conducted in three phases: data preparation, training phase, and testing phase. A sample from a database consisting of 23 million pharmacy insurance claim records, from 2004 to 2011 was-used, in which a total of 330 prescriptions were assessed and used to train and test the models simultaneously. In the training phase, the selected prescriptions were assessed by both a physician and a pharmacist separately and assigned a diagnosis. To test the performance of each model, a k-fold stratified cross validation was conducted in addition to measuring their sensitivity and specificity. Result: Generally, two methods had very similar accuracies. Considering the weighted average of true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity), the decision tree had slightly higher accuracy in its ability for correct classification (83.3% and 96% versus 80.3% and 95.1%, respectively). However, when the weighted average of ROC area (AUC between each class and all other classes) was measured, the ANN displayed higher accuracies in predicting the diagnosis (93.8% compared with 90.6%). Conclusion: According to the result of this study, artificial neural network and decision tree model represent similar accuracy in labeling diagnosis to GI prescription.

Many computational methodologies and algorithms have been proposed as a solution to the 3-D Protein Structure Prediction (3-D-PSP) problem. These methods can be divided in four main classes: (a) first principle methods without database information; (b) first principle methods with database information; (c) fold recognition and threading methods; and (d) comparative modeling methods and sequence alignment strategies. Deterministic computational techniques, optimization techniques, data mining and machine learning approaches are typically used in the construction of computational solutions for the PSP problem. Our main goal with this work is to review the methods and computational strategies that are currently used in 3-D protein prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapidly collecting/pooling data can accelerate 'translational research in radiation therapy and oncology. The exchange of study data is one of the fundamental principles behind data aggregation and data mining. The possibilities of reproducing the original study results, performing further analyses on existing research data to generate new hypotheses or developing computational models to support medical decisions (e.g. risk/benefit analysis of treatment options) represent just a fraction of the potential benefits of medical data-pooling. Distributed machine learning and knowledge exchange from federated databases can be considered as one beyond other attractive approaches for knowledge generation within "Big Data". Data interoperability between research institutions should be the major concern behind a wider collaboration. Information captured in electronic patient records (EPRs) and study case report forms (eCRFs), linked together with medical imaging and treatment planning data, are deemed to be fundamental elements for large multi-centre studies in the field of radiation therapy and oncology. To fully utilise the captured medical information, the study data have to be more than just an electronic version of a traditional (un-modifiable) paper CRF. Challenges that have to be addressed are data interoperability, utilisation of standards, data quality and privacy concerns, data ownership, rights to publish, data pooling architecture and storage. This paper discusses a framework for conceptual packages of ideas focused on a strategic development for international research data exchange in the field of radiation therapy and oncology.

Ranga			Design and development of a web-enabled data mining system employing JEE technologies	SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						Data mining; graph mining; web-based system; JEE technologies	ALGORITHMS	With the advent of cost effective storage systems and high speed network connectivity, the amount of data gathered by various transactional systems has increased manifold and processing the same has become a real challenge. A number of data mining systems have been developed for processing such huge data in a meaningful way. Most of these systems are stand-alone in nature except a few of them that facilitate a subset of their overall functionality for web-based usage. This is mainly due to the challenges involved in designing the architectural framework required for developing a web-enabled data mining system. Such a system is aimed at analysing the transactional data pertaining to various input domains employing some advanced graph mining techniques like subgraph matching, frequent subgraph discovery and graph visualization. In this paper, we present an innovative approach employing various Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) based technologies for developing a data mining system that operates in the web environment. This paper basically presents the architectural principles required to design a suitable framework for enabling the development of such a system and the implementation challenges faced in realising the same. The paper also discusses functional details of the system involving various graph mining techniques. A few general guidelines based on our understanding during the system implementation are also included in this paper for completeness.	[Krishna, Varun; Jose, Jintomon; Suri, N. N. R.

K-means is one of the popular clustering algorithms that, despite its inherent simplicity, has also some major problems. One way to resolve these problems and improve the k-means algorithm is the use of evolutionary algorithms in clustering. In this study, the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is developed and then used in the clustering process. Clustering of IRIS, Wine and CMC datasets using developed ICA and comparing them with the results of clustering by the original ICA, GA and PSO algorithms, demonstrate the improvement of Imperialist competitive algorithm.

Understanding how sentiments change overtime is an interesting and important problem with many applications. Given a certain public event or product, a user's sentiments expressed in microblog stream can be regarded as a vector. In this paper, we define a novel problem of sentiment evolution analysis, and develop a simple yet effective method to detect sentiment evolution in user-level for public events. We firstly propose a multidimensional sentiment model with hierarchical structure to model user's complicate sentiments. Based on this model, we use FP-growth tree algorithm to mine frequent sentiment patterns and perform sentiment evolution analysis by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Moreover, we develop an improve Affinity Propagation algorithm to detect why people change their sentiments. Experimental evaluations on real data sets show that sentiment evolution could be implemented effectively using our method proposed in this article.

J	Li, HJ; Wang, H; Chen, LN				Li, Hui-Jia; Wang, Hao; Chen, Luonan			Measuring robustness of community structure in complex networks	EPL			English	Article							MODEL	The theory of community structure is a powerful tool for real networks, which can simplify their topological and functional analysis considerably. However, since community detection methods have random factors and real social networks derived from complex systems always contain error edges, evaluating the robustness of community structure is an urgent and important task. In this letter, we employ the critical threshold of resolution parameter in Hamiltonian function, gamma C, to measure the robustness of a network. According to spectral theory, a rigorous proof shows that the index we proposed is inversely proportional to robustness of community structure. Furthermore, by utilizing the co- evolution model, we provides a new efficient method for computing the value of gamma C. The research can be applied to broad clustering problems in network analysis and data mining due to its solid mathematical basis and experimental effects.

Quality measures for fuzzy predicates in conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms	INGENIERIA E INVESTIGACION			English	Article						data mining; fuzzy predicate; quality measures; conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms	ASSOCIATION RULES; MODEL; SETS	Association rule mining is a very popular data mining technique. Rules in this technique are often used to identify and represent dependencies between attributes in databases. Specifically, fuzzy association rules are rules that use the concepts of fuzzy sets and can be considered as a special case of fuzzy predicates. Many quality measures have been defined for fuzzy association rules, but all consider a specific structure: antecedent and consequence. In the case of fuzzy predicates in the normal form (i.e., conjunctive or disjunctive), it is necessary to define different quality measures that do not consider the structure as an antecedent or a consequence. The only available measure for this scenario is the fuzzy predicate truth value- (FPTV), which has serious limitations. The evaluation of fuzzy predicates in the normal form through appropriate quality measures has not yet been clearly defined in the literature. Thus, we propose several quality measures specifically for fuzzy predicates in the conjunctive (CNF) and disjunctive (DNF) normal forms. Experimental studies illustrate the use of the proposed measures and allow some general conclusions about each measure.

Efficient mining frequent itemsets algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Association rule mining; Frequent; Apriori; Count table; Efficient	ASSOCIATION RULES; TREE; GENERATION; BITTABLEFI; PATTERNS; SETS	Efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets are crucial for mining association rules as well as for many other data mining tasks. It is well known that countTable is one of the most important facility to employ subsets property for compressing the transaction database to new lower representation of occurrences items. One of the biggest problem in this technique is the cost of candidate generation and test processing which are the two most important steps to find association rules. In this paper, we have developed this method to avoid the costly candidate-generation-and-test processing completely. Moreover, the proposed methods also compress crucial information about all itemsets, maximal length frequent itemsets, minimal length frequent itemsets, avoid expensive, and repeated database scans. The proposed named CountTableFI and BinaryCountTableF are presented, the algorithm has significant difference from the Apriori and all other algorithms extended from Apriori. The idea behind this algorithm is in the representation of the transactions, where, we represent all transactions in binary number and decimal number, so it is simple and fast to use subset and identical set properties. A comprehensive performance study shows that our techniques are efficient and scalable comparing with other methods.

Logistic regression (LR) is a well-known classification method that has been used widely in many applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. However, its performance is affected by the multi-co-linearity among its predictors, and the features' redundancy. l1-regularizion and features extraction methods are commonly used to enhance the performance of logistic regression under multi-co-linearity and ovefitting problems, and to reduce computational complexity by discarding less relevant or redundant features. These methods include principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Recently, l1-regularized logistic regression has received much attention as a promising method for features selection in classification tasks. So there is a great need to be compared with these existing methods. In this paper, we assess the performance of the aforementioned feature selection methods on LR and l1-regularized logistic regression using different statistical measures. A variety of performance metrics has been utilized: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and the receiver operating characteristic analysis. This study is distinct by its inclusion of a comprehensive statistical analysis.

For modelling, we use data-mining methods often applied in bankruptcy prediction: neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and the rough set theory (RST) capable of rule-based classification. The point of departure for our comparative analysis is the practical finding that black-box-type data-mining methods typically show better classification performance than models whose results are easy to interpret, i.e. there seems to be a kind of trade-off between the interpretability and predictive power of bankruptcy models. Empirical results lead us to conclude that the RST approach can be a competitive alternative to black-box-type SVM and NN models. In our research, we did not find any major trade-off between the interpretability and predictive performance of bankruptcy models on the database of the first Hungarian bankruptcy model.

In this paper, we develop and successfully apply methodologies that rely heavily on readily available remote-sensing datasets over the Jazan province in the Red Sea hills of Saudi Arabia. A fivefold exercise was conducted: 1) a geographical information system (GIS) with a Web interface was generated to host and analyze relevant coregistered remote-sensing data and derived products; 2) an inventory was compiled for debris flows identified from satellite datasets (e.g., GeoEye, Orbview), a subset of which was field verified; 3) spatial analyses were conducted in a GIS environment and 10 predisposing factors were identified; 4) an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a logistic regression (LR) model were constructed, optimized, and validated; and 5) the generated models were used to produce debris-flow susceptibility maps. Findings include: 1) excellent prediction performance for both models (ANN: 96.1%; LR: 96.3%); 2) the high correspondence between model outputs (91.5% of the predictions were common) reinforces the validity of the debris-flow susceptibility results; 3) the variables with the highest predictive power were topographic position index (TPI), slope, distance to drainage line (DTDL), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and 4) the adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective, and could potentially be applied over many of the world's data-scarce mountainous lands, particularly along the Red Sea Hills.

J	Fuchs, M; Hopken, W; Lexhagen, M				Fuchs, Matthias; Hoepken, Wolfram; Lexhagen, Maria			Big data analytics for knowledge generation in tourism destinations - A case from Sweden	JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Big data analytics; Tourism destination; Destination management information system; Business intelligence; Data mining; Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)	MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; INDUSTRY; FIRM	This paper presents a knowledge infrastructure which has recently been implemented as a genuine novelty at the leading Swedish mountain tourism destination, Are. By applying a Business Intelligence approach, the Destination Management Information System Are (DMIS-Are) drives knowledge creation and application as a precondition for organizational learning at tourism destinations. Schianetz, Kavanagh, and Lockington's (2007) concept of the 'Learning Tourism Destination' and the 'Knowledge Destination Framework' introduced by Hopken, Fuchs, Keil, and Lexhagen (2011) build the theoretical fundament for the technical architecture of the presented Business Intelligence application. After having introduced the development process of indicators measuring destination performance as well as customer behaviour and experince the paper highlights how DMIS-Are can be used by tourism managers to gain new knowledge about customer-based destination processes focused on pre- and post-travel phases, like "Web-Navigation", "Booking" and "Feedback". After a concluding discussion about the various components building the prototypically implemented BI-based DMIS infrastructure with data from destination stakeholders, the agenda of future research is sketched. The agenda considers, for instance, the application of real-time Business Intelligence to gain real-time knowledge on tourists' on-site behaviour at tourism destinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although some genes or biological processes involved in the interaction between cotton and Verticillium dahliae have been identified, the molecular mechanism of cotton resistance to this disease is still poorly understood. The basic innate immune response for defence is somewhat conserved among plant species to defend themselves in complex environments, which makes it possible to characterize genes involved in cotton immunity based on information from model plants. With the availability of Arabidopsis databases, a data-mining strategy accompanied by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and heterologous expression were adopted in cotton and tobacco, respectively, for global screening and gene function characterization. A total of 232 Arabidopsis genes putatively involved in basic innate immunity were screened as candidate genes, and bioinformatic analysis suggested a role of these genes in the immune response. In total, 38 homologous genes from cotton were singled out to characterize their response to V. dahliae and methyl jasmonate treatment through quantitative real-time PCR. The results revealed that 24 genes were differentially regulated by pathogen inoculation, and most of these genes responded to both Verticillium infection and jasmonic acid stimuli. Furthermore, the efficiency of the strategy was illustrated by the functional identification of six candidate genes via heterologous expression in tobacco or a knockdown approach using VIGS in cotton. Functional categorization of these 24 differentially expressed genes as well as functional analysis suggest that reactive oxygen species, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signalling pathways are involved in the cotton disease resistance response to V. dahliae. Our data demonstrate how information from model plants can allow the rapid translation of information into non-model species without complete genome sequencing, via high-throughput screening and functional identification of target genes based on data-mining and VIGS.

Traditionally researchers would tackle this problem by considering "small" data algorithms, and investigating how to make them computationally more efficient for big data applications. The main means to achieve computational efficiency would be to revise the necessity and order of subroutines, or to approximate calculations. This paper presents a viewpoint that in order to be able to cope with the new challenges of the growing digital universe, research needs to take a combined view towards data analysis algorithm design and hardware design, and discusses a potential research direction in taking an intreated approach in terms of algorithm design and hardware design. Analyzing how data mining algorithms operate at the elementary operations level can help do design more specialized and dedicated hardware, that, for instance, would be more energy efficient. In turn, understanding hardware design can help to develop more effective algorithms.

The complexity of these systems unfolds both in evolving software structures, as well as in the social dynamics and organization of development teams. Due to the adoption of Open Source practices and the increasing use of online support infrastructures, large-scale data sets covering both the social and technical dimension of collaborative software engineering processes are increasingly becoming available. In the analysis of these data, a growing number of studies employ a network perspective, using methods and abstractions from network science to generate insights about software engineering processes. Featuring a collection of inspiring works in this area, with this topical issue, we intend to give an overview of state-of-the-art research. We hope that this collection of articles will stimulate downstream applications of network-based data mining techniques in empirical software engineering.

There are, however, ethical issues due to the monitoring-and-surveillance, data-mining, and autonomous nature of software agents. Considering the context, this study aims to comprehend stakeholders' perspectives on the social network service environment to identify the main considerations for the design of software agents in social network services in the near future. Twenty-one stakeholders, belonging to 3 key stakeholder groups, were recruited using a purposive sampling strategy for unstandardized semistructured e-mail interviews. The interview data were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis method. It was possible to identify 3 main considerations for the design of software agents in social network services, which were classified into the following categories: comprehensive understanding of users' perception of privacy, user type recognition algorithms for software agent development, and existing software agents enhancement.

The genome-wide methylation profiling of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has not previously been used to assess HCC development. Using MethylCap-seq, we analyzed the genome-wide cfDNA methylation profiles by separately pooling healthy control (HC), CHB, LC and HCC samples and independently validating the library data for the tissue DNA and cfDNA by MSP, qMSP and Multiplex-BSP-seq. Results: The dynamic features of cfDNA methylation coincided with the natural course of HCC development. Data mining revealed the presence of 240, 272 and 286 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) corresponding to the early, middle and late stages of HCC progression, respectively. The validation of the DNA and cfDNA results in independent tissues identified three DMGs, including ZNF300, SLC22A20 and SHISA7, with the potential for distinguishing between CHB and LC as well as between LC and HCC. The area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.65 to 0.80, and the odds ratio (OR) values ranged from 5.18 to 14.2. Conclusions: Our data revealed highly dynamic cfDNA methylation profiles in support of HBV-related HCC development. We have identified a panel of DMGs that are predictive for the early, middle and late stages of HCC development, and these are potential markers for the early detection of HCC as well as the screening of high-risk populations.

Statistical analysis and data mining of digital reconstructions of dendritic morphologies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						L-Measure (RRID:nif-0000-00003); NeuroMmpho.Org (RRID:nif-0000-00006); neuroinformatics; dendritic topology; cluster analysis; cellular neuroanatomy	MONKEY PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL MORPHOLOGY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; NEURAL CIRCUITS; RAT; INTERNEURONS; GENERATION; MICROCIRCUITS; ORGANIZATION	Neuronal morphology is diverse among animal species, developmental stages, brain regions, and cell types. The geometry of individual neurons also varies substantially even within the same cell class. Moreover, specific histological, imaging, and reconstruction methodologies can differentially affect morphometric measures. The quantitative characterization of neuronal arbors is necessary for in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship in nervous systems. The large collection of community-contributed digitally reconstructed neurons available at NeuroMorpho.Org constitutes a "big data" research opportunity for neuroscience discovery beyond the approaches typically pursued in single laboratories. To illustrate these potential and related challenges, we present a database-wide statistical analysis of dendritic arbors enabling the quantification of major morphological similarities and differences across broadly adopted metadata categories. Furthermore, we adopt a complementary unsupervised approach based on clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify the main morphological parameters leading to the most statistically informative structural classification. We find that specific combinations of measures related to branching density, overall size, tortuosity, bifurcation angles, arbor flatness, and topological asymmetry can capture anatomically and functionally relevant features of dendritic trees. The reported results only represent a small fraction of the relationships available for data exploration and hypothesis testing enabled by sharing of digital morphological reconstructions.

Latent Low Rank Representation (LatLRR) is one of the state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering. However, its effectiveness is undermined by a recent discovery that the solution to the noiseless LatLRR model is non-unique. To remedy this issue, we propose choosing the sparest solution in the solution set. When there is noise, we further propose preprocessing the data with robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantage of our robust LatLRR over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

STAT1-Dependent Signal Integration between IFN gamma and TLR4 in Vascular Cells Reflect Pro-Atherogenic Responses in Human Atherosclerosis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR; NF-KAPPA-B; INTERCELLULAR-ADHESION MOLECULE-1; TRANSPLANTED MOUSE HEARTS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; INTERFERON-GAMMA; NITRIC-OXIDE; GENE-EXPRESSION; TNF-ALPHA; REDUCES ATHEROSCLEROSIS	Signal integration between IFN gamma and TLRs in immune cells has been associated with the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of STAT1. We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular cells involved in cross-talk between IFNc and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic responses in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between IFN gamma and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccrl2, Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and antibacterial genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among the amplified genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a new pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NF kappa B, with the novel role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The synergistic interactions between IFN gamma and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell migration and impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1 phosphorylation in vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries. Moreover, using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a selection of these STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be increased in coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study provides evidence to suggest that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform for cross-talk between IFN gamma and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene signature that reflects a proatherogenic state in human atherosclerosis.

Review on Biodiesel Production from Various Feedstocks Using 12-Tungstophosphoric Acid (TPA) as a Solid Acid Catalyst Precursor	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DODECATUNGSTOPHOSPHORIC ACID; HETEROPOLY ACIDS; COOKING OIL; CANOLA OIL; SIMULTANEOUS ESTERIFICATION; EFFICIENT ESTERIFICATION; SOYBEAN OIL; FATTY-ACID; MAS NMR	Solid acid catalysts are an important class of catalysts because of their applications in various organic reactions. A 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) is a member of heteropoly acid (HPA) compounds, which grabbed attention because of its low volatility, low corrosivity, higher activity, and acidity compared to sulfuric acid. However, the major problems of using TPA are its solubility in polar media, and its lower surface area. Therefore, various techniques are applied to use it as heterogeneous catalysts. Biodiesel is a diesel substitute renewable fuel, which is produced from various renewable feedstocks through transesterification or esterification reactions. Acid catalysts can catalyze both transesterification and esterification reactions. For this reason, research has been conducted to study the catalytic activity of various TPA precursory solid acid catalysts for biodiesel production. In this Review, a data mining technique has been applied to extract valuable information from the previously published literature. For this purpose, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed based on the published research data to capture the general trends or to make predictions. Both catalyst properties and reaction conditions are trended and predicted using the network model.

J	Mangat, V; Vig, R				Mangat, Veenu; Vig, Renu			Novel associative classifier based on dynamic adaptive PSO: Application to determining candidates for thoracic surgery	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Associative classification; PSO; Rule quality	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; RULE DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM; DISCRETE; SPACE	Association rule mining is a data mining technique for discovering useful and novel patterns or relationships from databases. These rules are simple to infer and intuitive and can be easily used for classification in any domain that requires explanation for and investigation into how the classification works. Examples of such areas are medicine, agriculture, education, etc. For such a system to find wide adoptability, it should give output that is correct and comprehensible. The amount of data has been growing very fast and so has the search space of these problems. So we need to change traditional methods. This paper discusses a rule mining classifier called DA-AC (dynamic adaptive-associative classifier) which is based on a Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimizer. Due to its seeding method, exemplar selection, adaptive parameters, dynamic reconstruction of regions and velocity update, it avoids premature convergence and provides a better value in every dimension. Quality evaluation is done both for individual rules as well as entire rulesets. Experiments were conducted over fifteen benchmark datasets to evaluate performance of proposed algorithm in comparison with six other state-of-the-art non associative classifiers and eight associative classifiers. Results demonstrate competitive performance of proposed DA-AC while considering predictive accuracy and number of mined patterns as parameters. The method was then applied to predict life expectancy of post operative thoracic surgery patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, we identified Regenerating Gene Type IV (REG4) as the most significantly associated gene with resistance to CCRT. This study examined the prognostic impact of REG4 expression in patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant CCRT. MethodsREG4 immunohistochemistry was retrospectively assessed for pre-treatment biopsy specimens from 172 rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery without initial distant metastasis. The results were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), as well as -H2AX expression in post-treatment tumor samples. ResultsHigh expression of REG4 was associated with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (P=0.026), advanced post-treatment tumor status (P=0.006), advanced post-treatment nodal status (P=0.001), advanced post-treatment tumor stage (P<0.001), and inferior tumor regression grade (P=0.001). Of note, high expression of REG4 emerged as an adverse prognosticator for DSS (P=0.0004), LRFS (P=0.0009), and MeFS (P=0.0254). After multivariate comparisons, it remained independently prognostic for worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR]=2.731; P=0.025) and LRFS (HR=2.676; P=0.029). High expression of REG4 was also negatively associated with -H2AX expression (P<0.0001, r=-0.708). ConclusionsHigh expression of REG4 is associated with poor therapeutic response, adverse outcome and an aggressive phenotype in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT, justifying REG4 is a surrogate marker to predict CCRT resistance.

Cross correlation of signal templates with continuous seismic records has evidenced unusual events with similar low-frequency characteristics in several Italian regions. Spectral analysis and spatiotemporal distribution of these events, some of which are previously interpreted as tectonic long-period transients, suggest that they are not natural, but produced by huge cement factories. Since there are at least 57 full-cycle cement plants operating in Italy, each affecting areas of about 1250 to 2800km(2), we argue that significant portions of the Italian territory (23% to 51%) can be affected by this man-made noise. Seismic noise analyses, such as those used for microzonation or crustal structure investigations, as well as data mining techniques used to retrieve anomalous transient signals, should thus take into account this peculiar and pervasive source of seismic waves.

These images often carry annotations on taxonomy and observable features, such as anatomical structures and phenotype variations often recorded in response to the environmental factors under which the organisms were sampled. At present, most of these annotations are described in free text, may involve limited use of non-standard vocabularies, and rarely specify precise coordinates of features on the image plane such that a computer vision algorithm could identify, extract and annotate them. Therefore, researchers and curators need a tool that can identify and demarcate features in an image plane and allow their annotation with semantically contextual ontology terms. Such a tool would generate data useful for inter and intra-specific comparison and encourage the integration of curation standards. In the future, quality annotated image segments may provide training data sets for developing machine learning applications for automated image annotation. Results: We developed a novel image segmentation and annotation software application, "Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies" (AISO). The tool enables researchers and curators to delineate portions of an image into multiple highlighted segments and annotate them with an ontology-based controlled vocabulary. AISO is a freely available Java-based desktop application and runs on multiple platforms. It can be downloaded at http://www.plantontology.org/software/AISO. Conclusions: AISO enables curators and researchers to annotate digital images with ontology terms in a manner which ensures the future computational value of the annotated images. We foresee uses for such data-encoded image annotations in biological data mining, machine learning, predictive annotation, semantic inference, and comparative analyses.

Formaldehyde is one of the most reactive household and industrial pollutants. Dioxins are persistent organic pollutants and most potent synthetic poisons effective even at trace concentrations. Environmental pollutants are capable of altering the expression of a variety of genes. To identify the similarities and differences in the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxin on gene expression, we performed the bioinformatic analysis of all available published data. Results: We found that that in addition to the common p53-, ATM- and MAPK-signaling stress response pathways, genes of cell cycle regulation and proinflammatory cytokines, the studied pollutants induce a variety of other molecular processes. Conclusions: The observed patterns provide new insights into the mechanisms of the adverse effects associated with these pollutants. They can also be useful in the development of new bio-sensing methods for detection of pollutants in the environment and combating the deleterious effects.

However, many important problems including attribute reduction in rough sets are NP-hard, therefore the algorithms to solve them are often greedy. Matroids, generalized from linear independence in vector spaces, provide well-established platforms for greedy algorithm design. In this paper, we use graph and matrix approaches to study rough sets through matroids. First, we construct an isomorphism from equivalence relations to 2-circuit matroids, and then propose graph representations of lower and upper approximations through the graphic matroid. We also study graph representations of lower and upper approximations by that of the dual of the matroid. Second, in light of the fact that the relational matrix is a representable matrix of the matroid induced by an equivalence relation, matrix representations of lower and upper approximations are obtained with the representable matrix of the matroid. In a word, borrowing from matroids, this work presents two interesting views, graph and matrix ones, to investigate rough sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is known that a decision-tree model can contain relations that are statistically significant, but, in reality, meaningless to a human. When the task is domain analysis, meaningless relations are problematic, since they can lead to wrong conclusions and can consequently undermine a human's trust in DM programs. To eliminate problematic relations from the conclusions of analysis, we propose an interactive method called Human-Machine Data Mining (HMDM). The method constructs multiple models in a specific way so that a human can reexamine the relations in different contexts and, based on observed evidence, conclude which relations and models are credible that is, both meaningful and of high quality. Based on the extracted credible relations and models, the human can construct correct overall conclusions about the domain. The method is demonstrated in two complex domains, extracting credible relations and models that indicate the segments of the higher education sector and the research and development sector that influence the economic welfare of a country. An experimental evaluation shows that the method is capable of finding important relations and models that are better in both meaning and quality than those constructed solely by the DM programs.

In this paper, we propose a strong (k,t,n) verifiable multi-secret sharing scheme, where any k out of n participants operate as dealers. The scheme realizes both threshold structure and adversary structure simultaneously, and removes a trusted third party. The secret reconstruction phase is performed using an additive homomorphism for decreasing the storage cost. Meanwhile, the scheme achieves the pre-verification property in the sense that any participant doesn't need to reveal any information about real master shares in the verification phase. We compare our proposal with the previous (n,t,n) secret sharing schemes from the perspectives of what kinds of access structures they achieve, what kinds of functionalities they support and whether heavy storage cost for secret share is required. Then it shows that our scheme takes the following advantages: (a) realizing the adversary structure, (b) allowing any k out of n participants to operate as dealers, (c) small sized secret share. Moreover, our proposed scheme is a favorable candidate to be used in many applications, such as secure multi-party computation and privacy preserving data mining, etc.	[Li, Jing; Wang, Licheng; Yan, Jianhua; Niu, Xinxin; Yang, Yixian] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China	Wang, LC (reprint author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.	wanglc2012@126.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61103198, 61121061, 61370194]; NSFC A3 Foresight Program [61161140320]	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Nos. 61103198, 61121061,61370194), and the NSFC A3 Foresight Program (No. 61161140320).		28	0	0	KSII-KOR SOC INTERNET INFORMATION	GANGNAM-GU	KOR SCI & TECHNOL CTR, 409 ON 4TH FLR, MAIN BLDG, 635-4 YEOKSAM 1-DONG, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA	1976-7277			KSII T INTERNET INF	KSII Trans.

The processing chain has been designed looking at the simplicity, i.e., the minimization of the operations needed to obtain the products, and at the algorithms' availability in the literature. Innovation has been provided in the cross-calibration step, which is solved introducing the variable amplitude levels equalization (VALE) method, through which it is possible to establish a common metrics for the measurement of the amplitude levels exhibited by the images of the series.

Outpatient appointment scheduling given individual day-dependent no-show predictions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Business analytics; OR in health services; Data mining; Appointment scheduling	IMPROVE PATIENT ACCESS; HEALTH-CARE; CLINIC PERFORMANCE; OVERBOOKING; CAPACITY; SYSTEMS; SERVICE	This paper examines the combined use of predictive analytics, optimization, and overbooking to schedule outpatient appointments in the presence of no-shows. We tackle the problem of optimally overbooking appointments given no-show predictions that depend on the individual appointment characteristics and on the appointment day. The goal is maximizing the number of patients seen while minimizing waiting time and overtime. Our analysis leads to the definition of a near-optimal and simple heuristic which consists of giving same-day appointments to likely shows and future-day appointments to likely no-shows. We validate our findings by performing extensive simulation tests based on an empirical data set of nearly fifty thousand appointments from a real outpatient clinic. The results suggest that our heuristic can lead to a substantial increase in performance and that it should be preferred to open access under most parameter configurations. Our paper will be of great interest to practitioners who want to improve their clinic performance by using individual no-show predictions to guide appointment scheduling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, the interest in understanding the nature of the information diffusion in the blogosphere has also been increased. Existing studies in social networks have mainly focused on the information diffusion through explicit relationships between members. In this paper, we analyze the causes for the information diffusion without explicit relationships in the blogosphere. BlogCast, a functionality provided by blog-service providers to expose a high quality post on the portal main page, is found to be one of the main causes of the information diffusion without explicit relationships. We analyze the characteristics of the information diffusion through the BlogCast and its halo effect on the bloggers whose post has been exposed on the portal main page. In addition, we examine the sustainability of the halo effect of the BlogCast over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the extensive application of semi-structured data, frequent tree pattern mining has become a hot topic. This paper proposes a compression tree sequence (OS) to construct a compression tree model; and save the information of the original tree in the compression tree. As any subsequence of the CTS corresponds to a subtree of the original tree, it is efficient for mining subtrees. Furthermore, this paper proposes a frequent maximal induced subtrees mining method based on the compression tree sequence, CFMIS (compressed frequent maximal induced subtrees). The algorithm is primarily performed via four stages: firstly, the original data set is constructed as a compression tree model; then, a cut-edge reprocess is run for the edges in which the edge frequent is less than the threshold; next, the tree is compressed after the cut-edge based on the different frequent edge degrees; and, last, frequent subtree sets maximal processing is run such that, we can obtain the frequent maximal induced subtree set of the original data set. For each iteration, compression can reduce the size of the data set, thus, the traversal speed is faster than that of other algorithms. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can mine more frequent maximal induced subtrees in less time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In real applications, a small number of frequent patterns are used. Therefore, the mining of top-rank-k frequent patterns, which limits the number of mined frequent patterns by ranking them in frequency, has received increasing interest. This paper proposes the iNTK algorithm, which is an improved version of the NTK algorithm, for mining top-rank-k frequent patterns. This algorithm employs an N-list structure to represent patterns. The subsume concept is used to speed up the process of mining top-rank-k patterns. The experiments are conducted to evaluate iNTK and NTK in terms of mining time and memory usage for eight datasets. The experimental results show that iNTK is more efficient and faster than NTK. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a number of malicious users analyze the vulnerabilities of these systems in order to gain unauthorized access or to compromise the quality of service. For this reason, Intrusion Detection Systems have been designed in order to monitor the system and trigger alerts whenever they found a suspicious event. Optimal Intrusion Detection Systems are those that achieve a high attack detection rate together with a small number of false alarms. However, cyber attacks present many different characteristics which make them hard to be properly identified by simple statistical methods. According to this fact, Data Mining techniques, and especially those based in Computational Intelligence, have been used for implementing robust and accuracy Intrusion Detection Systems. In this paper; we consider the use of Genetic Fuzzy Systems within a pairwise learning framework for the development of such a system. The advantages of using this approach are twofold: first, the use of fuzzy sets, and especially linguistic labels, enables a smoother borderline between the concepts, and allows a higher interpretability of the rule set. Second, the divide-and-conquer learning scheme, in which we contrast all possible pair of classes with aims, improves the precision for the rare attack events, as it obtains a better separability between a "normal activity" and the different attack types. The goodness of our methodology is supported by means of a complete experimental study, in which we contrast the quality of our results versus the state-of-the-art of Genetic Fuzzy Systems for intrusion detection and the C4.5 decision tree.

J	Pears, R; Pisalpanus, S; Koh, YS				Pears, Russel; Pisalpanus, Songvvut; Koh, Yun Sing			A graph based approach to inferring item weights for pattern mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Semi supervised classification; Weighted association rule mining; WeightTransmitter model	ASSOCIATION RULES; INFORMATION; WEB	In this paper we present a novel approach to semi supervised classification based on a weight transmission model. Our research is motivated by rule extraction from transactional data, where a transaction consists of a collection of items, each of which is assigned a weight denoting its importance in relation to other items in the collection. The assignment of weight to items enables the end user to guide the rule extraction process to generate rules involving high impact items, thus enhancing the knowledge discovery process. Most previous research to weight assignment has used domain specific information to assign weights to items. We propose a model, XWeightTransmitter, that relaxes the assumption that domain information is available for all items. XWeightTransmitter interpolates the unknown weights from a known subset of weights and is an extension of the WeightTransmitter approach. Our experimentation shows that XWeightTransmitter outperforms a previously established weight transmission model known as WeightTransmitter, producing higher Recall and Precision in inferring unknown weights while incurring lower execution overheads. Although the research setting is weighted association rule mining the methods developed are equally applicable to the supervised classification context where class labels are not known for all instances, a typical scenario in many data mining applications.

In this approach to feature generation we consider the distribution of the pixel intensity placed in equal circular distances from the central point. In this statistical analysis each pixel of the image takes the role of the central point and KS statistics is estimated for the whole image. We determine the KS distance of pixel intensity corresponding to the coaxial rings of the increasing distance from the center. The slope of the linear regression function applied for approximating the characteristics presenting KS distance versus the geometrical distance of these rings, forms the proposed statistical descriptor of the image. We show the application of this numerical description for recognition of the set of images of soil of different type and show that it behaves very well as the diagnostic feature, better than texture Haralick features.

Characterization of time series for analyzing of the evolution of time series clusters	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time series; Temporal database; Cluster analysis; Multivariate database; Data mining	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES	This work proposes a new approach for the characterization of time series in databases (temporal databases - TDB) for temporal analysis of clusters. For the characterization of time-series it were used the level and trend components calculated through the Holt-Winters smoothing model. For the temporal analysis of those clusters, it was used in a combined manner the AGNES (Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster) and PAM (Partition Clustering) techniques. For the application of this methodology an R-based script for generating synthetic TDBs was developed. Our proposal allows the evaluation of the clusters, both in the object movement such as in the appearance or disappearance of clusters. The model chosen to characterize the time-series is adequate because it can be applied for short periods of time in situations where changes should be promptly detected for quick decision making.

J	Odgers, NP; McBratney, AB; Minasny, B				Odgers, Nathan P.; McBratney, Alex B.; Minasny, Budiman			Digital soil property mapping and uncertainty estimation using soil class probability rasters	GEODERMA			English	Article						Digital soil property mapping; Weighted means; Prediction interval; Uncertainty estimation; Probability rasters	OPTIMAL INTERPOLATION; ORGANIC-CARBON; SPATIAL PREDICTION; DEPTH FUNCTIONS; DECISION TREES; MAP UNITS; DISAGGREGATION; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; ATTRIBUTES	The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called "Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters" (PROPR). The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia. We created digital soil property maps of soil pH 1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90% prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-60 cm, 60-100 cm, 100-200 cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil pH value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference pH values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights. The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil pH of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90% prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions. The maps of soil pH displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil pH generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. RMSE increased with depth from about 0.75 pH units at the surface to 1.15 at depth. Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The PROPR approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in PROPR is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map. PROPR may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation. PROPR may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.

Comparing data mining and deterministic pedology to assess the frequency of WRB reference soil groups in the legend of small scale maps	GEODERMA			English	Article						Learning machine; Bayesian predictivity; Soil classification; Geomatic; Italy	CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE	The assessment of class frequency in soil map legends is affected by uncertainty, especially at small scales where generalization is greater. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that data mining techniques provide better estimation of class frequency than traditional deterministic pedology in a national soil map. In the 1:5,000,000 map of Italian soil regions, the soil classes are the WRB reference soil groups (RSGs). Different data mining techniques, namely neural networks, random forests, boosted tree, classification and regression tree, and supported vector machine (SVM), were tested and the last one gave the best RSG predictions using selected auxiliary variables and 22,015 classified soil profiles. The five most frequent RSGs resulting from the two approaches were compared. The outcomes were validated with a Bayesian approach applied to a subset of 10% of geographically representative profiles, which were kept out before data processing. The validation provided the values of both positive and negative prediction abilities. The most frequent classes were equally predicted by the two methods, which differed however from the forecast of the other classes. The Bayesian validation indicated that the SVM method was more reliable than the deterministic pedological approach and that both approaches were more confident in predicting the absence rather than the presence of a soil type.

Although such projects have different features from Software Engineering ones, they share some of their problems. Among these problems two are highlighted: unmanaged risks and inaccurate estimations of necessary resources to complete the project. In this context, this paper presents two ad-hoc models to be applied in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises: one for assessing project feasibility and the other for estimating the resources and time required to carry out the project. Both models should be applied at the beginning of the project. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An alignment-based framework to check the conformance of declarative process models and to preprocess event-log data	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM)	SEP 03-06, 2012	Tallinn, ESTONIA	Univ Tartu, Bizagi, IBM, HP, Signavio		Process mining; Declare; LTL; Conformance checking; Event-log preprocessing		Process mining can be seen as the "missing link" between data mining and business process management. The lion's share of process mining research has been devoted to the discovery of procedural process models from event logs. However, often there are predefined constraints that (partially) describe the normative or expected process, e.g., "activity A should be followed by B" or "activities A and B should never be both executed". A collection of such constraints is called a declarative process model. Although it is possible to discover such models based on event data, this paper focuses on aligning event logs and predefined declarative process models. Discrepancies between log and model are mediated such that observed log traces are related to paths in the model. The resulting alignments provide sophisticated diagnostics that pinpoint where deviations occur and how severe they are. Moreover, selected parts of the declarative process model can be used to clean and repair the event log before applying other process mining techniques. Our alignment-based approach for preprocessing and conformance checking using declarative process models has been implemented in ProM and has been evaluated using both synthetic logs and real-life logs from a Dutch hospital.

Feature selection and feature extraction are two commonly used techniques for decreasing dimensionality of the data and increasing efficiency of learning algorithms. Specifically, feature selection realized in the absence of class labels, namely unsupervised feature selection, is challenging and interesting. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection criterion developed from the viewpoint of subspace learning, which is treated as a matrix factorization problem. The advantages of this work are four-fold. First, dwelling on the technique of matrix factorization, a unified framework is established for feature selection, feature extraction and clustering. Second, an iterative update algorithm is provided via matrix factorization, which is an efficient technique to deal with high-dimensional data. Third, an effective method for feature selection with numeric data is put forward, instead of drawing support from the discretization process. Fourth, this new criterion provides a sound foundation for embedding kernel tricks into feature selection. With this regard, an algorithm based on kernel methods is also proposed. The algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection methods using six publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that in terms of clustering results, the proposed two algorithms come with better performance than the others for almost all datasets we experimented with here.

To identify carryover storage reservoir WLE operation rules for a cascade reservoir system, the best approach is to exploit large databases using a data mining tool such as decision trees. Thus, we applied decision trees based on the iterative dichotomizer 3 (ID3) to the Wu Jiang cascade reservoir system to derive the carryover storage reservoir WLE operation rules. The rules derived can be used to guide optimal real-time operation in the long term. The results demonstrated that the solution derived using tree-based rules performed better than the existing design rules in terms of the power generation benefit, which satisfied the output of the cascade reservoir system.

This study outlines the use of data mining capable of analyzing the wide range of situations found on the network, with a focus on the role of skid resistance in the cause of crashes. Results from the analyses show that on non-crash-prone roads with low crash rates, skid resistance contributes only in a minor way, whereas on high-crash roadways, skid resistance often contributes significantly in the calculation of the crash rate. The results provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between skid resistance and crashes and highlight the importance of the role of skid resistance in decision making in road asset management.

However, its time-consumption is very intolerable to analyze data sets with large scale and high dimensionality. Many heuristic fuzzy-rough feature selection algorithms have been developed however, quite often, these methods are still computationally time-consuming. For further improvement, we propose an accelerator, called forward approximation, which combines sample reduction and dimensionality reduction together. The strategy can be used to accelerate a heuristic process of fuzzy-rough feature selection. Based on the proposed accelerator, an improved algorithm is designed. Through the use of the accelerator, three representative heuristic fuzzy-rough feature selection algorithms have been enhanced. Experiments show that these modified algorithms are much faster than their original counterparts. It is worth noting that the performance of the modified algorithms becomes more visible when dealing with larger data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(ii) And how do CNVs, that do not represent complete deletions but do represent gene-dosage alterations, impact cancer cell functions? Recent studies have indicated that CNVs in cancer can impact genes for regulatory proteins long known to be associated with cancer development, but less is understood about CNVs affecting effector genes. Also, we have recently indicated the likely importance of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) copies in effector genes, in regulating the transition from a proliferative to an apoptotic state.

Because influent flow includes municipal sewage and rainfall runoff, it exhibits nonlinear spatial and temporal behavior and therefore makes it difficult to model. In this paper, a neural network approach is used to predict influent flow in the WWTP. The model inputs include historical influent data collected at a local WWTP, rainfall data and radar reflectivity data collected by the local weather station. A static multi-layer perceptron neural network performs well for the current time prediction but a time lag occurs and increases with the time horizon. A dynamic neural network with an online corrector is proposed to solve the time lag problem and increase the prediction accuracy for longer time horizons. The computational results show that the proposed neural network accurately predicts the influent flow for time horizons up to 300 min.

Devices such as smart phones, cameras, drones, and a growing array of environmental sensors (both fixed and mobile) and interactive online platforms have come to permeate daily life in technologically equipped societies. Consequently, we are witnessing a shift from targeted, purposeful, and discrete forms of information collection to always-on, ubiquitous, opportunistic ever-expanding forms of data capture. The increased use of sensors marks important changes to our understandings of surveillance, information processing, and privacy. In this article, we explore the transformations associated with the emerging sensing environment. The notion of a sensor society provides a conceptual basis for understanding the characteristics of emerging forms of monitoring and control.

Most of researches are focused on attribute reduction by using rough sets. Recently, Tsang et al. discussed attribute reduction with covering rough sets in the paper (Tsang et al., 2008), where an approach based on discernibility matrix was presented to compute all attribute reducts. In this paper, we provide anew method for constructing simpler discernibility matrix with covering based rough sets, and improve some characterizations of attribute reduction provided by Tsang et al. It is proved that the improved discernibility matrix is equivalent to the old one, but the computational complexity of discernibility matrix is relatively reduced. Then we further study attribute reduction in decision tables based on a different strategy of identifying objects. Finally, the proposed reduction method is compared with some existing feature selection methods by numerical experiments and the experimental results show that the proposed reduction method is efficient and effective.

The strategy of an agent is modeled by certain simple game theory models with limited information. Genetic algorithms are used to obtain the optimal collective behavior decomposition based on history data. The trained model can be used for collective behavior prediction. For modeling individual behavior, two simple games, the minority game and mixed game are investigated in experiments on the real-world stock prices and foreign-exchange rate.

Careful interpretation of these prototypes is crucial to assist the experts to better organize this know-how and to really improve their decision-making processes. The Traffic Lights Panel was introduced in 2009 as a postprocessing tool to provide understanding of clustering prototypes. In this work, annotated Traffic Lights Panel (aTLP) is presented as an enrichment of the TLP to manage the intrinsic uncertainty related with prototypes themselves. The aTLP handles uncertainty through a quantification of the prototypes' purity based on the variation coefficients (VC) and an associated color-based uncertainty model, with two dimensions - tone and saturation - representing nominal trend and purity of the prototype. An application to a waste-water treatment plant in Slovenia, in a discrete and continuous approach, suggests that aTLP seems a useful and friendly tool able to reduce the gap between data mining and effective decision support, towards informed-decisions.

While robust, efficient, and well-tested implementations exist for batch mining, hardly any publicly available equivalent exists for the streaming scenario. The lack of an efficient, usable tool for the task hinders its use by practitioners and makes it difficult to assess new research in the area. To alleviate this situation, we review the algorithms described in the literature, and implement and evaluate the IncMine algorithm by Cheng, Ke and Ng [J. Intell. Inf. Syst. 31(3) (2008), 191-215] for mining frequent closed itemsets from data streams. Our implementation works on top of the MOA (Massive Online Analysis) stream mining framework to ease its use and integration with other stream mining tasks. We provide a PAC-style rigorous analysis of the quality of the output of IncMine as a function of its parameters; this type of analysis is rare in pattern mining algorithms. As a by-product, the analysis shows how one of the user-provided parameters in the original description can be removed entirely while retaining the performance guarantees. Finally, we experimentally confirm both on synthetic and real data the excellent performance of the algorithm, as reported in the original paper, and its ability to handle concept drift.

The microorganisms have a wide range of organohalogen degradation ability both explicit and non-specific in nature. Most of these halogenated organic compounds being pollutants need to be remediated; therefore, the current approaches are to explore the potential of microbes at a molecular level for effective biodegradation of these substances. Several microorganisms with dehalogenation activity have been identified and characterized. In this aspect, the bioinformatics plays a key role to gain deeper knowledge in this field of dehalogenation. To facilitate the data mining, many tools have been developed to annotate these data from databases. Therefore, with the discovery of a microorganism one can predict a gene/protein, sequence analysis, can perform structural modelling, metabolic pathway analysis, biodegradation study and so on. This review highlights various methods of bioinformatics approach that describes the application of various databases and specific tools in the microbial dehalogenation fields with special focus on dehalogenase enzymes. Attempts have also been made to decipher some recent applications of in silico modeling methods that comprise of gene finding, protein modelling, Quantitative Structure Biodegradibility Relationslup (QSBR) study and reconstruction of metabolic pathways employed in dehalogenation research area.

J	Parvin, H; MirnabiBaboli, M; Alinejad-Rokny, H				Parvin, Hamid; MirnabiBaboli, Miresmaeil; Alinejad-Rokny, Hamid			Proposing a classifier ensemble framework based on classifier selection and decision tree	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Decision tree; Classifier ensembles; Clustering; Bagging; Learning; Ada Boosting		One of the most important tasks in pattern, machine learning, and data mining is classification problem. Introducing a general classifier is a challenge for pattern recognition communities, which enables one to learn each problem's dataset. Many classifiers have been proposed to learn any problem thus far. However, many of them have their own positive and negative aspects. So they are good only for specific problems. But there is no strong solution to recognize which classifier is better or good for a specific problem. Fortunately, ensemble learning provides a good way to have a near-optimal classifying system for any problem. One of the most challenging problems in classifier ensemble is introducing a suitable ensemble of base classifiers. Every ensemble needs diversity. It means that if a group of classifiers is to be a successful ensemble, they must be diverse enough to cover their errors. Therefore, during ensemble creation, a mechanism is needed to ensure that the ensemble classifiers are diverse. Sometimes this mechanism can select/remove a subset of base classifiers with respect to maintaining the diversity of the ensemble. This paper proposes a novel method, named the Classifier Selection Based on Clustering (CSBS), for ensemble creation. To insure diversity in ensemble classifiers, this method uses the clustering of classifiers technique. Bagging is used to produce base classifiers. During ensemble creation, every type of base classifier is the same as a decision tree classier or a multilayer perceptron classifier. After producing a number of base classifiers, CSBC partitions them by using a clustering algorithm. Then CSBC produces a final ensemble by selecting one classifier from each cluster. Weighted majority vote method is used as an aggregator function. In this paper we investigate the influence of cluster number on the performance of the CSBC method; we also probe how we can select a good approximate value for cluster number in any dataset. We base our study on a large number of real datasets of UCI repository to reach a definite result. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, to extract useful information, the temporal dimension also has to be accounted for which increases the complexity of the problem. For this reason, there is a need for suitable data mining techniques for this source of data. In this work, we developed a data mining methodology to extract multidimensional sequential patterns to characterize temporal behaviors. We then used the extracted multidimensional sequences to build a classifier, and show how the patterns help to distinguish between the classes. We evaluated our technique using a real-world dataset containing information about land use in Mali (West Africa) to automatically recognize if an area is cultivated or not. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nguyen, D; Vo, B; Le, B				Nguyen, Dang; Vo, Bay; Le, Bac			CCAR: An efficient method for mining class association rules with itemset constraints	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Associative classification; Class association rule; Data mining; Useful rules	QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; ALGORITHM	Class association rules (CARs) are basically used to build a classification model for prediction; they can also be used to describe correlations between itemsets and class labels. The latter is very popular in mining medical data. For example, epidemiologists often consider rules which indicate the relations between risk factors (itemsets) and HIV test results (class labels). However, in the real world, end users are often interested in a subset of class association rules. Particularly, they may consider only rules which contain at least one itemset from a user-defined set of itemsets in the rule antecedent. For example, when classifying which populations are at high risk for HIV infection, epidemiologists often concentrate on rules that include demographic information such as sex, age, and marital status in rule antecedents. Two naive strategies are to solve this problem by applying the itemset constraints into the preprocessing or post-processing step. However, such approaches are time-intensive. This paper thus proposes an efficient method for integrating the constraints into the class association rule mining process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two basic approaches in the mining time and the memory consumption. The practical benefits of our method are demonstrated by a real-life application in the HIV/AIDS domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pipelined Decision Tree Classification Accelerator Implementation in FPGA (DT-CAIF)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						Data mining; decision tree classification (DTC); hardware implementation; FPGA	NEURAL-NETWORK	Decision tree classification (DTC) is a widely used technique in data mining algorithms known for its high accuracy in forecasting. As technology has progressed and available storage capacity in modern computers increased, the amount of data available to be processed has also increased substantially, resulting in much slower induction and classification times. Many parallel implementations of DTC algorithms have already addressed the issues of reliability and accuracy in the induction process. In the classification process, larger amounts of data require proportionately more execution time, thus hindering the performance of legacy systems. We have devised a pipelined architecture for the implementation of axis parallel binary DTC that dramatically improves the execution time of the algorithm while consuming minimal resources in terms of area. Scalability is achieved when connected to a high-speed communication unit capable of performing data transfers at a rate similar to that of the DTC engine. We propose a hardware accelerated solution composed of parallel processing nodes capable of independently processing data from a streaming source. Each engine processes the data in a pipelined fashion to use resources more efficiently and increase the achievable throughput. The results show that this system is 3.5 times faster than the existing hardware implementation of classification.

Extending Association Rule Summarization Techniques to Assess Risk of Diabetes Mellitus	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; association rules; survival analysis; association rule summarization	LIFE-STYLE; TYPE-2; PREDICTION	Early detection of patients with elevated risk of developing diabetes mellitus is critical to the improved prevention and overall clinical management of these patients. We aim to apply association rule mining to electronic medical records (EMR) to discover sets of risk factors and their corresponding subpopulations that represent patients at particularly high risk of developing diabetes. Given the high dimensionality of EMRs, association rule mining generates a very large set of rules which we need to summarize for easy clinical use. We reviewed four association rule set summarization techniques and conducted a comparative evaluation to provide guidance regarding their applicability, strengths and weaknesses. We proposed extensions to incorporate risk of diabetes into the process of finding an optimal summary. We evaluated these modified techniques on a real-world prediabetic patient cohort. We found that all four methods produced summaries that described subpopulations at high risk of diabetes with each method having its clear strength. For our purpose, our extension to the Buttom-Up Summarization (BUS) algorithm produced the most suitable summary. The subpopulations identified by this summary covered most high-risk patients, had low overlap and were at very high risk of diabetes.

Much of recent research has focused on measuring the local difference between an outlier and its nearest neighbors, some of which may be unsuitable reference objects. Thus, local difference cannot represent true outlying-ness. On the basis of this conclusion, we propose a new outlying-ness measure that reflects the connectivity of any object to the main body of a data set. For any object p, the outlying-ness is denoted by the connectivity from the k-th most similar neighbor to p. The proposed measure is applicable to arbitrary-density and arbitrarily-shaped data. It is uninfluenced by unsuitable reference objects and effectively identifies outlying clusters without the need for clustering algorithms and additional parameters.

Catchment Classification Framework in Hydrology: Challenges and Directions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hydrologic modeling; Catchment classification; System complexity; Nonlinear dynamics; Networks	RIVER FLOW REGIMES; ENTROPY COMPLEXITY-MEASURES; WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; DOMINANT PROCESSES CONCEPT; SURFACE-WATER; HOMOGENEOUS REGIONS; UNGAUGED BASINS; UNITED-STATES; ENVIRONMENT CLASSIFICATION; STREAMFLOW REGIMES	The past few decades have witnessed the development of numerous catchment models, often with increasing structural complexity and mathematical sophistication. While such models have certainly provided a better understanding of catchments and associated processes, they are also often catchment-specific, region-specific, or process-specific. Serious concerns on this modeling trend have been increasingly raised in recent times and, consequently, the need for a generic catchment classification framework in hydrology has been emphasized. There have indeed been some attempts to advance the idea of such a classification framework. Such studies have investigated different ways of developing a framework, including river morphology, river regimes, hydroclimatic factors, landscape and land use parameters, hydrologic similarity indexes, hydrologic signatures, ecohydrologic factors, geostatistical properties, entropy, nonlinear and chaotic properties, data mining, and other relevant characteristics and methods. Although useful in their own ways, these studies are largely inadequate for a generic classification framework. In addition to the limitations that exist in each of the different forms, a coherent effort to bring these disparate forms together for a workable classification is also missing. This study highlights the challenges that the existing approaches pose in the development of a generic classification framework. It argues for an appropriate basis, a suitable methodology, and key components for such a framework. In particular, it discusses the vital role of system complexity as an appropriate basis for the classification framework and the potential of nonlinear dynamics, networks, and other modern concepts of complex systems science for assessing system complexity. The study also offers a three-step procedure for formulation and verification of a catchment classification framework. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Methods By combining array comparative genomic hybridisation, targeted Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing, we identified five further patients from four families with IEE due to biallelic alterations of WWOX. Results We identified eight deleterious WWOX alleles consisting in four deletions, a four base-pair frameshifting deletion, one missense and two nonsense mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation emerges from the seven reported families. The phenotype in four patients carrying two predicted null alleles was characterised by (1) little if any psychomotor acquisitions, poor spontaneous motility and absent eye contact from birth, (2) pharmacoresistant epilepsy starting in the 1st weeks of life, (3) possible retinal degeneration, acquired microcephaly and premature death. This contrasted with the less severe autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 phenotype due to hypomorphic alleles. In line with this correlation, the phenotype in two siblings carrying a null allele and a missense mutation was intermediate. Conclusions Our results obtained by a combination of different molecular techniques undoubtedly incriminate WWOX as a gene for recessive IEE and illustrate the usefulness of high throughput data mining for the identification of genes for rare autosomal recessive disorders. The structure of the WWOX locus encompassing the FRA16D fragile site might explain why constitutive deletions are recurrently reported in genetic databases, suggesting that WWOX-related encephalopathies, although likely rare, may not be exceptional.

We conducted a study that investigated this issue by comparing Google Trends and Baidu Index. Data from these two services are based on queries entered by users into Google and Baidu, two of the largest search engines in the world. We first compared the features and functions of the two services based on documents and extensive testing. We then carried out an empirical study that collected query volume data from the two sources. We found that data from both sources could be used to predict the quality of Chinese universities and companies. Despite the differences between the two services in terms of technology, such as differing methods of language processing, the search volume data from the two were highly correlated and combining the two data sources did not improve the predictive power of the data. However, there was a major difference between the two in terms of data availability. Baidu Index was able to provide more search volume data than Google Trends did. Our analysis showed that the disadvantage of Google Trends in this regard was due to Google's smaller user base in China. The implication of this finding goes beyond China. Google's user bases in many countries are smaller than that in China, so the search volume data related to those countries could result in the same issue as that related to China.

Although various methods have been developed to reduce the size of classical formal contexts, the reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on fuzzy lattices remains a difficult problem owing to its complicated derivation operators. To address this problem, we propose a general method of knowledge reduction by reducing attributes and objects in formal fuzzy contexts based on the variable threshold concept lattices. Employing the proposed approaches, we remove attributes and objects which are non-essential to the structure of a variable threshold concept lattice, i.e., with a given threshold level, the concept lattice constructed from a reduced formal context is made identical to that constructed from the original formal context. Discernibility matrices and Boolean functions are, respectively, employed to compute the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts, by which all the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts are determined without changing the structure of the lattice.

Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are two important issues in financial distress prediction where various statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop financial prediction models. Since there are no generally agreed upon financial ratios as input features for model development, many studies consider feature selection as a pre-processing step in data mining before constructing the models. However, most works only focused on applying specific feature selection methods over either bankruptcy prediction or credit scoring problem domains. In this work, a comprehensive study is conducted to examine the effect of performing filter and wrapper based feature selection methods on financial distress prediction. In addition, the effect of feature selection on the prediction models obtained using various classification techniques is also investigated. In the experiments, two bankruptcy and two credit datasets are used. In addition, three filter and two wrapper based feature selection methods combined with six different prediction models are studied. Our experimental results show that there is no the best combination of the feature selection method and the classification technique over the four datasets. Moreover, depending on the chosen techniques, performing feature selection does not always improve the prediction performance. However, on average performing the genetic algorithm and logistic regression for feature selection can provide prediction improvements over the credit and bankruptcy datasets respectively.

In this study, we investigated how frequently phosphorylation may affect the binding of drug inhibitors to target proteins. We examined the 453 non-redundant structures of soluble mammalian drug target proteins bound to inhibitors currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We cross-referenced these structures with phosphorylation data available from the PhosphoSitePlus database. Three hundred twenty-two of 453 (71%) of drug targets have evidence of phosphorylation that has been validated by multiple methods or labs. For 132 of 453 (29%) of those, the phosphorylation site is within 12 angstrom of the small molecule-binding site, where it would likely alter small molecule binding affinity. We propose a framework for distinguishing between drug-phosphorylation site interactions that are likely to alter the efficacy of drugs versus those that are not. In addition we highlight examples of well-established drug targets, such as estrogen receptor alpha, for which phosphorylation may affect drug affinity and clinical efficacy. Our data suggest that phosphorylation may affect drug binding and efficacy for a significant fraction of drug target proteins. Proteins 2015; 83:25-36. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Zheng, L; Hu, W; Min, Y				Zheng, Le; Hu, Wei; Min, Yong			Raw Wind Data Preprocessing: A Data-Mining Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Data mining; data preprocessing; local outlier factor (LOF); unsupervised learning	POWER; TURBINE	Wind energy integration research generally relies on complex sensors located at remote sites. The procedure for generating high-level synthetic information from databases containing large amounts of low-level data must therefore account for possible sensor failures and imperfect input data. The data input is highly sensitive to data quality. To address this problem, this paper presents an empirical methodology that can efficiently preprocess and filter the raw wind data using only aggregated active power output and the corresponding wind speed values at the wind farm. First, raw wind data properties are analyzed, and all the data are divided into six categories according to their attribute magnitudes from a statistical perspective. Next, the weighted distance, a novel concept of the degree of similarity between the individual objects in the wind database and the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm, is incorporated to compute the outlier factor of every individual object, and this outlier factor is then used to assess which category an object belongs to. Finally, the methodology was tested successfully on the data collected from a large wind farm in northwest China.

This is making the paradigm of health care change and the concept of mHealth or mobile health more relevant, whose main essence is the apps. This new reality makes it possible for doctors who are not specialist to have easy access to all the information generated in different corners of the world, making them potential keepers of that knowledge. However, the new daily information exceeds the limits of the human intellect, making Decision Support Systems (DSS) necessary for helping doctors to diagnose diseases and also help them to decide the attitude that has to be taken towards these diagnoses. These could improve the health care in remote areas and developing countries. All of this is even more important in diseases that are more prevalent in primary care and that directly affect the people's quality of life, this is the case in ophthalmological problems where in first patient care a specialist in ophthalmology is not involved. The goal of this paper is to analyse the state of the art of DSS in Ophthalmology. Many of them focused on diseases affecting the eye's posterior pole. For achieving the main purpose of this research work, a literature review and commercial apps analysis will be done. The used databases and systems will be IEEE Xplore, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and PubMed. The search is limited to articles published from 2000 until now. Later, different Mobile Decision Support System (MDSS) in Ophthalmology will be analyzed in the virtual stores for Android and iOS. 37 articles were selected according their thematic (posterior pole, anterior pole, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), cloud, data mining, algorithms and structures for DSS, and other) from a total of 600 found in the above cited databases. Very few mobile apps were found in the different stores. It can be concluded that almost all existing mobile apps are focused on the eye's posterior pole. Among them, the most intended are for diagnostic of diabetic retinopathy. The primary market niche of the commercial apps is the general physicians.

Currently, there are >100 different known types of cancer and >500 genes involved in cancer. Ongoing research efforts have been focused on cancer etiology and therapy. As a result, there is an exponential growth of cancer-associated data from diverse resources, such as scientific publications, genome-wide association studies, gene expression experiments, gene-gene or protein-protein interaction data, enzymatic assays, epigenomics, immunomics and cytogenetics, stored in relevant repositories. These data are complex and heterogeneous, ranging from unprocessed, unstructured data in the form of raw sequences and polymorphisms to well-annotated, structured data. Consequently, the storage, mining, retrieval and analysis of these data in an efficient and meaningful manner pose a major challenge to biomedical investigators. In the current review, we present the central, publicly accessible databases that contain data pertinent to cancer, the resources available for delivering and analyzing information from these databases, as well as databases dedicated to specific types of cancer. Examples for this wealth of cancer-related information and bioinformatic tools have also been provided.

Project Development Teams: A Novel Mechanism for Accelerating Translational Research	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							SUPPORT	The trend in conducting successful biomedical research is shifting from individual academic labs to coordinated collaborative research teams. Teams of experienced investigators with a wide variety of expertise are now critical for developing and maintaining a successful, productive research program. However, assembling a team whose members have the right expertise requires a great deal of time and many resources. To assist investigators seeking such resources, the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (Indiana CTSI) created the Project Development Teams (PDTs) program to support translational research on and across the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana University, Purdue University, and University of Notre Dame campuses. PDTs are multidisciplinary committees of seasoned researchers who assist investigators, at any stage of research, in transforming ideas/hypotheses into well-designed translational research projects. The teams help investigators capitalize on Indiana CTSI resources by providing investigators with, as needed, mentoring and career development; protocol development; pilot funding; institutional review board, regulatory, and/or nursing support; intellectual property support; access to institutional technology; and assistance with biostatistics, bioethics, recruiting participants, data mining, engaging community health, and collaborating with other investigators. Indiana CTSI leaders have analyzed metrics, collected since the inception of the PDT program in 2008 from both investigators and team members, and found evidence strongly suggesting that the highly responsive teams have become an important one-stop venue for facilitating productive interactions between basic and clinical scientists across four campuses, have aided in advancing the careers of junior faculty, and have helped investigators successfully obtain external funds.

Methods: Reference intervals for eight different analytes and different age and sex groups (a total of 11 separate reference intervals) for tests that are unlikely to be ordered during routine screening of disease-free populations were calculated using the modified algorithm for data mining of test results stored in the laboratory database and compared with published peer-reviewed studies that used direct sampling. The selection of analytes was based on the predefined criteria that include comparability of analytical methods with a statistically significant number of observations. Results: Of the 11 calculated reference intervals, having upper and lower limits for each, 21 of 22 reference interval limits were not statistically different from the reference studies. Conclusions: The presented statistical algorithm is shown to be an accurate and practical tool for reference interval calculations.

It aims to understand and evaluate product development processes indirectly through product data analysis. In this approach, OLAM integrates On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) with data mining, allowing it to support flexible and interactive OLAP operations to find product data patterns in intangible and uncertain product development processes. This integration also allows efficient preparation of product data for various data analysis and data mining processes. In this paper, a product data analysis process and its information system architecture are proposed, and the prototype system is implemented to show the efficiency and feasibility of the approach. In addition, the proposed approach is applied to clarify critical failure factors in product development experiments to show that the proposed approach can help engineers proactively evaluate and manage in-progress product development processes.

These courses embody a confluence of technological and pedagogical mediations yet to be fully explored. This study, applying an instrument of educational and interactive indicators on a MOOC (INdiMOOC-EdI) designed by the authors, seeks to ascertain the pedagogical components of MOOCs delivered in the Spanish language in order to establish which course features are platform dependent. An exploratory sequential mixed methods study was carried out on a total of 117 courses within 10 different platforms via an instrument developed and validated ad hoc. The data obtained is subjected to a content analysis for a qualitative perspective; while a quantitative perspective is obtained through a statistical analysis complemented with classification algorithms typical in data mining. The results suggest that the different platform providers condition the pedagogical design of the MOOC in five key areas: learning, activities and tasks, means and resources, interactivity and assessment. It concludes with a series of descriptive, educational and interactive indicators that can be a pedagogical benchmark for future MOOCs.

By exploiting powerful CP-level information in content distribution, these CP-built CDNs open up a whole new design space and are changing the content delivery landscape. In this paper, we adopt a measurement-based approach to understanding why, how, and how much CP-level intelligences can help content delivery. We first present a measurement study of the CDN built by Tencent, a largest content provider based in China. We observe new characteristics and trends in content delivery which pose great challenges to the conventional content delivery paradigm and motivate the proposal of CPCDN, a CDN powered by CP-aware information. We then reveal the benefits obtained by exploiting two indispensable CP-level intelligences, namely context intelligence and user intelligence, in content delivery. Inspired by the insights learnt from the measurement studies, we systematically explore the design space of CPCDN and present the novel architecture and algorithms to address the new content delivery challenges that have arisen. Our results not only demonstrate the potential of CPCDN in pushing content delivery performance to the next level, but also identify new research problems calling for further investigation.

Heterogeneous data sets can be collectively mined by data fusion. Fusion can focus on a specific target relation and exploit directly associated data together with contextual data and data about system's constraints. In the paper we describe a data fusion approach with penalized matrix tri-factorization (DFMF) that simultaneously factorizes data matrices to reveal hidden associations. The approach can directly consider any data that can be expressed in a matrix, including those from feature-based representations, ontologies, associations and networks. We demonstrate the utility of DFMF for gene function prediction task with eleven different data sources and for prediction of pharmacologic actions by fusing six data sources. Our data fusion algorithm compares favorably to alternative data integration approaches and achieves higher accuracy than can be obtained from any single data source alone.

Data mining is an ideal approach for analyzing the information and exploring the hidden knowledge among the data. The purpose of the data mining scheme is to identify and classify the effects of the relationships existing between properties. The results of the investigation are presented by means of multivariate modeling methods, such as the principal component analysis and the partial least squares regression to discover the implicit, yet meaningful, relationship between the elements of the data set, and to locate correlations between the properties of the materials. In this study, we present a data mining approach to discover such unusual correlations between properties of the elements. When comparing the properties of the transition metals with those of lutetium, our results show that lutetium shares many properties and similarities with the transition metals of the sixth row in the periodic table and can be well described as a transition metal.

A person with MCI has an increased risk of developing AD or another dementia. Thus, it is of medical interest to develop predictive tools to assess this risk. A growing awareness exists that pro-oxidative state and neuro-inflammation are both involved in AD. However, the extent of this relationship is still a matter of debate. Due to the expected non-linear correlations between oxidative and inflammatory markers, traditional statistics is unsuitable to dissect their relationship with the disease. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by central nervous system networks, capable of machine learning and pattern recognition. The aim of this work was to disclose the relationship between immunological and oxidative stress markers in AD and MCI by the application of ANNs. Through a machine learning approach, we were able to construct an algorithm to classify MCI and AD with high accuracy. Such an instrument, requiring a small amount of immunological and oxidative-stress parameters, would be useful in the clinical practice. Moreover, applying an innovative non-linear mathematical technique, a global immune deficit was shown to be associated with cognitive impairment. Surprisingly, both adaptive and innate immunity were peripherally defective in AD and MCI patients. From this study, new pathogenetic aspects of these diseases could emerge.

They are traditionally taken as noises and need to be removed properly. To achieve this, two intuitive and crucial kinds of information-the textual information and the visual information of web pages-is considered in this paper. Accordingly, Text Density and Visual Importance are defined for the Document Object Model (DOM) nodes of a web page. Furthermore, a content extraction method with these measured values is proposed. It is a fast, accurate and general method for extracting content from diverse web pages. And with the employment of DOM nodes, the original structure of the web page can be preserved. Evaluated with the CleanEval benchmark and with randomly selected pages from well-known Web sites, where various web domains and styles are tested, the effect of the method is demonstrated. The average F1-scores with our method were 8.7 % higher than the best scores among several alternative methods.

J	Luengo, J; Herrera, F				Luengo, Julian; Herrera, Francisco			An automatic extraction method of the domains of competence for learning classifiers using data complexity measures	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; Data complexity; Domains of competence; C4.5; Support vector machines; K-nearest neighbor	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFIERS; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK	The constant appearance of algorithms and problems in data mining makes impossible to know in advance whether the model will perform well or poorly until it is applied, which can be costly. It would be useful to have a procedure that indicates, prior to the application of the learning algorithm and without needing a comparison with other methods, whether the outcome will be good or bad using the information available in the data. In this work, we present an automatic extraction method to determine the domains of competence of a classifier using a set of data complexity measures proposed for the task of classification. These domains codify the characteristics of the problems that are suitable or not for it, relating the concepts of data geometrical structures that may be difficult and the final accuracy obtained by any classifier. In order to do so, this proposal uses 12 metrics of data complexity acting over a large benchmark of datasets in order to analyze the behavior patterns of the method, obtaining intervals of data complexity measures with good or bad performance. As a representative for classifiers to analyze the proposal, three classical but different algorithms are used: C4.5, SVM and K-NN. From these intervals, two simple rules that describe the good or bad behaviors of the classifiers mentioned each are obtained, allowing the user to characterize the response quality of the methods from a dataset's complexity. These two rules have been validated using fresh problems, showing that they are general and accurate. Thus, it can be established when the classifier will perform well or poorly prior to its application.

Online apnea-bradycardia detection based on hidden semi-Markov models	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Time series analysis; Hidden semi-Markov models; Data mining; Electrocardiogram; Apnea-bradycardia	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; FALSE ALARMS; INFANTS; HYPOXEMIA; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; CHAINS; WOLF	In this paper, we propose a new online apnea-bradycardia detection scheme that takes into account not only the instantaneous values of time series, but also their temporal evolution. The detector is based on a set of hidden semi-Markov models, representing the temporal evolution of beat-to-beat interval (RR interval) time series. A preprocessing step, including quantization and delayed version of the observation vector, is also proposed to maximize detection performance. This approach is quantitatively evaluated through simulated and real signals, the latter being acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Compared to two conventional detectors used in NICU, our best detector shows an improvement on average of around 15 % in sensitivity and 7 % in specificity. Furthermore, a reduced detection delay of approximately 2 s is also observed with respect to conventional detectors.

J	Mohammad, Y; Nishida, T				Mohammad, Yasser; Nishida, Toyoaki			Shift density estimation based approximately recurring motif discovery	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Motif discovery; HRI	TIME-SERIES; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS	Approximately Recurring Motif (ARM) discovery is the problem of finding unknown patterns that appear frequently in real valued timeseries. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for solving this problem that can achieve performance comparable with the most accurate algorithms with a speed comparable to the fastest ones. The main idea behind the proposed algorithm is to convert the problem of ARM discovery into a density estimation problem in the single dimensionality shift-space (rather than in the original time-series space). This makes the algorithm more robust to short noise bursts that can dramatically affect the performance of most available algorithms. The paper also reports the results of applying the proposed algorithm to synthetic and three real-world datasets in the domains of gesture discovery and motion primitive discovery.

J	Miller, C; Nagy, Z; Schlueter, A				Miller, Clayton; Nagy, Zoltan; Schlueter, Arno			Automated daily pattern filtering of measured building performance data	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building efficiency; Building performance analysis; Knowledge discovery; Clustering; Temporal data mining; Occupancy patterns; Diversity factors	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; FAULT-DETECTION; TIME-SERIES; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; DISCOVERY; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS	The amount of sensor data generated by modern building systems is growing rapidly. Automatically discovering the structure of diurnal patterns in this data supports implementation of building commissioning, fault detection and retrofit analysis techniques. Additionally, these data are crucial to informing design professionals about the efficacy of their assumptions and strategies used in performance prediction simulation models. In this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using k-means clustering. This procedure is designed for application on whole building and sub-system metrics from hierarchical building and energy management systems (BMS/EMS). The process transforms quantitative raw data into qualitative subgroups based on daily performance similarity and visualizes them using expressive techniques. We apply DayFilter on 474 days of example data from an international school campus in a tropical climate and 407 days of data from an office building from a temperate European climate. Discords are filtered resulting in 17 and 22 patterns found. Selected discords are investigated and many correlate with specific failures and energy savings detected by the on-site operations staff. Six and ten motif candidates are detected in the two case studies. These motifs are then further aggregated to five and six performance clusters that reflect the typical operational behavior of those projects. We discuss the influence of the parameter choices and provide initial parameter settings for the DayFilter process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering a set of boolean spatial features, the goal is to find subsets of features frequently located together. It has wide applications in environmental management, public safety, transportation or tourism. These last years, many algorithms have been proposed to extract frequent co-locations. However, most solutions do a "data-centered knowledge discovery" instead of a "expert-centered knowledge discovery". Successfully providing useful and interpretable patterns to experts is still an open problem. In this setting, we propose a domain-driven co-location mining approach that combines constraint-based mining and cartographic visualization. Experts can push new domain constraints into the mining algorithm, resulting in more relevant patterns and more efficient extraction. Then, they can visualize solutions using a new concise and intuitive cartographic visualization of co-locations. Using this original visualization approach, they identify new interesting patterns, and use uninteresting ones to define new constraints and refine their analysis. These proposals have been integrated into a prototype based on PostGIS geographic information system. Experiments have been done using a real geological datasets studying soil erosion, and results have been validated by a domain expert.

Gaining insight into regional coastal changes on La Reunion island through a Bayesian data mining approach	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Shoreline changes; Bayesian networks; Sea-level rise; Vertical ground motions; Coastal databases; La Reunion island	INDIAN-OCEAN; NETWORKS; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; VULNERABILITY; ASSIMILATION; EVOLUTION; PACIFIC; MODELS; IMAGES	Recent works have highlighted the interest in coastal geographical databases - collected for coastal management purposes - for obtaining insight into current shoreline changes. On La Reunion, a tropical volcanic high island located in the Southern Indian Ocean, a dataset is available which describes shoreline changes, the coastal geomorphology and the presence of anthropic structures. This database is first supplemented with information on the exposure of each coastal segment to energetic waves and to estuarine sediment inputs. To incorporate relative sea-level changes along the coast in the database, levelling data are analysed in combination with GPS, satellite altimetry and sea-level reconstructions. Finally, a method based on Bayesian networks is used to assess the probabilistic relationships between the variables in the database. The results highlight the high degree of dependency between variables: a retrospective model is able to reproduce 81% of the observations of shoreline mobility. Importantly, we report coastal ground motions for La Reunion island of the order of 1 to 2 mm/year along the coast. However, the resulting differing rates of relative sea-level rise do not significantly impact on shoreline changes. Instead, the results suggest a major control of geological processes and local coastal geomorphic settings on shoreline evolution. While any exploration of a coastal database needs to be complemented with human reasoning to interpret the results in terms of physical processes, this study highlights the significance of revisiting other datasets to gain insight into coastal processes and factors causing shoreline changes, including sea-level changes.

Telehealth is now being deployed widely in both rural and urban settings, and in this paper, we discuss the contribution made by biomedical instrumentation, user interfaces, and automated risk stratification algorithms in developing a clinical diagnostic quality longitudinal health record at home. We identify technical challenges in the acquisition of high-quality biometric signals from unsupervised patients at home, identify new technical solutions and user interfaces, and propose new measurement modalities and signal processing techniques for increasing the quality and value of vital signs monitoring at home. We also discuss use of vital signs data for the automated risk stratification of patients, so that clinical resources can be targeted to those most at risk of unscheduled admission to hospital. New research is also proposed to integrate primary care, hospital, personal genomic, and telehealth electronic health records, and apply predictive analytics and data mining for enhancing clinical decision support.

We propose a two-step analysis framework that focuses on positive and negative sentiment, as well as the side effects of treatment, in users' forum posts, and identifies user communities (modules) and influential users for the purpose of ascertaining user opinion of cancer treatment. We used a self-organizing map to analyze word frequency data derived from users' forum posts. We then introduced a novel network-based approach for modeling users' forum interactions and employed a network partitioning method based on optimizing a stability quality measure. This allowed us to determine consumer opinion and identify influential users within the retrieved modules using information derived from bothword-frequency data and network-based properties. Our approach can expand research into intelligently mining social media data for consumer opinion of various treatments to provide rapid, up-to-date information for the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, and medical staff, on the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of future treatments.

To this goal, we devised a two-step analysis framework. Initial exploratory analysis using self-organizing maps was performed to determine structures based on user opinions among the forum posts. The results were a compilation of user's clusters and their correlated (positive or negative) opinion of the drug. Subsequent modeling using network analysis methods was used to determine influential users among the forum members.

We present the concept of LTV applied to telemarketing for improving the return-on-investment, using a recent (from 2008 to 2013) and real case study of bank campaigns to sell long-term deposits. The goal was to benefit from past contacts history to extract additional knowledge. A total of twelve LTV input variables were tested, under a forward selection method and using a realistic rolling windows scheme, highlighting the validity of five new LTV features. The results achieved by our LTV data-driven approach using neural networks allowed an improvement up to 4 pp in the Lift cumulative curve for targeting the deposit subscribers when compared with a baseline model (with no history data). Explanatory knowledge was also extracted from the proposed model, revealing two highly relevant LTV features, the last result of the previous campaign to sell the same product and the frequency of past client successes. The obtained results are particularly valuable for contact center companies, which can improve predictive performance without even having to ask for more information to the companies they serve.

J	Ju, YH; Sohn, SY				Ju, Yonghan; Sohn, So Young			Identifying patterns in rare earth element patents based on text and data mining	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Rare earth elements; Patent; Text mining; Topic detection; Quadratic assignment procedure (QAP); Patent network analysis; Association rule	TECHNOLOGY	Rare earth elements (REE) are needed to produce many cutting-edge products, and their depletion is a major concern. In this paper, we identify unique characteristics of REE-related patents granted from 1975 to 2013 in five large patent offices around the world. Through topic detection and clustering of patent text, we found that purification processes related to oxides, nitrogen oxide, and exhaust gas were highlighted in the Korean Intellectual Property Office and Japan Patent Office (JPO). Molecular sieve, dispersion, and preparation methods involving yttrium, cerium, methane, zirconium, and ammonia were prominent in the China Patent and Trademark Office (CPTO) in the areas of performing operation and transporting. Quadratic assignment procedure correlation analysis was performed for IPC co-occurrence among REE patents in different offices, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office showed significantly different patterns than the CPTO and JPO. Furthermore, using betweenness centrality as an indicator of technology transition, the manufacture and treatment of nanostructures, nanotechnology for materials and surface science, and electrodes were identified as important REE technologies to be protected in Korea. In Japan, the technological areas identified as important for protection were the apparatuses and processes of manufacturing or assembling devices, compounds of iron, and materials. Our study results offer insights into national strategies for REE-related technologies in each country.

Alper			A polynomial based algorithm for detection of embolism	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Emboli; Polynomial based Classification; Multivariate data partitioning; Approximation; HDMR	DIMENSIONAL MODEL REPRESENTATION; TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER; SIGNAL-DETECTION; HDMR	The Transcranial Doppler ultrasound can be used to detect asymptomatic circulating cerebral emboli. Emboli indicate particles that can plug the arterial system. Asymptomatic emboli signals help to discover critical stroke events by taking the embolus activities into consideration. Cerebral emboli detection is searched deeply in the literature. But none of them proposed a polynomial method to generalize the solution of the emboli detection. High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) philosophy is an effective way of generating an analytical model for a given multivariate data modeling problem, that is, HDMR can be used in constructing a general polynomial model for detecting embolism. In this study, emboli related data set was collected from 35 different patients. HDMR based methods and various data mining techniques were used to detect emboli through that data set. The Euclidean Matrix Based Indexing HDMR method has an important superiority in terms of generating a polynomial model which can then be used in other emboli detection problems without a training process. The method also shows satisfactory results in generalizing the emboli characteristics when compared with the other methods.	[Karahoca, Adem; Tunga, M.

In the first phase, a type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) model of an individual's perception of the terms used in rating user satisfaction is derived through a decomposition-based procedure. The analysis is carried out by using well-established metrics and results from the Social Sciences context. In the second phase, interval T2FS models of online user satisfaction are calculated using a similarity-based data mining procedure. The procedure selects an essential and informative subset of the initial T1FSs that is used to discard the outliers automatically. Resulting interval T2FSs, which are synthesized based on the selected subset of T1FSs only, exhibit reasonable shapes and interpretability.

First, the data mining technology is used to find attributes that are usually subscribed together, e.g. frequent itemset. Then subscriptions and events are installed by frequent itemsets contained in them. If subscriptions and events don't contain any frequent itemset, they are delivered to specified RPs (rendezvous points) for matching. The usage of frequent itemsets provides two advantages to DMPSS. First, it achieves even matching load distribution on RPs. Second, it reduces the event publication cost. The performance of DMPSS is evaluated by simulations. The experimental results show that DMPSS realizes even matching load distribution, and it reduces the overhead for message transmission and latency dramatically.

J	Park, J; Abdel-Aty, M; Lee, J; Lee, C				Park, Juneyoung; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed; Lee, Jaeyoung; Lee, Chris			Developing crash modification functions to assess safety effects of adding bike lanes for urban arterials with different roadway and socio-economic characteristics	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Safety effectiveness; Crash modification factors; Simple and full crash modification functions; Heterogeneous effect; Before-after method; Adding a bike lane	MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES; ACCIDENT MODIFICATION FUNCTIONS; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; INFRASTRUCTURE; INJURIES	Although many researchers have estimated crash modification factors (CMFs) for specific treatments (or countermeasures), there is a lack of studies that explored the heterogeneous effects of roadway characteristics on crash frequency among treated sites. Generally, the CMF estimated by before-after studies represents overall safety effects of the treatment in a fixed value. However, as each treated site has different roadway characteristics, there is a need to assess the variation of CMFs among the treated sites with different roadway characteristics through crash modification functions (CMFunctions). The main objective of this research is to determine relationships between the safety effects of adding a bike lane and the roadway characteristics through (1) evaluation of CMFs for adding a bike lane using observational before-after with empirical Bayes (EB) and cross-sectional methods, and (2) development of simple and full CMFunctions which are describe the CMF in a function of roadway characteristics of the sites. Data was collected for urban arterials in Florida, and the Florida-specific full SPFs were developed. Moreover, socio-economic parameters were collected and included in CMFunctions and SPFs (1) to capture the effects of the variables that represent volume of bicyclists and (2) to identify general relationship between the CMFs and these characteristics. In order to achieve better performance of CMFunctions, data mining techniques were used. The results of both before-after and cross-sectional methods show that adding a bike lane on urban arterials has positive safety effects (i.e., CMF <1) for all crashes and bike crashes. It was found that adding a bike lane is more effective in reducing bike crashes than all crashes. It was also found that the CMFs vary across the sites with different roadway characteristics. In particular, annual average daily traffic (AADT), number of lanes, AADT per lane, median width, bike lane width, and lane width are significant characteristics that affect the variation in safety effects of adding a bike lane. Some socio-economic characteristics such as bike commuter rate and population density also have significant effect on the variation in CMFs. The findings suggest that full CMFunctions showed better model fit than simple CMFuncttions since they account for the heterogeneous effects of multiple roadway and socio-economic characteristics. The proposed CMFunctions provide insights into bike lane design and selection of sites for bike lane installation for reducing crashes. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Elwakil, E; Zayed, T				Elwakil, Emad; Zayed, Tarek			Construction knowledge discovery system using fuzzy approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						simulation; modeling; knowledge discovery systems; data mining; construction processes; fuzzy knowledge base	DATABASES	Most research works in simulating construction operations have predominantly focused on modeling and mistreated data preparation that is paramount for simulation. To prepare data for simulation process, a knowledge discovery system (KDS) is indispensable in extracting hidden knowledge from construction data sets. This knowledge is typically hard to obtain using traditional means, such as statistical analysis. The presented research develops, using fuzzy approach, a KDS to prepare, utilize, analyze, and extract the hidden patterns from construction data to predict work task durations. The KDS depends mainly on finding the relation between quantitative and qualitative variables, which affect the duration of construction operations and work tasks as well as prepare data for simulation modeling. It consists of two stages: data processing and mining. Data processing consists of cleaning, integrating, transforming, and selecting the appropriate knowledge. Data mining consists of selecting the factors that affect a construction operation, generating their fuzzy sets, defining fuzzy rule and models, developing a fuzzy knowledge base, and testing the effectiveness of this knowledge base in predicting work task durations. The developed KDS has been tested using a construction case study in which the results found satisfactory with an average validity percent of 92%. The developed system assists researchers and practitioners in utilizing historical construction data to extract knowledge that could not be obtained by traditional techniques and precisely predicting work task durations.

The algorithm discovers association rules from subscriptions, and then integrates these association rules into the arrived events. These integrated association rules guide the event matching process, which can greatly improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary matching processes. To solve the available problem of integrating the association rules into the ontology-based publish/subscribe system, we also show an approach of transforming the subscriptions into a format that can apply the data mining algorithm and an approach of integrating the association rule into the events. The results show that the algorithm achieves performance improvement of matching efficiency by using comparison.

Molecular profiling and more sophisticated analysis of longitudinal clinical data are refining definitions of human diseases, creating needs and opportunities to re-target or reposition approved drugs for alternative indications. Drug repositioning studies have demonstrated success in complex diseases requiring improved therapeutic interventions as well as orphan diseases without any known treatments. An increasing collection of available computational and experimental methods that leverage molecular and clinical data enable diverse drug repositioning strategies. Integration of translational bioinformatics resources, statistical methods, chemoinformatics tools and experimental techniques (including medicinal chemistry techniques) can enable the rapid application of drug repositioning on an increasingly broad scale. Efficient tools are now available for systematic drug-repositioning methods using large repositories of compounds with biological activities. Medicinal chemists along with other translational researchers can play a key role in various aspects of drug repositioning. In this review article, we briefly summarize the history of drug repositioning, explain concepts behind drug repositioning methods, discuss recent computational and experimental advances and highlight available open access resources for effective drug repositioning investigations. We also discuss recent approaches in utilizing electronic health record for outcome assessment of drug repositioning and future avenues of drug repositioning in the light of targeting disease comorbidities, underserved patient communities, individualized medicine and socioeconomic impact.
