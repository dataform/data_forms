The authors evaluated the real energy consumption of the HMP system tuned for a set of 50 application codes using a data-mining tool for finding code similarities and selecting HMP configurations. The selected HMP system configuration requires a small cache configuration and consumes less energy when compared to a homogeneous system with the same number of cores and only with a very modest increase in execution time.

The paper considers a novel approach to determine virtual subnets that is based on the given matrix of logic connectivity of computers. The paper shows that the problem considered is related to one of the forms of Boolean Matrix Factorization. It formulates the virtual subnet design task and proposes genetic algorithms as a means to solve it. Basic improvements proposed in the paper are using trivial solutions to generate an initial population, taking into account in the fitness function the criterion of minimum number of virtual subnets, and using columns of the connectivity matrix as genes of chromosomes. Experimental results show the proposed genetic algorithm has high effectiveness.

Most recent works concerning unsupervised learning have been focused on clustering, where ACO-based techniques have showed a great potential. At the same time, new clustering techniques that seek the continuity of data, specially focused on spectral-based approaches in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches, have attracted an increasing research interest-an area still under study by ACO clustering techniques. This work presents a hybrid spectral-based ACO clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach combines ACOC with the spectral Laplacian to generate a new search space for the algorithm in order to obtain more promising solutions. The new algorithm, called SACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Spectral Clustering) and with ACOC. The experiments measure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

A variety of methods performing this task have been proposed in the recent literature. Many comparative studies have been carried out in this field. However, the main common feature between these methods is that they are designed manually. In the meanwhile, there have been some successful attempts to automatically design such methods using Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP). In this paper, we propose a different system called Automatic Grammar Genetic Programming (AGGP) that can evolve complete java program codes. These codes represent a rule induction algorithm that uses a grammar evolution technique that governs a Backus Naur Form grammar definition mapping to a program. To perform this task, we will use binary strings as inputs to the mapper along with the Backus Naur Form grammar. Such binary strings represent possible potential solutions resulting from the initialized component and Weka building blocks, this would ease the induction process and makes induced programs short. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method. It is also shown that, compared to some recent and similar manual techniques (Prism, Ripper, Ridor, OneRule) the proposed method outperforms such techniques. A benchmark of well-known data sets is used for the sake of comparison.

It is essential to investigate how other factors besides the Braden scale could enhance the prediction of pressure ulcers. Data mining modeling techniques can be beneficial to conduct this type of analysis. Data mining techniques have been applied extensively in health care, but are not widely used in nursing research. Purpose: To remedy this methodological gap, this paper will review, explain, and compare several data mining models to examine patient level factors associated with pressure ulcers based on a four year study from military hospitals in the United States. Methods: The variables included in the analysis are easily accessible demographic information and medical measurements. Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and multivariate adaptive regression splines were compared based on their performance and interpretability. Results: The random forests model had the highest accuracy (C-statistic) with the following variables, in order of importance, ranked highest in predicting pressure ulcers: days in the hospital, serum albumin, age, blood urea nitrogen, and total Braden score. Conclusion: Data mining, particularly, random forests are useful in predictive modeling. It is important for hospitals and health care systems to use their own data over time for pressure ulcer risk prediction, to develop risk models based upon more than the total Braden score, and specific to their patient population.

However, the high degree of uncertainty of personal trajectory data significantly disturbs the existing route pattern mining approaches, and results in finding only short and incomplete patterns with high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a personal trajectory data mining framework, which includes a group-and-partition trajectory abstraction technique and a frequent pattern mining algorithm called SCPM (Spatial Continuity based Pattern Mining). The group-and-partition technique can discover common sub-segments which are used to abstract the original trajectory data. The SCPM algorithm can efficiently derive longer and more complete route patterns from the abstracted personal trajectory data by tolerating various kinds of disturbances during the trips. Based on the real-world personal trajectory data, we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is more efficient and effective as compared with the existing route pattern mining approaches, and the extracted route patterns can be effectively utilized to predict users' future route.

As such, interest in time series mining in these areas has surged. Clustering of data is performed as a pre-processing or exploratory approach in many data mining tasks. Time series data sets are often very large, thus, data cannot fit in the main memory for clustering. In this case, dimension reduction is a common solution. However, the cost of data reduction is relatively high because of overlooking the data involved in this process, leading to low-quality clustering. In this paper, we propose a new approach for improving the approximate clustering accuracy of dimensionality reduced time series by discretization approach. A new distance measure is initially introduced. Thereafter, the partitional algorithm that best matches the representation method is proposed.

Medical field has large amount of various heterogeneous databases, in which the extraction of hidden useful knowledge for the classification of data is difficult one. In order to cluster and classify the whole databases of medical field, a clustering algorithm MPSO-AFKM (Modified Particle Swarm Optimization based Adaptive Fuzzy K-Modes) is introduced. The proposed method works with the two phases clustering and classification for the effective classification of medical database. The foremost step is the clustering, which utilize the MPSO-AFKM algorithm for obtaining clustered data. In MPSO-AFKM, the categorical data is clustered with Adaptive Fuzzy K-Modes (AFKM) algorithm and the cluster centroids in AFKM is optimized using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm for getting accurate clustering results. The clustered results of data are classified with the aid of Fuzzy Logic system, by which our required information is achieved. Our proposed work is implemented in Matlab platform on Postoperative Patient dataset. And the performance is also evaluated with the evaluation metrics precision, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, which shows that our proposed work performance is better one for the effective medical data clustering. Moreover, the comparison is also made to prove the good performance of our proposed work dyer other existing works.	[Kumar, R.

Analysis of Node Clustering Algorithms on Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Network	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Wireless sensor network; Clustering algorithms; Voronoi diagram; k-means; Fuzzy; Genetic; Data aggregation		One of the most important constraints to be studied in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is its life time. There are two typical data mining processes that support to reduce the energy consumption of WSN is clustering and data summarization. One of the primary goals of node clustering in WSN is in-network preprocessing that aims to obtain qualified information and to limit the energy consumed. A clustering algorithm is composed of three parts first electing cluster head (CH), selection of cluster membership and transferal data from members to CH.CH relays only one of the aggregated or compressed data packet to sink/ base station. In this paper a brief comparative study is made from different research proposals, which suggests different cluster head selection approaches for data aggregation. The algorithms under this study are Voronoi based K-means clustering algorithm, Voronoi Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms and Voronoi based Genetic clustering algorithm. Significant factors for evaluating and comparing these algorithms are defined, analyzed and summarized. It has been assumed that the sensor nodes are randomly distributed and are not mobile, the coordinates of the base station (BS) and the dimensions of the sensor field are known.

Currently, only similar to 10% of human PPIs may be known, and about one-third of human proteins have no known interactions. We introduce Fp Class, a data mining-based method for proteome-wide PPI prediction. At an estimated false discovery rate of 60%, we predicted 250,498 PPIs among 10,531 human proteins; 10,647 PPIs involved 1,089 proteins without known interactions. We experimentally tested 233 high-and medium-confidence predictions and validated 137 interactions, including seven novel putative interactors of the tumor suppressor p53.

A method integrating these two remotely sensed data sets is presented in this study. Snow depth retrieval is performed using microwave brightness temperature at 19 and 37 GHz from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SSMI/S), and visible/infrared surface reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroadiometer (MODIS) products. Microwave brightness temperature provides information about the volume of snow pack, and visible/infrared surface reflectance can indicate snow presence and surface grain size. With these two remote sensing data sets, snow depth is retrieved by a nonlinear data mining technique, the modified sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) regression. The proposed method is tested by using 16,329 records of dry snow measured at 54 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over an area of 1.6 million km(2) from 2000 to 2009. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE and the correlation coefficient of our method are 621 cm, 0.64 and 0.87, respectively. These results are better than those obtained using only brightness temperature data (8.80 cm, 0.90 and 0.73), the traditional spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm (15.07 cm, 1.54 and 0.58), a modified Chang algorithm in WESTDC (9.80 cm, 1.00 and 0.62), or the multilayer perceptron classifier of artificial neural networks (ANN) (9.23 cm, 0.94 and 0.72). The daily snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved by this method has an RMSE of 8.05 mm and a correlation of 0.84, which are better than those of NASA NSIDC (32.87 mm and 0.47) or Globsnow (19.07 mm and 0.59). This study demonstrates that the combination of visible/infrared surface reflectance and microwave brightness temperature via an SVM regression can provide a more accurate retrieval of snow depth.

We demonstrate that competition with the tropical invasive Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus has led to thermal niche displacement in the temperate fish Girardinichthys multiradiatus. Data mining of field records indicates that temperature is the main factor determining which species is dominant, behavioural performance profiles confirmed thermal segregation of these species and laboratory trials demonstrate that G. multiradiatus co-occurring with P. bimaculatus has shifted their thermal optimum to a lower temperature. An exploration of the consequences of these processes under climate change using a thermodynamic model predicts increased frequency of P. bimaculatus with global warming. This reveals a dilemma facing temperate species confronting tropical competitors; the need to adjust their thermal niche to escape competition behind a shrinking cold barrier, a lose-lose situation given current climatic trends.

Thus far, the MGI has resulted in significant progress in computational simulation, modeling, and predictions of catalytic materials. However, prodigious amounts of experimental data are necessary to inform and validate these computational models. High-throughput (HT) methodologies, in which hundreds of materials are rapidly synthesized, processed, and characterized for their figure of merit, represent the key experimental enabler of the theoretical aspects of the MGI. HT methodologies have been used since the early 1980s for identifying novel catalyst formulations and optimizing existing catalysts. Many sophisticated screening and data mining techniques have been developed and since the mid-1990s, this approach has become a widely accepted industrial practice. This article will provide a short history of major developments in HT and will discuss screening approaches combining rapid, qualitative primary screens via thin-film techniques with a series of quantitative screens using plug flow reactors. An illustrative example will be provided of one such study in which novel fuel-flexible sulfur tolerant cracking catalysts were developed. We will then illustrate a path forward that leverages existing HT expertise to validate, provide empirical data to and help guide future theoretical studies.

Processing the raw observation into representative features of the behaviors involves an implicit choice of time-scale and resolution, which critically affect the final output of the mining techniques. The choice is associated with the parameters of data-processing, e.g., smoothing and segmentation, which unintuitively yet strongly influence the intrinsic structure of the numerical data. Data mining techniques generally require users to provide an appropriately processed input, but selecting a resolution is an arduous task that may require an expensive, manual examination of outputs between different settings. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble framework for aggregating outcomes in different settings of scale and resolution parameters for an anomaly detection task. Such a task is difficult for existing ensemble approaches based on weighted combination because: (a) evaluating and weighing an output requires training samples of anomalies which are generally unavailable, (b) the detectability of anomalies can depend on the resolution, i.e., the distinction from normal instances may only be apparent within a small, selective range of parameters. In the proposed framework, predictions based on different resolutions are aggregated to construct meta-feature representations of the behavior instances. The meta-features provide the discriminative information for conducting a clustering-based anomaly detection. In the proposed framework, two interrelated tasks of the behavior analysis: processing the numerical data and discovering anomalous patterns, are addressed jointly, providing an intuitive alternative for a knowledge-intensive parameter selection. We also design an efficient clustering-based anomaly detection algorithm which reduces the computational burden of mining at multiple resolutions. We conduct an empirical study of the proposed framework using real-world trajectory data. It shows that the proposed framework achieves a significant improvement over the conventional ensemble approach.

J	Kosina, P; Gama, J				Kosina, Petr; Gama, Joao			Very fast decision rules for classification in data streams	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Data streams; Classification; Rule learning; Concept drift	DRIFT	Data stream mining is the process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous, rapid data records. Many decision tasks can be formulated as stream mining problems and therefore many new algorithms for data streams are being proposed. Decision rules are one of the most interpretable and flexible models for predictive data mining. Nevertheless, few algorithms have been proposed in the literature to learn rule models for time-changing and high-speed flows of data. In this paper we present the very fast decision rules (VFDR) algorithm and discuss interesting extensions to the base version. All the proposed versions are one-pass and any-time algorithms. They work on-line and learn ordered or unordered rule sets. Algorithms designed to work with data streams should be able to detect changes and quickly adapt the decision model. In order to manage these situations we also present the adaptive extension (AVFDR) to detect changes in the process generating data and adapt the decision model. Detecting local drifts takes advantage of the modularity of the rule sets. In AVFDR, each individual rule monitors the evolution of performance metrics to detect concept drift. AVFDR prunes rules whenever a drift is signaled. This explicit change detection mechanism provides useful information about the dynamics of the process generating data, faster adaptation to changes and generates more compact rule sets. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that algorithms achieve competitive results in comparison to alternative methods and the adaptive methods are able to learn fast and compact rule sets from evolving streams.

Visualizing multi-dimensional decision boundaries in 2D	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Interactive data mining; Knowledge discovery; Decision boundary visualization; Multi-dimensional space; Classification; Visual analytics	INFORMATION VISUALIZATION; VORONOI DIAGRAMS; EXPLORATION; SYSTEM	In many applications experts need to make decisions based on the analysis of multi-dimensional data. Various classification models can support the decision making process. To obtain an intuitive understanding of the classification model, interactive visualizations are essential. We argue that this is best done by a series of interactive 2D scatterplots. In this paper, we define a set of characteristics of the multi-dimensional classification model that have to be visually represented in those scatterplots. Our proposed method presents those characteristics in a uniform manner for both linear and non-linear classification methods. We combine a visualization of a Voronoi based representation of multi-dimensional decision boundaries with visualization of the distances of the data elements to these boundaries. To allow the developer of the model to refine the threshold of the classification model and instantly observe the results, we use interactive decision point selection on a performance curve. Finally, we show how the combination of those techniques allows exploration of multi-dimensional decision boundaries in 2D.	[Migut, M.

This paper presents an improved AMO algorithm (IAMO), which significantly improves the original AMO in solving complex optimization problems. Clustering is a popular data analysis and data mining technique and it is used in many fields. The well-known method in solving clustering problems is k-means clustering algorithm; however, it highly depends on the initial solution and is easy to fall into local optimum. To improve the defects of the k-means method, this paper used IAMO for the clustering problem and experiment on synthetic and real life data sets. The simulation results show that the algorithm has a better performance than that of the k-means, PSO, CPSO, ABC, CABC, and AMO algorithm for solving the clustering problem.

In particular, near infrared spectroscopy is commonly utilized in the food quality control industry to monitor the physical attributes of numerous cereal grains for protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content. IR-based methods require little sample preparation, labor, or technical competence if multivariate data mining techniques are implemented; however, they do require extensive calibration. Economically important crops are infected by fungi that can severely reduce crop yields and quality and, in addition, produce mycotoxins. Owing to the health risks associated with mycotoxins in the food chain, regulatory limits have been set by both national and international institutions for specific mycotoxins and mycotoxin classes. This article discusses the progress and potential of IR-based methods as an alternative to existing chemical methods for the determination of fungal contamination in crops, as well as emerging spectroscopic methods.

Using an International p53 Mutation Database as a Foundation for an Online Laboratory in an Upper Level Undergraduate Biology Class	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						laboratory exercise; cancer; molecular biology; bioinformatics	BIOINFORMATICS; EDUCATION	A two-part laboratory exercise was developed to enhance classroom instruction on the significance of p53 mutations in cancer development. Students were asked to mine key information from an international database of p53 genetic changes related to cancer, the IARC TP53 database. Using this database, students designed several data mining activities to look at the changes in the p53 gene from a number of perspectives, including potential cancer-causing agents leading to particular changes and the prevalence of certain p53 variations in certain cancers. In addition, students gained a global perspective on cancer prevalence in different parts of the world. Students learned how to use the database in the first part of the exercise, and then used that knowledge to search particular cancers and cancer-causing agents of their choosing in the second part of the exercise. Students also connected the information gathered from the p53 exercise to a previous laboratory exercise looking at risk factors for cancer development. The goal of the experience was to increase student knowledge of the link between p53 genetic variation and cancer. Students also were able to walk a similar path through the website as a cancer researcher using the database to enhance bench work-based experiments with complementary large-scale database p53 variation information.

Enhancing the scalability of a genetic algorithm to discover quantitative association rules in large-scale datasets	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; genetic algorithms; multi-objective optimization; quantitative association rules; large scale datasets	LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; STEEL STRUCTURES; COST OPTIMIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; DATABASES; ACCURACY; MODEL	Association rule mining is a well-known methodology to discover significant and apparently hidden relations among attributes in a subspace of instances from datasets. Genetic algorithms have been extensively used to find interesting association rules. However, the rule-matching task of such techniques usually requires high computational and memory requirements. The use of efficient computational techniques has become a task of the utmost importance due to the high volume of generated data nowadays. Hence, this paper aims at improving the scalability of quantitative association rule mining techniques based on genetic algorithms to handle large-scale datasets without quality loss in the results obtained. For this purpose, a new representation of the individuals, new genetic operators and a windowing-based learning scheme are proposed to achieve successfully such challenging task. Specifically, the proposed techniques are integrated into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm named QARGA-M to assess their performances. Both the standard version and the enhanced one of QARGA-M have been tested in several datasets that present different number of attributes and instances. Furthermore, the proposed methodologies have been integrated into other existing techniques based in genetic algorithms to discover quantitative association rules. The comparative analysis performed shows significant improvements of QARGA-M and other existing genetic algorithms in terms of computational costs without losing quality in the results when the proposed techniques are applied.

Computer science and information technology are changing the innovation environment and accumulating Big Data from which a lot of knowledge is to be discovered. However, it is a rather nebulous area and there still remain several challenging problems to integrate the multi-information and rough knowledge effectively to support the process of innovation. Based on the new cross discipline Extenics, the authors have presented a collaborative innovation model in the context of Big Data. The model has two mutual paths, one to transform collected data into an information tree in a uniform basic-element format and another to discover knowledge by data mining, save the rules in a knowledge base, and then explore the innovation paths and solutions by a formularized model based on Extenics. Finally, all possible solutions are scored and selected by 3D-dependent function. The model which integrates different departments to put forward the innovation solutions is proved valuable for a user of the Big Data by a practical innovation case in management.

A successful business needs accurate sales forecasting to understand the market and sales trends. This paper presents a novel sales forecasting model by integrating support vector regression (SVR) and bat algorithm (BA). Since the accuracy of SVR forecasting mainly depends on SVR parameters, we use BA for tuning these parameters because Bat is a newly introduced algorithm and has many parameters. In order to find the best set of BA parameters Taguchi method was utilized. We validated our model on four known UCI datasets. Then we applied our model in printed circuit board (PCB) sales forecasting case study. We compared the accuracy of the proposed model with Genetic algorithm (GA)-SVR, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-SVR, and classic-SVR. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the others. To ensure the robustness of our proposed model, sensitivity analysis was also done using our model to find out the effects of dependent variables values on sales time series.

In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for detecting and trending events from tweet clusters that are discovered by using locality sensitive hashing (ISH) technique. Key challenges include: (1) construction of dictionary using incremental term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) in high-dimensional data to create tweet feature vector, (2) leveraging LSH to find truly interesting events, (3) trending the behavior of event based on time, geo-locations and cluster size, and (4) speed-up the cluster-discovery process while retaining the cluster quality. Experiments are conducted for a specific event and the clusters discovered using LSH and K-means are compared with group average agglomerative clustering technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kalanat, N; Shamsinejadbabaki, P; Saraee, M				Kalanat, Nasrin; Shamsinejadbabaki, Pirooz; Saraee, Mohamad			A fuzzy method for discovering cost-effective actions from data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Actionable knowledge discovery; fuzzy action mining; fuzzy decision tree; cost-effective action	ACTION RULES DISCOVERY; DECISION TREES; SYSTEM DEAR2; INDUCTION; KNOWLEDGE	Data mining techniques are often confined to the delivery of frequent patterns and stop short of suggesting how to act on these patterns for business decision-making. They require human experts to post-process the discovered patterns manually. Therefore a significant need exists for techniques and tools with the ability to assist users in analyzing a large number of patterns to find usable knowledge. Action mining is one of these techniques which intelligently and automatically suggests some changes in the state of an object with the aim of gaining some profit in the corresponding domain. Up to now little research has been done in this field; in all cases continuous-valued data is handled by discretizing the associated attributes in advance or during the learning process. One inherent disadvantage in these methods is that using this sharp behavior can result in missing the optimal action. To overcome this problem this paper presents a method based on fuzzy set theory. In this paper, we concentrate on the fuzzy set based approach for the enhancement of Yang's method and present an algorithm that suggests actions which will decrease the degree to which a certain object belongs to an undesired status and increase the degree to which it belongs to a desired one. Our algorithm takes into account the fuzzy cost of actions, and further, it attempts to maximize the fuzzy net profit. The contribution of the work is in taking the output from fuzzy decision trees, and producing novel, actionable knowledge through automatic fuzzy post-processing. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with Yang's method using several real-life datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms Yang's method not only in finding more actions but also in finding actions with more fuzzy net profit.

A user provides the agent with keywords and assigns a threshold value for each given keyword, the agent in turn attempts to find papers that match the keywords within a defined threshold. To achieve context recognition, the algorithm mines the keywords and identifies the potential context from analysing a paper's abstract. The mining process entails data cleaning, formatting, filtering, and identifying the candidate keywords. Subsequently, based on the strength of each keyword and the threshold value, the algorithm facilitates the identification of the paper's potential context.

Many researchers have been proposed the different algorithms to find the useful patterns but one of the most important drawbacks they have found that data mining techniques works for single data table. This technique is known as traditional data mining technique. In this era almost all data available in the form of relational database which have multiple tables and their relationships. The new data mining technique has emerged as an alternative for describing structured data such as relational data base, since they allow applying data mining in multiple tables directly, which is known as Multi Relational data mining. To avoid the more number joining operations as well as the semantic losses the researchers bound to use Multi Relational Data Mining approaches. In this paper MRDM focuses multi relational association rule, Multi relational decision tree construction, Inductive logic program (ILP) as well three statistical approaches. We emphasize each MR-Classification approach as well as their characteristics, comparisons as per the statistical values and finally found the most research challenging problems in MRDM.

The data-set for the disease is retrieved from UCI repository. A relative study on feature relevance analysis and the accuracy using different classification methods was carried out on Parkinson data-set. Sieve multigram data and Survey graph provide the statistical analysis on the voice data so that the healthy and Parkinson patients would be correctly classified. KStar and NNge present good accuracy based classification methods. Sieve multigram shows the edges between the nodes such as Fhi, Flo, Jitter, JitterAb, RAP and PPQ. KStar and NNge have connections with Shimmer and ShimmerDB. ADTree shows 21 leaves with 31 leaves and SimpleCART shows 13 leaves and 7 leaves. Most of the clusters vary with DBScan and SimpleKMeans with 25% and 38% towards Parkinson disease.	[Sriram, Tarigoppula V.

These databases has large number of itemsets that can arrive frequently and sequentially, it can also predict the users behaviors. The evaluation of user behavior is done by using Sequential pattern mining where the frequent patterns extracted with several limitations. Even the previous sequential pattern techniques used some limitations to extract those frequent patterns but these techniques does not generated the more reliable patterns. Thus, it is very complex to the decision makers for evaluation of user behavior. In this paper, to solve this problem a technique called hybrid pattern is used which has both time based limitation and space limitation and it is used to extract more feasible pattern from sequential database. Initially, the space limitation is applied to break the sequential database using the maximum and minimum threshold values. To this end, the time based limitation is applied to extract more feasible patterns where a bury-time arrival rate is computed to extract the reliable patterns.

Defects are detected and classified based on their severity, this can be automated in order to reduce the development time and cost. Nowadays to extract useful knowledge from large software repositories engineers and researchers are using data mining techniques. In this paper, software defect detection and classification method is proposed and data mining techniques are integrated to identify, classify the defects from large software repository. Based on defects severity proposed method discussed in this paper focuses on three layers: core, abstraction and application layer. The designed method is evaluated using the parameters precision and recall.	[Prakash, B. V.

An important application area in this perspective where there has been a lot of research is Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). ITS aid the process of learning and evaluation of attainments without human intervention. However ITS are unable to pin point the exact area in a lesson plan where the student is deficient in. In this context, several researchers have used concept maps to perform this identification. However it is time consuming for the educators to construct a concept map of learning manually. Several data mining algorithms have thus been used by the researchers to generate association rules which are used for automated concept map construction. This study proposes automated construction of concept maps using Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm. The proposed approach was tested with a set of students enrolled in an introductory Java course in some undergraduate colleges in Kolkata and was found to diagnose their learning problems satisfactorily.

It is used in several areas. In this paper we are focusing on finding relevant patterns from Positive and Negative Rules. For this we have applied Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique on the positive and negative rules. Our algorithm has achieved better global optimum value and chances of finding are improved. So the chances of Positive or relevant rules are more in comparison to the traditional technique. We are also applying the optimization to the negative rules so that there are equal chances for achieving the global optimum. But the negative rules are not qualifying the global optimum value and hence the relevant rules find by our algorithm are verified.

There are often long delays between when a drug is approved and when serious ADEs are identified. Recent and ongoing advances in drug safety surveillance include the establishment of government-sponsored networks of population databases, the use of data mining approaches, and the formal integration of diverse sources of drug safety information. These advances promise to reduce delays in identifying drug-related risks and in providing reassurance about the absence of such risks.

It has a declining population trend due to anthropogenic pressures. Human-driven climate change is expected to have substantial impacts. However, quantitative and transparent information on the ecological niche (potential as well as realized) of this species across the vast and complex eight nations of the HKH region is lacking. Such baseline information is not only crucial for identifying new populations but also for restoring locally-extinct populations, for understanding its bio-geographical evolution, as well as for prioritizing regions and an efficient management. First we compiled, and made publicly available through an institutional repository (dSPACE), the best known 'presence only' red panda dataset with ISO compliant metadata. This was done through the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD.org) data-platform to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org). We used data mining and machine learning algorithms such as high-performance commercial Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, TreeNet, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines implementations. We averaged all these Geographic Information System (GIS) models for the first produced ensemble model for this species in the HKH region. Our predictive model is the first of its kind and allows to assess the red panda distribution based on empirical open access data, latest methods and the major signals and drivers of the ecological niche. It allows to assess and fine-tune earlier habitat area estimates. Our models promote 'best professional practices'. It can readily be used by the red panda Recovery Team, the red panda Action Plan, etc. because they are robust, transparent, publicly available, fit for use, and have a good accuracy, as judged by several independent assessment metrics (Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC-AUC) curves, expert opinion, assessed by known absence regions, 95% confidence intervals and new field data).

However, this topic is essential for a deeper study from human dynamics and social networks aspects. In this paper, we examine the location history data and social networks data of 712 email users and 399 offline events users from a map-editing based social network website. Based on these data, we expand all our experiment both from individual aspect and community aspect. We find that the physical distance is still the most influential factor to social ties among the nine representative human mobility features extracted from our GPS trajectory dataset, although Internet revolution has made long-distance communication dramatically faster, easier and cheaper than ever before, and in turn, partly expand the physical scope of social networks. Furthermore, we find that to a certain extent, the proximity of South North direction is more influential than East West direction to social ties. To the our best of our knowledge, this difference between South North and East West is the first time to be raised and quantitatively supported by a large dataset. We believe our findings on the interplay of human mobility and social ties offer a new perspective to this field of study.

The main estimating elements are concrete and formwork that can be considered in a quantity takeoff, whereas the quantity prediction element is the reinforcing bars in the design development stage. This study proposes a cost estimation system that applies automatic quantity takeoff and quantity prediction with parameters. Firstly, the logic of a quantity takeoff calculates the quantity of formwork with the object information. The Standard Method of Measurement (SMM) automatically estimates the quantity of formwork upon receiving physical shape information from the 3D-object. Secondly, the logic of quantity prediction estimates the quantity of reinforcing bars with data mining tools such as the Decision Tree Model (DTM) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR). To predict the quantity of reinforcing bars, Information Gains (IG) of design attributes are evaluated, and then the valid attributes are selected as the parameters. The Parameters can statistically classify the quantity of reinforcing bars by generating decision tree nodes.

The interesting aspect of the methodology is that it is based only on the "in situ" data of meteorological parameters. Data mining technique is used. The weather patterns of hot day and cold day for April and May months during summer and January, February and March months during winter respectively have also been extracted using the same method. The study shows that the proposed data mining model can predict the occurrence of rainfall, hot day during summer and cold day during winter with the help of local weather parameters.

Application to Investigate the Molecular Events in the Differentiation of B Cells into Plasma Cells	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENERATION	DNA microarrays have considerably helped to improve the understanding of biological processes and diseases. Large amounts of publicly available microarray data are accumulating, but are poorly exploited due to a lack of easy-to-use bioinformatics resources. The aim of this study is to build a free and convenient data-mining web site (www.genomicscape.com). GenomicScape allows mining dataset from various microarray platforms, identifying genes differentially expressed between populations, clustering populations, visualizing expression profiles of large sets of genes, and exporting results and figures. We show how easily GenomicScape makes it possible to construct a molecular atlas of the B cell differentiation using publicly available transcriptome data of naive B cells, centroblasts, centrocytes, memory B cells, preplasmablasts, plasmablasts, early plasma cells and bone marrow plasma cells. Genes overexpressed in each population and the pathways encoded by these genes are provided as well as how the populations cluster together. All the analyses, tables and figures can be easily done and exported using GenomicScape and this B cell to plasma cell atlas is freely available online. Beyond this B cell to plasma cell atlas, the molecular characteristics of any biological process can be easily and freely investigated by uploading the corresponding transcriptome files into GenomicScape.

J	Apgar, D				Apgar, David			The False Promise of Big Data: Can Data Mining Replace Hypothesis-Driven Learning in the Identification of Predictive Performance Metrics?	SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						predictive performance metrics; complexity; information content; hypothesis-driven learning; data mining		This paper argues US manufacturers still fail to identify metrics that predict performance results despite two decades of intensive investment in data-mining applications because indicators with the power to predict complex results must have high information content as well as a high impact on those results. But data mining cannot substitute for experimental hypothesis testing in the search for predictive metrics with high information contentnot even in the aggregatebecause the low-information metrics it provides require improbably complex theories to explain complex results. So theories should always be simple but predictive factors may need to be complex. This means the widespread belief that data mining can help managers find prescriptions for success is a fantasy. Instead of trying to substitute data mining for experimental hypothesis testing, managers confronted with complex results should lay out specific strategies, test them, adapt themand repeat the process.

J	Sesmero, MP; Ledezma, AI; Sanchis, A				Paz Sesmero, M.; Ledezma, Agapito I.; Sanchis, Araceli			Generating ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers using Stacked Generalization	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review							COMBINING CLASSIFIERS; FEATURE-SELECTION; DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; ACCURACY	Over the last two decades, the machine learning and related communities have conducted numerous studies to improve the performance of a single classifier by combining several classifiers generated from one or more learning algorithms. Bagging and Boosting are the most representative examples of algorithms for generating homogeneous ensembles of classifiers. However, Stacking has become a commonly used technique for generating ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers since Wolpert presented his study entitled Stacked Generalization in 1992. Studies that have addressed the Stacking issue demonstrated that when selecting base learning algorithms for generating classifiers that are members of the ensemble, their learning parameters and the learning algorithm for generating the meta-classifier were critical issues. Most studies on this topic manually select the appropriate combination of base learning algorithms and their learning parameters. However, some other methods use automatic methods to determine good Stacking configurations instead of starting from these strong initial assumptions. In this paper, we describe Stacking and its variants and present several examples of application domains.

Wavelet analysis of CME, X-ray flare, and sunspot series	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: activity; methods: data analysis	CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; SOLAR-CYCLE; LASCO; PERIODICITIES; ENTROPY; CATALOG; MAXIMUM; PERIOD	Context. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares are the most energetic transient phenomena taking place at the Sun. Together they are principally responsible for disturbances in outer geospace. Coronal mass ejections and solar flares are believed to be correlated with the solar cycle, which is mainly characterized by sunspot numbers. Aims. Here, we search for pattern identification in CMEs, X-ray solar flares, and sunspot number time series using a new data mining process and a quantitative procedure to correlate these series. Methods. This new process consists of the combination of a decomposition method with the wavelet transform technique applied to the series ranging from 2000 until 2012. A simple moving average is used for the time-series decomposition as a high-pass filter. A continuous wavelet transform is applied to the series in sequence, which permits us to uncover signals previously masked by the original time series. We made use of the wavelet coherence to find some correlation between the data. Results. The results have shown the existence of periodic and intermittent signals in the CMEs, flares, and sunspot time series. For the CME and flare series, few and relatively short time intervals without any signal were observed. Signals with an intermittent character take place during some epochs of the maximum and descending phases of the solar cycle 23 and rising phase of solar cycle 24. A comparison among X-ray flares, sunspots, and CME time series shows a stronger relation between flare and CMEs, although during some short intervals (four-eight months) and in a relatively narrow band. Yet, in contrast we have obtained a fainter or even absent relation between the X-ray flares and sunspot number series as well as between the CMEs and sunspot number series.	[Guedes, M. R.

J	Maji, P; Garai, P				Maji, Pradipta; Garai, Partha			Simultaneous Feature Selection and Extraction Using Feature Significance	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Pattern recognition; data mining; feature selection; feature extraction; classification	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CRITERIA	Dimensionality reduction of a data set by selecting or extracting relevant and nonredundant features is an essential preprocessing step used for pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning, and multimedia indexing. Among the large amount of features present in real life data sets, only a small fraction of them is effective to represent the data set accurately. Prior to analysis of the data set, preprocessing the data to obtain a smaller set of representative features and retaining the optimal salient characteristics of the data not only decrease the processing time but also lead to more compactness of the models learned and better generalization. In this regard, a novel dimensionality reduction method is presented here that simultaneously selects and extracts features using the concept of feature significance. The method is based on maximizing both relevance and significance of the reduced feature set, whereby redundancy therein is removed. The method is generic in nature in the sense that both supervised and unsupervised feature evaluation indices can be used for simultaneously feature selection and extraction. The effectiveness of the proposed method, along with a comparison with existing feature selection and extraction methods, is demonstrated on a set of real life data sets.

The very low therapeutic efficacy of the existing conventional drugs with poor outcome may be, in part, due to uncertainty of the mechanism involved that clearly explains the existing comorbidity. The main purpose of this review was to address the sophisticated mechanisms of this comorbidity with a view of developing potential novel targets with higher efficacy and specificity. Data were collected from database searches including PubMed, references from relevant English language research/review articles and other official publications. Articles from 1990 to 2013 were included, and a broad search term criteria were followed for data mining so that relevant information was not missed out. Some of the search terms used included; diabetes-induced depression, diabetes and serotonin, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and diabetes and glucocorticoids in diabetes. Neuropathologically, depletion of brain monoaminergic activity specifically the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) system, due to chronically persisting diabetic state may lead to the mood and behavioral complications that further add on worsening the quality life years. The 5-HT system through multifunctional tasks regulates neurogenesis and plasticity and by complex receptor mechanism controls the emotional and behavioral activity. Persisting hyperglycemia leads to impaired neurogenesis, decreased synaptic plasticity, undesired neuro-anatomical alterations, neurochemical deficits, and reduced neurotransmitter activity. The neurotrophic factors and secondary messenger functions affected at molecular and genetic levels indicate the impact of diabetes-mediated dysregulation on neuronal circuits. HPA activity, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and insulin signaling controls were also found to be hampered, interlinked to 5-HT system following diabetic progression.

J	Chongwatpol, J				Chongwatpol, Jongsawas			Prognostic analysis of defects in manufacturing	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Manufacturing; Analytics; Defects; Data mining	DATA MINING APPROACH; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; YIELD; ALGORITHM	Purpose-Since works-in-process (WIPs) are highly vulnerable to defects because of the variety and complexity of manufacturing processes, the purpose of this paper is to describe how to utilize existing analytics techniques to reduce defects, improve production processes, and reduce the cost of operations. Design/methodology/approach-Three alternatives for diagnosing causes of defects and variations in the production process are presented in order to answer the following research question: "What are the most important factors to be included in prognostic analysis to prevent defects?" Findings-The key findings for the proposed alternatives help explain the characteristics of defects that have a great impact on manufacturing yield and the quality of products. Consequently, any corrective action and preventive maintenance addressing the common causes of defects and variations in the process can be regularly evaluated and monitored. Research limitations/implications-Although the focus of this study is on improving shop-floor operations by reducing defects, further experimentation with business analytics in other areas such as machine utilization and maintenance, process control, and safety evaluation remains to be done. Practical implications-This study has been validated with several scenarios in a manufacturing company, and the results demonstrate the practical validity of the approach, which is equally applicable to other manufacturing sub-sectors. Originality/value-This study is different from the others by providing alternatives for diagnosing the root causes of defects. Control charts, costs of defects, and clustering-based defect prediction scores are utilized to reduce defects. Additionally, the key contribution of this study is to demonstrate different methods for understanding WIP behaviors and identifying any irregularities in the production process.

Several HRV patterns, based on 68 linear and non-linear HRV measures, were analyzed in relation to falls using advanced statistical and data mining methods. The results demonstrated that there is a significant association between a depressed HRV and the risk of falling, suggesting that a depressed HRV could be a new independent risk factor for falls with an odds ratio of 5.12 (CI 95% 1.42-18.41; p<0.01).

Although recent technological advancements have led to much more reliable and safer Medical Devices (MDs), potential risks of failure and the associated adverse incidents cannot be ignored. To create a safer environment for the patient in terms of technology, it is necessary to provide rapid and accurate information on adverse events, in order to avoid their repetition. The traditional approach of MD Vigilance based only on official user reports of adverse incidents has been proven inadequate today. A modern approach, also used in this work, to the problem is based on the introduction of additional means, such as data mining, extraction, standardization and codification of the information, from different direct and indirect sources worldwide, and its systematic classification and archiving in dedicated databases. The aim is to timely extract information on potentially hazardous MDs and to make it available where appropriate.

UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS fingerprinting was coupled to a data mining method to more efficiently detect ion signals from accurate mass data. Ermiao Wan (EW) is a combination formula of Cortex Phellodendri Chinensis and Rhizoma Atractylodis that is commonly used to treat gout and hyperuricemia, as described in the State Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. However, the chemical constituents of EW remain unclear to date. In the present study, the multiple compounds in EW were extracted and simultaneously determined under optimized conditions. A Waters UPLC BEH C-18 column was used to separate the target analytes, followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection using an electro-spray ionization source in positive and negative mode. As a result, a total of 100 compounds (45 ions in positive mode, 55 ions in negative mode) were detected. Among them, 93 components were tentatively identified by analysing the retention times and subsequent mass spectrometry fragment ions. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed the complexity of the chemical composition of this formula. The integration of the multivariate data mining (MMA) with UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was demonstrated to be a valuable strategy for the rapid screening and identification of major EW constituents.

J	Lei, NR; Moon, SK				Lei, Ningrong; Moon, Seung Ki			A Decision Support System for market-driven product positioning and design	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision Support System; Data mining; Market segmentation; Product positioning; Product design; AdaBoost	FAMILY DESIGN; VALIDATION	This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an,intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on data for seven pollutants in 29 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2010, we conducted statistical tests on the coefficients of the critical variables (polynomial income-related terms) by following the logic of a "General Sensitivity Test," more often known under the name of "Extreme Bound Analysis (EBA)," which was initially proposed by Learner (1978). We tested a set of models (6144) and estimation methods (23) using a bootstrap approach in which each model is estimated 1001 times (1000 bootstrapped database + one original database). Based on the 6144 (*) 23 (*) 1001 regression results, we construct distributions for the coefficients of the income-related terms and calculate the cumulative probabilities for the single coefficients with the expected signs and the regressions that obtain the "accepted" forms of the EKC (inverted-U or N forms). Our test reveals that the EKC hypothesis cannot be considered valid for any of the seven emission indicators because the probability of obtaining a negative coefficient for the quadratic income terms and the probability of finding an inverted-U-form relationship between income and pollution are all lower than the 95% critical level. Without reaching the 95% statistical significance level for emissions such as CO2 and industrial gas, our results seem to more often reveal a positive linear relationship with income.

However, most distributed graph-parallel systems are oblivious to the unique characteristics in such graphs and existing online graph partitioning algorithms usually cause excessive replication of vertices as well as significant pressure on network communication. This article identifies the challenges and opportunities of partitioning bipartite graphs for distributed MLDM processing and proposes BiGraph, a set of bipartite-oriented graph partitioning algorithms. BiGraph leverages observations such as the skewed distribution of vertices, discriminated computation load and imbalanced data sizes between the two subsets of vertices to derive a set of optimal graph partitioning algorithms that result in minimal vertex replication and network communication. BiGraph has been implemented on Power Graph and is shown to have a performance boost up to 17.75X (from 1.16X) for four typical MLDM algorithms, due to reducing up to 80% vertex replication, and up to 96% network traffic.

This data provide a wealth of information about user behaviours and their potential is increasing, as it becomes ever-more common for images to be associated with location information in the form of geo-tags. Recently, there is an increasing tendency to adopt the information from these geo-tagged photos for learning to recommend tourist locations. In this paper, we aim to propose a system to recommend interesting tourist locations and interesting tourist travel sequences (i.e., sequence of tourist locations) from a collection of geotagged photos. Proposed system is capable of understanding context (i.e., time, date, and weather), as well as taking into account the collective wisdom of people, to make tourist recommendations. We illustrate our technique on a sample of public Flickr data set. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate better recommendations as compared to other state-of-the-art landmark based recommendation methods.

The study compared drug safety signals found in the EU-ADR and SRS databases. The potential for signal detection in the EU-ADR system was found to be dependent on frequency of the event and utilization of drugs in the general population. The EU-ADR system may have a greater potential for detecting signals for events occurring at higher frequency in general population and those that are commonly not considered as potentially a drug-induced event. Factors influencing various differences between the datasets are discussed along with potential limitations and applications to pharmacovigilance practice.

The review provides research and industry contexts for papers in this volume only. A discussion of global context and frameworks emphasizes the value yet to be captured from compare and contrast studies. Multidisciplinary efforts highlight the importance of greater integration of sedimentology, diagenesis and structural geology. Developments in analytical and experimental methods, stimulated by advances in the materials sciences, support new insights into fundamental (pore-scale) processes in carbonate rocks. Subsurface imaging methods relevant to the delineation of heterogeneities in carbonates highlight techniques that serve to decrease the gap between seismically resolvable features and well-scale measurements. Methods to fuse geological information across scales are advancing through multiscale integration and proxies. A surge in computational power over the last two decades has been accompanied by developments in computational methods and algorithms. Developments related to visualization and data interaction support stronger geoscience-engineering collaborations. High-resolution and real-time monitoring of the subsurface are driving novel sensing capabilities and growing interest in data mining and analytics. Together, these offer an exciting opportunity to learn more about the fundamental fluid-flow processes in carbonate reservoirs at the interwell scale.

However, existing erasable pattern mining approaches utilize only profit information for each product, but do not consider distinct weights of items organizing the products. In addition, previous algorithms spend much time and space mining erasable patterns due to their inefficient pattern mining methods. In a real-life environment, considering weights of items in each product can be more important compared to calculating product profits only. For this reason, we propose a novel algorithm for mining weighted erasable patterns by considering the distinct weight of each item. Moreover, we discuss both discovering weighted erasable patterns and minimizing the resource availability of erasable pattern mining processes utilizing weight conditions. Especially, our approach has advantages for time and space resource consumption compared to existing approaches because our algorithm uses a pattern pruning method and stores item information included in product databases by using both compact tree and hash list structures. We present performance evaluation utilizing both real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.

The broad purpose of the paper was to investigate the level of professionalism in librarianship and to ascertain the current status, trends and opportunities within the profession among academic librarians in Nigeria. Five specific research questions were formulated which are: to examine how librarians value librarianship as a profession, to elicit the efforts made by librarians with regards to professional development, to ascertain methods of acquiring current competencies within the profession, to investigate the role of professional bodies in promoting professionalism and excellence within the library and information science (LIS) profession and to proffer strategies to enhance professionalism and excellence among librarians in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive survey design was adopted in the study across both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The area of the study was the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State and the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka Anambra State. Population of the study comprised a total of 63 librarians in the two universities. All librarians were sampled because of the small sample size. The instrument for data collection was oral interview and questionnaire which contained 53 items derived from the research questions and built on a four-point scale of Strongly Agree (SA), Agree, (A) Disagree (D) and Strongly Disagree (SD). The criterion mean was 2.50. Therefore, any calculated mean below 2.50 was adjudged a negative score, while any mean from 2.50 and above was regarded as a positive score. Findings - The study revealed the challenges facing professionalism and excellence within the LIS field as lack of funding for professional development, lack of sponsorship to workshops and conferences, lack of uninterruptible internet facility and a dearth of professional mentors in the South East zone. Other problems gathered from a scheduled interview with some senior professionals in the institutions revealed that most librarians are still facing the challenge of imbibing and utilizing emerging skills in the LIS professions such as digital archiving and data mining skills for their day-to-day activities. Originality/value - Recommendations arising from the study were proffered such as the creation of staff development programmes by management; collaboration and partnership by libraries within the zone; acquisition of training through workshops and conferences irrespective of sponsorship by the institutions; and teaming of academic librarians to enhance their visibility and publication output. International staff exchanges and opportunities for sabbatical leave, which hitherto was not common in the South East Zone, were recommended. Among other recommendations also were building of consortia with libraries in the country; LIS professional bodies helping to create visibility and prestige of the LIS profession; and, finally, to scale up the image of the profession the marketing of library products through profiling of patrons and furnishing them with required information has not only become necessary but critical.

Evaluation of Classifiers Based on Decision Tree for Learning Medical Claim Process	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Data Mining; KDD; Classification; Health Insurance Company	AGREEMENT	Brazil has one of the largest private healthcare markets in the world. However, it appears that many medical procedures are being carried out without need, generating unnecessary costs on businesses and making the service offered more expensive. The medical claim process is a control mechanism used by health insurance companies to minimize the waste of resources through blockage of procedures that were requested wrongly. However, in order to realize an efficient medical claim process it needs a medical reviewer 24 hours a day and this generates a high cost. In this work, we followed the initial stages of the process of Knowledge Discovery Database in order to improve the quality of the data of a health insurance company. Then, we compared classification techniques based in Decision Tree in order to learn the medical reviewer behavior professionals who assess if the medical requests should or not should be authorized. For the generation of knowledge, we used a database from a nonprofitable health insurance company containing records collected since the year 2007. Promising experimental results are present.

J	Feng, F; Pedrycz, W				Feng, Feng; Pedrycz, Witold			On Scalar Products and Decomposition Theorems of Fuzzy Soft Sets	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Soft sets; fuzzy sets; fuzzy soft sets; level soft sets; scalar products; decomposition theorems	DECISION-MAKING; BCK/BCI-ALGEBRAS; ROUGH SETS	Fuzzy soft sets realize a hybrid soft computing model in which the methods of gradualness and parametrization for dealing with uncertainty are combined effectively. Up to now, fuzzy soft sets have shown to be useful in various fields such as algebra, logic, data mining, supply chains risk management, forecasting, prediction and decision making under uncertainty. Also it is well-known that the level set approach and decomposition theorems play an important role in investigating fuzzy concepts or structures. Thus decomposition of fuzzy soft sets is a meaningful research topic from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. Nevertheless, so far as we know very few works contribute to this important issue. The present study endeavors to fill this blank in the theory of fuzzy soft sets. It offers a systematic investigation of scalar products of fuzzy soft sets. Particularly it is shown that scalar product operations can be regarded as semimodule actions and algebraic structures like ordered idempotent semimodules of fuzzy soft sets over ordered semirings can be constructed. Also the collection of all t-level soft sets of a fuzzy soft set can form a distributive lattice under soft union and intersection operations.

Indeed, over the course of the last 2 years, the genome sequences of several commercially important cereals, notably barley and bread wheat, have become available, as well as those of related wild species. While still incomplete, comparison with other, more completely assembled species suggests that coverage of genic regions is likely to be high. Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org) is an integrative resource organizing, analyzing and visualizing genome-scale information for important crop and model plants. Available data include reference genome sequence, variant loci, gene models and functional annotation. For variant loci, individual and population genotypes, linkage information and, where available, phenotypic information are shown. Comparative analyses are performed on DNA and protein sequence alignments. The resulting genome alignments and gene trees, representing the implied evolutionary history of the gene family, are made available for visualization and analysis. Driven by the case of bread wheat, specific extensions to the analysis pipelines and web interface have recently been developed to support polyploid genomes. Data in Ensembl Plants is accessible through a genome browser incorporating various specialist interfaces for different data types, and through a variety of additional methods for programmatic access and data mining. These interfaces are consistent with those offered through the Ensembl interface for the genomes of non-plant species, including those of plant pathogens, pests and pollinators, facilitating the study of the plant in its environment.

It belongs to the gigantic order Lamiales, which includes many well-known or economically important species, such as olive (Olea europaea), leonurus (Leonurus japonicus) and lavender (Lavandula spica), many of which have important pharmacological properties. Despite their importance, genetic and genomic analyses on these species have been insufficient due to a lack of reference genome information. The now available S. indicum genome will provide an unprecedented opportunity for studying both S. indicum genetic traits and comparative genomics. To deliver S. indicum genomic information to the worldwide research community, we designed Sinbase, a web-based database with comprehensive sesame genomic, genetic and comparative genomic information. Sinbase includes sequences of assembled sesame pseudomolecular chromosomes, protein-coding genes (27,148), transposable elements (372,167) and non-coding RNAs (1,748). In particular, Sinbase provides unique and valuable information on colinear regions with various plant genomes, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Vitis vinifera and Solanum lycopersicum. Sinbase also provides a useful search function and data mining tools, including a keyword search and local BLAST service. Sinbase will be updated regularly with new features, improvements to genome annotation and new genomic sequences, and is freely accessible at http://ocri-genomics.org/Sinbase/.

Interoperability between RDRs is needed for research activities, validation of therapeutic treatments, and public health actions. Sharing and comparing information requires a uniform and standardized way of data collection, so levels of interconnection between RDRs with similar aims and/or nature of data should be identified. The objective of this study is to define a classification and characterization of RDRs in order to identify different profiles and informative needs. Methods: Exploratory statistical analyses (cluster analysis and random forest) were applied to data derived from the EPIRARE project ('Building Consensus and Synergies for the EU Rare Disease Patient Registration') survey on the activities and needs of RDRs. Results: The cluster analysis identified 3 main typologies of RDRs: public health, clinical and genetic research, and treatment registries. The analysis of the most informative variables, identified by the random forest method, led to the characterization of 3 types of RDRs and the definition of different profiles and informative needs. Conclusions: These results represent a useful source of information to facilitate the harmonization and interconnection of RDRs in accordance with the different profiles identified. It could help sharing the information between RDRs with similar profiles and, whenever possible, interconnections between registries with different profiles. (C) 2015 S.

Medication administration errors (MAEs) are those that actually reach patients and remain a threat to patient safety. The Joint Commission International (JCI) advocates medication error prevention, but experience in reducing MAEs during the period of before and after JCI accreditation has not been reported. Methods: An intervention study, aimed at reducing MAEs in hospitalized patients, was performed in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, during the journey to JCI accreditation and in the post-JCI accreditation era (first half-year of 2011 to first half-year of 2014). Comprehensive interventions included organizational, information technology, educational, and process optimization-based measures. Data mining was performed on MAEs derived from a compulsory electronic reporting system. Results: The number of MAEs continuously decreased from 143 (first half-year of 2012) to 64 (first half-year of 2014), with a decrease in occurrence rate by 60.9% (0.338% versus 0.132%, P<0.05). The number of MAEs related to high-alert medications decreased from 32 (the second half-year of 2011) to 16 (the first half-year of 2014), with a decrease in occurrence rate by 57.9% (0.0787% versus 0.0331%, P<0.05). Omission was the top type of MAE during the first half-year of 2011 to the first half-year of 2014, with a decrease by 50% (40 cases versus 20 cases). Intravenous administration error was the top type of error regarding administration route, but it continuously decreased from 64 (first half-year of 2012) to 27 (first half-year of 2014). More experienced registered nurses made fewer medication errors. The number of MAEs in surgical wards was twice that in medicinal wards. Compared with non-intensive care units, the intensive care units exhibited higher occurrence rates of MAEs (1.81% versus 0.24%, P<0.001). Conclusion: A 3-and-a-half-year intervention program on MAEs was confirmed to be effective. MAEs made by nursing staff can be reduced, but cannot be eliminated. The depth, breadth, and efficiency of multidiscipline collaboration among physicians, pharmacists, nurses, information engineers, and hospital administrators are pivotal to safety in medication administration. JCI accreditation may help health systems enhance the awareness and ability to prevent MAEs and achieve successful quality improvements.

Stellar variability in the near-infrared (NIR) remains largely unexplored. The exploitation of public science archives with data-mining methods offers a perspective for a time-domain exploration of the NIR sky. Aims. We perform a comprehensive search for stellar variability using the optical-NIR multiband photometric data in the public Calibration Database of the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA), with the aim of contributing to the general census of variable stars and of extending the current scarce inventory of accurate NIR light curves for a number of variable star classes. Methods. Standard data-mining methods were applied to extract and fine-tune time-series data from the WSA. We introduced new variability indices designed for multiband data with correlated sampling, and applied them for preselecting variable star candidates, i.e., light curves that are dominated by correlated variations, from noise-dominated ones. Preselection criteria were established by robust numerical tests for evaluating the response of variability indices to the colored noise characteristic of the data. We performed a period search using the string-length minimization method on an initial catalog of 6551 variable star candidates preselected by variability indices. Further frequency analysis was performed on positive candidates using three additional methods in combination, in order to cope with aliasing. Results. We find 275 periodic variable stars and an additional 44 objects with suspected variability with uncertain periods or apparently aperiodic variation. Only 44 of these objects had been previously known, including 11 RR Lyrae stars on the outskirts of the globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). We provide a preliminary classification of the new variable stars that have well-measured light curves, but the variability types of a large number of objects remain ambiguous. We classify most of the new variables as contact binary stars, but we also find several pulsating stars, among which 34 are probably new field RR Lyrae, and 3 are likely Cepheids. We also identify 32 highly reddened variable objects close to previously known dark nebulae, suggesting that these are embedded young stellar objects. We publish our results and all light curve data as the WFCAM Variable Star Catalog.	[Ferreira Lopes, C. E.; Leao, I. C.; De Medeiros, J.

The huge number of evolved rules of items (or, genes) by association rule mining (ARM) algorithms makes confusion to the decision maker. In this article, we propose a weighted rule-mining technique (say, RANW AR or rank-based weighted association rule-mining) to rank the rules using two novel rule-interestingness measures, viz., rank-based weighted condensed support (wcs) and weighted condensed confidence (wcc) measures to bypass the problem. These measures are basically depended on the rank of items (genes). Using the rank, we assign weight to each item. RANW AR generates much less number of frequent itemsets than the state-of-the-art association rule mining algorithms. Thus, it saves time of execution of the algorithm. We run RANW AR on gene expression and methylation datasets. The genes of the top rules are biologically validated by Gene Ontologies (GOs) and KEGG pathway analyses. Many top ranked rules extracted from RANW AR that hold poor ranks in traditional Apriori, are highly biologically significant to the related diseases. Finally, the top rules evolved from RANW AR, that are not in Apriori, are reported.

We strive toward a better understanding of the molecular structure of key players in psychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases including autism, schizophrenia, and AD. This article includes data mining and bioinformatics analysis on the ADNP gene and protein, in addition to other related genes, with emphasis on recent literature. ADNP is discovered here as unique to chordata with specific autism mutations different from cancer-associated mutation. Furthermore, ADNP exhibits similarities to other cancer/autism-associated genes. We suggest that key genes, which shape and maintain our brain and are prone to mutations, are by in large unique to chordata. Furthermore, these brain-controlling genes, like ADNP, are linked to cell growth and differentiation, and under different stress conditions may mutate or exhibit expression changes leading to cancer propagation. Better understanding of these genes could lead to better therapeutics.

In particular, mobile phone datasets offer access to insights into urban dynamics and human activities at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, representing a huge opportunity for research and real-world applications. This article surveys the new ideas and techniques related to the use of telecommunication data for urban sensing. We outline the data that can be collected from telecommunication networks as well as their strengths and weaknesses with a particular focus on urban sensing. We survey existing filtering and processing techniques to extract insights from this data and summarize them to provide recommendations on which datasets and techniques to use for specific urban sensing applications.

It has achieved great success in various fields including computer vision, data mining, signal processing, and bioinformatics. Recently, much progress has been made in theories, algorithms, and applications of low-rank modeling, such as exact low-rank matrix recovery via convex programming and matrix completion applied to collaborative filtering. These advances have brought more and more attention to this topic. In this article, we review the recent advances of low-rank modeling, the state-of-the-art algorithms, and the related applications in image analysis. We first give an overview of the concept of low-rank modeling and the challenging problems in this area. Then, we summarize the models and algorithms for low-rank matrix recovery and illustrate their advantages and limitations with numerical experiments. Next, we introduce a few applications of low-rank modeling in the context of image analysis. Finally, we conclude this article with some discussions.

Competitive evaluation of data mining algorithms for use in classification of leukocyte subtypes with Raman microspectroscopy	ANALYST			English	Article							IN-VIVO; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; CERVICAL PRECANCERS; PROSTATE-CANCER; BLOOD-PLASMA; SERUM; DISCRIMINATION; ESOPHAGUS; PATHOLOGY; TOOL	Raman microspectroscopy has been investigated for some time for use in label-free cell sorting devices. These approaches require coupling of the Raman spectrometer to complex data mining algorithms for identification of cellular subtypes such as the leukocyte subpopulations of lymphocytes and monocytes. In this study, three distinct multivariate classification approaches, (PCA-LDA, SVMs and Random Forests) are developed and tested on their ability to classify the cellular subtype in extracted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (T-cell lymphocytes from myeloid cells), and are evaluated in terms of their respective classification performance. A strategy for optimisation of each of the classification algorithm is presented with emphasis on reduction of model complexity in each of the algorithms. The relative classification performance and performance characteristics are highlighted, overall suggesting the radial basis function SVM as a robust option for classification of leukocytes with Raman microspectroscopy.

Dysmenorrhea is a common problem for which acupuncture provides effective analgesia. Although acupoint selection affects the effectiveness of acupuncture, the basic rules of acupoint selection are little understood. This study aims to investigate the principles of acupoint selection and characteristics of acupoints used for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods. PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Database were searched for clinical trials published in English or Chinese from January 1978 to April 2014 evaluating the effect of acupuncture on primary dysmenorrhea, with or without methods of randomization and/or control. Three authors extracted information and two reviewers inputted information on titles, journals, interventions, main acupoints, and outcomes using the self-established Data Excavation Platform of Acupoint Specificity for data mining. Results. Sanyinjiao (SP06), Guanyuan (CV04), and Qihai (CV06) were used most frequently. The most frequently used meridians were Conception Vessel, Spleen Meridian of Foot Taiyin, and Bladder Meridian of Foot Taiyang. 67.24% of acupoints used were specific acupoints. Acupoints on lower limbs were most frequently used. Conclusion. Data mining is a feasible approach to identify the characteristics of acupoint selection. Our study indicated that modern acupuncture treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is based on selection of specific acupoints according to traditional acupuncture theory.

In this paper, a local energy-based framework is proposed to estimate the features' relevance for ranking them. The key idea behind this framework is to transform a complex nonlinear problem into a set of locally linear ones through local energy-based learning. Moreover, the convergence of this framework is analyzed. Some experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets including high dimension small sample size data, such as gene data. The experimental results have shown the correctness of our algorithm derived from this framework and its performance is higher or similar to other classical feature ranking algorithms in most cases.

The database focuses on fighter and attack aircraft because their design is a particular challenge compared with the design of other types of aircraft. For small conventional aircraft, historical information accumulated over many years on countless previous designs is freely available to designers. Such data for fighter aircraft design are, however, difficult to obtain or are insufficient. The database developed can contribute to the design of fighter and attack aircraft on a conceptual level. In addition, decision-making models are developed by means of data mining as well as approximation models based on the developed database to facilitate initial aircraft configuration decisions. The efficiency and simplicity of the proposed method are described in a case study, which also describes a sample process of conceptual design optimization using initial design information extracted from the developed database.

Fuzzy association rule mining for fashion product development	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Fast fashion; New product development; Fuzzy association rules	QUALITY MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; GARMENT INDUSTRY; NEURAL-NETWORK; INTELLIGENT; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; CUSTOMIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; ALGORITHM	Purpose - The emergence of the fast fashion trend has exerted a great pressure on fashion designers who are urged to consider customers' preferences in their designs and develop new products in an efficient manner. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) approach for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of new product development (NPD) in fast fashion. Design/methodology/approach - The FARM identifies the hidden relationships between product styles and customer preferences. The knowledge discovered help the fashion industry design new products which are not only fashionable, but are also saleable in the market. Findings - To evaluate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based fashion company in which a real-set of data are tested to generate fuzzy association rules. The results reveal that the FARM approach can provide knowledge support to the fashion industry during NPD, shorten the NPD cycle time, and increase customer satisfaction. Originality/value - Compared with traditional association rule mining, the proposed FARM approach takes the fuzziness of data into consideration and the knowledge represented in the fuzzy rules is in a more human-understandable structure. It captures the voice of the customer into fashion product development and provides a specific solution to deal with the challenges brought by fast fashion. In addition, it helps increase the innovation and technological capability of the fashion industry.	[Lee, Carmen Kar Hang; Ho, G. T. S.; Choy, K.

J	Abu Hammad, A; El-Halees, A				Abu Hammad, Ahmed; El-Halees, Alaa			All Approach for Detecting Spain in Arabic Opinion Reviews	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Opinion mining; arabic opinion mining; spam review; spam detection		For the rapidly increasing amount of information available on the Internet, little quality control exists, especially over the user-generated content. Manually scanning through large amounts of user-generated content is time-consuming and sometime impossible. In this case, opinion mining is a better alternative. Although, it is recognized that the opinion reviews contain valuable information for a variety of applications, the lack of quality control attracts spammers who have found many ways to draw their benefits from spamming. Moreover, the spam detection problem is complex because spammers always invent fresh methods that can't be easily recognized. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new approach that works to identify spam in opinion reviews. We have some in English; we need one in Arabic language in order to identify Arabic spam reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study to detect spam in Arabic reviews. In this research, we propose a new approach for performing spam detection in Arabic opinion reviews by merging methods from data mining and text mining in one mining classification approach. Our work is based on the state-of-the-art achievements in the Latin-based spam detection techniques keeping in mind the specific nature of the Arabic language. In addition; we overcome the drawbacks of the class imbalance problem by using sampling techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in identifying Arabic spam opinion reviews. Our designed machine learning achieves significant improvements. In the best case, our F-measure is improved to 99.59%.

The examples of such kind of data are bank records, web logs, cell phone records and network traffic records. This has raised a new challenge for people i.e., to transform this data into useful information. To achieve this task successfully, data mining is a vital technique. The aim of data mining is to extract knowledge from data. Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) is an important area of data mining. Sequential data contains events and events contain items. The order between items does not matter. Whenever, we extract sequential information, there is always a threat that we may reveal sensitive sequential patterns. Thus, a need arises to protect sensitive sequential patterns. To fulfil this need; Privacy Preservation Data Mining (PPDM) techniques are used. The aim of privacy preservation techniques is to extract information from data without revealing sensitive information. In this research we would propose a technique based on FP growth approach and then applying anti-monotone and monotone constraints for identifidng sensitive sequential patterns. For data modification we would apply the concept of fuzzy sets.

We propose a methodology based on a classification and regression tree (CART) approach, allowing the characteristics that most influence overall service quality to be identified. The methodology is applied by using data regarding rail service in northern Italy, particularly suburban lines connecting different towns of the hinterland of the city of Milan. Passengers expressed their opinions about service characteristics such as safety, cleanliness, comfort, information, and personnel. We found that perceptions about service quality are differentiated among the various groups of users.

These changes have driven the 'data deluge' of modern biology. Submissions of nucleotide sequences to GenBank, for example, have doubled in size every year since 1982, and individual data sets now frequently reach terabytes in size. While 'big data' present exciting opportunities for scientific discovery, data analysis skills are not part of the typical wet bench biologist's experience. Knowing what to do with data, how to visualize and analyse them, make predictions, and test hypotheses are important barriers to success. Many researchers also lack adequate capacity to store and share these data, creating further bottlenecks to effective collaboration between groups and institutes. The US National Science Foundation-funded iPlant Collaborative was established in 2008 to form part of the data collection and analysis pipeline and help alleviate the bottlenecks associated with the big data challenge in plant science. Leveraging the power of high-performance computing facilities, iPlant provides free-to-use cyberinfrastructure to enable terabytes of data storage, improve analysis, and facilitate collaborations. To help train UK plant science researchers to use the iPlant platform and understand how it can be exploited to further research, GARNet organized a four-day Data mining with iPlant workshop at Warwick University in September 2013. This report provides an overview of the workshop, and highlights the power of the iPlant environment for lowering barriers to using complex bioinformatics resources, furthering discoveries in plant science research and providing a platform for education and outreach programmes.

Currently, new versions of e-learning platforms include indicators that provide some static feedback mechanisms and help both learners and educators in planning their learning strategies. This paper explains the usage of indicators in current e-learning systems, generates a taxonomy for their classification, and studies their influence on student performance. Also, it provides a study which is based on the combination of a user-based evaluation process that facilitates data collection and data mining algorithms to infer association rules between learning variables and performance. The results highlight how procrastination influences negative learning performance and how time-related indicators are tightly coupled with students' performance in e-learning platforms.

J	Chen, C; Chen, DJ; Ciucci, F				Chen, Chi; Chen, Dengjie; Ciucci, Francesco			A molecular dynamics study of oxygen ion diffusion in A-site ordered perovskite PrBaCo2O5.5: data mining the oxygen trajectories	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY RELAXATION; NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; MODEL MATERIAL; TRANSPORT; SIMULATIONS; CATHODE; OXIDES; REPRESENTATION; CONDUCTORS; MECHANISM	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely used to study oxygen ion diffusion in crystals. In the data analysis, one typically calculates the mean squared displacements to obtain the self-diffusion coefficients. Further information extraction for each individual atom poses significant challenges due to the lack of general methods. In this work, oxygen ion diffusion in A-site ordered perovskite PrBaCo2O5.5 is studied using MD simulations and the oxygen migration is analyzed by k-means clustering, a machine learning algorithm. The clustering analysis allows the tracking of each individual oxygen jump along with its corresponding location, i.e., oxygen site in BaO, PrO0.5 and CoO2 layers. Therefore it increases the understanding of the factors influencing oxygen diffusion. For example, it is found that the oxygen occupation fraction in the PrO0.5 layers increases with temperature, while in the CoO2 layers it decreases with temperature. Additionally, the activation enthalpies of oxygen jumps from CoO2 to CoO2, CoO2 to PrO0.5 and PrO0.5 to CoO2 are 0.22 eV, 0.54 eV and 0.34 eV, respectively, exhibiting anisotropic characteristics. Furthermore, the dwell times of oxygen atoms suggest that they are highly mobile in PrO0.5 layers. Combining the analysis of activation enthalpies and dwell times, it is suggested that the oxygen transport is fast within the CoO2 layers while the PrO0.5 layers work as oxygen vacancy reservoirs.

J	Hu, YH; Lin, WC; Tsai, CF; Ke, SW; Chen, CW				Hu, Ya-Han; Lin, Wei-Chao; Tsai, Chih-Fong; Ke, Shih-Wen; Chen, Chih-Wen			An efficient data preprocessing approach for large scale medical data mining	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Data preprocessing; instance selection; medical data mining; breast cancer; protein homology	INSTANCE SELECTION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; OUTLIER DETECTION; REDUCTION	BACKGROUND: The size of medical datasets is usually very large, which directly affects the computational cost of the data mining process. Instance selection is a data preprocessing step in the knowledge discovery process, which can be employed to reduce storage requirements while also maintaining the mining quality. This process aims to filter out outliers (or noisy data) from a given (training) dataset. However, when the dataset is very large in size, more time is required to accomplish the instance selection task. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce an efficient data preprocessing approach (EDP), which is composed of two steps. The first step is based on training a model over a small amount of training data after preforming instance selection. The model is then used to identify the rest of the large amount of training data. METHODS: Experiments are conducted based on two medical datasets for breast cancer and protein homology prediction problems that contain over 100000 data samples. In addition, three well-known instance selection algorithms are used, IB3, DROP3, and genetic algorithms. On the other hand, three popular classification techniques are used to construct the learning models for comparison, namely the CART decision tree, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: The results show that our proposed approach not only reduces the computational cost by nearly a factor of two or three over three other state-of-the-art algorithms, but also maintains the final classification accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: To perform instance selection over large scale medical datasets, it requires a large computational cost to directly execute existing instance selection algorithms. Our proposed EDP approach solves this problem by training a learning model to recognize good and noisy data. To consider both computational complexity and final classification accuracy, the proposed EDP has been demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness in the large scale instance selection problem.

Different data mining techniques have been used for mining rules, and mathematical models have been developed to assist the clinician in decision making. The objective of this research is to build a classifier that will predict the presence or absence of a disease by learning from the minimal set of attributes that has been extracted from the clinical dataset. In this work rough set indiscernibility relation method with backpropagation neural network (RS-BPNN) is used. This work has two stages. The first stage is handling of missing values to obtain a smooth data set and selection of appropriate attributes from the clinical dataset by indiscernibility relation method. The second stage is classification using backpropagation neural network on the selected reducts of the dataset. The classifier has been tested with hepatitis, Wisconsin breast cancer, and Statlog heart disease datasets obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The accuracy obtained from the proposed method is 97.3%, 98.6%, and 90.4% for hepatitis, breast cancer, and heart disease, respectively. The proposed system provides an effective classification model for clinical datasets.

J	Pham, TT				Thi-Thiet Pham			Efficiently Mining Sequential Generator Patterns Using Prefix Trees	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						sequential pattern; sequential generator pattern; sequence database; prefix tree	FREQUENT SEQUENCES; ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM; DATABASES; LATTICE	Mining long frequent sequences that contain a combinatorial number of frequent subsequences or using very low support thresholds to mine sequential patterns is usually both time-and memory-consuming. The mining of closed sequential patterns, sequential generator patterns, and maximum sequences has been proposed to overcome this problem. Sequential generator patterns, when used together with closed sequential patterns, can provide additional information that closed sequential patterns alone cannot provide. Mining sequential generator patterns is thus an important task in data mining as well. This paper proposes an algorithm called MSGP-PreTree for mining all sequential generator patterns based on the prefix-tree structure. The algorithm uses the characteristics of sequential generator patterns and sequence extensions to efficiently perform a depth-first search on a prefix tree. It also uses a vertical approach to list and count the supports of sequences based on the prime block encoding approach for representing candidate sequences and determining the frequencies of candidates. Besides, the search space of the MSGP-PreTree algorithm is much smaller than those of other algorithms because two pruning strategies are applied. Experimental results conducted on synthetic and real databases show that the proposed algorithm is effective than a previous one.

Methods: Following pre-processing of FAERS data by elimination of duplicated records as well as adjustments to standardize drug names, reports involving haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole were analyzed in children (age 0-12). Signals in the data that signified a drug-associated adverse event were detected via quantitative data mining algorithms. The algorithms applied to this study include the empirical Bayes geometric mean, the reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, and the information component of a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT prolongation, leukopenia, and suicide attempt were focused on as serious adverse events. Results: In regard to NMS, the signal scores for haloperidol and aripiprazole were greater than for other antipsychotics. Significant signals of the QT prolongation adverse event were detected only for ziprasidone and risperidone. With respect to leukopenia, the association with clozapine was noteworthy. In the case of suicide attempt, signals for haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole were detected. Conclusions: It was suggested that there is a level of diversity in the strength of the association between various first-and second-generation antipsychotics with associated serious adverse events, which possibly lead to fatal outcomes. We recommend that research be continued in order to gather a large variety and quantity of related information, and that both available and newly reported data be placed in the context of multiple medical viewpoints in order to lead to improved levels of care.

However, it remains uncertain whether statin therapy is associated with cancer risk. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of cancer, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of claims constructed by a database vendor (The Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]). Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS, which included data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2012, were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals and was calculated using the case/non-case method. Additionally, signals were detected via the information component (IC) using the IC025 metric. Furthermore, event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was applied to identify the risk of cancer following treatment with statins over the period January 2005 to July 2013. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant signals for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found for statins as a class. In the ESSA, significant associations between statin use and colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found, with adjusted sequence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.20 (1.08-1.34) and 1.31 (1.13-1.53), respectively, at an interval of 48 months. Conclusions: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer.

FP-Growth (frequent-pattern growth) algorithm is a classical algorithm in association rules mining. But the FP-Growth algorithm in mining needs two times to scan database, which reduces the efficiency of algorithm. Through the study of association rules mining and FP-Growth algorithm, we worked out improved algorithms of FP-Growth algorithm-Painting-Growth algorithm and N (not) Painting-Growth algorithm (removes the painting steps, and uses another way to achieve). We compared two kinds of improved algorithms with FP-Growth algorithm. Experimental results show that Painting-Growth algorithm is more than 1050 and N Painting-Growth algorithm is less than 10000 in data volume; the performance of the two kinds of improved algorithms is better than that of FP-Growth algorithm.

The last two levels are implemented in Zynq-7000 device available on the prototyping board ZC706. Communications between the levels 1 and 2-3 are organized through PCI express bus and interactions between components of levels 2 and 3 - through on-chip AXI interfaces. We studied two levels of software programs (running in PC and ARM), high-performance hardware accelerators implemented in Zynq-7000 programmable logic, and architecture enabling interactions and exchange of data between different levels. The selected for analysis sorting problem has high computational complexity and is widely required in data processing (data mining and statistical data manipulation, in particular). The results of experiments demonstrate that the elaborated architecture is efficient and permits fast solutions to be found. Proposals for potential further improvements are also given.

Currently, several in silico methods have been developed for the prediction of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) using artificial neural network (ANN) or support vector machine (SVM). In spite of this, there are ample opportunities for further improvements by developing a simple and interpretable quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method. Herein, an efficient linear method (ELM) is proposed for constructing a highly predictive QSAR model containing a spontaneous feature importance estimator. Briefly, ELM is a linear-based model with optimal parameters derived from genetic algorithm. Results showed that the simple ELM method displayed robust performance with 10-fold cross-validation MCC values of 0.64 and 0.56 for steroidal and non-steroidal AIs, respectively. Comparative analyses with other machine learning methods (i.e. ANN, SVM and decision tree) were also performed. A thorough analysis of informative molecular descriptors for both steroidal and non-steroidal AIs provided insights into the mechanism of action of compounds. Our findings suggest that the shape and polarizability of compounds may govern the inhibitory activity of both steroidal and non-steroidal types whereas the terminal primary C(sp3) functional group and electronegativity may be required for non-steroidal AIs. The R code of the ELM method is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1274030.

The estimation of LDLC (LDL-Cal) level was performed using Friedewald's equation for triglyceride (TG) level less than 400 mg/dL. Therefore, the aim of this study is to generate a new formula for LDL-Cal and validate the correlation coefficient between LDL-Cal and LDL-C directly measured (LDL-Direct). A data set of 1786 individuals receiving annual medical check-ups from the Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Thailand in 2008 was used in this study. Lipid profiles including total cholesterol (TC), TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C were determined using Roche/Hitachi modular system analyzer. The estimated LDL-C was obtained using Friedewald's equation and the homogenous enzymatic method. The level of TG was divided into 6 groups (TG< 200, < 300, < 400, < 500, < 600 and < 1000 mg/dL) for constructing the LDL-Cal formula. The pace regression model was used to construct the candidate formula for the LDL-Cal and determine the correlation coefficient (r) with the LDL-Direct. The candidate LDL-Cal formula was generated for 6 groups of TG levels that displayed well correlation between LDL-Cal and LDL-Direct. Interestingly, The TG level was less than 1000 mg/dL, the regression model was able to generate the equation as shown as strong r of 0.9769 with LDL-Direct. Furthermore, external data set (n = 666) with TG measurement (36-1480 mg/dL) was used to validate new formula which displayed high r of 0.971 between LDL-Cal and LDL-direct. This study explored a new formula for LDL-Cal which exhibited higher r of 0.9769 and far beyond the limitation of TG more than 1000 mg/dL and potential used for estimating LDL-C in routine clinical laboratories.

Although these data sets do not offer spatial or cell type-specific information, they can be extremely useful for gene discovery when analyzed by the appropriate techniques. Previously, we proposed and validated the use of combinatorial dataset analysis techniques to identify novel genes required during pre-implantation development. Now we build upon this work to identify genes that have dynamic expression during gametogenesis. Here we present detailed analysis of the expression pattern of leukemia-associated, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to 1 (Mllt1)gene. We document a novel splice isoform of Mllt1 and confirm that both Mllt1 mRNA isoforms are translated. We provide data supporting that MLLT1 protein isoforms display distinct stage-specific expression during spermiogenesis and adult tissues. Finally, we evaluated genes neighboring the Mllt1 locus, and show dynamic stage specific expression patterns of other genes Catsperd, Prr22, Rfx2 and Slc25a41. We document testes expressed alternative isoforms of Prr22 and Rfx2. These results indicate that transcriptome data mining, combined with specific expression analysis provides a wealth of novel gene expression information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reason is that weighted itemset mining considers not only the occurrence of items in transactions but also the individual importance of items. The traditional upper-bound model can be used to handle the weighted itemset mining problem, but a large number of candidates are generated by the model. This work thus presents an improved model to enhance the effectiveness of reducing unpromising candidates. Besides, an effective strategy, projection-based pruning, is proposed as well to tighten upper-bounds of weighted supports for itemsets in the mining process, thus reducing the execution time further. Through a series of experimental evaluation, the results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach has good performance in both pruning effectiveness and execution efficiency under various parameter settings when compared to some other approaches.

Analysing huge gene expression data otherwise known as microarray data is complicated due to its high dimensionality. Hence the traditional classifiers do not perform well where the number of features far exceeds the number of samples. A good set of features help classifiers to classify the dataset efficiently. Moreover, a manageable set of features is also desirable for the biologist for further analysis. In this paper, we have proposed a linear regression-based feature selection method for selecting discriminative features. Our main focus is to classify the dataset more accurately using less number of features than other traditional feature selection methods. Our method has been compared with several other methods and in almost every case the classification accuracy is higher using less number of features than the other popular feature selection methods.

Based on probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and probabilistic curve fitting idea, we propose a probabilistic PLSR (PPLSR) model and an Estimation Maximisation (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters. This model explains PLSR from a probabilistic viewpoint, describes its essential meaning and provides a foundation to develop future Bayesian nonparametrics models. Two real Raman spectra datasets were used to evaluate this model, and experimental results show its effectiveness.

Biomedical Named Entities include mentions of proteins, genes, DNA, RNA, etc. which, in general, have complex structures and are difficult to recognise. In this paper, we propose a Single Objective Optimisation based classifier ensemble technique using the search capability of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for NERC in biomedical texts. Here, GA is used to quantify the amount of voting for each class in each classifier. We use diverse classification methods like Conditional Random Field and Support Vector Machine to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the set of features and/or feature templates. The proposed technique is evaluated with two benchmark datasets, namely JNLPBA 2004 and GENETAG. Experiments yield the overall F-measure values of 75.97% and 95.90%, respectively.

Biomedical named entity (BNE) recognition is a basic technique in the biomedical knowledge discovery and its performance has direct effects on further discovery and processing in biomedical texts. In this paper, we present an improved method based on co-decision matrix framework for Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BNER). The relativity between classifiers is utilised by using co-decision matrix to exchange decision information among classifiers. The experiments are carried on GENIA corpus with the best result of 75.9% F-score. Experimental results show that the proposed method, co-decision matrix framework, can yield promising performances.

Sequential patterns can be used to discover the purchased behaviors of customers or the usage behaviors of users from Web log data. Most approaches process a static database to discover sequential patterns in a batch way. In real-world applications, transactions or sequences in databases are frequently changed. In the past, a fast updated sequential pattern (FUSP)-tree was proposed to handle dynamic databases whether for sequence insertion, deletion or modification based on FUP concepts. Original database is required to be re-scanned if it is necessary to maintain the small sequences which was not kept in the FUSP tree. In this paper, the prelarge concept was adopted to maintain and update the built prelarge FUSP tree for sequence modification. A prelarge FUSP tree is modified from FUSP tree for preserving not only the frequent 1-sequences but also the prelarge 1-sequences in the tree structure. The PRELARGE-FUSP-TREE-MOD maintenance algorithm is proposed to reduce the rescans of the original database due to the pruning properties of prelarge concept. When the number of modified sequences is smaller than the safety bound of the prelarge concept, better results can be obtained by the proposed PRELARGE-FUSP-TREE-MOD maintenance algorithm for sequence modification in dynamic databases.

In this paper, a more efficient algorithm TripRec is proposed to solve this problem. Based on the principle of the Aprior algorithm for mining frequent item sets, our method constructs candidate attraction sets containing k attractions by using the join rule on valid sets consisting of k-1 attractions. After all the valid routes from the valid k-1 attraction sets have been obtained, all of the candidate routes for the candidate k-sets can be acquired through a route extension approach. This method exhibits manifest improvement of the efficiency in the valid routes generation process. Then, by determining whether there exists at least one valid route, the paper prunes some candidate attraction sets to gain all the valid sets. The process will continue until no more valid attraction sets can be obtained. In addition, several optimization strategies are employed to greatly enhance the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm has the better pruning rate and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art method.

These individual investors are in great need of mobile apps that can provide professional and handy trading analysis and decision support everywhere. However, financial data is challenging to analyze because of its large-scale, non-linear and noisy characteristics in a varying stock environment. This paper develops a Mobile Data-Driven Stock Trading System (iTrade), which is a mobile app system based on Client-Server architecture and various data mining techniques. The iTrade is characterized by 1) a data-driven intelligent learning model, which can provide further insight compared to empirical technical analysis, 2) a concept drift adaptation process, which facilitates the model adaptation to market structure changes, and 3) a rigorous benchmark analysis, including the Buy-and-Hold strategy and the strategies of three world-famous master investors (e.g., Warren E. Buffett). Technologies used in iTrade include the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and risk-adjusted portfolio optimization. An application case of iTrade is presented, which is based on a seven-year (2005-2011) back-testing. Evaluation results indicated that iTrade could gain much higher cumulative return compared to the benchmark (Shanghai Composite Index). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study and mobile app system that emphasizes and investigates the concept drift phenomenon in stock market, as well as the performance comparison between data-driven intelligent model and strategies of master investors.

These applications capture humanmotions in real-time from video sensors, the data patterns are nonstationary and ever changing. While the hardware technology of such motion sensing devices as well as their data collection process become relatively mature, the computational challenge lies in the real-time analysis of these live feeds. In this paper we argue that traditional data mining methods run short of accurately analyzing the human activity patterns from the sensor data stream. The shortcoming is due to the algorithmic design which is not adaptive to the dynamic changes in the dynamic gesture motions. The successor of these algorithms which is known as data stream mining is evaluated versus traditional data mining, through a case of gesture recognition over motion data by using Microsoft Kinect sensors. Three different subjects were asked to read three comic strips and to tell the stories in front of the sensor. The data stream contains coordinates of articulation points and various positions of the parts of the human body corresponding to the actions that the user performs. In particular, a novel technique of feature selection using swarm search and accelerated PSO is proposed for enabling fast preprocessing for inducing an improved classification model in real-time. Superior result is shown in the experiment that runs on this empirical data stream. The contribution of this paper is on a comparative study between using traditional and data stream mining algorithms and incorporation of the novel improved feature selection technique with a scenario where different gesture patterns are to be recognized from streaming sensor data.

Besides this issue, the increasing amount of data that is being generated every day by remote sensors raises more challenges to be overcome. In this work, a tool within the scope of InterIMAGE Cloud Platform (ICP), which is an open-source, distributed framework for automatic image interpretation, is presented. The tool, named ICP: Data Mining Package, is able to perform supervised classification procedures on huge amounts of data, usually referred as big data, on a distributed infrastructure using Hadoop MapReduce. The tool has four classification algorithms implemented, taken from WEKA's machine learning library, namely: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of an experimental analysis using a SVM classifier on data sets of different sizes for different cluster configurations demonstrates the potential of the tool, as well as aspects that affect its performance.

PBMCs were isolated from a total of 12 blood samples using a Histopaque-1077 solution. The proteins were fractioned, separated by 2D SDS-PAGE (pI 4-7), and double-stained. The proteomes were compared and statistically processed with Progenesis SameSpots; then proteins were identified by nano-LC-MS/MS. Protein functional association and expression profiles were analyzed using the EnrichNet application and Progenesis SameSpots hierarchical clustering software, respectively. By comparing the cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions of the two groups, 178 significantly (P < 0.05, ANOVA) differing spots were found, corresponding to 139 unique proteins. Data mining of the Reactome and KEGG databases using EnrichNet highlighted the possible involvement of the identified protein alterations in apoptosis, proteasome protein degradation, heat shock protein action, and signal transduction. Western blot analysis revealed underexpression of vinculin and advanced fragmentation of fermitin-3 in MDS patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that proteome changes have been identified in the mononuclear cells of MDS patients. Vinculin and fermitin-3, the proteins involved in cell adhesion and integrin signaling, have been shown to be dysregulated in MDS.

These research angles come from other disciplines and are in the process of being adopted by the IoT. Our paper serves a key purpose: from the perspective of correlative technologies based on time, to review the evolutionary process of the IoT and depict the relations between the correlation techniques which are largely missing in current literature in which the focus has been more on the introduction and comparison of existing technologies and less on issues describing evolutionary process of the IoT. We consider that the latter is crucial to understanding the evolution of the IoT. Through generalizations of particular focus in different stages of each technology, we can better understand the current phase of the IoT and therefore predict future challenges. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing guidance in terms of the evolutionary process of the IoT and gives readers a panoramic view of the IoT field without repeating what is already available in existing literature so as to complement the existing IoT survey papers which have not covered the evolutionary process of the IoT.

Functional evaluation of out-of-the-box text-mining tools for data-mining tasks	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						electronic health records; natural language processing; text mining	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; CLINICAL TEXT; MEDICAL-RECORDS; INFORMATION EXTRACTION; RISK-FACTORS; SYSTEM; ACCURACY; ARCHITECTURE; CHALLENGE; ALGORITHM	Objective The trade-off between the speed and simplicity of dictionary-based term recognition and the richer linguistic information provided by more advanced natural language processing (NLP) is an area of active discussion in clinical informatics. In this paper, we quantify this trade-off among text processing systems that make different trade-offs between speed and linguistic understanding. We tested both types of systems in three clinical research tasks: phase IV safety profiling of a drug, learning adverse drug-drug interactions, and learning used-to-treat relationships between drugs and indications. Materials We first benchmarked the accuracy of the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in a manually annotated, publically available dataset from the 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge. We then applied the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL to 9 million clinical notes from the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) and used the resulting data for three research tasks. Results There is no significant difference between using the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in the results of the three research tasks when using large datasets. In one subtask, REVEAL achieved higher sensitivity with smaller datasets. Conclusions For a variety of tasks, employing simple term recognition methods instead of advanced NLP methods results in little or no impact on accuracy when using large datasets. Simpler dictionary-based methods have the advantage of scaling well to very large datasets. Promoting the use of simple, dictionary-based methods for population level analyses can advance adoption of NLP in practice.

The proposed method takes into consideration the distribution of all samples to generate an ideal discretization scheme. The method maintains a high interdependence between the target class and the discretized attribute, and avoids overfitting. Empirical evaluation of seven discretization algorithms on UCI real datasets show that the novel algorithm can yield a better discretization scheme that improves the accuracy of decision tree classification. As to the execution time of discretization and the number of generated rules, our approach also achieves promising results.

While passing a design rule deck is a necessary condition for a VLSI design to be manufacturable, it is not sufficient. Other physical design profiling decks that attempt to obtain statistical information about the various critical dimensions in the VLSI design lack a systematic methodology for rule enumeration. These decks are often inadequate, unable to extract all the interlayer and intralayer dimensions in a design that have a correlation with process yield.

Nevertheless such large demand requires substantial power grid to sustain. Therefore power equipment's running and testing data which contains vast information underpins online monitoring and fault diagnosis to finally achieve state maintenance. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis model for power equipment based on case-based reasoning (IFDCBR) will be proposed. The model intends to discover the potential rules of equipment fault by data mining. The intelligent model constructs a condition case base of equipment by analyzing the following four categories of data: online recording data, history data, basic test data, and environmental data. SVM regression analysis was also applied in mining the case base so as to further establish the equipment condition fingerprint. The running data of equipment can be diagnosed by such condition fingerprint to detect whether there is a fault or not. Finally, this paper verifies the intelligent model and three-ratio method based on a set of practical data. The resulting research demonstrates that this intelligent model is more effective and accurate in fault diagnosis.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise; Blood glucose; Heart rate; Vital capacity; Systematic method		Objective: To investigate the effects of Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise on blood glucose, heart rate and vital capacity of healthy undergraduates Methods: 200 undergraduate volunteers were selected according to the diagnostic standards and inclusion criteria. They were randomly and evenly allocated into the two groups. The case group practiced the Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise and the control group practiced the 8th Broadcast Gymnastic Exercise, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Three biological indexes were measured half an hour before and after the exercise. From t test (single variable), correlation (two variables) to multi-variables, such as Principal component analysis, Heat map and Random forest, a systematical method was presented to understand the data. Results: There were significant differences before and after the exercise in both two groups. Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise performed better than the 8th Broadcast Gymnastic Exercise in reducing BG, balancing HR and enlarging VC. They were interacted with each other to separate control group from case group with an accuracy rate of nearly 80%. The most important one is BG, the less important one is HR and VC is of the least importance. Conclusion: Systematically statistical methods could discover intrinsic rules behind the data. It has been proved that "Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise" performed better than " 8th Broadcast Gymnastic Exercise" in reducing BG, balancing HR and enlarging VC of undergraduate students, so the " Chinese Traditional Setting-up Exercise" was suitable for popularizing among universities.

Most quality parameters are assessed by traditional methods, which are time consuming, laborious, and associated with inconsistency and variability. Non-destructive methods have been developed to objectively measure quality attributes for various kinds of food. In recent years, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has matured into one of the most powerful tools for quality evaluation of agricultural and food products. HSI allows characterization of a sample's chemical composition (spectroscopic component) and external features (imaging component) in each point of the image with full spectral information. In order to track the latest research developments of this technology, this paper gives a detailed overview of the theory and fundamentals behind this technology and discusses its applications in the field of quality evaluation of agricultural products. Additionally, future potentials of HSI are also reported.

However, these charts provide only limited information about the contribution of any specific variable to an out-of-control signal. To address this limitation, some fault identification methods have been developed to identify contributors to an abnormality. In real situations, however, a couple of tasks should be further considered with these contributors to improve their applicability and to facilitate interpretation of faults.

Biosom: gene synonym analysis by self-organizing map	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Gene nomenclature; Gene ambiguity; Kohonen; Gene synonym prediction; Self-organizing map; Matrix-U	DATABASE; PROTEIN; NOMENCLATURE; NAMES	There are several guidelines for gene nomenclature, but they are not always applied to the names of newly identified genes. The lack of standardization in naming genes generates inconsistent databases with errors such as genes with the same function and different names, genes with different functions and the same name, and use of an abbreviated name. This paper presents a methodology for predicting synonyms in a given gene nomenclature, thereby detecting and minimizing naming redundancy and inconsistency and facilitating the annotation of new genes and data mining in public databases. To identify gene synonyms, i.e., gene ambiguity, the methodology proposed begins by grouping genes according to their names using a Kohonen self-organizing map artificial neural network. Afterwards, it identifies the groups generated employing the Matrix-U technique. The employment of such techniques allows one to infer the synonyms of genes, to predict probable hypothetical gene names and to point out possible errors in a database record. Many mistakes related to gene nomenclature were detected in this research, demonstrating the importance of predicting synonyms. The methodology developed is applicable for describing hypothetical, putative and other types of genes without a known function. Moreover, it can also indicate a possible function for genes after grouping them.	[Otemaier, K. R.; Steffens, M. B. R.; Raittz, R. T.; Brawerman, A.; Marchaukoski, J.

One of the reasons is the lack of readily available open-source software packages which can easily calculate calibration metrics. In order to provide one such tool, we have developed a custom modification of the Weka data mining software, which implements the calculation of Hosmer-Lemeshow groups of risk and the Pearson chi-square statistic comparison between estimated and observed frequencies for binary problems. We provide calibration performance estimations with Logistic regression (LR), BayesNet, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees and Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) models with six different datasets. Our experiments show that SVMs with RBF kernels exhibit the best results in terms of calibration, while decision trees, RIPPER and KNN are highly unlikely to produce well-calibrated models.

For example, in the case of the Technological Educational Institute of Athens, in the academic year 20122013, the percentage of graduates with a length of studies of more than 6 years was 53%. This "problem" becomes harder if we consider that according to the new legislation, the Greek Higher Education Institutes (HEI) must cut off access to the students who "linger" too long. This means that many of these graduates wouldn't be able to complete their studies. While many institutes have systems to quantify and report the length of studies of all graduates, far less attention is typically paid to each student's reason(s) for delayed graduation. In this paper, we focus on examining the question of why students delay in the completion of their studies using several data mining techniques. Through the application of data mining techniques new knowledge will be provided to the administration of a HEI that could be used for solving this problem. The data used in our case study come from a questionnaire distributed to graduates of the institute but also from educational data stored in the Institute's student database.

This can be extended to crowd-centred applications if a large number of users is included. In this paper we present a spatio-temporal prediction approach to forecast user location in a medium-term period. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that users exhibit a different mobility pattern for each day of the week. Once factored out this weekly pattern, user mobility among points of interest is postulated to be markovian. We trained a hidden Markov model to forecast user mobility and evaluated our approach using a public dataset. The experimental results show that our approach is effective considering a time period of up to 7 h. We obtained an accuracy of up to 81.75% for a period of 30 min, and 66.25% considering 7 h.

Three significant chondrocytic pathways and one network were screened by TranscriptomeBrowser; one significant pathway and one network were identified by MetaCore. BAX, APAF1, CASP6, BCL2, VEGF, SOCS3, BAK, TGFBI, TNFAIP6, TNFRSF11B and THBS1 were significant genes associated with the biological function of chondrocyte or cartilage involved in the TranscriptomeBrowser or MetaCore results. The interactions between the significant genes and their adjacent genes were searched and classified in GeneMANIA. In pathway analysis results, TranscriptomeBrowser is superior to get the interaction of pathway and co-expression compared with MetaCore; MetaCore is superior to get the interaction of physical interaction compared with TranscriptomeBrowser. In network analysis results, TranscriptomeBrowser contains more interaction message of co-localisation, MetaCore contains more interaction message of co-expression.

Discovery of phenotypic networks from genotypic association studies with application to obesity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						genetic networks; GWAS; Bayesian networks; structural equation modelling; obesity	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LOCI; GENETICS; CHILDREN	Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) have resulted in many discovered risk variants for several obesity-related traits. However, before clinical relevance of these discoveries can be achieved, molecular or physiological mechanisms of these risk variants needs to be discovered. One strategy is to perform data mining of phenotypically-rich data sources such as those present in dbGAP (database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) for hypothesis generation. Here we propose a technique that combines the power of existing Bayesian Network (BN) learning algorithms with the statistical rigour of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to produce an overall phenotypic network discovery system with optimal properties. We illustrate our method using the analysis of a candidate SNP data set from the AMERICO sample, a multi-ethnic cross-sectional cohort of roughly 300 children with detailed obesity-related phenotypes. We demonstrate our approach by showing genetic mechanisms for three obesity-related SNPs.

However, the existing text representation and feature weighting schemes commonly used for text classification are not well suited for IAC. We capture and utilise biological domain knowledge, i.e. gene mentions also known as protein or gene names in the articles, to address the problem. We put forward a new gene mention order-based approach that highlights the important role of gene mentions to represent the texts. Furthermore, we also incorporate the information concerning gene mentions into a novel feature weighting scheme called Gene Mention-based Term Frequency (GMTF). By conducting experiments, we show that using the proposed representation and weighting schemes, our Interaction Article Classifier (IACer) performs better than other leading systems for the moment.

Orthogonal X-rays and the IBA Digital Image Positioning System (DIPS) were used for setup correction prior to treatment and were repeated after treatment delivery. Following a rationale for margin estimates similar to that of van Herk,((1)) the daily post-treatment DIPS data were analyzed to determine if an adaptive radiotherapy plan was necessary. A Web application using ASP. NET MVC5, Entity Framework, and an SQL database was designed to automate this process. The designed features included state-of-the-art Web technologies, a domain model closely matching the workflow, a database-supporting concurrency and data mining, access to the DIPS database, secured user access and roles management, and graphing and analysis tools. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm allowed clean domain logic, unit testing, and extensibility. Client-side technologies, such as jQuery, jQuery Plug-ins, and Ajax, were adopted to achieve a rich user environment and fast response. Data models included patients, staff, treatment fields and records, correction vectors, DIPS images, and association logics. Data entry, analysis, workflow logics, and notifications were implemented. The system effectively modeled the clinical workflow and IGRT process.

Prediction of the scour depth around piers is complicated, and accurate results are rarely achieved by the existing models. Recently, data mining approaches such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems have been applied successfully to predict scour depth around hydraulic structures. In this study, an alternative robust data mining approach was used for the predictions of the scour depth around piers, and the results were compared with those of three empirical approaches. Performances of developed models were tested by experimental data sets collected in laboratory experiments and field measurements, together with existing empirical approaches. Statistical measures indicate that the proposed M5' model provides a better prediction of scour depth than the empirical approaches.

International guidelines recommend that breast care providers ascertain that mammography systems produce a constant high quality image, using as low a radiation dose as is reasonably achievable. The main purpose of this research is to develop a framework to monitor radiation dose and image quality in a mixed breast screening and diagnostic imaging environment using an automated tracking system. This study presents a module of this framework, consisting of a computerized system to measure the image quality of the American College of Radiology mammography accreditation phantom. The methods developed combine correlation approaches, matched filters, and data mining techniques. These methods have been used to analyze radiological images of the accreditation phantom. The classification of structures of interest is based upon reports produced by four trained readers. As previously reported, human observers demonstrate great variation in their analysis due to the subjectivity of human visual inspection. The software tool was trained with three sets of 60 phantom images in order to generate decision trees using the software WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis). When tested with 240 images during the classification step, the tool correctly classified 88%, 99%, and 98%, of fibers, speck groups and masses, respectively. The variation between the computer classification and human reading was comparable to the variation between human readers. This computerized system not only automates the quality control procedure in mammography, but also decreases the subjectivity in the expert evaluation of the phantom images.

Continuous improvements in lithography and processing performance over the past years have resulted in consequent overlay performance improvement for critical layers. Identification of the remaining factors causing systematic disturbances and inefficiencies will further reduce overlay. By building a context database, mappings between context, fingerprints and alignment & overlay metrology can be learned through techniques from pattern recognition and data mining (Fig. 1). [GRAPHICS] Figure 1. Building a context database that describes the life of a wafer in the scanner and the fab. We relate structure ('patterns') in the metrology data to relevant contextual factors. Once understood, these factors could be moved to the known effects (e.g. the presence of systematic fingerprints from reticle writing error or lens and reticle heating). Hence, we build up a knowledge base of known effects based on data. Outcomes from such an integral ('holistic') approach to lithography data analysis may be exploited in a model-based predictive overlay controller that combines feedback and feedforward control [1]. Hence, the available measurements from scanner, fab and metrology equipment are combined to reveal opportunities for further overlay improvement which would otherwise go unnoticed.

The paper aims to discuss data mining techniques based on statistical tools in medical data management in case of long-term diseases. The data collected from a population survey is the source for reasoning and identifying disease processes responsible for patient's illness and its symptoms, and prescribing a knowledge and decisions in course of action to correct patient's condition. The case considered as a sample of constructive approach to data management is a dependence of allergic diseases of chronic nature on some symptoms and environmental conditions. The knowledge summarized in a systematic way as accumulated experience constitutes to an experiential simplified model of the diseases with feature space constructed of small set of indicators. We have presented the model of disease-symptom-opinion with knowledge discovery for data management in healthcare. The feature is evident that the model is purely data-driven to evaluate the knowledge of the diseases' processes and probability dependence of future disease events on symptoms and other attributes. The example done from the outcomes of the survey of long-term (chronic) disease shows that a small set of core indicators as 4 or more symptoms and opinions could be very helpful in reflecting health status change over disease causes. Furthermore, the data driven understanding of the mechanisms of diseases gives physicians the basis for choices of treatment what outlines the need of data governance in this research domain of discovered knowledge from surveys.

Applications of data mining in Blood Transfusion Organizations could be useful for improving the performance of blood donation service. The aim of this research is the prediction of healthiness of blood donors in Blood Transfusion Organization (BTO). For this goal, three famous algorithms such as Decision Tree C4.5, Naive Bayesian classifier, and Support Vector Machine have been chosen and applied to a real database made of 11006 donors. Seven fields such as sex, age, job, education, marital status, type of donor, results of blood tests (doctors' comments and lab results about healthy or unhealthy blood donors) have been selected as input to these algorithms. The results of the three algorithms have been compared and an error cost analysis has been performed. According to this research and the obtained results, the best algorithm with low error cost and high accuracy is SVM. This research helps BTO to realize a model from blood donors in each area in order to predict the healthy blood or unhealthy blood of donors. This research could be useful if used in parallel with laboratory tests to better separate unhealthy blood.

As the most important indicator of sentiment, sentiment words which convey positive and negative polarity are quite instrumental for sentiment analysis. However, most of the existing methods for identifying polarity of sentiment words only consider the positive and negative polarity by the Cantor set, and no attention is paid to the fuzziness of the polarity intensity of sentiment words. In order to improve the performance, we propose a fuzzy computing model to identify the polarity of Chinese sentiment words in this paper. There are three major contributions in this paper. Firstly, we propose a method to compute polarity intensity of sentiment morphemes and sentiment words. Secondly, we construct a fuzzy sentiment classifier and propose two different methods to compute the parameter of the fuzzy classifier. Thirdly, we conduct extensive experiments on four sentiment words datasets and three review datasets, and the experimental results indicate that our model performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.

These changes have led to the strategic importance of water demand management. The aim is to provide water where and when it is required using the fewest resources. A key variable in this process is the demand forecasting. It is not sufficient to have long term forecasts, as the current context requires the continuous availability of reliable hourly predictions. This paper incorporates artificial intelligence to the subject, through an agent-based system, whose basis are complex forecasting methods (Box-Jenkins, Holt-Winters, multi-layer perceptron networks and radial basis function networks). The prediction system also includes data mining, oriented to the pre and post processing of data and to the knowledge discovery, and other agents. Thereby, the system is capable of choosing at every moment the most appropriate forecast, reaching very low errors. It significantly improves the results of the different methods separately.

Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) provides a potentially robust solution by leveraging label atlases via image registration and statistical fusion. We posit that the efficiency of atlas selection requires further exploration in the context of substantial registration errors. The selective and iterative method for performance level estimation (SIMPLE) method is a MAS technique integrating atlas selection and label fusion that has proven effective for prostate radiotherapy planning. Herein, we revisit atlas selection and fusion techniques for segmenting 12 abdominal structures using clinically acquired CT. Using a re-derived SIMPLE algorithm, we show that performance on multi-organ classification can be improved by accounting for exogenous information through Bayesian priors (so called context learning). These innovations are integrated with the joint label fusion (JLF) approach to reduce the impact of correlated errors among selected atlases for each organ, and a graph cut technique is used to regularize the combined segmentation. In a study of 100 subjects, the proposed method outperformed other comparable MAS approaches, including majority vote, SIMPLE, JLF, and the Wolz locally weighted vote technique. The proposed technique provides consistent improvement over state-of-the-art approaches (median improvement of 7.0% and 16.2% in DSC over JLF and Wolz, respectively) and moves toward efficient segmentation of large-scale clinically acquired CT data for biomarker screening, surgical navigation, and data mining.

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that dimensionality reduction can benefit from label information, via a joint estimation of predictors and target variables from a lowf-rank representation. In the light of such inspiration, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction which simultaneously reconstructs the predictors using matrix factorization and estimates the target variable via a dual-form maximum margin classifier from the latent space. Compared to existing studies which conduct the decomposition via linearly supervision of targets, our method reconstructs the labels using nonlinear functions. If the hyper-plane separating the class regions in the original data space is non-linear, then a nonlinear dimensionality reduction helps improving the generalization over the test instances. The joint optimization function is learned through a coordinate descent algorithm via stochastic updates. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to both classification in the original space (no reduction), classification after unsupervised reduction, and classification using linearly supervised projection.

Predicting Early Bulbar Decline in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Speech Subsystem Approach	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SPEAKING RATE; RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION; ARTICULATORY SPEED; ACOUSTIC ANALYSIS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; ALS; DYSARTHRIA; DETERIORATION; DIAGNOSIS; VOICE	Purpose. To develop a predictive model of speech loss in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on measures of respiratory, phonatory, articulatory, and resonatory functions that were selected using a data-mining approach. Method. Physiologic speech subsystem (respiratory, phonatory, articulatory, and resonatory) functions were evaluated longitudinally in 66 individuals with ALS using multiple instrumentation approaches including acoustic, aerodynamic, nasometeric, and kinematic. The instrumental measures of the subsystem functions were subjected to a principal component analysis and linear mixed effects models to derive a set of comprehensive predictors of bulbar dysfunction. These subsystem predictors were subjected to a Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the time until speech loss. Results. For amajority of participants, speech subsystem decline was detectible prior to declines in speech intelligibility and speaking rate. Among all subsystems, the articulatory and phonatory predictors were most responsive to early bulbar deterioration; and the resonatory and respiratory predictors were as responsive to bulbar decline as was speaking rate.

J	Castro, NC; Azevedo, PJ				Castro, Nuno C.; Azevedo, Paulo J.			Automatically estimating iSAX parameters	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Time series; data mining; representation; iSAX; parameters	TIME-SERIES	The Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (iSAX) is widely used in time series data mining. Its popularity arises from the fact that it largely reduces time series size, it is symbolic, allows lower bounding and is space efficient. However, it requires setting two parameters: the symbolic length and alphabet size, which limits the applicability of the technique. The optimal parameter values are highly application dependent. Typically, they are either set to a fixed value or experimentally probed for the best configuration. In this work we propose an approach to automatically estimate iSAX's parameters. The approach - AutoiSAX - not only discovers the best parameter setting for each time series in the database, but also finds the alphabet size for each iSAX symbol within the same word. It is based on simple and intuitive ideas from time series complexity and statistics. The technique can be smoothly embedded in existing data mining tasks as an efficient sub-routine. We analyze its impact in visualization interpretability, classification accuracy and motif mining. Our contribution aims to make iSAX a more general approach as it evolves towards a parameter-free method.

To gather the required information for developing prediction models, batches of 200 tomatoes (cv. Pannovy) harvested at two maturity stages, were stored at standard condition up to four weeks. During storage, the modulus of elasticity, moisture content, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, hyperspectral data, and backscattering images were acquired on 40 tomatoes at regular intervals of one week. After extracting the spectral data from 40 points on each sample, they were subjected to preprocessing operations. Several feature selection techniques, including filter (Relief F, Fisher-Score, and t-Score) and wrapper (genetic algorithm) methods were used to find the sensitive wavelengths for each fruit quality parameter. With the novel strategy used, the wavelengths found by the fusion of genetic algorithm and t-Score techniques showed good prediction performance for all considered qualitative parameters. In order to verify the usefulness of selected wavelengths, backscattering and multispectral imaging techniques were applied. The artificial neural network produced the calibration models which gave a reasonably good correlation for estimating the modulus of elasticity, soluble solid content, and titratable acidity at 660 nm and moisture content at 830 nm of tomato from backscattering images. The correlation coefficient between the multispectral and backscattering imaging prediction results and reference measurement results were 0.952 and 0.891 for modulus of elasticity, 0.727 and 0.539 for moisture content, 0.736 and 0.561 for soluble solid content, and 0.811 and 0.706 for titratable acidity, respectively.

Past discoveries of bioactive natural products have relied on serendipity, and these compounds serve as inspiration for the generation of analogs with desired physicochemical properties. Bioactive natural products with therapeutic potential are abundantly available in nature and some of them are beyond exploration by conventional methods. The effectiveness of computational approaches as versatile tools for facilitating drug discovery and development has been recognized for decades, without exception, in the case of natural products. In the post-genomic era, scientists are bombarded with data produced by advanced technologies. Thus, rendering these data into knowledge that is interpretable and meaningful becomes an essential issue. In this regard, computational approaches utilize the existing data to generate knowledge that provides valuable understanding for addressing current problems and guiding the further research and development of new natural-derived drugs. Furthermore, several medicinal plants have been continuously used in many traditional medicine systems since antiquity throughout the world, and their mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the utilization of computational approaches and advanced synthetic techniques would yield great benefit to improving the world's health population and well-being.

Furthermore, the desire to protect user privacy has prevented the retention of data that could be used to correlate library data to non-library data. The research team used data mining to determine library use patterns and to determine whether library use correlated to students' grade point average. Design/methodology/approach - A research team collected and analyzed data from the libraries, registrar and human resources. All data sets were uploaded into a single, secure data warehouse, allowing them to be analyzed and correlated. Findings - The analysis revealed patterns of library use by academic department, patterns of book use over 20 years and correlations between library use and grade point average. Research limitations/implications - Analysis of more narrowly defined user populations and collections will help develop targeted outreach efforts and manage the print collections. The data used are from one university; therefore, similar research is needed at other institutions to determine whether these findings are generalizable. Practical implications - The unexpected use of the central library by those affiliated with law resulted in cross-education of law and central library staff. Management of the print collections and user outreach efforts will reflect more nuanced selection of subject areas and departments. Originality/value - A model is suggested for campus partnerships that enables data mining of sensitive library and campus information.

These devices provide a growing massive data that far exceeds the analytical ability of a professional doctor. The computer-assisted analysis of biomedical data has become an essential tool in medicine diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Due to the advantages of discrete, noise elimination and dimensionality reduction, symbolic representation of biomedical data has attracted great interest. The symbolization results provide efficiently performing at data mining, such as pattern discovery, anomaly detection and association rules mining, so we want to use the method to improving the biomedical data classification. METHODS: In this paper, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method, called Trend Feature Symbolic Approximation (TFSA). RESULTS: The TFSA focuses on retaining most of the original series' trend features, and it also very suitable for subsequent mining work, such as association rules mining. CONCLUSION: The TFSA provides the lower bounding guarantee and the experimental results show that comparing with some existing methods, its classification accuracy is improved.

When searching for the coexpression genes, the data mining process is largely affected by selection of algorithms. Thus, it is highly desirable to provide multiple options of algorithms in the user-friendly analytical toolkit to explore the gene expression signatures. For this purpose, we developed GESearch, an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, which is written in MATLAB and supports a variety of gene expression data files. This analytical toolkit provides four models, including the mean, the regression, the delegate, and the ensemble models, to identify the coexpression genes, and enables the users to filter data and to select gene expression patterns by browsing the display window or by importing knowledge-based genes. Subsequently, the utility of this analytical toolkit is demonstrated by analyzing two sets of real-life microarray datasets from cell-cycle experiments. Overall, we have developed an interactive GUI toolkit that allows for choosing multiple algorithms for analyzing the gene expression signatures.

The current Granger causality analysis method can just perform effectively in dealing with the two-variable causality test, and thus it could lead to the confusion between direct cause and indirect cause and also pseudo-cause problems due to the homologous data. In order to solve the flaws considered above, an improved method is here proposed by introducing additional variables to the original Granger test equation and defining a new test statistic through Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, a simulation analysis for validation and an empirical analysis in stock market risk transmission or application were both made. Both the results demonstrate that the improved method is able to avoid the confusions caused by the current method and also capable of finding the risk conduction path clearly.

Data mining approaches offer the methodology and technology to transform these heterogeneous data into meaningful information for decision making. This paper studies data mining applications in healthcare. Mainly, we study k-means clustering algorithms on large datasets and present an enhancement to k-means clustering, which requires k or a lesser number of passes to a dataset. The proposed algorithm, which we call G-means, utilizes a greedy approach to produce the preliminary centroids and then takes k or lesser passes over the dataset to adjust these center points. Our experimental results, which were used in an increasing manner on the same dataset, show that G-means outperforms k-means in terms of entropy and F-scores. The experiments also yield better results for G-means in terms of the coefficient of variance and the execution time.

The safety of railway operation is of great concern for the whole country. Railway track irregularity is a potential threat to safety of operation and comfort of passengers, and remains a challenging issue for researchers and engineers. Currently, track irregularity data are recorded by various sensors in the comprehensive inspection cars in China. To reveal relations between the operation of high-speed trains and the track geometry, the data mining and random modeling of track irregularity are needed. In this paper, different methods to evaluate the track irregularities are presented at first. A case study of a section in Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway is studied using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. Track geometries that are a representation of this railway network are generated along with statistical and frequency validations. As an application based on generated random track geometries, accelerations of train body under different traveling velocities are calculated and analyzed using a simulation model.

J	Okazaki, S; Diaz-Martin, AM; Rozano, M; Menendez-Benito, HD				Okazaki, Shintaro; Diaz-Martin, Ana M.; Rozano, Mercedes; David Menendez-Benito, Hector			Using Twitter to engage with customers: a data mining approach	INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Algorithms; Data analysis; Marketing theory; Customer service management; Communications technology; Social networks	SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC; WORD-OF-MOUTH; SOCIAL NETWORK; COMMUNITIES; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; CREATION; POWER; EWOM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore customer engagement in Twitter via data mining. Design/methodology/approach - This study's intended contributions are twofold: to find a clear connection among customer engagement, presumption, and Web 2.0 in a context of service-dominant (S-D) logic; and to identify social networks created by prosumers. To this end, the study employed data mining techniques. Tweets about IKEA were used as a sample. The resulting algorithm based on 300 tweets was applied to 4,000 tweets to identify the patterns of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). Findings - Social networks created in IKEA's tweets consist of three forms of eWOM: objective statements, subjective statements, and knowledge sharing. Most objective statements are disseminated from satisfied or neutral customers, while subjective statements are disseminated from dissatisfied or neutral customers. Satisfied customers mainly carry out knowledge sharing, which seems to reflect presumption behavior. Research limitations/implications - This study provides partial evidence of customer engagement and presumption in IKEA's tweets. The results indicate that there are three forms of eWOM in the networks: objective statements, subjective statements, and knowledge sharing. It seems that IKEA successfully engaged customers in knowledge sharing, while negative opinions were mainly disseminated in a limited circle. Practical implications - Firms should make more of an effort to identify prosumers via data mining, since these networks are hidden behind "self-proclaimed" followers. Prosumers differ from opinion leaders, since they actively participate in product development. Thus, firms should seek prosumers in order to more closely fit their products to consumer needs. As a practical strategy, firms could employ celebrities for promotional purposes and use them as a platform to convert their followers to prosumers. In addition, firms are encouraged to make public how they resolve problematic customer complaints so that customers can feel they are a part of firms' service development. Originality/value - Theoretically, the study makes unique contributions by offering a synergic framework of S-D logic and Web 2.0. The conceptual framework collectively relates customer engagement, presumption, and Web 2.0 to social networks.

To accomplish this task, data mining techniques and semantic web technologies can be used to retrieve user relevant documents. In this work we extract author supplied keywords from a collection of computer science articles, which has a strong influence on the topic of the article when compared with other words. For these keywords term weight is computed using Fuzzy Logic which uses three criteria namely mapping with concept in domain ontology, keyword frequency in the title and keyword frequency in abstract. Using domain ontology, keywords of each document with their term weights are represented hierarchically as XML documents and they are clustered. The experimental results show that the proposed technique yields better precision and recall rates when compared with some of the existing approaches.

The process of extracting such rules from a given dataset is called association rule mining (ARM). The work aims at effective utilization of all the cores present in the system with less time wastage and also balance the workload among them. Full fledged use of system resources and load balance can be achieved by perfect scheduling and providing efficient parallel algorithms. This paper discusses such a parallel ARM algorithm and rule generation based on the frequent combinations obtained. As the rules generated are also more in number as well as redundant, insignificant, and unproductive, it is compulsory to filter and refine the rules.

Popular researches based on the evolutionary processes have been dealing with the universal criteria. So the need for location-dependent population searches lead to the research based on the cultural traits of the individual, i.e., memetic computational applications. In the telecom sector, the decision-making process of the corporate customers is taken for study with the applications based on the memetic computation. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyze the customer attitude with objective, subjective, and inter-subjective criteria in the multi-attribute deterministic environment. The two metrics, viz. value of business (VOB) and number of services (NOS), are taken as reference using the memetic attributes. Experimental analysis shows that with respect to the telecom sector, memetic framework has improvised the corporate customer attitude toward the services in the betterment of customer relation management.

There are several approaches including data mining, neural network, naive basis, etc., that are applied for finding the intrusions. But there is still a need for betterment in this direction. Our paper focuses on the limitation faced in the traditional approach. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid framework based on association rule mining (ARM) and ant colony optimization (ACO). Combining the properties of association and ant colony may provide better classification in comparison with the previous methodology. In our approach, we consider the dataset of NSL-KDD. It is a dataset that does not include redundant record, and test sets are reasonable which is mentioned in [1]. Then, we consider equal proportion of 10,000 dataset from the whole dataset. We first divide it into two parts based on normal establishment and termination. Then, we consider the normal dataset, and for finding the intrusions, we calculate the support value based on the matching factor. Then, we apply ACO technique to check the global optimum value. If the value crosses the limit value, then the node will be added into the final attack category. Finally, based on the attack category of denial of service (DoS), user to root (U2R), remote to user (R2L), and probing (Probe), we find the final classification. Our results support better classification in comparison with the previous techniques used in several research papers as per our study.

As Grid computing is the ultimate solution believed to meet the ever-expanding computational needs of organizations, analysis of the various possible risks to evaluate and develop solutions to resolve these risks is needed. For correctly predicting the risk environment, we made a comparative analysis of various machine learning modeling methods on a dataset of risk factors. First we conducted an online survey with international experts about the various risk factors associated with grid computing. Second we assigned numerical ranges to each risk factor based on a generic grid environment. We utilized data mining tools to pick the contributing attributes that improve the quality of the risk assessment prediction process. The empirical results illustrate that the proposed framework is able to provide risk assessment with a good accuracy.

Ontology matching plays an integral role in whole integration process by identifying the similarity measure between source and target ontologies using various matching techniques, e.g. Element-level techniques and Structure level techniques. The scope of this paper is to discuss existing ontology matching techniques and propose a multi-strategy ontology matching approach. In Proposed algorithm is a multi-strategy matching approach, where multiple similarity measure are combined and finally an ontology tree based on the binary tree is created. Ontology mapping is used for creating ontology binary tree. The hybrid approach of Ontology integration performs significantly better than its predecessor with single similarity measures.

Mining these patterns from the evolving data streams is a big challenge, due the characteristics of data streams like high arrival rate, unbounded and gigantic in size, etc. Commonly there are three window models (landmark window, sliding window, time fading window) used in data streams. However, in most applications, users are interested in recent happenings. Hence, sliding window model has attracted high interest among three. Many approaches have been proposed based on the sliding window model. However, most of the approaches are based on level-wise candidate generation and text approach. In view of this, we propose an efficient one pass, tree based approach for mining high utility patterns over data streams. Experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than the level-wise approach.

But this algorithm has several limitations due to repeated database scans and its weak association rule analysis. In modern world of large databases, efficiency of traditional apriori algorithm would reduce manifolds. In this paper, we proposed a new modified apriori approach by cutting down the repeated database scans and improving association analysis of traditional apriori algorithm to cluster the web documents. Further we improve those clusters by applying Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), K-Means and Vector Space Model (VSM) techniques separately. We use Classic3 and Classic4 datasets of Cornell University having more than 10,000 documents and run both traditional apriori and our modified apriori approach on it. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the traditional apriori algorithm in terms of database scan and improvement on association of analysis.

The performance of these algorithms converges to local minima depends highly on initial cluster centroids. In order to overcome local minima apply evolutionary and population based methods like Genetic Algorithms and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). The GA and TLBO is applied to solve the challenges of partitioning clustering method K-means like initial centroid selection and compare the results with using GA and TLBO.

Feature Subset Selection becomes an important preprocessing part in the area of data mining. Hence, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, and to improve the performance, document preprocessing, feature selection and attribute reduction becomes an important parameter. To overcome the problem of document preprocessing, feature selection and attribute reduction, a theoretic framework based on hybrid Information gain-rough set (IG-RS) model is proposed. In this paper, firstly the document preprocessing is prepared; secondly an information gain is used to rank the importance of the feature. In the third stage a neighborhood rough set model is used to evaluate the lower and upper approximation value. In the fourth stage an attribute reduction algorithm based on rough set model is proposed. Experimental results show that the hybrid IG-RS model based method is more flexible to deal with documents.

Data sets are of many types like categorical/nominal, ordinal, binary (symmetric or asymmetric), ratio and interval scaled variables. The present scenario of Variety of latest approaches of unsupervised classification are Swarm Optimization based, Customer Segmentation based, Soft Computing methods like GA based, Entropy based and Fuzzy based methods and hierarchical approaches have two serious bottlenecks. Either they are hybrid mathematical techniques or large computation demanding which increases their complexity and hence compromises with accuracy. The proposed methodology deals with this problem with a newly and efficiently generated algorithm and shapes a better, lesser complex and computationally demanding pseudo codes which may lead in future a revolutionary approach. We work upon multivariate data set. In case of nominal variables, we quantify the dataset by different methods to construct combined category quantifications and plot the object scores. Here we have proposed an iterative procedure to calculate the cluster centers and the object memberships. To support our approach, a numerical experiment has been demonstrated. For all mixed variety of attributes Binary, Interval and Ratio scaled along with ordinal type attributes, an efficient methodology by Divide and Conquer (D&C) approach has been designed and has been given in this write up. We will separately calculate the grouping criteria and objective function and will sum up them to get combined function. The better groups may be obtained my maximizing this function.

Rather, IT can be used as an enabler to meet goals, targets and position the organization in the minds of the customer. A Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable higher level services from more primitive business processes. The result is a flexible, agile organization. However, in some cases, without a business model, an SOA can be implemented but the result is islands of incompatible services. In the era of data analytics, the evolution of business intelligence has assumed a more dominant role. Proponents argue that Business Intelligence subsumes SOA. Other practitioners argue that Business Intelligence (BI) and SOA are distinct from each other as each aims to deliver different perspectives to an organization. This chapter challenges this view by developing a framework where both SOA and BI are pivotal to delivering the business model. The analytics, business intelligence and data mining handshake with the SOA, allowing decision makers to plan, coordinate and control resources to meet the goals, targets and performance measures set for the organization. Business Intelligence and SOA need not operate on different levels for an organisation. In an era where companies are trying to go from barely surviving IT expenses towards developing an IT portfolio, the more options for technologies supporting asset data management, warehousing and mining to interact and co-exist are necessary. Putting aside arguments of Business Intelligence versus SOA, we propose that they can handshake and bring out the collaborative synergies to enable organizational decision making to address the competitive challenges in today's global marketplace.

An unexpected failure of a power transformer can cause severe production damage and significant loss throughput the power grid. In order to prevent power facilities from malfunctions and breakdowns, the development of real-time monitoring and health prediction tools are of great interests to both researchers and practitioners. An advanced monitoring tool performs real-time monitoring of key parameters to detect signals of potential failure through data mining techniques and prediction models. Asset managers use the result to develop a suitable maintenance and repair strategy for failure prevention. Principal component analysis (PCA) and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) are the algorithms adopted in the research. This chapter utilizes industrial power transformers' historical data from Taiwan and Australia to train and test the failure prediction models and to verify the proposed methodology. First, PCA detects the conditions of transformers by identifying the state of dissolved gasses. Then, the BP-ANN health prediction model is trained using the key factor values. The integrated engineering asset management database includes nine gases in oil as input factors (N-2, O-2, CO2, CO, H-2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C2H2). After applying the principal components algorithm, the research identifies five factors from the Taiwan operational transformer data and six factors from the Australia data. The integrated PCA and BP-ANN fault diagnosis system yields effective and accurate predictions when tested using Taiwan and Australia data. The accuracy rates are much higher (i.e., 92 and 96 % respectively) when compared to previous result of 69 and 75 %. This research is benchmarked against the DGA heuristic approaches including IEEE's Doernenburg and Rogers and IEC's Duval Triangle for the experimental fault diagnoses.	[Trappey, Amy J.

The offshore wind power (OWP) has been promoted and encouraged by many countries for their renewable energy development. This research focuses on systematically discover the profile of OWP technology innovation extracted, analysed and synthesized from world patent databases dynamically using text and data mining techniques. In real time, all related patents are searched and collected. Afterward, the research builds an OWP ontology schema by identifying the OWP technical domain structure, the core concepts, and the relationships between the concepts. The ontology schema is constructed and refined dynamically using key phrases automatically extracted from patents and verified by domain experts. The research also emphasizes on the control of risk and reliable factors when evaluating the offshore wind power development. Thus, the research applies patent indicators, i.e., the patent family, the growth rates of domain technologies, the reference and citation network, the technology and function matrix, and the patent litigation information, to derive the OWP R&D landscape and strategy. After building the OWP patent knowledge base (KB), the potentials of OWP development opportunities for a specific region can be clearly identified with reliable measures based on patent map informatics.

General requirements for an advanced ABIAA system present significant challenges in architectural design, computing resources, data volumes, workflow efficiency, data mining and analysis algorithms, and database structures. These sophisticated ABI software systems must include advanced algorithms that automatically flag activities of interest in less time and within larger data volumes than can be processed by human analysts. In doing this, they must also maintain the geospatial accuracy necessary for cross-correlation of multi-intelligence data sources. Historically, serial architectural workflows have been employed in ABIAA system design for tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination. These simpler architectures may produce implementations that solve short term requirements; however, they have serious limitations that preclude them from being used effectively in an automated ABIAA system with multiple data sources. This paper discusses modern ABIAA architectural considerations providing an overview of an advanced ABIAA system and comparisons to legacy systems. It concludes with a recommended strategy and incremental approach to the research, development, and construction of a fully automated ABIAA system.

Software understanding: Automatic classification of software identifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Automatic software understanding; data mining; text classification; software engineering	NAMES	Identifier names (e.g., packages, classes, methods, variables) are one of most important software comprehension sources. Identifier names need to be analyzed in order to support collaborative software engineering and to reuse source codes. Indeed, they convey domain concept of softwares. For instance, "getMinimumSupport" would be associated with association rule concept in data mining softwares, while some are difficult to recognize such as the case of mixing parts of words (e.g., "initFeatSet"). We thus propose methods for assisting automatic software understanding by classifying identifier names into domain concept categories. An innovative solution based on data mining algorithms is proposed. Our approach aims to learn character patterns of identifier names. The main challenges are (1) to automatically split identifier names into relevant constituent subnames (2) to build a model associating such a set of subnames to predefined domain concepts. For this purpose, we propose a novel manner for splitting such identifiers into their constituent words and use N-grams based text classification to predict the related domain concept. In this article, we report the theoretical method and the algorithms we propose, together with the experiments run on real software source codes that show the interest of our approach.

J	Ghazanfar, MA				Ghazanfar, Mustansar Ali			Experimenting switching hybrid recommender systems	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Recommender systems; collaborative filtering; singular value decomposition (SVD); machine learning classifiers; content-based filtering	CLASSIFIERS; NEWS	Recommender systems employ machine learning and data mining techniques for filtering unseen information and can predict whether a user would like a given resource. To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Moreover, machine learning classifiers can be used for recommendation by training them on items' content information. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialisation, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed unique generalised switching hybrid recommendation algorithms that combine machine learning classifiers with the collaborative filtering recommender systems. We also provide various variants of the proposed algorithm by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based recommendations, utilising SVD over collaborative filtering, and utilising SVD combined with Expected Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Experimental results on two different datasets, show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and provide better performance - in terms of accuracy and coverage - than other algorithms while at the same time eliminate some recorded problems with the recommender systems.

The primary objective of the design in the present study is that the sufficient down range and the duration time in the lower thermosphere are achieved for aurora scientific observation whereas the initial gross weight is held down. Multidisciplinary design optimization and data mining were performed by using evolutionary hybrid computation under the conditions that polypropylene as solid fuel and liquid oxygen as liquid oxidizer were adopted and that single-time ignition is implemented in sequence. Consequently, the design information regarding the tradeoffs and the behaviors of the design variables in the design space was obtained in order to quantitatively differentiate the advantage of hybrid rocket engine.

However, there are several risks involved in using a cloud environment. To make the decision of migrating to cloud services there is a great need to assess the various risks involved. The main target of risk assessment is to define appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating those risks. We conducted a survey and formulated different associated risk factors to simulate the data from the experiments. We applied different feature selection algorithms such as Best-First, and random search algorithms methods to reduce the attributes to 3, 4, and 9 attributes, which enabled us to achieve better accuracy. Further, seven function approximation algorithms, namely Isotonic Regression, Randomizable Filter Classifier, Kstar, Extra Tree, IBK, multilayered perceptron, and SMOreg were selected after experimenting with more than thirty different algorithms.

Initially, the k-means clustering method was applied to group variables rather than observations in the design of questionnaires. The first draft of a questionnaire contained more questions than is prudent to ensure a good response rate. When the draft questionnaire is tested on a smaller number of respondents (75 samples), it was observed that the responses to certain groups of questions are highly correlated. Hence, clustering analysis was applied to identify groups of questions that are most predominant in contributing to the reduction in air pollution in Chennai. Thus, the selected questions were used for survey purpose to study the acceptability among different sectors of people. Primary data were collected from 110 people belonging to different sectors of Chennai using questionnaire method. In the second level of cluster analysis, the cluster analysis was carried out to assign observations to groups. These results were further applied to identify the recommendation of suitable transport policies to mitigate vehicular pollution. This method of applying clustering techniques in two levels of the questionnaire analysis has been newly proposed in this paper.

These problems require the estimation of a set of model parameters or state variables that provide the best possible solution to a predefined cost or objective function, or a set of optimal trade-off values in the case of two or more conflicting objectives. Locating global optimal solutions becomes challenging especially in the presence of high dimensionality, nonlinear parameter interaction, insensitivity, and multi-modality of the objective function. These conditions make it very difficult for any search algorithm to find high-quality solutions quickly without getting stuck in local optima. Unfortunately, these difficulties are frequently encountered in real-world optimization problems when traversing the search space en route to the global optimum. Small-world PSO has been proven to be effective in solving global function optimization problems. After all, every optimization algorithm has to be applied to some real-world problems. This paper evaluates the performance of small-world PSO algorithm on two real-world function optimization problems. Comparative study with state of the art demonstrates the effectiveness of small-world PSO.	[Vora, Megha; Mirnalinee, T.

Recently, frequent patterns in transactional medical databases that occur periodically are exploited to know the temporal aspects of various diseases. In this paper we modified K-means algorithm to extract yearly and monthly periodic frequent patterns from medical datasets. The datasets contain electronic health records of 2012 and 2013. Periodical frequent patterns between these years and monthly patterns were extracted using the proposed methodology. To achieve this we used the notion of making temporal view that is instrumental in adapting K-means for this purpose. We built a prototype to test the algorithm and the empirical results reveal that the proposed methodology for knowledge discovery related periodic frequent diseases is useful. The application can be reused to have lasting implications on health care industry for improving quality of services with strategic and expert decision making.	[Khaleel, Mohammed Abdul; Dash, G.

One of the utilities of mining social data is learning collective behavior which helps in taking well informed decisions pertaining to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and such real world applications. In multi mode while studying the collective behavior using edge centric approach, object heterogeneity is a problem. In this paper, we propose a scheme temporal regularized evolutionary multimode clustering algorithm which can address object heterogeneity in social media with multi-mode more effectively.

Outlier detection for data mining is normally based on distance, clustering and spatial methods. This paper deals with locating outliers in large, multidimensional datasets. The k-means clustering algorithm partitions a dataset into a number of clusters, and then the results are used to find out the outliers from each cluster, using any one of the outlier's detection methods. The k-means clustering algorithm is enhanced in three manners. The first is by using a different distance metric. The second and third enhancements are brought forward by automating the process of estimating 'k' value and initial seed selection using the enhanced clustering algorithm. Outliers are detected in the drinking water dataset after the clustering process is over. The results show that classification accuracy, speeds are improved and normalized root mean square error is reduced.

The IPSO is based on the global search properties of the traditional PSO and focuses on the suitable balance of the investigation and exploitation of the particles in the swarm for effective solution. During IPSO iterations, with increase in possible generations, the search space is decreased. Motivated from successful use of IPSO in many applications, in this paper, it is an attempt to design a MLP classifier with a hybrid back propagation learning based on IPSO. The proposed method has been tested using benchmark dataset from UCI machine learning repository and performances are compared with MLP, GA based MLP and PSO based MLP.	[Kanungo, D.

It is the serious health problem and leading cause of death for middle aged women. Mammography is one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast cancer. But mammograms are the most difficult images for interpretation and may lead to false diagnosis. Therefore there is a significant need of automatic extraction of the actionable information from the mammogram data in order to ensure improvement in diagnosis. To address this issue, we have proposed an automatic classification system for breast cancer using Texture Based Associative Classifier (TBAC).

Moreover, many contributions have been made in two directions: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO). But, some limitations in both the algorithms (complicated operator like crossover and mutation in GA and early convergence in PSO), are the major restricted boundaries for solving complex problems. In this paper, a hybridization of Particle swarm optimization and Genetic algorithm has been proposed with the back propagation learning based Multilayer perceptron neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through a no. of simulation steps with the help of the benchmark datasets considered from UCI machine learning repository. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other standard algorithms to show the steadiness and efficiency as well as statically significant.

SNA has led the law enforcement agencies to study the behavior of terrorist networks for the identification of relationships that may exist between nodes. Recently, Terrorist Network Mining (special branch of SNA) has been in vogue in Data mining community because of its ability to identify key nodes present in the network. This paper proposes a new approach for Terrorist network mining. The proposed work is carried out in two phases. The first phase proposes Genetic based optimization mechanism. Proposed mechanism is suitable for effective optimization of large social network containing terrorist and non-terrorist nodes. During optimization process removal of non-terrorist nodes from the network has been performed and resultant represents the reduced graph containing only the set of potential nodes. The second phase proposes a weighted degree centrality measure (considers frequency of communication) for effectively neutralizing of the terrorist network.

In data mining Classification is a supervised learning that can be used to design models describing important data classes, where class attribute is involved in the construction of the classifier. Naive Bayes is very simple, most popular, highly efficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition. Medical data bases are high volume in nature. If the data set contains redundant and irrelevant attributes, classification may produce less accurate result. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in India as well as different parts of world. Hence there is a need to define a decision support system that helps clinicians to take precautionary measures. In this paper we propose a new algorithm which combines Naive Bayes with genetic algorithm for effective classification. Experimental results shows that our algorithm enhance the accuracy in diagnosis of heart disease.

Higher order neural network (HONN) has the ability to expand the input representation space, perform high learning capabilities that require less memory in terms of weights and nodes and have been utilized in many complex data mining problems. To capture the extreme volatility, nonlinearity and uncertainty associated with stock data, this paper considered a HONN, called Pi-Sigma Neural Network (PSNN), for prediction of closing prices of five real stock markets. The tunable weights are optimized by Gradient Descent (GD) and a global search technique, Genetic Algorithm (GA).

Outliers do not have a clear distinction with respect to regular samples in the dataset. Analysis and knowledge extraction from data with outliers lead to ambiguity and confused conclusions. Therefore, there is a need for detection of outliers as a pre-processing stage for data mining. In a multidimensional perspective, outlier detection is a challenging issue as an object may deviate in one subspace and may appear perfectly regular in another subspace. In this paper, an ensemble meta-algorithm has been proposed to analyze and vote the samples for outlier identification in multidimensional subspaces. Cook's distance, a regression based model has been applied to detect the outliers voted by the ensemble meta-algorithm. Extensive experimentation on real datasets demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed system in detecting outliers.	[Kumari, M. Ashwini; Bhargavi, M.

It is the process of filtering, storing and organizing information in our brains. Learners differ by the ways in which perceive, process and receive information. Based on the means of processing the information, learners are considered to possess their own style of learning. The learning process tends to be more effective if the knowledge is disseminated to the learners in their own learning styles. In order to disseminate knowledge in different ways, learners should be categorized based on their styles and they should be trained in an appropriate manner. This paper proposes a novel method to detect the relationships between different dimensions in Felder-Silverman learning style model using a data mining technique known as association rules, thereby providing a simpler way to disseminate the knowledge in the context of technology enhanced learning.

This has also raised many debates such as rights of privacy, legality and ethics, and rights to non-disclosure of information. It has someway opened a Pandora's box. Only, time will tell whether it is on the whole destructive or constructive; nonetheless, technology is not as such absolutely constructive or destructive; it only depends on how it is brought into use.

We present our methodology and some preliminary results of its application to new movie launches through the analysis of about 2 million downloaded in the US in 72 hours around the events in a 4 months period. Design/methodology/approach - We use a combination of semantic and topological analyses that demonstrated good results identifying conversational patterns to be used not only to assess how people feel about the event but also to develop a better understanding about what people say and how people talk about the event. To obtain the what people say, the methodology and the tools automatically analyze the conversations, with the support of visualization components. The how people talk is addressed detecting patterns in the conversations and evaluating the correlation of those patterns with performance indicators. Structure and contents are analyzed through a set of semantic and topological metrics to assess the content generated in different conversations. Metrics are then collected in a single dataset, which is later used to train and test a data mining model. Originality/value - Several commercial platforms are available to retrieve and assess to some extent this collective judgment through sentiment analysis. Sentiment, however, just measures how the "crowd" feels about a product, but does not offer insight on the structure and the determinants of the customers' preferences nor provides indications about future behavior. Our challenge is instead to dig deeper into Twitter streams to capture and assess structured contents that are embedded in them through an analytical and quantitative approach. Practical implications - The elicitation of organized content from Twitter streams could support market analysts to achieve a better understanding of consumers' perceptions and to better manage the reach-richness trade off between qualitative and quantitative market analyses. An additional practical use of our study can be to find a way to ascertain the presence of given semantic patterns in Twitter streams that can be predictive of early market success for a new product.

Unfold Principal Component Analysis and Functional Unfold Principal Component Analysis for Online Plant Stress Detection	IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MODELLING IN FRUIT RESEARCH AND ORCHARD MANAGEMENT	Acta Horticulturae		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management	JUN 19-23, 2011	Saint Jean sur Richelieu, CANADA	Int Soc Horticultural Sci		drought stress; statistical process control; functional data analysis; stem diameter variations; Solanum lycopersicum; Malus domestica	STEM DIAMETER VARIATIONS; WATER STATUS; SAP FLOW; MULTIVARIATE	To be able to develop accurate plant-based irrigation scheduling tools, automatic and early detection of plant drought stress is of great importance. In this context, measurements of stem diameter variations are very promising as a source of information. These measurements are sensitive for drought stress, but also depend on changing microclimatic conditions. Specific data mining techniques, such as Unfold Principal Component Analysis (UPCA), have been developed to facilitate monitoring and diagnosing of such large-dimensional data sets. A UPCA model is used in this study to determine whether the measured stem diameter variations deviate from normal conditions due to drought stress. A newer technique, Functional Unfold Principal Component Analysis (FUPCA), combines functional data analysis with UPCA. The function parameters instead of the original data are then analysed by UPCA. The resulting FUPCA model is less complex and more robust compared to the original UPCA model. Moreover, FUPCA can handle days with missing data straightforwardly. The performances of UPCA and FUPCA models for online plant stress detection were investigated and compared to each other. Two pilot-scale setups were conducted: one with an herbaceous and one with a woody species. For both species, UPCA and FUPCA were shown to be applicable for stress detection. Both allowed successful detection days before visible symptoms appeared, while FUPCA exhibited a lesser parametric complexity.

Towards an Automated Intelligence Product Generation Capability	NEXT-GENERATION ANALYST III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Next-Generation Analyst III	APR 20-21, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Data Mining; Learning and Discovery tools; Integrated Tool environments; Human-Computer Interaction		Creating intelligence information products is a time consuming and difficult process for analysts faced with identifying key pieces of information relevant to a complex set of information requirements. Complicating matters, these key pieces of information exist in multiple modalities scattered across data stores, buried in huge volumes of data. This results in the current predicament analysts find themselves; information retrieval and management consumes huge amounts of time that could be better spent performing analysis. The persistent growth in data accumulation rates will only increase the amount of time spent on these tasks without a significant advance in automated solutions for information product generation. We present a product generation tool, Automated PrOduct Generation and Enrichment (APOGEE), which aims to automate the information product creation process in order to shift the bulk of the analysts' effort from data discovery and management to analysis. APOGEE discovers relevant text, imagery, video, and audio for inclusion in information products using semantic and statistical models of unstructured content. APOGEEs mixed-initiative interface, supported by highly responsive backend mechanisms, allows analysts to dynamically control the product generation process ensuring a maximally relevant result. The combination of these capabilities results in significant reductions in the time it takes analysts to produce information products while helping to increase the overall coverage. Through evaluation with a domain expert, APOGEE has been shown the potential to cut down the time for product generation by 20x. The result is a flexible end-to-end system that can be rapidly deployed in new operational settings.

In Persian, some words such as adverbs can freely be moved within a sentence without affecting its correctness or meaning. In this paper, we illustrate the robustness of dependency parsing against this particular problem by training two well-known dependency parsers, namely MST Parser and Malt Parser, using a Persian dependency corpus called Dadegan. We divided the corpus into two separate parts including only projective sentences and only non-projective sentences, which are corelated with the free word order property. As our results show, MST Parsing is not only more tolerant than Malt Parsing against the free word order problem, but it is also in general a more accurate technique.

As well as for conventional data, spatial data need to be analyzed so interesting information can be retrieved from them. Therefore, data clustering techniques can be used to extract clusters of a set of spatial data. However, current approaches do not consider the implicit semantics that exist between a region and an object's attributes. This paper presents an approach that enhances spatial data mining process, so they can use the semantic that exists within a region. A framework was developed, OntoSDM, which enables spatial data mining algorithms to communicate with ontologies in order to enhance the algorithm's result. The experiments demonstrated a semantically improved result, generating more interesting clusters, therefore reducing manual analysis work of an expert.

Updating Side Friction Factors for Design of Unpaved Roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Traction coefficients are used in the calculations required for safe geometric road design, including stopping sight distance and horizontal curve alignment. Friction factors are based on traction coefficients for low-volume roads provided in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (FS) Road Preconstruction Handbook and are also referenced by the AASHTO Guidelines for Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume Local Roads (ADT <= 400). These traction values are based on measurements from the 1950s to the 1970s. However, tire design, construction, and even test methods have changed considerably since then. To evaluate the validity of the design coefficients, and to determine replacement values or ranges, a literature search, data mining, and a limited test program were conducted by the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory and FS. This paper presents existing FS handbook values and design guidelines, updated values collected from the literature, and new measurements taken on gravel and snow-covered roads. For longitudinal friction traction, updated values are similar to the FS handbook values, except for asphalt and gravel, which has presented friction values up to 30% and 100% higher, respectively. Lateral traction shows even higher values for gravel and snow, being 2 to 2.5 times as high as the handbook's median values. Fortunately, these differences err on the side of safety. Future evaluations should consider the impact of the higher values on road design, operations, and economics to see whether a change is warranted. Testing of additional surfaces is recommended, as are measurements that use a wider range of tires and vehicles.

We suggest to build, directly out of probing data space, a theoretical framework enabling us to extract the manifold hidden relations (patterns) that exist among data, as correlations depending on the semantics generated by the mining context. The program, that is grounded in the recent innovative ways of integrating data into a topological setting, proposes the realization of a Topological Field Theory of Data, transferring and generalizing to the space of data notions inspired by physical (topological) field theories and harnesses the theory of formal languages to de fine the potential semantics necessary to understand the emerging patterns.

For that reason, data mining has been assisting physicians in decision making and to cope with the information overload. A considerable amount of literature has been available on medical data classification based on data mining techniques to automate or facilitating the delineation of images. However, from image formation to the final analysis, medical imaging is still facing challenges. New imaging procedures for classification could overcome the inefficiencies and provide more reliable information to the medical experts. Therefore, this paper assesses the performance of selected classification algorithms based on fuzzy soft set for classification of medical data. There are two concepts that underlie the classification in the fuzzy soft set theory namely: classification based on decision making problem and classification based on similarity between two fuzzy soft set. The selected algorithms are evaluated based on two criteria: accuracy and computational time. Moreover, the conducted experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of fuzzy soft set for medical data categorization.

This analysis mainly focuses on organizing the Indian judicial system which enables the lawyers and law students to access the constitutions details, code for civil and criminal procedure in an easier and faster way. In this work android is used as a medium for this analysis because smart phones are being used by 9 persons out of 10 in the legal society. The user of this application can search using keywords and all sections from the constitution relating to the keyword are displayed along with review of related procedures either civil procedure or criminal procedure as mentioned above. The major advantage of this application is that it reduces the time for the lawyers and law students to search using android phones rather than to do survey on books and materials related to their case.

So, travel agencies or tourism organizations must have a good planning and provide campaign for tourist's needs. This study proposes the usage of data mining for tourism industries in Thailand. Data clustering and association rule mining were chosen as the data mining methods in order to discover useful knowledge. Two-level clustering with decision tree bagging was applied to construct the segments of tourist. Apriori algorithm was then used to find the rules on each cluster. The experimental results indicated that the tourists data was separated into eleven differently segments and decision tree bagging for attributes weighting can enhance the quality of clusters. The eleven segments were analyzed in order to identify tourists' behavior patterns and their preferences. Association rule mining was applied to each segment in order to find the relationship among the features of tourist data. The rules were filtered again by experts. The clustering and association rule results can be served to tourism organization in order to support their strategic and market planning.

RAP2A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in the process of GTP binding and GTPase activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of RAP2A and its prognostic impact in patients with early and locoregionally advanced NPC. Methods: RAP2A immunohistochemistry was performed for 124 NPC patients who were receiving standard treatment and had no initial distal metastasis. We also performed Western blotting to evaluate the endogenous protein expression of RAP2A in NPC cells and non-neoplastic mucosal cells. The result of RAP2A expression was further correlated with clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMeFS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Results: High expression of RAP2A was significantly associated with advanced primary tumor status (P = 0.024) and advanced TNM stage (P = 0.006). In univariate analysis, high expression of RAP2A served as a significant prognostic factor for inferior DSS (P < 0.0001), DMeFS (P < 0.0001), and LRFS (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, RAP2A overexpression still independently predicted worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.976, P < 0.001), DMeFS (HR = 4.233, P < 0.001), and LRFS (HR = 4.156, P < 0.001). Moreover, Both HONE1 and TW01 NPC cells, but not non-neoplastic DOK cells demonstrated significantly increased RAP2A expression. Conclusion: Overexpression of RAP2A is associated with advanced disease status and may therefore be an important prognosticator for poor outcomes in NPC, as well as a potential therapeutic target to aid in developing effective treatment modalities.

The problem is exacerbated if the number of instances is large. Therefore, this paper concentrates on a double treatment iterative improvement algorithm with intelligent selection on composite neighbourhood structure to solve the attribute reduction problems and to obtain near optimal reducts. The algorithm works iteratively with only accepting an improved solution. The proposed approach has been tested on a set of 13 benchmark datasets taken from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository in line with the state-of-the-art methods. The 13 datasets have been chosen due to the differences in size and complexity in order to test the stability of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce competitive results for the tested datasets.

Some papers have presented several interestingness measure methods; the most typical are Support, Confidence, Lift, Improve, and so forth. But their limitations are obvious, like no objective criterion, lack of statistical base, disability of defining negative relationship, and so forth. This paper proposes three new methods, Bi-lift, Bi-improve, and Bi-confidence, for Lift, Improve, and Confidence, respectively. Then, on the basis of utility function and the executing cost of rules, we propose interestingness function based on profit (IFBP) considering subjective preferences and characteristics of specific application object. Finally, a novel measure framework is proposed to improve the traditional one through experimental analysis. In conclusion, the new methods and measure framework are prior to the traditional ones in the aspects of objective criterion, comprehensive definition, and practical application.

Unsupervised Learning for individual e-IQ & IQ relying on memory eliciting (i.e. scent, grandmother images) and IQ baseline profiles could further enhance the ability to uniquely identify and properly diagnose individuals. Sub-threshold changes in a common/probable biomedical biomarker (disorders) means that an individual remains healthy, while a martingale would require further investigation and more measurements taken to determine credibility. Empirical measurements of human actions can discover anomalies hidden in data, which point to biomarkers revealed through stimulus response. We review the approach for forming a single-user baseline having 1-d devices and a scale-invariant representation for N users each (i) having N*d(i) total devices. Such a fractal representation of human-centric data provides self-similar levels information and relationships which are useful for diagnosis and identification causality anywhere from a mental disorder to a DNA match. Biomarkers from biomedical devices offer a robust way to collect data. Biometrics could be envisioned as enhanced and personalized biomedical devices (e.g. typing fist), but used for security. As long as the devices have a shared context origin, useful information can be found by coupling the sensors. In the case of the electroencephalogram (EEG), known patterns have emerged in low frequency Delta Theta Alpha Beta-Gamma (DTAB-G) waves when an individual views a familiar picture in the visual cortex which is shown on EEGs as a sharp peak. Using brainwaves as a functional biomarker for security can lead the industry to create more secure sessions by allowing not only passwords but also visual stimuli and/or keystrokes coupled with EEG to capture and stay informed about real time user e-IQ/IQ data changes. This holistic Computer Science (CS) Knowledge Discovery in Databases, Data Mining (KDD, DM) approach seeks to merge the fields having a shared data origin biomarkers revealed through stimulus response.

There must be a general strategy used to transform raw signals into useful features, but representing this generalization in the context of our information extraction tool set is lacking. In contrast to Big Data (BD), Large Data Analysis (LDA) has become a reachable multi-disciplinary goal in recent years due in part to high performance computers and algorithm development, as well as the availability of large data sets. However, the experience of Machine Learning (ML) and information communities has not been generalized into an intuitive framework that is useful to researchers across disciplines. The data exploration phase of data mining is a prime example of this unspoken, ad-hoc nature of ML - the Computer Scientist works with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to understand the data, and then build tools (i.e. classifiers, etc.) which can benefit the SME and the rest of the researchers in that field. We ask, why is there not a tool to represent information in a meaningful way to the researcher asking the question? Meaning is subjective and contextual across disciplines, so to ensure robustness, we draw examples from several disciplines and propose a generalized LDA framework for independent data understanding of heterogeneous sources which contribute to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). Then, we explore the concept of adaptive Information resolution through a 6W unsupervised learning methodology feedback system. In this paper, we will describe the general process of man-machine interaction in terms of an asymmetric directed graph theory (digging for embedded knowledge), and model the inverse machine-man feedback (digging for tacit knowledge) as an ANN unsupervised learning methodology. Finally, we propose a collective learning framework which utilizes a 6W semantic topology to organize heterogeneous knowledge and diffuse information to entities within a society in a personalized way.

Glioma-derived cancer stem cells (GSCs) are tumor-initiating cells and may be refractory to radiation and chemotherapy and thus have important implications for tumor biology and therapeutics. The analysis and interpretation of large proteomic data sets requires the development of new data mining and visualization paradigms. Traditional machine learning techniques proved to be insufficient to interpret and visualize the available experimental proteomic data. To overcome these limitations, we will present novel approaches for the visualization, clustering and projection representation to unveil hidden data structures relevant for the accurate interpretation of biological experiments. These qualitative and quantitative methods are applied to the proteomic analysis of data sets derived from the GSCs. The achieved clustering and visualization results provide a more detailed insight into the expression patterns of chromosome 19 proteins.

In the midst of it, the routine traffic data exists in a large number of isolated data in real time without establishing relationships with other data, and detects the amount of data which is greater than that at present. The usage of these data which is relatively shallow requires an in-depth analysis of its data model. Therefore, this paper uses a fuzzy clustering analysis method of feature points to study the traffic flow, uses a Markov decision chain model to study traffic jams, uses quantitative sample points based on the information entropy to calculate traffic flow trends and uses a heuristic prediction model to predict the road congestion. Through the simulation experiment which verifies the correctness of the model, this research is to advance the development of the road and to provide a basis for a dredging plan.

Such data must be modeled and analyzed as graphs, with attributes on both objects and relations encode and differentiate their semantics. Traditional data mining algorithms were originally designed for analyzing discrete objects for which a set of features can be defined, and thus cannot be easily adapted to deal with graph data. This gave rise to the relational data mining field of research, of which graph pattern learning is a key sub-domain [11]. In this paper, we describe a model for learning graph patterns in collaborative distributed manner. Distributed pattern learning is challenging due to dependencies between the nodes and relations in the graph, and variability across graph instances. We present three algorithms that trade-off benefits of parallelization and data aggregation, compare their performance to centralized graph learning, and discuss individual benefits and weaknesses of each model. Presented algorithms are designed for linear speedup in distributed computing environments, and learn graph patterns that are both closer to ground truth and provide higher detection rates than centralized mining algorithm.

While it can continue to be used as a toy example, the age of this dataset makes it all but useless for intrusion detection research and data mining. Many of the attacks used within the dataset are obsolete and do not reflect the features important for intrusion detection in today's networks. Creating a new dataset encompassing a large cross section of the attacks found on the Internet today could be useful, but would eventually fall to the same problem as the KDD-99 Cup; its usefulness would diminish after a period of time. To continue research into intrusion detection, the generation of new datasets needs to be as dynamic and as quick as the attacker. Simply examining existing network traffic and using domain experts such as intrusion analysts to label traffic is inefficient, expensive, and not scalable. The only viable methodology is simulation using technologies including virtualization, attack-toolsets such as Metasploit and Armitage, and sophisticated emulation of threat and user behavior. Simulating actual user behavior and network intrusion events dynamically not only allows researchers to vary scenarios quickly, but enables online testing of intrusion detection mechanisms by interacting with data as it is generated. As new threat behaviors are identified, they can be added to the simulation to make quicker determinations as to the effectiveness of existing and ongoing network intrusion technology, methodology and models.

In this study, two data mining approaches, namely, back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) and supporting vector regression (SVR), were used to estimate atmospheric visibility through the synergistic use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 1B (LIB) data and ground-based observations at fourteen stations in the province of Khuzestan (southwestern Iran), during 2009-2010. Reflectance and brightness temperature in different bands (from MODIS) along with in situ meteorological data were input to the models to estimate atmospheric visibility. The results show that both models can accurately estimate atmospheric visibility. The visibility estimates from the BP ANN network had a root-mean-square error (RMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. The corresponding RMSE and R from the SVR model were 0.59 and 0.71, implying that the SVR approach outperforms the BP ANN.

The present work deals with an onshore wind farm in southern Italy, which has been a test case of IEA-Task 31 Wakebench project: 17 turbines, with 2.3 MW of rated power each, are sited on a very complex terrain. A cluster of machines is investigated through numerical and experimental methods: CFD is employed for simulating wind fields and power extraction, as well as wakes, are estimated through the Actuator Disc model. SCADA data mining techniques are employed for comparison between models and actual performances. The simulations are performed both on the real terrain and on flat terrain, in order to disentangle the effects of complex flow and wake effects. Attention is devoted to comparison between actual alignment patterns of the cluster of turbines and predicted flow deviation.

As existing batch system monitoring and related system monitoring tools do not support measurements at batch job level, a new tool has been developed and put into operation at the GridKa Tier 1 center for monitoring continuous data streams and characteristics of WLCG jobs and pilots. Long term measurements and data collection are in progress. These measurements already have been proven to be useful analyzing misbehaviors and various issues. Therefore we aim for an automated, realtime approach for anomaly detection. As a requirement, prototypes for standard workflows have to be examined. Based on measurements of several months, different features of HEP jobs are evaluated regarding their effectiveness for data mining approaches to identify these common workflows. The paper will introduce the actual measurement approach and statistics as well as the general concept and first results classifying different HEP job workflows derived from the measurements at GridKa.

This amount of electronically available data collected routinely opens up new opportunities for secondary use. Objectives: To present a case study of a nursing intelligence system for reusing routinely collected nursing documentation data for multiple purposes, including quality management of nursing care. Methods: The SPIRIT framework for systematically planning the reuse of clinical routine data was leveraged to design a nursing intelligence system which then was implemented using open source tools in a large university hospital group following the spiral model of software engineering. Results: The nursing intelligence system is in routine use now and updated regularly, and includes over 40 million data sets. It allows the outcome and quality analysis of data related to the nursing process. Conclusions: Following a systematic approach for planning and designing a solution for reusing routine care data appeared to be successful. The resulting nursing intelligence system is useful in practice now, but remains malleable for future changes.	[Hackl, W.

Particularly, the embedded Shapely Value includes two memetic operators namely "include" and "remove" features (or genes) to realize the genetic algorithm (GA) solution. The method is ranking the genes according to its capability to differentiate the classes. The method selects the genes that can maximize the capability to discriminate between different classes. Thus, the dimensionality of data features is reduced and the classification accuracy rate is improved. Four classifiers such as Support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and J48 are used on the breast cancer dataset from the Kent ridge biomedical repository to classify between the normal and abnormal tissues and to diagnose as benign and malignant tumours. The obtained classification accuracy demonstrates that the proposed method contributes to the superior diagnosis of breast cancer than the existing methods. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Analysis of gene expression is important in many fields of biological research in order to retrieve the required information. As time progresses, the illness in general and cancer in particular have become more and more complex and complicated, in detecting, analyzing and curing. We know cancer is deadly disease. Cancer research is one of the major area of research in medical field. Predicting precisely of different tumor types is a great challenge and providing accurate prediction will have great value in providing better treatment to the patients. To achieve this, data mining algorithms are important tools and the most extensively used approach to achieve important feature of gene expression data and plays an important role for gene classification. One of major challenges is to discover how to extract useful information from huge datasets. This paper presents recent advances in the machine learning based gene expression data analysis with different feature selection algorithms. Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. But compared to the number of genes involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size for classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies.

The k-modes algorithm well known for its simplicity is a popular partitioning algorithm for clustering categorical data. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of distance function used in this algorithm with an illustrative example and then we propose a similarity coefficient based on Information Entropy. We analyze the time complexity of the k-modes algorithm with proposed similarity coefficient. The main advantage of this coefficient is that it improves the clustering accuracy while retaining scalability of the k-modes algorithm. We perform the scalability tests on synthetic datasets.

In this work an attempt is made to correlate arc sound with the weld quality. The welding is done with various combinations of current, voltage, and travel speed to produce good welds as well as weld with defects. The defects considered in this study are lack of fusion and burn through. Raw data points captured from the arc sound were converted into amplitude signals. The welded specimens were inspected and classified into 3 classes such as good weld and weld with lack of fusion and burn through. Statistical features of raw data were extracted using data mining software. Using classification algorithms the defects are classified. Two algorithms namely, J48 and random forest were used and classification efficiencies of the algorithms were reported. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An Efficient Association Rule Based Clustering of XML Documents	BIG DATA, CLOUD AND COMPUTING CHALLENGES	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC)	MAR 12-13, 2015	Chennai, INDIA		VIT Univ	K-means clustering; Association Rule Mining; XML documents; Web mining		Mining the web data is one of the emerging researches in data mining. The HTML can be used for maintaining the web data but it is hard to achieve the accurate web mining results from HTML documents. The XML documents make more convenient for finding the properties in web mining. Association rule based mining discovers the temporal associations among XML documents. But this kind of data mining is not sufficient to retrieve the properties of every XML document. Finding the properties for set of similar documents is better idea rather than to find the property of a single document. Hence, the key contribution of the work is to find the meaningful clustered based associations by association rule based clustering. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid approach which discovers the frequent XML documents by association rule mining and then find the clustering of XML documents by classical k-means algorithm. The proposed approach was tested with real data of Wikipedia. The comparative study and result analysis are discussed in the paper for knowing the importance of the proposed work.

Artificial immune systems (AIS) are inspired by the processes of the biological immune systems like the learning and memory characteristics which are used for solving complex problems. During the last two decades, AIS have been applied in various fields such as optimization, network security and data mining. In this article, we focus on the application of AIS to data mining in bioinformatics, more specifically, the classification task. For this purpose, we suggest three immune models based on clonal selection theory for the identification of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to predict their function. Our three classifiers are the artificial immune recognition system (AIRS), the clonal selection algorithm (CLONALG) and the clonal selection classification algorithm (CSCA). The GPCRs represent one of the largest and most important families of multifunctional proteins and are a significant target for bioactive and drug discovery programs. It is estimated that more than half of the drugs on the market currently target GPCRs. However, although thousands of GPCRs sequences are known, many of them remain orphans, have unknown function. Our experiments show that the three immunological classifiers have provided interesting results, however, AIRS obtained the best ones. Therefore, it is, for us, the most suitable immune model for the GPCRs identification problem.

Rising to these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed data mining method based on deep neural network (DNN), by dividing the deep neural network into different layers and putting them into sensors. By the proposed solution, the distributed data mining calculating units in WSN share much of fusion center's calculating burden. And the power consumption of transmitting the data processed by DNN is much less than transmitting the raw data. Also, a fault detection scenario is built to verify the validity of this method. Results show that the detection rate is 99%, and WSN shares 64.06% of the data mining calculating task with 58.31% reduction of power consumption.

J	Cordeiro, CLD; Rossetti, DD				de Oliveira Cordeiro, Carlos Leandro; Rossetti, Dilce de Fatima			Mapping vegetation in a late Quaternary landform of the Amazonian wetlands using object-based image analysis and decision tree classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							RESOLUTION SATELLITE DATA; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; L-BAND; FLORISTIC PATTERNS; LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS; RADAR BACKSCATTER; NORTHERN AMAZONIA; OKAVANGO DELTA; LANDSAT DATA; SAR IMAGERY	Fan-shaped morphologies related to late Quaternary residual megafan depositional systems are common features over wide areas in northern Amazonia. These features were formed by ancient distributary drainage systems that are in great contrast to tributary drainage networks that typify the modern Amazon basin. The surfaces of the Amazonian megafans constitute vegetacional mosaic wetlands with different campinarana types. A fine-scale-resolution investigation is required to provide detailed classification maps for the various campinarana and surrounding forest types associated with the Amazonian megafans. This approach remains to be presented, despite its relevance for analysing the relationship between stages of plant succession and sedimentary dynamics associated with the evolution of megafans. In this work, we develop a methodology for classifying vegetation over a fan-shaped megafan palaeoform from a northern Amazonian wetland. The approach included object-based image analysis (OBIA) and data-mining (DM) techniques combining Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images, land-cover fractions derived by the linear spectral mixing model, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and the digital elevation model (DEM) acquired during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The DEM, vegetation fraction, and ASTER band 3 were the most useful parameters for defining the forest classes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ASTER band 1, vegetation fraction, and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) transmitting and receiving horizontal polarization (HH) and transmitting horizontal and receiving vertical polarization (HV) were all effective in distinguishing the wetland classes campinarana and Mauritia. Tests of statistical significance indicated the overall accuracies and kappa coefficients (kappa) of 88% and 0.86 for the final map, respectively. The allocation disagreement coefficient of 5% and a quantity disagreement value of 7% further attested the statistical significance of the classification results. Hence, in addition to water, exposed soil, and deforestation areas, OBIA and DM were successful for differentiating a large number of open (forest, wood, shrub, and grass campinaranas), forest (terra firme, varzea, igapo, and alluvial), as well as Mauritia wetland classes in the inner and outer areas of the studied megafan.

To reinforce such development, this paper presents another cluster ensemble approach for fuzzy clustering, with an aim to be applied for clustering of big data. The proposed algorithm first generates fuzzy base clusters with respect to each data feature and then, employs a fuzzy hierarchical graph to represent the relationships between the resulting base clusters. Whilst the work employs fuzzy c-means and hierarchical clustering in generating base cluster and implementing consensus function respectively, when applied to large datasets it has lower time complexity than the original fuzzy c-means and hierarchical clustering. The resultant ensemble clustering mechanism is tested against traditional clustering methods on various benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that it generally outperforms crisp cluster ensembles and single linkage agglomerative clustering, in terms of accuracy in conjunction with time efficiency, thereby showing that it has the potential for application in clustering big data.

The environment, time, and region influence the occurrence of traffic accidents. The life and property loss is expected to be reduced by improving traffic engineering, education, and administration of law and advocacy. This study observed 2,471 traffic accidents which occurred in central Taiwan from January to December 2011 and used the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) of Feature Selection to screen the important factors affecting traffic accidents. It then established models to analyze traffic accidents with various methods, such as Fuzzy Robust Principal Component Analysis (FRPCA), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). The proposed model aims to probe into the environments of traffic accidents, as well as the relationships between the variables of road designs, rule-violation items, and accident types. The results showed that the accuracy rate of classifiers FRPCA-BPNN (85.89%) and FRPCA-LR (85.14%) combined with FRPCA is higher than that of BPNN (84.37%) and LR (85.06%) by 1.52% and 0.08%, respectively. Moreover, the performance of FRPCA-BPNN and FRPCA-LR combined with FRPCA in classification prediction is better than that of BPNN and LR.

However, in real problems, we always have to run the algorithm for several times and use the best matrix factorization result as the final output because of the random initialization of the matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed an improved non-negative matrix factorization algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA), which uses the internal parallelism and the random search of genetic algorithm to get the optimal solution of matrix factorization. It could have larger searching area and higher accuracy in matrix factorization. In the document clustering problem, we use the TDT2 dataset and design several contrast experiments on the classical NMF and the improved NMF based on genetic algorithm, the experiment results show that our improved non-negative matrix factorization algorithm has higher clustering accuracy and better robustness.

The most common is the artificial construction of missing data, but we can predict it, or transform the whole database in a fuzzy way. In this article we propose a different approach: we extend our rough classification to incomplete databases. This uses the correlation clustering as a tool, which uses a tolerance relation of the similarity between objects of a database. This relation can be generated from the distance between objects and can be sensitized based on missing data. We demonstrate our method in the wine database.

Moreover, studies of biosynthetic pathway of the metabolites/proteins involved in quality at transcriptional and translational levels may provide relevant information for subsequent functional studies and quality improvement. Data mining of ESTs from HarvEST database allowed the selection of 17 cDNA libraries from albedo, flavedo, peel, pulp and juice sac of different orange, mandarin, clementine and grapefruit varieties. In order to select key genes involved in quality we used systems biology which offers mathematical tools that include the analysis of the structure, clustering and centralities of the network. In order to have information regarding physical protein-protein interactions (PPPI) from citrus sequences, orthologous sequences of A. thaliana were used (BLASTX; reciprocal BLASTP). Literature data mining was performed, and PPPI network design was obtained using the Cytoscape software. The interactome networks thus obtained were analyzed with MCODE. Gene ontology clustering analysis was performed using BiNGO. Specific algorithms were applied to identify modules and central nodes within the citrus libraries associated network. The obtained results will be used as a guideline to select specific genes/proteins from citrus for further functional studies as gene expression or plant transformation.	[Silva, Edson M.

Therefore, these kinds of systems are exposed to intelligent cyber attacks aimed to disrupt the stable operation of commonly named modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCI). We chose the Tennessee Eastman plant-wide challenge process (TEP) as representing a NCI controlled by an industrial control system (ICS). In order to ensure the security and to maintain the stability of NCI, new cyber attack detection methods are necessary. We propose a clustering based approach for detecting the influences of cyber attacks, especially those of denial of service (DoS) attacks, in the observed process data. The abnormal process behavior is identified by clustering the feature data points that describe the actual operation of the system. The proposed approach is presented in contrast with TEP, therefore several scenarios of DoS attack are experimented to validate the effectiveness of the method. (c) 2015 The Authors.

The analysis began from a dataset including 2325 births. The article presents a synthesis of the studies that analyze birth data. The Apgar score is the main subject in many studies. On one hand, researchers investigated the relation between the Apgar score and different factors such as the newborns' cry, the level of glucose in the blood from the umbilical cord, the mother's body mass index before the pregnancy, etc. On the other hand, there are studies that demonstrate that the Apgar score is important for the ulterior evolution of babies. The article presents the attributes from the dataset and how they were preprocessed in order to be analyzed with Weka. The values of each attribute were investigated and the results were presented. The past experience regarding births, expressed through the dataset values, was then used to build classification models. With the help of these models, the Apgar score can be estimated based on the known information regarding the mother, the baby and possible medical interventions. The purpose of these estimations is consultative, to help in identifying which values of the input variables will lead to an optimal Apgar score, in certain circumstances. The classification models were built and tested with the help of ten classification algorithms. After the model that produces the best results of classification was determined, a dedicated application was developed, with the aid of the Weka API which classifies the birth data by using LogitBoost algorithm.

An important contribution to the comprehension of lncRNAs biology in cancer could be obtained through the integrated analysis of multiple expression datasets. However, the growing availability of public datasets requires new data mining techniques to integrate and describe relationship among data. In this perspective, we explored the powerness of the Association Rule Mining (ARM) approach in gene expression data analysis. By the ARM method, we performed a meta-analysis of cancer-related microarray data which allowed us to identify and characterize a set of ten lncRNAs simultaneously altered in different brain tumor datasets. The expression profiles of the ten lncRNAs appeared to be sufficient to distinguish between cancer and normal tissues. A further characterization of this lncRNAs signature through a comodulation expression analysis suggested that biological processes specific of the nervous system could be compromised.

J	Shabanzadeh, P; Yusof, R				Shabanzadeh, Parvaneh; Yusof, Rubiyah			An Efficient Optimization Method for Solving Unsupervised Data Classification Problems	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							BIOGEOGRAPHY-BASED OPTIMIZATION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; CLUSTERING PROBLEM; ALGORITHMS; SEARCH	Unsupervised data classification (or clustering) analysis is one of the most useful tools and a descriptive task in data mining that seeks to classify homogeneous groups of objects based on similarity and is used in many medical disciplines and various applications. In general, there is no single algorithmthat is suitable for all types of data, conditions, and applications. Each algorithm has its own advantages, limitations, and deficiencies. Hence, research for novel and effective approaches for unsupervised data classification is still active. In this paper a heuristic algorithm, Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm, was adapted for data clustering problems by modifying the main operators of BBO algorithm, which is inspired from the natural biogeography distribution of different species. Similar to other population-based algorithms, BBO algorithm starts with an initial population of candidate solutions to an optimization problem and an objective function that is calculated for them. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm assessment was carried on six medical and real life datasets and was compared with eight well known and recent unsupervised data classification algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm is efficient for unsupervised data classification.

Acupuncture, a popular therapeutic method in China, can improve memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability in VaD patients. However, in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research, the selection of acupoints to treat VaD remains challenging. This study aimed to discover acupoints and acupoint combinations with potential for VaD based on data mining. After database searching and screening for articles on clinical trials evaluating the effects of acupuncture on VaD, 238 acupuncture prescriptions were included for further analysis. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shuigou (GV 26), and Shenting (GV 24) appeared most frequently in the modern literature and are potential acupoints for VaD. Combinations between Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shenting (GV 24), Shuigou (GV 26), and Zusanli (ST 36) were most frequent and represent potential combinations for VaD treatment. These results provide a reference for the selection and combination of acupoints to treat VaD in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research.

Evolutionary algorithms are not the first option for solving such type of problems. In this work, the evolutionary algorithm uses the information extracted from the previous best solutions to guide the search in the next iterations. After the archive of previous best solutions has been sufficiently (re)filled, a data mining module is called to find association rules between variables and values. The generated rules are used to improve further the search process. Different methods of applying the association rules are investigated. Computational experiments are done on academic and real-world problem instances. The obtained results validate the approach and show that it is competitive with existing approaches in literature.

Feature selection has become a very sharp tool to select the informative genes. However, few feature selection methods consider the effect of paired samples, which are much more considered in the experiments of these years. Here, we propose a new feature selection method for paired microarray data sets analysis. It uses the fold change instead of the subtraction in the original approach, measures the statistical significant using the q-value of False Discovery Rate (FDR) and also decreases the influence of redundant genes. We compare the proposed method with another six existing methods in predict performance, stability of gene lists, functional stability and functional enrichment analysis using six kinds of paired cancer data sets. Comparison results show that our proposed method achieves better effectiveness, stability and consistency when it is applied to paired data sets.

Patch-Surfer is efficient in recognition of protein-ligand binding partners, further speedup is necessary to address multiple-user access. Futher speedup is realised by exploiting Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling (LMDS). It computes embedding coordinates for data points based on their distances from landmark points. When selecting the landmark points, we adopt two approaches random and greedy selection. Our method approximately retrieves top-k results and the accuracy increases as we exploit more landmark points. Although two landmark selection approaches show comparable results, the greedy selection shows the best performance when the number of landmark points is large. Using our method, the searching time is reduced up to 99% and it retrieves almost 80% of exact top-k results. Additionally, LMDS-based binding-site search+ improves the retrieval accuracy from 80% to 95% while sacrificing the speedup ratio from 99% to 90% compared to Patch-Surfer.

In this study, we firstly compiled a set of genes responsive to different stresses in Arabidopsis thaliana and then comparatively analysed their promoters at both the DNA sequence and three-dimensional structure levels. Amazingly, the comparison revealed that the profiles of several sequence and structure properties vary distinctly in different regions of promoters. Moreover, the content of nucleotide T and the profile of B-DNA twist are distinct in promoters from different stress groups, suggesting Arabidopsis genes might exploit different regulatory mechanisms in response to various stresses. Finally, we evaluated the performance of two representative promoter predictors including EP3 and PromPred. The evaluation results revealed their strengths and weakness for identifying stress-related promoters, providing valuable guidelines to accelerate the discovery of novel stress-related promoters and genes in plants.

It is one of the hardest and long-standing problems in bioinformatics. Apriori is a well-known data-mining algorithm for the discovery of frequent patterns in large datasets. In this paper, we apply the Apriori algorithm and use the Trie data structure to discover motifs. We propose several modifications so that we can adapt the classic Apriori to our problem. Experiments are conducted on Tompa's benchmark to investigate the performance of our proposed algorithm, the Trie-based Apriori Motif Discovery (TrieAMD). Results show that our algorithm outperforms all of the tested tools on real datasets for the average sensitivity measure, which means that our approach is able to discover more motifs. In terms of specificity, the performance of our algorithm is comparable to the other tools. The results also confirm both linear time and linear space scalability of the algorithm.

Mitigating bias in planning two-colour microarray experiments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						microarray design; A-optimality; bias errors; minimum variance; gene expression; bioinformatics; data mining	GENE-EXPRESSION; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; MODELS; DISCOVERY; FACTORIAL; SELECTION; COLOR	Two-colour microarrays are used to study differential gene expression on a large scale. Experimental planning can help reduce the chances of wrong inferences about whether genes are differentially expressed. Previous research on this problem has focused on minimising estimation errors (according to variance-based criteria such as A-optimality) on the basis of optimistic assumptions about the system studied. In this paper, we propose a novel planning criterion to evaluate existing plans for microarray experiments. The proposed criterion is 'Generalised-A Optimality' that is based on realistic assumptions that include bias errors. Using Generalised-A Optimality, the reference-design approach is likely to yield greater estimation accuracy in specific situations in which loop designs had previously seemed superior. However, hybrid designs are likely to offer higher estimation accuracy than reference, loop and interwoven designs having the same number of samples and slides. These findings are supported by data from both simulated and real microarray experiments.

Due to the inherent noise existing in the gene expression data, the attempt to improve the prediction accuracy resorting to new classification techniques is limited. With the emergence of Gene Ontology (GO), extra knowledge about the gene products can be extracted from GO and facilitates solving the gene function prediction problem. In this paper, we propose a new method which utilises GO information to improve the classifiers' performance in gene function prediction. Specifically, our method learns a distance metric under the supervision of the GO knowledge using the distance learning technique. Compared with the traditional distance metrics, the learned one produces a better performance and consequently classification accuracy can be improved. The effectiveness of our proposed method has been corroborated by the extensive experimental results.

It's an important addition to the species-level relationship between two compared communities and can quantify their differences in function. We downloaded all functional annotation data of several microbiotas. It's developed to identify the functional distribution and the significantly enriched functional categories of microbial communities. We analysed the similarity between two microbial communities on functional state. In the experimental results, it shows that the semantic similarity can quantify the difference between two compared species on function level.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular approach to build Recommendation System and has been successfully employed in many applications. Collaborative Filtering algorithms are much explored technique in the field of Data Mining and Information Retrieval. In CF, past user behavior are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and items to recommend an item to a user based on opinions of other users. Those customers, who had similar likings in the past, will have similar likings in the future. In the past decades due to the rapid growth of Internet usage, vast amount of data is generated and it has becomea challenge for CF algorithms. So, CF faces issues with sparsity of rating matrix and growing nature of data. These challenges are well taken care of by Matrix Factorization (MF). In this paper we are going to discuss different Matrix Factorization models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). This paper attempts to present a comprehensive survey of MF model like SVD to address the challenges of CF algorithms, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.

Firstly, basic data of metal mine enterprises were analyzed in distribution from data statistics and production operation two points of view. The former are targets for data mining arithmetic; the latter are the members of data marts built by distinct duty of department. Then, in the light of strategies of object-oriented data warehouse, it is reasonable to go through three steps of source data area, the staging area and the presentation area under a unified spatiotemporal and dimensional framework. According to this, new dataflow architecture was put forward with CWM to implement both transaction database for metal mine daily management and data warehouse for decision making. Obeying unified modeling language (UML), we built concept model of metal mine entities from real world to information world, which was subsequently mapped into dimensional model of data warehouse correspondingly depending on dimensional mapping rules. It shows that: for metal mine having tremendous multidimensional mineral entities, it displays more technical advantages of data warehouse of smart mine with object-oriented technique and CWM than structuring technique, so is for data integration.

In the proposed classifier approach, harmonic data obtained through a 3-phase system have been classified by using k-means and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. In order to obtain class details regarding harmonic data, a k-means clustering algorithm has been applied to these data first. The training of the LS-SVM model has been realized with the class details obtained through the k-means algorithm. To increase the efficiency of the LS-SVM model, the regularization and kernel parameters of this model have been determined with a grid search method and the training phase has been realized. Backpropagation neural network and J48 decision tree classifiers have been applied to the same data and results have been obtained for the purpose of comparing the performance of the LS-SVM model. The real data obtained from the output of distribution system have been used to assess the performance of the proposed classifier system. The obtained results and comparisons suggest that the proposed classifier system approach is quite efficient at classifying harmonic data.

It can be performed on a fuzzy or a crisp basis. Fuzzy clustering is widely-applied with microarray gene expression data as these data are usually uncertain and imprecise. There are several measures to evaluate the quality of clustering, but their performance is highly related to the dataset to which they are applied. In a previous work the authors proposed using a multi-objective genetic algorithm - based method, NSGA - II, to optimize two clustering validity measures simultaneously. In this paper we use another multi-objective optimizer, NSPSO, which is based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, to solve the same problem. The experiments we conducted on two microarray gene expression data show that NSPSO is superior to NSGA-II in handling this problem.

J	Shin, Y				Shin, Yoonseok			Application of Boosting Regression Trees to Preliminary Cost Estimation in Building Construction Projects	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREES; PREDICTION	Among the recent data mining techniques available, the boosting approach has attracted a great deal of attention because of its effective learning algorithm and strong boundaries in terms of its generalization performance. However, the boosting approach has yet to be used in regression problems within the construction domain, including cost estimations, but has been actively utilized in other domains. Therefore, a boosting regression tree (BRT) is applied to cost estimations at the early stage of a construction project to examine the applicability of the boosting approach to a regression problem within the construction domain. To evaluate the performance of the BRT model, its performance was compared with that of a neural network (NN) model, which has been proven to have a high performance in cost estimation domains. The BRT model has shown results similar to those of NN model using 234 actual cost datasets of a building construction project. In addition, the BRT model can provide additional information such as the importance plot and structure model, which can support estimators in comprehending the decision making process. Consequently, the boosting approach has potential applicability in preliminary cost estimations in a building construction project.

The Case Study of Salman Farsi Dam, Fars Province, Southern Iran	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 5: URBAN GEOLOGY, SUSTAINABLE PLANNING AND LANDSCAPE EXPLOITATION			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International IAEG Congress	SEP 15-19, 2014	Torino, ITALY	IAEG		Lugeon; Karst; Decision tree; Data mining; Salman Farsi Dam		As a consequence the leakage from karstic dam foundations and abutments, reservoir storage will be reduced. Due to the complexity of dam sites in karst, estimation of the cement to be used in the injecting boreholes and operating the sealing membrane cannot be readily done. Data mining with decision tree algorithm and searching of databases can help us to find the effective parameters in cement take. In this study, Salman Farsi Dam in Fars province in southern Iran is selected. In this article as a case study, in the left gallery at level of 853 a.m.s.l, 6 boreholes were selected. Important information such as the depth of the borehole drilling, shaft angle, and cement take at different depth intervals, hydro-mechanical behaviors (ground water flow type) gathered with Lugeon tests and were analyzed. 47.76 % of the test data indicates Lugeon ranges in impermeable to very low permeability (3 < Lu <= 10). Application of the technique of decision tree showed that when the angles of boreholes lie between 29 and 31.5 degrees, depth of the borehole is less than 32.5 m, Lugeon greater than 15.5 and Hydromechanical behavior belongs to dilatation, wash out or void filling, cement take will follow the empirical Ewert (1985) theory. If the angle of the hole is higher than 31.5 degrees, flow type is void filling or linear, and Lugeon greater than 3.5, cement take and luegon number has not complied. Thus we can order the role of effective parameters on cement take as follows: angle of shaft, hydromechanical flow type, average Lugeon, and finally borehole depth. Eventually, the validity of the model is tested.

Further, we have designed and built an imaging informatics module that utilizes this database to perform data mining. The end-goal of this data mining system is to provide radiation therapy decision support for incoming head and neck cancer patients, by identifying best practices from previous patients who had the most similar tumor geometries. Since the performance of such systems often depends on the size and quality of the retrospective database, we have also placed an emphasis on developing infrastructure and strategies to encourage data sharing and participation from multiple institutions. The infrastructure and decision support algorithm have both been tested and evaluated with 51 sets of retrospective treatment planning data of head and neck cancer patients. We will present the overall design and architecture of our system, an overview of our decision support mechanism as well as the results of our evaluation.

The web-based system aims to be integrated in DICOM-compliant clinical and research environments to aid clinicians in patient treatments and disease tracking. This year, we have further developed the eFolder system to handle big data analysis and data mining in today's medical imaging field. The database has been updated to allow data mining and data look-up from DICOM-SR lesion analysis contents. Longitudinal studies are tracked, and any changes in lesion volumes and brain parenchyma volumes are calculated and shown on the web-based user interface as graphical representations. Longitudinal lesion characteristic changes are compared with patients' disease history, including treatments, symptom progressions, and any other changes in the disease profile. The image viewer is updated such that imaging studies can be viewed side-by-side to allow visual comparisons. We aim to use the web-based medical imaging informatics eFolder system to demonstrate big data analysis in medical imaging, and use the analysis results to predict MS disease trends and patterns in Hispanic and Caucasian populations in our pilot study. The discovery of disease patterns among the two ethnicities is a big data analysis result that will help lead to personalized patient care and treatment planning.

This paper discusses a new method to draw the distribution of PM2.5 of a city by using mass data provided by the monitoring stations, which can be accurate to all the spot. In order to solve the problem efficiently, we present modified Gauss plume model. In the proposed model, firstly, for the accuracy of the model, we put forward a new method to calculate the wind direction. In addition, through the geometric inversion of the wind direction, the pollution source can be found. Moreover, in order to simulate the real situation, we replace the normal distribution by chi square distribution in Gauss plume model. Finally, the whole distribution of PM2.5 of the city can be draw. The PM2.5 distribution of Beijing in 2014 March indicates the proposed model is effective and feasible.

Granular computing has been applied to the decision tree, then a new decision tree based on the classification preference ratio of attribute is proposed. This decision tree is a hierarchical granularity tree. In information systems, each condition attribute divides the domain into several parts of a granular space. In the granular space, the classification preference ratio is used to describe the condition attribute. The classification preference ratio of every condition attribute is computed, and then the maximum attribute is chosen to divide the domain. According to different values of the attribute, the sample set is divided into several subsets. Each subset is a node or branch of the decision tree. If all the objects in a node are the same class, this node is a leaf node without further division. Otherwise, the node is not a consistent node. Above process of division will be repeated for all inconsistent nodes until all nodes become leaf nodes. Now the decision tree is finished. An example is given, which shows that the algorithm is feasible.

In response of the fact that traditional intrusion detection systems are not able to fulfill the requirements for specific network security, such as fast processing speed, stronger defense capability, and higher real-time performance. We propose a model based on network security on the integration of data stream mining and intrusion detection, after comparing data stream clustering methodology with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, we choose the former to act as the selected clustering algorithm. Finally, with the case analysis and simulation experiment, we illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

The output of the forecasting model can be used in reservoir decision support systems. This study demonstrates the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in developing the forecasting model for the change of reservoir water level stage. In this study, sliding window technique has been used to extract the temporal pattern that represents time delays in the reservoir water level. The patterns are used as input to the ANN model. The results show that a model with 4 days of time delay has produced the acceptable performance with both low error rate and high accuracy.

A major challenge in cancer research is the biological interpretation of the complexity of cancer somatic mutation profiles. This study examines the role of pathway crosstalk in the metastatic process of lung cancer cells based on DNA microarray analysis. Methods: We downloaded the gene expression profile GSE10096 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and the gene functions of selected DEGs were further analyzed. After KEGG pathway analysis, dysfunctional pathways and dysfunctional crosstalk between pathways in two types of lung cancer cells (low metastasis, M1, and high metastasis, M5) were examined. Results: A total of 13433 genes were filtered as DEGs, and after pathway analysis, 108 signaling pathways related to cancer signaling pathways were screened, including a host pathway hsa05223 and 79 neighbor pathways. Dysfunctional crosstalk analysis of pathways revealed that pathway crosstalk dysfunction of M1 and M5 cells mainly occurred between hsa05223 (non-small cell lung cancer) and hsa04310 (Wnt signaling pathway), and between non-small cell lung cancer and hsa04520 (adherens junction), respectively. Significant pathway crosstalk dysfunction also existed between adherens junction and other classical signaling pathways such as hsa04110 (cell cycle), hsa04310 (Wnt signaling pathway), hsa04350 (TGF-beta signaling pathway), and hsa04630 (Jak-STAT signaling pathway). Conclusions: Our discovery will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the high carcinogenic and metastatic potential of lung cancer cells. In addition, it will pave the way to developing effective therapies for lung cancer.

A total of four viroids/viroid-like RNAs and 49 new plant RNA and DNA viruses from 18 known or unassigned virus families have been identified from plants since 2009. A comparison of enrichment strategies reveals that full indexing of RNA and DNA viruses as well as viroids in a plant sample at single-nucleotide resolution is made possible by one NGS run of total small RNAs, followed by data mining with homology-dependent and homology-independent computational algorithms. Major challenges in the application of NGS technologies to pathogen discovery are discussed.

To assess the landslide susceptibility a database containing landslide information and geological, morphological and hydrological parameters associated with landslide occurrence was established and analyzed with different data mining algorithms. The most promising results were achieved with an Artificial Neural Network, a Bayesian Network and a Support Vector Machine. All three methods developed the ability to predict landslide occurrence and produced spatially reasonable results. Other models, such as CHAID Decision Tree and Logistic Regression developed only poor ability for landslide prediction and the results were from a geologically point of view not plausible. The C5.0 Decision Tree almost perfectly predicted landslide occurrence, however it is most likely overfit to the data and would only have a poor ability to generalize the prediction on new datasets. In general the method proved to be useful for the analysis of landslide susceptibility in remote regions where landslide occurrence is related to multiple factors; it also allowed us to extract a maximum of information from a relatively simple dataset.

A minimum of $4.8 million is lost due to landslide related damages every year in Illawara region of Australia. At present, Data mining and knowledge discovery techniques are becoming popular in building landslide susceptibility models due to their enhanced predictive performances. Until now, the lack of tools to undertake data extraction and making the predictions have limited the applicability of this novel technique in landslide model building. This paper discusses the development of the LSDM (Landslide Susceptibility Data Mining) toolbar which was designed to utilize machine learning techniques within a GIS environment by coupling GIS and data mining software (See5) capabilities. The software development kit available with ArcGIS v. 10 has been utilized in developing the toolbar add-in. The fundamental tasks; data preparation, model optimizing, derivation of decision trees, predictions and validation are all performed using the individual controls available in the toolbar. This tool automates the entire model building process and in preparation of training data and producing outcomes that are compliant with both national and international Landslide Risk management guidelines.

The inhibition of Pgp has become a notable strategy for combating multidrug-resistant cancers and improving therapeutic outcomes. However, the polyspecific nature of Pgp, together with inconsistent results in experimental assays, renders the determination of endpoints for Pgp-interacting compounds a great challenge. In this study, the classification of a large set of 2,477 Pgp-interacting compounds (i.e., 1341 inhibitors, 913 non-inhibitors, 197 substrates and 26 non-substrates) was performed using several machine learning methods (i.e., decision tree induction, artificial neural network modelling and support vector machine) as a function of their physicochemical properties. The models provided good predictive performance, producing MCC values in the range of 0.739-1 for internal cross-validation and 0.665-1 for external validation. The study provided simple and interpretable models for important properties that influence the activity of Pgp-interacting compounds, which are potentially beneficial for screening and rational design of Pgp inhibitors that are of clinical importance.

We first describe the large agent number, deterministic limit of the system dynamics by performing numerical bifurcation calculations on a continuum approximation of their model. By exploring a broad parameter space, we observe several interesting phenomena including turning points leading to unstable stationary agent density distributions as well as a type of "termination point." Close to these deterministic turning points we expect the stochastic underlying model to exhibit rare event transitions. We then proceed to discuss a coarse-grained approach to the quantitative study of these rare events. The basic assumption is that the dynamics of the system can be decomposed into fast (noise) and slow (single reaction coordinate) dynamics, so that the system can be described by an effective, coarse-grained Fokker-Planck(FP) equation. An explicit form of this effective FP equation is not available; in our computations we bypass the lack of a closed form equation by numerically estimating its components - the drift and diffusion coefficients - from ensembles of short bursts of microscopic simulations with judiciously chosen initial conditions. The reaction coordinate is first constructed based on our understanding of the continuum model close to the turning points, and it gives results reasonably close to those from brute-force direct simulations. When no guidelines for the selection of a good reaction coordinate are available, data-mining tools, in particular Diffusion Maps, can be used to determine a suitable reaction coordinate. In the third part of this work we demonstrate this "variable-free" approach by constructing a reaction coordinate simply based on the data from the simulation itself. This Diffusion Map based, empirical coordinate gives results consistent with the direct simulation.	[Liu, Ping] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Siettos, C.

It turns out that, comparing with Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Laplacian Eigenmap maintains the information of nonlinear structure of high dimensional spectral data, which leads to a higher classification accuracy. In the feature space, backpropagation neural network is used to classify WDMS and non-WDMS spectra. Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is implemented to increase the classification accuracy via optimizing the parameters of the network. The results shows that the method in this paper can discover WDMS efficiently and accurately after training the neural network with low-dimensional data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10).

In order to resolve the problems about knowledge acquisition in complete and incomplete knowledge representation systems, the algorithm of knowledge acquisition based on rough set theory is proposed. Let the knowledge representation system be a decision table, the useful knowledge can be obtained by simplification of the decision table. The algorithm of computation of condition attributes' reductions and the algorithm of computation of reduction of decision rule are researched to simplify the decision table. When there are missing values in knowledge representation systems, the missing data should be completed by the algorithm of missing values' completion firstly. This algorithm of knowledge acquisition based on rough set theory can obtain a minimal set of decision rules which can be used to reason in expert systems. The approach of knowledge acquisition can be used to simplify uncertain and incomplete knowledge representation systems.

However, in data mining, the values range may be of various types-real, nominal or ordinal. Regardless of their type, the methods on measuring correlation between multivariable sequences of data are reviewed. In particular, a new method on measuring the statistical correlation of multivariable sequences is proposed. As the method relies on the geometrical meaning of dot conduct to get the degree of multivariable correlation, it is called M-correlation. M-correlation is used to cut redundancy association rules in this paper. In order to enhance mining efficiency, a novel algorithm, namely FT-Miner, is presented to find all frequent sub-trees in a forest, using two new data structures called UFP-Tree and FP-Forest. The experimentation shows that the algorithm not only reduces a lot of unavailable rules, but also has better capability than classical algorithms.	[Hu, J.; Jian, H. F.; Sun, J.

It refers to a collection of statistical methods for learning the structure of data by solely exploring pairwise distances or similarities. Often meaningful structures are not detectable in these high-dimensional feature spaces. Relevant features can be obfuscated by noise from irrelevant measurements. These observations led to the design of subspace clustering algorithms, which can identify clusters that originate from different subsets of features. Hunting for clusters in arbitrary subspaces is intractable due to the infinite search space spanned by all feature combinations. In this work, we present a subspace clustering algorithm that can be applied for exhaustively screening all feature combinations of small- or medium-sized datasets (approximately 30 features). Based on a robustness analysis via subsampling we are able to identify a set of stable candidate subspace cluster solutions.

J	Sheller, M				Sheller, Mimi			News Now Interface, ambience, flow, and the disruptive spatio-temporalities of mobile news media	JOURNALISM STUDIES			English	Article						flow; social media; mobilities; mobile interface; temporality; materiality		This article explores how mobile consumption practices afforded by new mobile media have transformed the spatialities and temporalities of news media through processes such as proliferation, participation, personalization, cross-platform flow, geolocation, and mapping. Expanding journalism studies to encompass digital social media and the interdisciplinary field of mobilities research, the approach taken here gives greater attention to the making and unmaking of materialities and infrastructure in order to show how the mobile production, dissemination, and consumption of news produces new spatial temporalities and scales. With the emergence of various mobile interfaces and personalized networks connected via mobile social media, news is not only constantly accessed "on demand" from miniature mobiles, but also tagged, curated, aggregated, and easily re-distributed, fostering "ambient journalism" (Hermida) and on-location "citizen witnessing" (Allan). Through a historical analysis of changes in the New York Times since the 1990s and a consideration of emerging modes of on-demand, on-location, participatory news production, it is argued that the redistribution of the places, spaces, and timing of news production and consumption has transformed not only the content, form, and style of news, but also the very temporality of news as an event. Through an analysis of the impact of these changes on the reporting of recent natural disasters, the article seeks to envision an enlivened terrain of mobile news that is live, active, immersive, pervasive, and constantly updating, yet also attentive to the implications of infrastructural disruption, data-mining, and surveillance.

This study analyzed the data collected from the experiments made by a lean production simulation laboratory at a university in Taiwan, so as to investigate whether production optimization results of the enterprises can promote the overall performance of production and service. This study first compared the data envelopment analysis (DEA) with the experimental data, so as to evaluate whether the optimized production can improve the performance. It then analyzed main factors influencing the income with decision tree, and established the optimized production performance detection model respectively using three data mining technologies, namely the GABPN, BPN and decision tree. The analytic results showed that the output through optimized production does improve the overall performance of production and service. The main factors affecting the technical efficiency include the time consumed from serving all dishes on the table to leaving the table and the time consumed from leaving the table to paying the bill. Among these three data mining technologies, GABPN has the best detection ability.

In turn, modulation frequency features have surfaced in the area of music data mining, also known as music information retrieval (MIR). The term 'modulation spectral features' has been used rather loosely, but we refer to them as temporal patterns in a signal that may be revealed via the modulation spectrum. This paper consists of a literature survey of modulation features in which we review the historical use of general modulation features along with evolving interest in exploring modulation spectral features for data mining in music signals. We also discuss challenges encountered in employing modulation spectral features with music signals and suggest new directions in this area. Lastly, we further exploit modulation spectral features by applying these motivated concepts, properties, and parameters of modulation spectra and its features to our preliminary, unsupervised source identification method for sound sources of periodic, temporal patterns.

In this study, a CBR system was developed for marketing mix planning (MMP) in a steel manufacturing company. In case retrieval, feature weighting is an important component and plays a key role in CBR efficiency. In recent years, several methods have been presented for feature weighting, which have used retrieval accuracy only for performance ranking of weighting methods and ignored other method dimensions. In order to consider other dimensions for weighting method ranking, this study applied a fuzzy AHP method to prioritize weighting methods. In this study, genetic algorithm (GA), rough set theory (RST) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) were used for feature weighting. Moreover, feature weighting based on FIS was introduced in this work for the first time.

Self-organizing maps with information theoretic learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						SOM; Kernel methods; Information theoretic learning; Magnification factor	DENSITY-ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; QUANTIZATION; MAXIMIZATION; CORRENTROPY; NETWORKS	The self-organizing map (SUM) is one of the popular clustering and data visualization algorithms and has evolved as a useful tool in pattern recognition, data mining since it was first introduced by Kohonen. However, it is observed that the magnification factor for such mappings deviates from the informationtheoretically optimal value of 1 (for the SUM it is 2/3). This can be attributed to the Use of the mean square error to adapt the system, which distorts the mapping by oversampling the low probability regions. In this work, we first discuss the kernel SUM in terms of a similarity measure called correntropy induced metric (CIM) and empirically show that this can enhance the magnification of the mapping without much increase in the computational complexity of the algorithm. We also show that adapting the SUM in the CIM sense is equivalent to reducing the localized cross information potential, an informationtheoretic function that quantifies the similarity between two probability distributions. Using this property we propose a kernel bandwidth adaptation algorithm for Gaussian kernels, with both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic components. We show that the proposed model can achieve a mapping with optimal magnification and can automatically adapt the parameters of the kernel function. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It reduces the number of features by removing noisy, irrelevant and redundant data. In this paper, a novel feature selection algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), called Advanced Binary ACO (ABACO), is presented. Features are treated as graph nodes to construct a graph model and are fully connected to each other. In this graph, each node has two sub-nodes, one for selecting and the other for deselecting the feature. Ant colony algorithm is used to select nodes while ants should visit all features. The use of several statistical measures is examined as the heuristic function for visibility of the edges in the graph. At the end of a tour, each ant has a binary vector with the same length as the number of features, where 1 implies selecting and 0 implies deselecting the corresponding feature. The performance of proposed algorithm is compared to the performance of Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), CatfishBPSO, Improved Binary Gravitational Search Algorithm (IBGSA), and some prominent ACO-based algorithms on the task of feature selection on 12 well-known UCI datasets. Simulation results verify that the algorithm provides a suitable feature subset with good classification accuracy using a smaller feature set than competing feature selection methods.

Exploring the Possibilities and Limitations of a Nanomaterials Genome	SMALL			English	Article							NANOSCIENCE; GENE; NANOSTRUCTURES; TABLE	What are we going to do with the cornucopia of nanomaterials appearing in the open and patent literature, every day? Imagine the benefits of an intelligent and convenient means of categorizing, organizing, sifting, sorting, connecting, and utilizing this information in scientifically and technologically innovative ways by building a Nanomaterials Genome founded upon an all-purpose Periodic Table of Nanomaterials. In this Concept article, inspired by work on the Human Genome project, which began in 1989 together with motivation from the recent emergence of the Materials Genome project initiated in 2011 and the Nanoinformatics Roadmap 2020 instigated in 2010, we envision the development of a Nanomaterials Genome (NMG) database with the most advanced data-mining tools that leverage inference engines to help connect and interpret patterns of nanomaterials information. It will be equipped with state-of-the-art visualization techniques that rapidly organize and picture, categorize and interrelate the inherited behavior of complex nanomatter from the information programmed in its constituent nanomaterials building blocks. A Nanomaterials Genome Initiative (NMGI) of the type imagined herein has the potential to serve the global nanoscience community with an opportunity to speed up the development continuum of nanomaterials through the innovation process steps of discovery, structure determination and property optimization, functionality elucidation, system design and integration, certification and manufacturing to deployment in technologies that apply these versatile nanomaterials in environmentally responsible ways. The possibilities and limitations of this concept are critically evaluated in this article.

However, the associated rapid increase in digital data volumes does not automatically correlate with new insights and advances in our understanding of those data. The relatively new technique of data mining offers a promising way to extract knowledge and patterns from large, multidimensional and complex data sets. This paper therefore aims to provide a comprehensive overview of existing data mining techniques and related tools and to illustrate the potential of data mining for different research areas by means of example applications. Despite a number of conventional data mining techniques and methods, these classical approaches are restricted to isolated or "silo" data sets and therefore remain primarily stand alone and specialized in nature. Highly complex and mostly interdisciplinary questions in environmental research cannot be answered sufficiently using isolated or area-based data mining approaches. To this end, the linked open data (LOD) approach will be presented as a new possibility in support of complex and inter-disciplinary data mining analysis. The merit of LOD will be explained using examples from medicine and environmental research. The advantages of LOD data mining will be weighed against classical data mining techniques. LOD offers unique and new possibilities for interdisciplinary data analysis, modeling and projection for multidimensional, complex landscapes and may facilitate new insights and answers to complex environmental questions. Our paper aims to encourage those research scientists which do not have extensive programming and data mining knowledge to take advantage of existing data mining tools, to embrace classical data mining and LOD approaches in support of gaining more insight and recognizing patterns in highly complex data sets.

J	Su, MY; Tsai, CH				Su, Ming-Yang; Tsai, Chen-Han			Using data mining approaches to identify voice over IP spam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Genetic algorithms; k-nearest neighbor (kNN); spam over Internet telephony (SPIT); prevention of SPIT (PSPIT); session initiation protocol (SIP); feature weighting; cross-validation		With its rapid growth in popularity and attendant personal and commercial use of voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), spam over VoIP has emerged as a significant problem. In this paper, we first applied genetic algorithms to weight predetermined features of VoIP calls. Based on the weighting technique, we then proposed a mechanism for the online prevention of VoIP spam by the k-nearest neighbor classification. Differing from the traditional k-nearest neighbor algorithm, this paper used genetic algorithms to weight features to reflect the different degree of importance of each feature. VoIP is a real-time communication service, as compared to off-line e-mail, and VoIP spam is also known as Spam over Internet telephony (SPIT). The system proposed in this paper has been named PSPIT that denotes Prevention of SPIT. Once spam is identified, the proposed PSPIT immediately updates the built-in blacklist on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server to block that specific user from sending SPIT again. The n-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate PSPIT for unknown SPIT detection; in the case of n=2, the best overall accuracy was 94.7%, whereas in the case of n=4, the best overall accuracy was 93.1%.

The GLOBAQUA project	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Ecosystem functioning; Ecosystem services; Modelling; Climate scenarios; Improved management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; MEDITERRANEAN RIVERS; SOUTHERN EUROPE; MANAGEMENT; SCENARIOS; QUALITY; SYSTEMS	Water scarcity is a serious environmental problem in many European regions, and will likely increase in the near future as a consequence of increased abstraction and climate change. Water scarcity exacerbates the effects of multiple stressors, and thus results in decreased water quality. It impacts river ecosystems, threatens the services they provide, and it will force managers and policy-makers to change their current practices. The EU-FP7 project GLOBAQUA aims at identifying the prevalence, interaction and linkages between stressors, and to assess their effects on the chemical and ecological status of freshwater ecosystems in order to improve water management practice and policies. GLOBAQUA assembles a multidisciplinary team of 21 European plus 2 non-European scientific institutions, as well as water authorities and river basin managers. The project includes experts in hydrology, chemistry, biology, geomorphology, modelling, socio-economics, governance science, knowledge brokerage, and policy advocacy. GLOBAQUA studies six river basins (Ebro, Adige, Sava, Evrotas, Anglian and Souss Massa) affected by water scarcity, and aims to answer the following questions: how does water scarcity interact with other existing stressors in the study river basins? How will these interactions change according to the different scenarios of future global change? Which will be the foreseeable consequences for river ecosystems? How will these in turn affect the services the ecosystems provide? How should management and policies be adapted to minimise the ecological, economic and societal consequences?

While CNVs are often only common in a small number of samples in the studied population or patient cohort, previous work has not focused on customized identification of CNV regions that only exhibit in subsets of samples with advanced data mining techniques to reliably answer questions such as "Which are all the chromosomal fragments showing nearly identical deletions or insertions in more than 30% of the individuals?". Results: We introduce a tool for mining CNV subspace patterns, namely SubPatCNV, which is capable of identifying all aberrant CNV regions specific to arbitrary sample subsets larger than a support threshold. By design, SubPatCNV is the implementation of a variation of approximate association pattern mining algorithm under a spatial constraint on the positional CNV probe features. In benchmark test, SubPatCNV was applied to identify population specific germline CNVs from four populations of HapMap samples. In experiments on the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset, SubPatCNV discovered many large aberrant CNV events in patient subgroups, and reported regions enriched with cancer relevant genes. In both HapMap data and TCGA data, it was observed that SubPatCNV employs approximate pattern mining to more effectively identify CNV subspace patterns that are consistent within a subgroup from high-density array data. Conclusions: SubPatCNV available through http://sourceforge.net/projects/subpatcnv/ is a unique scalable open-source software tool that provides the flexibility of identifying CNV regions specific to sample subgroups of different sizes from high-density CNV array data.

J	Cheng, Y				Cheng, Yi			Forward approximation and backward approximation in fuzzy rough sets	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy rough sets; Rule extraction; Data mining	ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; AXIOMATIC CHARACTERIZATION; INFORMATION GRANULATION; OPERATORS; SELECTION; RULES	It is general to obtain rules by attribute reduction in fuzzy information systems. Instead of obtaining rules by attribute reduction, which may have a negative effect on inducting good rules, the objective of this paper is to extract rules without computing attribute reducts. Forward and backward approximations in fuzzy rough sets are first defined, and their important properties are discussed. Two algorithms based on forward and backward approximations, namely, mine rules based on the forward approximation (MRBFA) and mine rules based on the backward approximation (MRBBA), are proposed for rule extraction. The two algorithms are evaluated by several data sets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results show that both MRBFA and MRBBA achieve better classification performances than the method based on attribute reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, J; Xie, Q; Zheng, K				Zhu, Jia; Xie, Qing; Zheng, Kai			An improved early detection method of type-2 diabetes mellitus using multiple classifier system	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple classifier system; T2DM; Classification	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MAJORITY VOTE; ALGORITHMS; ENSEMBLES	The specific causes of complex diseases such as Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have not yet been identified. Nevertheless, many medical science researchers believe that complex diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Detection of such diseases becomes an issue because it is not free from false presumptions and is accompanied by unpredictable effects. Given the greatly increased amount of data gathered in medical databases, data mining has been used widely in recent years to detect and improve the diagnosis of complex diseases. However, past research showed that no single classifier can be considered optimal for all problems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on employing multiple classifier systems to improve the accuracy of detection for complex diseases, such as T2DM. We proposed a dynamic weighted voting scheme called multiple factors weighted combination for classifiers' decision combination. This method considers not only the local and global accuracy but also the diversity among classifiers and localized generalization error of each classifier. We evaluated our method on two real T2DM data sets and other medical data sets. The favorable results indicated that our proposed method significantly outperforms individual classifiers and other fusion methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We identified 2,750 proteins at false discovery rates of 1.3% (protein) and 0.03% (spectrum) by comparing the proteomic profiles of three GC and a normal gastric cell lines. Nine proteins were significantly dysregulated in all three GC cell lines, including filamin C, a muscle-specific filamin and a large actin-cross-linking protein. Downregulation of filamin C in GC cell lines and tissues were verified using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Data-mining using public microarray datasets shown that filamin C was significantly reduced in many human primary and metastasis cancers. Transient expression or silencing of filamin C affected the proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells. Silencing of endogenous filamin C enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas ectopic expression of filamin C had opposing effects. Silencing of filamin C increased the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 2 and improved the metastasis of prostate cancer in a zebrafish model. High filamin C associated with better prognosis of prostate cancer, leukemia and breast cancer patients. These findings establish a functional role of filamin C in human cancers and these data will be valuable for further study of its mechanisms.

Realizing the ultimate goal of identifying genome-wide signatures that define and drive specific neuronal fates has been hampered by enormous complexity in both time and space during development. Here, we have paired high-throughput purification of pyramidal neuron subclasses with deep profiling of spatiotemporal transcriptional dynamics during corticogenesis to resolve lineage choice decisions. We identified numerous features ranging from spatial and temporal usage of alternative mRNA isoforms and promoters to a host of mRNA genes modulated during fate specification. Notably, we uncovered numerous long noncoding RNAs with restricted temporal and cell-type-specific expression. To facilitate future exploration, we provide an interactive online database to enable multidimensional data mining and dissemination. This multifaceted study generates a powerful resource and informs understanding of the transcriptional regulation underlying pyramidal neuron diversity in the neocortex.

Data Mining Strategies to Improve Multiplex Microbead Immunoassay Tolerance in a Mouse Model of Infectious Diseases	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SIMULTANEOUS SERODETECTION; TRANSGENIC MICE; VIRUS; PARVOVIRUS; CYTOKINES; ASSAY	Multiplex methodologies, especially those with high-throughput capabilities generate large volumes of data. Accumulation of such data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is fast becoming more common and thus requires the development and implementation of effective data mining strategies designed for biological and clinical applications. Multiplex microbead immunoassay (MMIA), on xMAP or MagPix platform (Luminex), which is amenable to automation, offers a major advantage over conventional methods such as Western blot or ELISA, for increasing the efficiencies in serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. MMIA allows detection of antibodies and/or antigens efficiently for a wide range of infectious agents simultaneously in host blood samples, in one reaction vessel. In the process, MMIA generates large volumes of data. In this report we demonstrate the application of data mining tools on how the inherent large volume data can improve the assay tolerance (measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity) by analysis of experimental data accumulated over a span of two years. The combination of prior knowledge with machine learning tools provides an efficient approach to improve the diagnostic power of the assay in a continuous basis. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth knowledge base to study pathological trends of infectious agents in mouse colonies on a multivariate scale. Data mining techniques using serodetection of infections in mice, developed in this study, can be used as a general model for more complex applications in epidemiology and clinical translational research.

In this context, hyperspectral imaging offers a particularly promising approach since it provides non-destructive measurements of plants correlated with internal structure and biochemical compounds. In this paper, we present a cascade of data mining techniques for fast and reliable data-driven sketching of complex hyperspectral dynamics in plant science and plant phenotyping. To achieve this, we build on top of a recent linear time matrix factorization technique, called Simplex Volume Maximization, in order to automatically discover archetypal hyperspectral signatures that are characteristic for particular diseases. The methods were applied on a data set of barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare) diseased with foliar plant pathogens Pyrenophora teres, Puccinia hordei and Blumeria graminis hordei. Towards more intuitive visualizations of plant disease dynamics, we use the archetypal signatures to create structured summaries that are inspired by metro maps, i.e. schematic diagrams of public transport networks. Metro maps of plant disease dynamics produced on several real-world data sets conform to plant physiological knowledge and explicitly illustrate the interaction between diseases and plants. Most importantly, they provide an abstract and interpretable view on plant disease progression.

Applicability of data mining algorithms in the identification of beach features/patterns on high-resolution satellite data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						data mining; decision trees; artificial neural networks; IKONOS-2; beach features/patterns	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; HYPERSPECTRAL DATA; COASTAL ZONES; IMAGE; GIS; MORPHODYNAMICS; PRODUCTS	The available beach classification algorithms and sediment budget models are mainly based on in situ parameters, usually unavailable for several coastal areas. A morphological analysis using remotely sensed data is a valid alternative. This study focuses on the application of data mining techniques, particularly decision trees (DTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to an IKONOS-2 image in order to identify beach features/patterns in a stretch of the northwest coast of Portugal. Based on knowledge of the coastal features, five classes were defined. In the identification of beach features/patterns, the ANN algorithm presented an overall accuracy of 98.6% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. The best DTs algorithm (with pruning) presents an overall accuracy of 98.2% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. The results obtained through the ANN and DTs were in agreement. However, the ANN presented a classification more sensitive to rip currents. The use of ANNs and DTs for beach classification from remotely sensed data resulted in an increased classification accuracy when compared with traditional classification methods. The association of remotely sensed high-spatial resolution data and data mining algorithms is an effective methodology with which to identify beach features/patterns.

Here, we present the 2014 edition of arrayMap (http://www.arraymap.org), a publicly accessible collection of pre-processed oncogenomic array data sets and CNA profiles, representing a vast range of human malignancies. Since the initial release, we have enhanced this resource both in content and especially with regard to data mining support. The 2014 release of arrayMap contains more than 64 000 genomic array data sets, representing about 250 tumor diagnoses. Data sets included in arrayMap have been assembled from public repositories as well as additional resources, and integrated by applying custom processing pipelines. Online tools have been upgraded for a more flexible array data visualization, including options for processing user provided, non-public data sets. Data integration has been improved by mapping to multiple editions of the human reference genome, with the majority of the data now being available for the UCSC hg18 as well as GRCh37 versions. The large amount of tumor CNA data in arrayMap can be freely downloaded by users to promote data mining projects, and to explore special events such as chromothripsis-like genome patterns.

The information is obtained by manual extraction from primary literature, text and data mining, data integration, and prediction algorithms. Approximately 300 million data include enzyme function and molecular data from more than 30 000 organisms. The manually derived core contains 3 million data from 77 000 enzymes annotated from 135 000 literature references. Each entry is connected to the literature reference and the source organism. They are complemented by information on occurrence, enzyme/disease relationships from text mining, sequences and 3D structures from other databases, and predicted enzyme location and genome annotation. Functional and structural data of more than 190 000 enzyme ligands are stored in BRENDA. New features improving the functionality and analysis tools were implemented. The human anatomy atlas CAVEman is linked to the BRENDA Tissue Ontology terms providing a connection between anatomical and functional enzyme data. Word Maps for enzymes obtained from PubMed abstracts highlight application and scientific relevance of enzymes. The Enzyme Detector genome annotation tool and the reaction database BKM-react including reactions from BRENDA, KEGG and MetaCyc were improved. The website was redesigned providing new query options.

Dayem; Chelala, Claude			BCCTBbp: the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank bioinformatics portal	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article								BCCTBbp (http://bioinformatics.breastcancertissue bank.org) was initially developed as the data-mining portal of the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank (BCCTB), a vital resource of breast cancer tissue for researchers to support and promote cutting-edge research. BCCTBbp is dedicated to maximising research on patient tissues by initially storing genomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and microRNA data that has been mined from the literature and linking to pathways and mechanisms involved in breast cancer. Currently, the portal holds 146 datasets comprising over 227 795 expression/genomic measurements from various breast tissues (e.g. normal, malignant or benign lesions), cell lines and body fluids. BCCTBbp can be used to build on breast cancer knowledge and maximise the value of existing research. By recording a large number of annotations on samples and studies, and linking to other databases, such as NCBI, Ensembl and Reactome, a wide variety of different investigations can be carried out. Additionally, BCCTBbp has a dedicated analytical layer allowing researchers to further analyse stored datasets. A future important role for BCCTBbp is to make available all data generated on BCCTB tissues thus building a valuable resource of information on the tissues in BCCTB that will save repetition of experiments and expand scientific knowledge.

Araport: the Arabidopsis Information Portal	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL DATA; DATA SETS; PLATFORM; ANNOTATION; GENERATION; INTERMINE; ONTOLOGY; BROWSER; TOOL	The Arabidopsis Information Portal (https://www.araport.org) is a new online resource for plant biology research. It houses the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence and associated annotation. It was conceived as a framework that allows the research community to develop and release 'modules' that integrate, analyze and visualize Arabidopsis data that may reside at remote sites. The current implementation provides an indexed database of core genomic information. These data are made available through feature-rich web applications that provide search, data mining, and genome browser functionality, and also by bulk download and web services. Araport uses software from the InterMine and JBrowse projects to expose curated data from TAIR, GO, BAR, EBI, UniProt, PubMed and EPIC CoGe. The site also hosts 'science apps,' developed as prototypes for community modules that use dynamic web pages to present data obtained on-demand from third-party servers via RESTful web services. Designed for sustainability, the Arabidopsis Information Portal strategy exploits existing scientific computing infrastructure, adopts a practical mixture of data integration technologies and encourages collaborative enhancement of the resource by its user community.

With intensive effort made during the last two decades, numerous genes and mutations have been published to be associated with the disease. An organized resource integrating and annotating the ever-increasing genetic data will be imperative to acquire a global view of the cutting-edge in epilepsy research. Herein, we developed EpilepsyGene (http://61.152.91.49/EpilepsyGene). It contains cumulative to date 499 genes and 3931 variants associated with 331 clinical phenotypes collected from 818 publications. Furthermore, in-depth data mining was performed to gain insights into the understanding of the data, including functional annotation, gene prioritization, functional analysis of prioritized genes and overlap analysis focusing on the comorbidity. An intuitive web interface to search and browse the diversified genetic data was also developed to facilitate access to the data of interest. In general, EpilepsyGene is designed to be a central genetic database to provide the research community substantial convenience to uncover the genetic basis of epilepsy.

Lipid rafts are specialized membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids thought to act as dynamic signalling and sorting platforms. Given their fundamental roles in cellular regulation, there is a plethora of information on the size, composition and regulation of these membrane microdomains, including a large number of proteomics studies. To facilitate the mining and analysis of published lipid raft proteomics studies, we have developed a searchable database RaftProt. In addition to browsing the studies, performing basic queries by protein and gene names, searching experiments by cell, tissue and organisms; we have implemented several advanced features to facilitate data mining. To address the issue of potential bias due to biochemical preparation procedures used, we have captured the lipid raft preparation methods and implemented advanced search option for methodology and sample treatment conditions, such as cholesterol depletion. Furthermore, we have identified a list of high confidence proteins, and enabled searching only from this list of likely bona fide lipid raft proteins. Given the apparent biological importance of lipid raft and their associated proteins, this database would constitute a key resource for the scientific community.

In this study a specially designed superconducting magnet with a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which can provide three apparent gravity levels (mu-g, 1-g, and 2-g), was used to simulate a space-like gravity environment. Osteocyte, as the most important mechanosensor in bone, takes a pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. In this study, the effects of LG-HMF on gene expression profiling of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were investigated by Affymetrix DNA microarray. LG-HMF affected osteocyte gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and data mining were further analyzed by using bioinfomatic tools, such as DAVID, iReport. 12 energy metabolism related genes (PFKL, AK4, ALDOC, COX7A1, STC1, ADM, CA9, CA12, P4HA1, APLN, GPR35 and GPR84) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. An integrated gene interaction network of 12 DEGs was constructed. Bio-data mining showed that genes involved in glucose metabolic process and apoptosis changed notablly. Our results demostrated that LG-HMF affected the expression of energy metabolism related genes in osteocyte. The identification of sensitive genes to special environments may provide some potential targets for preventing and treating bone loss or osteoporosis.

Rough set theory, which has been used successfully in solving problems in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining, centers around the idea that a set of distinct objects may be approximated via a lower and upper bound. In order to obtain the benefits that rough sets can provide for data mining and related tasks, efficient computation of these approximations is vital. The recently introduced cloud computing model, MapReduce, has gained a lot of attention from the scientific community for its applicability to large-scale data analysis. In previous research, we proposed a MapReduce-based method for computing approximations in parallel, which can efficiently process complete data but fails in the case of missing (incomplete) data. To address this shortcoming, three different parallel matrix-based methods are introduced to process large-scale, incomplete data. All of them are built on MapReduce and implemented on Twister that is a lightweight MapReduce runtime system. The proposed parallel methods are then experimentally shown to be efficient for processing large-scale data.

J	Leyva, E; Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Leyva, Enrique; Gonzalez, Antonio; Perez, Raul			A Set of Complexity Measures Designed for Applying Meta-Learning to Instance Selection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Complexity measures; instance selection; meta-learning; data mining; machine learning	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; PROTOTYPE SELECTION; ALGORITHMS	In recent years, some authors have approached the instance selection problem from a meta-learning perspective. In their work, they try to find relationships between the performance of some methods from this field and the values of some data-complexity measures, with the aim of determining the best performing method given a data set, using only the values of the measures computed on this data. Nevertheless, most of the data-complexity measures existing in the literature were not conceived for this purpose and the feasibility of their use in this field is yet to be determined. In this paper, we revise the definition of some measures that we presented in a previous work, that were designed for meta-learning based instance selection. Also, we assess them in an experimental study involving three sets of measures, 59 databases, 16 instance selection methods, two classifiers, and eight regression learners used as meta-learners. The results suggest that our measures are more efficient and effective than those traditionally used by researchers that have addressed the instance selection from a perspective based on meta-learning.

Previous studies, to date, have been primarily focused on building accurate ensemble models from stream data. However, a linear scan of a large number of base classifiers in the ensemble during prediction incurs significant costs in response time, preventing ensemble learning from being practical for many real-world time-critical data stream applications, such as Web traffic stream monitoring, spam detection, and intrusion detection. In these applications, data streams usually arrive at a speed of GB/second, and it is necessary to classify each stream record in a timely manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel Ensemble-tree (E-tree for short) indexing structure to organize all base classifiers in an ensemble for fast prediction. On one hand, E-trees treat ensembles as spatial databases and employ an R-tree like height-balanced structure to reduce the expected prediction time from linear to sub-linear complexity. On the other hand, E-trees can be automatically updated by continuously integrating new classifiers and discarding outdated ones, well adapting to new trends and patterns underneath data streams. Theoretical analysis and empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach.

Holistic Measures for Evaluating Prediction Models in Smart Grids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Consumption prediction; performance measures; time series forecasting; regression tree learning; smart grids; energy sustainability	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; LOAD; ACCURACY; FORECASTS; LEVEL	The performance of prediction models is often based on "abstract metrics" that estimate the model's ability to limit residual errors between the observed and predicted values. However, meaningful evaluation and selection of prediction models for end-user domains requires holistic and application-sensitive performance measures. Inspired by energy consumption prediction models used in the emerging "big data" domain of Smart Power Grids, we propose a suite of performance measures to rationally compare models along the dimensions of scale independence, reliability, volatility and cost. We include both application independent and dependent measures, the latter parameterized to allow customization by domain experts to fit their scenario. While our measures are generalizable to other domains, we offer an empirical analysis using real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications: planning, customer education and demand response, which are relevant for energy sustainability. Our results underscore the value of the proposed measures to offer a deeper insight into models' behavior and their impact on real applications, which benefit both data mining researchers and practitioners.

We argue that there is a need for small-scale, qualitative studies of cultures of large-scale, quantitative data like ours, to open up spaces in which to reflect critically on the methods with which such data are produced. However, in this paper we highlight the difficulties we had enacting through action research a commitment to both the potential (which might be seen as the action part of action research) and the problems (which might be seen as the research part of action research) of digital methods. Following Hammersley [(2002). Action research: A contradiction in terms? Exeter: British Educational Research Association], we suggest that an equal balance between action and research may always be difficult to sustain, in both action research and the use of digital methods. Despite this, we argue that critical discussion of digital methods needs to extend beyond academic spaces - through this move, we suggest, we might open up a space in which to reflect on how these methods might be used for the public good.

Empirical research was performed to examine the effectiveness of the system in actual use. This study confirms that the new model developed by combining technology acceptance model (TAM), media richness theory, and the factors of self-efficacy can be applied to relevant AR research. The experiment results revealed that the average question classification accuracy of QAS when combined with artificial neural network and ontology was 98.76%. Moreover, the perceived media richness was found to be positively related to self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user attitude, and use intention. Furthermore, this study reveals that combining the TAM and media richness theory provides a stronger explanation than does the TAM alone. Before new systems are created, designers are suggested to consider the four factors of media richness theory (i.e., multiple cues, language variety, timely feedback, and personal focus), to greatly improve user attitudes toward and behavioral intentions to use new technologies.

The investigations are performed for autism data. Few chosen methods of feature selection have been applied and their results integrated in the final outcome. In this way we find the contents of small set of the most important genes associated with autism. They have been applied in the classification procedure aimed on recognition of autism from reference group members. The results of numerical experiments concerning selection of the most important genes and classification of the cases on the basis of the selected genes will be discussed. The main contribution of the paper is in developing the fusion system of the results of many selection approaches into the final set, most closely associated with autism. We have also proposed special procedure of estimating the number of highest rank genes used in classification procedure. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The nuclear radial positioning of NOR-CT correlated with the size of chromosomes with smaller CT more interior. A high frequency of pairwise associations between NOR-CT ranging from 52% (CT 13-21) to 82% (CT 15-21) was detected as well as a triplet arrangement of CT 15-21-22 (72%). The associations of homologous CT were significantly lower (24-36%). Moreover, singular contacts between CT 13-14 or CT 13-22 were found in the majority of cells, while CT 13-15 or CT 13-21 predominantly exhibited multiple interactions. In cells with multiple nucleoli, one of the nucleoli (termed "dominant") always associated with a higher number of CT. Moreover, certain CT pairs more frequently contributed to the same nucleolus than to others. This nonrandom pattern suggests that a large number of the NOR-chromosomes are poised in close proximity during the postmitotic nucleolar recovery and through their NORs may contribute to the formation of the same nucleolus. A global data mining program termed the chromatic median determined the most probable interchromosomal arrangement of the entire NOR-CT population. This interactive network model was significantly above randomized simulation and was composed of 13 connections among the NOR-CT. We conclude that the NOR-CT form a global interactive network in the cell nucleus that may be a fundamental feature for the regulation of nucleolar and other genomic functions.

However, they continue to face significant challenges in fully capturing and understanding the behavior of international tourists. The challenges are primarily due to the inefficient data collection approaches currently in use. In this paper, we present a new approach to this task by exploiting the socially generated and user-contributed geotagged photos now made publicly available on the Internet. Our case study focuses on Hong Kong inbound tourism using 29,443 photos collected from 2100 tourists. We demonstrate how a dataset constructed from such geotagged photos can help address such challenges as well as provide useful practical implications for destination development, transportation planning, and impact management. This study has the potential to benefit tourism researchers worldwide from better understanding travel behavior and developing sustainable tourism industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Traveler preference is unpredictable; for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences.

In order to introduce this concept we have proved that the cartesian product of a finite family of fuzzy normed linear spaces is a fuzzy normed linear space. Thus any fuzzy norm on K generates a fuzzy norm on K-n. Finally, we prove that each fuzzy Euclidean normed space is complete. Fuzzy Euclidean normed spaces can be proven to be a suitable tool for data mining. The method is based on embedding the data in fuzzy Euclidean normed spaces and to carry out data analysis in these spaces.

J	Tsai, CY; Huang, SH				Tsai, Chieh-Yuan; Huang, Sheng-Hsiang			A data mining approach to optimise shelf space allocation in consideration of customer purchase and moving behaviours	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						customer purchase and moving behaviour; shelf space allocation; association rules; high-utility mobile sequential patterns	MODEL; SUPERMARKETS; ASSORTMENT; SALES	A good shelf space allocation strategy can help customers easily find product items and dramatically increase store profit. Previous studies generally relied on the space elasticity formula to optimise space allocation models, but space elasticity requires estimates of many parameters, resulting in high costs and frequent errors in the mathematical models. In this study, a three-stage data mining method is proposed for solving the shelf space allocation problem with consideration of both customer purchase and moving behaviours. In the first stage, the customer's purchasing behaviour is derived from records of previous transactions, while moving behaviour is collected through radio frequency identification systems. In the second stage, the A priori algorithm is applied to obtain frequent product association rules from purchase transactions. In addition, the UMSPL algorithm is adopted to derive high-utility mobile sequential patterns from customer mobile transaction sequences. In the third stage, all product items are classified as either major, minor or trivial according to a set of criteria. A Location preference evaluation procedure is then developed to calculate location preference if a minor item is placed at a given section of the store. Based on the location preference matrix, minor items are reassigned to optimal shelves. The experimental results show the proposed method can reassign items to suitable shelves and dramatically increase cross-selling opportunities for major and minor items.

Since its creation in Aug 2012, the Materials API has been the Materials Project's de facto platform for data access, supporting not only the Materials Project's many collaborative efforts but also enabling new applications and analyses. We will highlight some of these analyses enabled by the Materials API, particularly those requiring consolidation of data on a large number of materials, such as data mining of structural and property trends, and generation of phase diagrams.

Traditional in-core mining algorithms do not scale well with huge data volumes, and are hindered by critical issues such as long execution times due to massive memory swap and main-memory exhaustion. This work is aimed at overcoming the scalability issues of existing in-core algorithms by improving their memory usage. A persistent structure, VLDBMine, to compactly store huge transactional datasets on disk and efficiently support large-scale itemset mining is proposed. VLDBMine provides a compact and complete representation of the data, by exploiting two different data structures suitable for diverse data distributions, and includes an appropriate indexing structure, allowing selective data retrieval. Experimental validation, performed on both real and synthetic datasets, shows the compactness of the VLDBMine data structure and the efficiency and scalability on large datasets of the mining algorithms supported by it.

Rescue and renewal of legacy soil resource inventories: A case study of the Limpopo National Park, Mozambique	CATENA			English	Article						Adequacy criteria; Soil organic carbon stocks; Digital soil mapping; Data mining; Data archaeology	ACID SULFATE SOILS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; RESURRECTION; UNCERTAINTY; GAMBIA; MAPS	Many areas of developing countries are covered by legacy soil surveys, which, however are hardly used, as they are not available in digital form, used outdated standards, and have unknown quality. There have been very few attempts to rescue and renew these surveys, nor are there established criteria for the evaluation of their quality. We therefore decided to test the applicability of the Cornell Adequacy Criteria (CAC) to assess the quality of several renewed soil surveys in or near the Limpopo National Park, Mozambique (centroid: 23 degrees 18' 55.57" S, 31 degrees 55' 16.24" E), using the concepts of digital soil mapping. The quality was assessed for mapping and monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC), in terms of geodetic control, positional accuracy, map scale, and texture and adequacy of map legend. Metadata was attached to the renewed maps. SOC stocks were estimated qualitatively based on the description of the map units and quantitatively by the measure-and-multiply approach from legacy laboratory measurements. The positional accuracy of georegistration was 13 to 45% of the square root of a Minimum Legible Area (MLA). Point and area-class layers could be created with high positional accuracy. However the index of maximum reduction was high, indicating that the original publication scale could be reduced. Map unit definitions and overall information content of the surveys were adequate. Integration of remotely sensed optical imagery and digital elevation models could be used to derive accurate contours, against which the positional accuracy of contour-based map borders was assessed. Less than 30% of their lengths were within a distance equal to the square root of MIA. These sources could not be used to evaluate internal map borders, due to the subdued topography and major land-use changes since the original survey. Qualitative estimates of SOC are between low and medium, consistent with other studies in this area. The CAC proved to be a useful framework for determining the fitness for use of legacy surveys.

J	Tsai, CY; Chen, CJ				Tsai, Chieh-Yuan; Chen, Chih-Jung			A PSO-AB classifier for solving sequence classification problems	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Sequence classification; Closed mining algorithm; Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm; Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SPEECH RECOGNITION; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE; OPTIMIZATION; METHODOLOGY; MODEL	Recently, considerable attention has focused on compound sequence classification methods which integrate multiple data mining techniques. Among these methods, sequential pattern mining (SPM) based sequence classifiers are considered to be efficient for solving complex sequence classification problems. Although previous studies have demonstrated the strength of SPM-based sequence classification methods, the challenges of pattern redundancy, inappropriate sequence similarity measures, and hard-to-classify sequences remain unsolved. This paper proposes an efficient two-stage SPM-based sequence classification method to address these three problems. In the first stage, during the sequential pattern mining process, redundant sequential patterns are identified if the pattern is a sub-sequence of other sequential patterns. A list of compact sequential patterns is generated excluding redundant patterns and used as representative features for the second stage. In the second stage, a sequence similarity measurement is used to evaluate partial similarity between sequences and patterns. Finally, a particles warm optimization-AdaBoost (PSO-AB) sequence classifier is developed to improve sequence classification accuracy. In the PSO-AB sequence classifier, the PSO algorithm is used to optimize the weights in the individual sequence classifier, while the AdaBoost strategy is used to adaptively change the distribution of patterns that are hard to classify. The experiments show that the proposed two-stage SPM-based sequence classification method is efficient and superior to other approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Churn management is of essential importance in detecting loyal and hopeless subscribers. Keeping current GSM number when changing the GSM operator also facilitates these subscribers to switch to another operator. Euclidean Indexing High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) method is a polynomial based modeling method which is used to predict the churner behavior of the GSM subscribers. An up-to-date data set consists of demographic information and call details records with the related churn behavior is used to model the churner detection problem. The proposed method uses 640 randomly selected training nodes for the modeling process while 316 nodes are used to examine the performance of the proposed method and to make comparisons with the data mining techniques.

J	Peng, T; Liu, L				Peng, Tao; Liu, Lu			A novel incremental conceptual hierarchical text clustering method using CFu-tree	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Text clustering; CFu-tree; Comparison Variation (CV); Incremental hierarchical clustering	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; RETRIEVAL	As a data mining method, clustering, which is one of the most important tools in information retrieval, organizes data based on unsupervised learning which means that it does not require any training data. But, some text clustering algorithms cannot update existing clusters incrementally and, instead, have to recompute a new clustering from scratch. In view of above, this paper presents a novel down-top incremental conceptual hierarchical text clustering approach using CFu-tree (ICHTC-CF) representation, which starts with each item as a separate cluster. Term-based feature extraction is used for summarizing a cluster in the process. The Comparison Variation measure criterion is also adopted for judging whether the closest pair of clusters can be merged or a previous cluster can be split. And, our incremental clustering method is not sensitive to the input data order. Experimental results show that the performance of our method outperforms k-means, CLIQUE, single linkage clustering and complete linkage clustering, which indicate our new technique is efficient and feasible.

It is a significant issue to develop effective and easy approach of rule extraction for classification. A new approach of rule extraction by features of attributes is proposed in this article for word sense disambiguation (WSD). English preposition on is taken as a target word of WSD, a data set of 600 samples is randomly selected from a 350,000 words corpus. Semantic and syntactic features are extracted from the context, and the corresponding formal context is generated. The rules for WSD of English preposition on are extracted based on the theoretical descriptions and calculation of the simple class exclusive attributes and composite class exclusive attributes. The extracted rules are used in the WSD of English preposition on, and the accuracy reaches 93.2%. The results of the comparative analysis show that the proposed feature of attribute approach is simpler, more effective and easier to use than the existing well-formed structural partial ordered attribute diagram approach.

PMBGNP uses graph structures for its individual representation, which shows higher expression ability than the classical EDAs. Hence, it extends EDAs to solve a range of problems, suchas data mining and agent control. This paper is dedicated to propose a continuous version of PMBGNP for continuous optimization in agent control problems. Different from the other continuous EDAs, the proposed algorithm evolves the continuous variables by reinforcement learning (RL). We compare the performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms on a real mobile robot control problem. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others with statistically significant differences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While in principle this goal can be met using knowledge of the electron charge density, the relationships between the density and properties are largely unknown. To help overcome this problem we develop a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) between the charge density and the elastic constants for B2 intermetallics. Using a combination of informatics techniques for screening all the potentially relevant charge density descriptors, we find that C-11 and C-44 are determined solely from the magnitude of the charge density at its critical points, while C-12 is determined by the shape of the charge density at its critical points. From this reduced charge density selection space, we develop models for predicting the elastic constants of an expanded number of intermetallic systems, which we then use to predict the mechanical stability of new systems. Having reduced the descriptors necessary for modeling elastic constants, statistical learning approaches may then be used to predict the reduced knowledge-based required as a function of the constituent characteristics.

It is difficult to write a new metamorphic malware and in general malware writers reuse old malware. To hide detection the malware writers change the obfuscations (syntax) more than the behavior (semantic) of such a new malware. On this assumption and motivation, this paper presents a new framework named MARD for Metamorphic Malware Analysis and Real-Time Detection. As part of the new framework, to build a behavioral signature and detect metamorphic malware in real-time, we propose two novel techniques, named ACFG (Annotated Control Flow Graph) and SWOD-CFWeight (Sliding Window of Difference and Control Flow Weight). Unlike other techniques, ACFG provides a faster matching of CFGs, without compromising detection accuracy; it can handle malware with smaller CFGs, and contains more information and hence provides more accuracy than a CFG. SWOD-CFWeight mitigates and addresses key issues in current techniques, related to the change of the frequencies of opcodes, such as the use of different compilers, compiler optimizations, operating systems and obfuscations. The size of SWOD can change, which gives. anti-malware tool developers the ability to select appropriate parameter values to further optimize malware detection. CFWeight captures the control flow semantics of a program to an extent that helps detect metamorphic malware in real-time. Experimental evaluation of the two proposed techniques, using an existing dataset, achieved detection rates in the range 94%-99.6%. Compared to ACFG, SWOD-CFWeight significantly improves the detection time, and is suitable to be used where the time for malware detection is more important as in real-time (practical) anti-malware applications.

Integrating Human Behavior Modeling and Data Mining Techniques to Predict Human Errors in Numerical Typing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Behavior modeling; data mining; electroencephalograph (EEG); human errors; linear discriminant analysis; numerical typing	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; NEUROMOTOR NOISE; FORCE PRODUCTION; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; SELECTION; MOVEMENT; NETWORK; STRESS	Numerical typing errors can lead to serious consequences, but various causes of human errors and the lack of contextual clues in numerical typing make their prediction difficult. Human behavior modeling can predict the general tendency in making errors, while data mining can recognize neurophysiological feedback in detecting cognitive abnormality on a trial-by-trial basis. This study suggests integrating human behavior modeling and datamining to predict human errors because it utilizes both 1) top-down inference to transform interactions between task characteristics and conditions into a general inclination of an average operator to make errors and 2) bottom-up analysis in parsing psychophysiological measurements into an individual's likelihood of making errors on a trial-by-trial basis. Real-time electroencephalograph (EEG) features collected in a numerical typing experiment and modeling features produced by an enhanced human behavior model (queuing network model human processor) were combined to improve error classification performance by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. Integrating EEG and modeling features improved the results of LDA classification by 28.3% in keenness (d') and by 10.7% in the area under ROC curve (AUC) from that of using EEG only; it also outperformed the other three benchmarking scenarios: using behaviors only, using apparent task features, and using task features plus trial information. The AUC was significantly increased from using EEG along only if EEG + Model features were used.

J	Li, HL				Li, Hailin			On-line and dynamic time warping for time series data mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Dynamic time warping; Similarity measure; Time series data mining; Online measurement	ALGORITHM	Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a robust method used to measure similarity of time series. To speed up the calculation of DTW, an on-line and dynamic time warping is proposed to the field of time series data mining. A sliding window is used to segment a long time series into several short subsequences, and an efficient DTW proposed to measure the similarity of each pair of short subsequences. Meanwhile, a forward factor is proposed to set an overlap warping path for the two adjacent subsequences, which makes the last warping path be close to the best warping path between two time series. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to DTW, the proposed approach comparing to DTW measures the similarity of time series fast and validly, which improves the performance of the algorithm applied to the field of time series data mining.

Product customization of tablet computers based on the information of online reviews by customers	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Product customization; Customer online reviews; Association rule mining	WORD-OF-MOUTH; DATA-MINING APPROACH; A-KIND PRODUCTION; MASS CUSTOMIZATION; PORTFOLIO IDENTIFICATION; DESIGN; METHODOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; CONFIGURATION; REQUIREMENTS	Since the first release of Apple iPad in April 2010, tablet computers (or simply tablets) can be viewed as a new category of technological products for general consumers. To compete in the evolving market, it is expected that the manufacturers need to customize the design of tablets to satisfy different needs of customers. To support product customization in this context, one specific challenge is that the customer information of tablets is relatively limited due to the newness of the product category. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a data mining approach to analyze the online reviews that contain customer opinions towards tablet products. In this research, tablet usages are first classified according to three user types: personal, business and student. From the online reviews, association rule mining is applied to investigate what tablet attributes are desired by specific user types. To examine the approach, the online reviews were collected from the time between April 2010 (first release of Apple iPad) and May 2011. Then, the association rule results from that time are compared with the recent tablet products on the market. It is demonstrated that online reviews as the original customer information can provide relevant insights for product customization.	[Li, Simon; Nahar, Kamrun; Fung, Benjamin C.

As such, accurate estimates of the PDF are essential to reducing the uncertainties and errors associated with mining results. The nonparametric adaptive kernel density estimator (AKDE) provides accurate, robust, and asymptotically consistent estimates of a PDF. However, due to AKDE's extensive computational requirements, it cannot be directly applied to the data stream environment. This paper describes the development of an AKDE approximation approach that heeds the constraints of the data stream environment and supports efficient processing of multiple queries. To this end, this work proposes (1) the concept of local regions to provide a partition-based variable bandwidth to capture local density structures and enhance estimation quality; (2) a suite of linear-pass methods to construct the local regions and kernel objects online; (3) an efficient multiple queries evaluation algorithm; (4) a set of approximate techniques to increase the throughput of multiple density queries processing; and (5) a fixed-size memory time-based sliding window that updates the kernel objects in linear time. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with real-world and synthetic data sets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

The majority of current research in classification and categorization does not completely address the true structure and nature of data for particular application at hand. In contrast to most previous research, our proposed work focuses on the modeling and classification of spherical data that are naturally generated in many data mining and knowledge discovery applications such as text classification, visual scenes categorization and gene expression analysis. This paper investigates a generative mixture model to cluster spherical data based on Langevin distribution. In particular, we formulate a unified probabilistic framework, where we build probabilistic kernels based on Fisher score and information divergences from mixture of Langevin distributions for Support Vector Machine. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed learning framework through synthetic data and challenging applications involving spam filtering using both textual and visual email contents.

We construct a fuzzy inference system to predict the profit of the major 500 industrial enterprises of Turkey. For this aim, we use most of the data mining tools. First, we use fuzzy -means clustering algorithm and obtain the linguistic terms of the variables. Having used decision tree technique, fuzzy rules are revealed. Eventually, we compare various defuzzification strategies to obtain crisp prediction values of our fuzzy inference system. We can conclude that the prediction results of the smallest of maxima defuzzification strategy-based fuzzy inference system has circa 40 % smaller sum square error than that of classical regression model.

The Web content extraction process is very important for many technologies or uses as a preprocessing of many systems such as crawlers and indexers. Additionally, the extracted content is needed by the end users especially for blind and visually impaired users. It aims to extract useful and meaningful data from Webpages that are surrounded with various clutters such as advertisements and navigation menus. Many extraction algorithms are designed for English Language and perform less efficient and less accurate in Arabic language. In this paper, a bi-languages mining algorithm for extracting Web contents called BiLEx is presented. It extracts useful Web content from Arabic and English Webpages in the approximately same level of efficiency and accuracy. An experiment is made for 600 Webpages which are chosen randomly from 30 different Websites to test the proposed algorithm performance and efficiency. Results prove that BiLEx algorithm gives high precision, recall, and F1-measure for both Arabic and English Webpages.

In the control of the ecological process and for environmental management, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify surface water contamination (in areas such as rivers and dams) with contaminated runoff waters coming, for example, from cultivation and urban areas. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms applied to the data collected from a sample of soil-contaminated water aiming to identify if the water quality classification proposed in this research agrees with reality. The sample was part of a laboratory experiment, which began with a sample of treated water added with increasing fractions of soil. The results show that the proposed classification for water quality in this scenario is coherent, because different algorithms indicated a strong statistic relationship between the classes and their instances, that is, in the classes that qualify the water sample and the values which describe each class. The proposed water classification varies from excelling to very awful (12 classes).

Predictor variables for digital soil mapping are often chosen on the basis of data availability and the researcher's expert knowledge. Predictor variables commonly overlooked include alternative analysis scales for land-surface derivatives and additional remote sensing products. For this study, a pool of 412 potential predictors was assembled, which included qualitative location classes, elevation, land-surface derivatives (with a wide range of analysis scales), hydrologic indicators, as well as proximal and remote sensing (from multiple sources with a variety of resolutions). Subsets of the full pool were also examined for comparison. The performance for the models built from the different starting predictor pools was analyzed for seven target variables. Results suggest that models with limited predictor pools can substitute other predictors to compensate for the missing variables. However, a better performing model was always found by considering predictor variables at multiple scales. Compared with baseline subsets with the most commonly used predictors for digital soil mapping at a single scale, the use of multi-scale predictor variables produced an improvement in model performance ranging from negligible to a 70% increase in the adjusted le. Although the scale effect of the modifiable area unit problem is generally well known, this study suggests digital soil mapping efforts would be enhanced by the greater consideration of predictor variables at multiple analysis scales.

Alteration of the penA gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2), is the main mechanism conferring penicillin resistance including reduced susceptibility and resistance to ESCs. To predict and investigate putative amino acid mutations causing beta-lactam resistance particularly for ESCs, we applied proteochemometric modeling to generalize N. gonorrhoeae susceptibility data for predicting the interaction of PBP2 with therapeutic beta-lactam antibiotics. This was afforded by correlating publicly available data on antimicrobial susceptibility of wild-type and mutant N. gonorrhoeae strains for penicillin-G, cefixime and ceftriaxone with 50 PBP2 protein sequence data using partial least-squares projections to latent structures. The generated model revealed excellent predictability (R (2) = 0.91, Q (2) = 0.77, Q (Ext) (2) = 0.78). Moreover, our model identified amino acid mutations in PBP2 with the highest impact on antimicrobial susceptibility and provided information on physicochemical properties of amino acid mutations affecting antimicrobial susceptibility. Our model thus provided insight into the physicochemical basis for resistance development in PBP2 suggesting its use for predicting and monitoring novel PBP2 mutations that may emerge in the future.

By relating water quality, weather data, and various hydrological parameters to the chlorophyll-a concentration, a correlation was able to be established between them. R statistical modeling and data mining [ model tree, artificial neural network ( ANN), and radial basis function (RBF)] with Weka were used specifically employed for the purpose. An empirical model was developed with and without normalization of the input data. The empirical model with normalization of the input data showed excellent correlations (R-2 > 0.9) as compared to that without normalization of the input data (R-2 > 0.5). Based on 10 years of data and selection attributes using Weka preprocess, COD, T-P, and PO4-P were deemed to be the best attributes for the prediction of chlorophyll-a concentration in Daechung reservoir. As compared to classical mechanistic modeling, this approach is significantly less complicated, less time-consuming and more cost effective. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In software effort prediction the aim is to forecast the effort needed to complete a software project, whereas software fault prediction tries to identify fault-prone modules. In this research both tasks are considered, thereby using different data mining techniques. The predictive models not only need to be accurate but also comprehensible, demanding that the user can understand the motivation behind the model's prediction. Unfortunately, to obtain predictive performance, comprehensibility is often sacrificed and vice versa. To overcome this problem, we extract trees from well performing Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines for regression (SVRs) making use of a rule extraction algorithm ALPA. This method builds trees (using C4.5 and REPTree) that mimic the black-box model (RF, SVR) as closely as possible. The proposed methodology is applied to publicly available datasets, complemented with new datasets that we have put together based on the Android repository. Surprisingly, the trees extracted from the black-box models by ALPA are not only comprehensible and explain how the black-box model makes (most of) its predictions, but are also more accurate than the trees obtained by working directly on the data.

J	Bambauer, J				Bambauer, Jane			HASSLE	MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DRUG INTERDICTION; PROBABLE CAUSE; REASONABLE SUSPICION; 4TH-AMENDMENT; PROOF; PROBABILITY; JUDGMENT; VERDICTS; JUSTICE; BLACK	Before police perform a search or seizure, they typically must meet the probable cause or reasonable suspicion standard. Moreover, even if they meet the appropriate standard, their evidence must be individualized to the suspect and cannot rely on purely probabilistic inferences. Scholars and courts have long defended the distinction between individualized and purely probabilistic evidence, but existing theories of individualization fail to articulate principles that are descriptively accurate or normatively desirable. They overlook the only benefit that the individualization requirement can offer: reducing hassle. Hassle measures the chance that an innocent person will experience a search or seizure. Because some investigation methods meet the relevant suspicion standards but nevertheless impose too many stops and searches on the innocent, courts must have a lever independent from the suspicion standard to constrain the scope of criminal investigations. The individualization requirement has unwittingly performed this function, but not in an optimal way. Individualization has kept hassle low by entrenching old methods of investigation. Because courts designate practices as individualized when they are costly (for example, gumshoe methods) or lucky (for example, tips), the requirement has confined law enforcement to practices that cannot scale. New investigation methods such as facial-recognition software and pattern-based data mining, by contrast, can scale up law-enforcement activities very quickly. Although these innovations have the potential to increase the accuracy of stops and searches, they may also increase the total number of innocent individuals searched because of the innovations' speed and cost-effectiveness. By reforming individualization to minimize hassle, courts can enable law-enforcement innovations that are fairer and more accurate than traditional police investigations without increasing burdens on the innocent.

Modelling within-field variations in deoxynivalenol (DON) content in oats using proximal and remote sensing	PRECISION AGRICULTURE			English	Article						DON; Fusarium; MARSplines; ECa; Oats; Proximal sensing	HEAD BLIGHT PATHOGENS; FUSARIUM EAR BLIGHT; SMALL-GRAIN CEREALS; MYCOTOXIN CONTAMINATION; WINTER-WHEAT; VARIABILITY; TOXINS; MAIZE; CROPS	Within-field variations in the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in oat grain were investigated at two farms in south-west Sweden. At Sarestad farm (sampled 2012), where one of two fields studied was ploughed annually and the other was under no-till cultivation, the DON concentration varied between 28 and 1 755 ppb. The level was higher (270-5 000 ppb) at Entorp farm (sampled 2013). Within-field prediction models for DON were constructed using a data mining method (multi-variate adaptive regression splines) with satellite data, an ECa sensor and airborne laser scanning. At Sarestad, the no-till field had higher DON content, with the highest values in silty patches in the otherwise clayey soil. Sensor data related to soil and crop conditions had the potential to describe the DON variability within fields. The covariance between DON content and auxiliary data differed at Entorp farm, where high DON values (> 2 000 ppb) were found in clayey parts of the field. This pattern was attributed to poor drainage with recurring waterlogging. Within these clayey parts, the highest DON contents coincided with the highest biomass density. South-west Sweden received much less rainfall in 2013 than in 2012, which may have resulted in different DON patterns in relation to soil types. In 2012, more permeable silty soils apparently promoted growth, biomass production and DON production, whereas in 2013 a poorly drained clayey soil with high water-holding capacity favoured development of high DON concentrations.

But, soils vary a great deal in terms of origin, appearance, characteristics and production capacity. Better understanding of the causality between yield and yield-limiting soil factor(s) is essential for site-specific crop management. The objectives of this study were deriving a spatiotemporal yield trend map of a 144 km(2) paddy rice growing region located at an alluvial plain in southwestern Taiwan from satellite images and exploring the potential yield-limiting soil factor(s) in conjunction with general soil survey data. Due to the complexity of data sets, classification and regression trees analysis (CART) was used to relate soil characteristics to yield classes in the spatiotemporal yield trend map, and followed by comparisons of soil characteristics between those consistently-high and -low yielding areas to explore the interactions between yields and soil properties. Through the above data mining analysis, high soil pH, severe leaching loss of applied nitrogen fertilizers, and excessive reductive root environment were suspected to be the major soil related low-yielding mechanisms spread within studied region. Soil characteristics that induced these low-yielding mechanisms were identified and mapped. Error analysis indicated that 61.8 % of the consistently low-yield areas could be correctly identified by just a few soil characteristics. Improvements of management practices to alleviate the negative effects on yields were also proposed based on the identified low yielding mechanisms. Our study highlighted the pressing need and possible methodologies to adjust management strategies for narrowing yield variability and increasing crop production.

In previous studies, water movement through the soil has been simulated mainly using physically-based models. The most frequently used models for predicting soil water movement are MACRO, HYDRUS-1D/2D and Root Zone Water Quality Model. However, these models are difficult to apply to a small portion of land due to the information required about the soil and climate, which are difficult to obtain for each plot separately. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance and applicability of water outflow modeling by using a modeling approach based on machine learning techniques. It allows us to overcome the major drawbacks of physically-based models e.g., the complexity and difficulty of obtaining the information necessary for the calibration and the validation, by learning models from data collected from experimental fields that are representative for a wider area (region). We evaluate the proposed approach on data obtained from the La Jailliere experimental site, located in Western France. This experimental site represents one of the ten scenarios contained in the MACRO system. Our study focuses on two types of water outflows: discharge through sub-surface drainage systems and surface runoff. The results show that the proposed modeling approach successfully extracts knowledge from the collected data, avoiding the need to provide the information for calibration and validation of physically-based models. In addition, we compare the overall performance of the learned models with the performance of existing models MACRO and RZWQM. The comparison shows overall improvement in the prediction of discharge through sub-surface drainage systems, and partial improvement in the prediction of the surface runoff, in years with intensive rainfall.

This suggests that they can be effectively represented and compressed using only a few coefficients of an appropriate basis (e.g., Fourier and wavelets). However, distance estimation when the data are represented using different sets of coefficients is still a largely unexplored area. This work studies the optimization problems related to obtaining the tightest lower/upper bound on Euclidean distances when each data object is potentially compressed using a different set of orthonormal coefficients. Our technique leads to tighter distance estimates, which translates into more accurate search, learning and mining operations directly in the compressed domain. We formulate the problem of estimating lower/upper distance bounds as an optimization problem. We establish the properties of optimal solutions and leverage the theoretical analysis to develop a fast algorithm to obtain an exact solution to the problem. The suggested solution provides the tightest estimation of the -norm or the correlation. We show that typical data analysis operations, such as -nearest-neighbor search or k-Means clustering, can operate more accurately using the proposed compression and distance reconstruction technique. We compare it with many other prevalent compression and reconstruction techniques, including random projections and PCA-based techniques. We highlight a surprising result, namely that when the data are highly sparse in some basis, our technique may even outperform PCA-based compression. The contributions of this work are generic as our methodology is applicable to any sequential or high-dimensional data as well as to any orthogonal data transformation used for the underlying data compression scheme.

Due to the popularity of XML and with increasing numbers of XML documents, the process of knowledge discovery from this type of data has found more attention. Although in the last decade several different methods have been proposed for mining XML documents, this research field still is in its infancy compared to traditional data mining. As in relational techniques, in the case of XML documents, association rule mining has a strong research interest. In this paper we have performed a comprehensive study on all of the major works so far done on mining association rules from XML documents. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a reference point for future researches by collecting different techniques and methods concerning the topic; classifying them into a number of categories and creating a complete bibliography of the major published works. We think that this paper can help researchers in XML association rules mining domains to quickly find the current work as the basis for the future activities.

GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						crystalline rock; data mining; data synthesis; hydraulic conductivity; permeability	CONTINENTAL-CRUST; MOLASSE BASIN; FISSION-TRACK; INSITU MEASUREMENTS; CONSTRAINTS; TRANSPORT; TRENDS; FLOW	The permeability of crystalline rocks is generally assumed to decrease with depth due to increasing overburden stress. While experiments have confirmed the dependence of permeability on stress, field measurements of crystalline permeability have not previously yielded an unambiguous and universal relation between permeability and depth in the shallow crust (<2.5km). Large data sets from Sweden, Germany and Switzerland provide new opportunities to characterize the permeability of crystalline rocks in the shallow crust. Here we compile in situ permeability measurements (n=973) and quantitatively test potential relationships between permeability, depth (0-2.5km), lithology (intrusive and metamorphic) and tectonic setting (active and inactive). Higher permeabilities are more common at shallow depths (<1km), but trend analysis does not support a consistently applicable and generalizable relationship between permeability and depth in crystalline rock in the shallow crust. Results suggest lithology has a weak control on permeability-depth relations in the near surface (<0.1km), regardless of tectonic setting, but may be a more important control at depth. Tectonic setting appears to be a stronger control on permeability-depth relations in the near surface. Permeability values in the tectonically active Molasse basin are scattered with a very weak relationship between permeability and depth. While results indicate that there is no consistently applicable relationship between permeability and depth for crystalline rock in the shallow crust, some specific lithologies and tectonic settings display a statistically significant decrease of permeability with depth, with greater predictive power than a generalized relationship, that could be useful for hydrologic and earth system models.

Automatic Arabic text categorization: A comprehensive comparative study	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Arabic text categorization; classification; decision table; decision tree; K-Nearest Neighbour; light stemming; naive Bayes; RapidMiner; root-based stemming; Support Vector Machine; Weka	HYBRID APPROACH; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; WORDS	Text categorization or classification (TC) is concerned with placing text documents in their proper category according to their contents. Owing to the various applications of TC and the large volume of text documents uploaded on the Internet daily, the need for such an automated method stems from the difficulty and tedium of performing such a process manually. The usefulness of TC is manifested in different fields and needs. For instance, the ability to automatically classify an article or an email into its right class (Arts, Economics, Politics, Sports, etc.) would be appreciated by individual users as well as companies. This paper is concerned with TC of Arabic articles. It contains a comparison of the five best known algorithms for TC. It also studies the effects of utilizing different Arabic stemmers (light and root-based stemmers) on the effectiveness of these classifiers. Furthermore, a comparison between different data mining software tools (Weka and RapidMiner) is presented. The results illustrate the good accuracy provided by the SVM classifier, especially when used with the light10 stemmer. This outcome can be used in future as a baseline to compare with other unexplored classifiers and Arabic stemmers.

(rice). Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of these genes allow the definition of four types of NDPK isoforms with different predicted subcellular localization. These predictions are supported by experimental evidence for most NDPK types. Data mining also provides evidence for the existence of a novel NDPK type putatively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Phylogenic analyses indicate that plant types I, II, and III belong to the previously identified Nme group I whereas type IV belongs to Nme group II. Additional analysis of the literature offers clues supporting the idea that the various plant NDPK types have different functions. Hence, cytosolic type I NDPKs are involved in metabolism, growth, and stress responses. Type II NDPKs are localized in the chloroplast and mainly involved in photosynthetic development and oxidative stress management. Type III NDPKs have dual targeting to the mitochondria and the chloroplast and are principally involved in energy metabolism. The subcellular localization and precise function of the novel type IV NDPKs, however, will require further investigations.

Freshwater algae are considered biological indicators of environmental change and can be useful in assessing the impact of global climate change and increased environmental pollution. In this study, freshwater microeukaryotes in an Arctic reservoir at Ny-C(0)lesund (Svalbard, Norway) were studied using the hypervariable V1-V3 small subunit rRNA and 454 pyrosequencing. On the basis of 8,956 reads, we revealed high genetic diversity in eukaryotes, representing all known eukaryotic supergroups, except Excavata. "Chromalveolata" (previously supergroup Chromalveolata) and Archaeplastida were the most and least abundant supergroups, respectively. After data mining, 57 phylotypes were detected from 7,398 pyrosequences. They were dominated by stramenopiles (84 %) and Dinoflagellata (13 %), with minor contributions from Cryptophyta, Chlorophyta, and Telonemida. The detection of algae belonging to the orders Mamiellales and Monomastigales provides a window into a fraction of the 'rare biosphere' that had previously been undetected in such environments. Interestingly, no haptophytes were recorded. Stramenopiles and Dinoflagellata mainly comprised taxa belonging to the families Chrysophyceae, Synurophyceae, and Dinophyceae. On the basis of the proportion of operational taxonomic units, the dominant phylotypes were found to include Ochromonas spp., Mallomonas spp., and Uroglena americana. These results demonstrate the significance of a chrysophyte-dominated microeukaryotic community, which is of great potential for future studies in terms of reconstruction of past climate trends and monitoring of environmental change in the Arctic.

Predicting future rising stars is to find brilliant scholars/researchers in co-author networks. In this paper, we propose a solution for rising star prediction by applying machine learning techniques. For classification task, discriminative and generative modeling techniques are considered and two algorithms are chosen for each category. The author, co-authorship and venue based information are incorporated, resulting in eleven features with their mathematical formulations. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze the impact of individual feature, category wise and their combination w.r.t classification accuracy. Then, two ranking lists for top 30 scholars are presented from predicted rising stars. In addition, this concept is demonstrated for prediction of rising stars in database domain. Data from DBLP and Arnetminer databases (1996-2000 for wide disciplines) are used for algorithms' experimental analysis.	[Daud, Ali; Malik, M. S.

A total of 63 compounds were identified and tentatively assigned structures for the establishment of fingerprints using high-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS). Unsupervised and supervised pattern recognition technologies including principal component analysis (PCA), nearest neighbors algorithm(NN), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed. Results showed that Phyllanthus could be correctly classified according to their geographical locations and species through ANN and PLS-DA. Important variables for clusters discrimination were also identified by PCA. Although unsupervised and supervised pattern recognitions have their own disadvantage and application scope, they are effective and reliable for studying fingerprints of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). These two technologies are complementary and can be superimposed. Our study is the first holistic comparison of supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition technologies in the TCM chemical fingerprinting. They showed advantages in sample classification and data mining, respectively.

It uses the land-use database of Yixing City of Jiangsu Province, an urbanized and industrialized city in Yangtze River Delta of China, as an exemplification. The study area is divided into six kinds of land-use types according to the national standard of land-use classification. It includes arable land, garden, woodland, urban-rural construction land, water, and unused land. The six kinds of land-use types are formed into their corresponding landscape types in the scale of 1:10,000 by the aid of ArcGIS9.3 software of ESRI. In ArcGIS9.3, the landscape pattern indices are calculated by using Fragstats (raster version 3.3) software. Based on these landscape pattern indices, an integrated indicator system of landscape regionalization of land use in Yixing was established, and land-use regionalization models are set up using the catastrophe theory. Rough set theory is introduced to avoid the subjectivity in the indicator's importance in catastrophe models. The hidden rule among the raw data is acquired by knowledge reduction of the data mining in the rough set theory. In the process, indicators needed to be arranged according to the computed importance of an attribute without considering the determination of weight function. This greatly avoids the subjectivity in the process of weight factor determination. The zoning of land use based on landscape indices finally is made by the multi-indicator integrated catastrophe progression method. According to these indices, Yixing is divided into four grading land-use zones when the rough set and catastrophe progression methods are combined. The zones include high-, medium-, low-, and weak-intensity zones, indicating that land use primarily varies the landscape pattern. With the increase of water and forest area proportion, the human disturbance to land system wanes; patch fragmentation reduces; patch shape complexity enhances; and landscape diversity decreases. Moreover, it can mostly avoid the subjective evaluation in artificially determining factor weights by using rough set theory. It makes the zoning results more objective and exact.

The objective approach draws on already established text analysis methods for developing search filters. Our aim was to determine whether the objective approach for the development of search strategies was noninferior to the conceptual approach commonly used in Cochrane reviews (CRs). Methods: We conducted a search for CRs published in the Cochrane Library. The studies included in the CRs were searched for in MEDLINE and represented the total set. We then tested whether references previously removed could be identified via the objective approach. We also reconstructed the original search strategies from the CRs to determine why references could not be identified by the objective approach. As we performed the validation of the search strategies without study filters, we used only sensitivity as a quality measure and did not calculate precision. Results: The objective approach yielded a mean sensitivity of 96% based on 13 searches. The noninferiority test showed that this approach was noninferior to the conceptual approach used in the CRs (P < 0.002). An additional descriptive analysis showed that the original MEDLINE strategies could identify only 86% of all references; however, this lower sensitivity was largely due to one CR. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our findings indicate for the first time that the objective approach for the development of search strategies is noninferior to the conceptual approach.

J	Reiner, BI				Reiner, Bruce I.			The Quality/Safety Medical Index: Implementation and Analysis	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Data mining; Decision support; Image quality analysis; Radiation dose	CLINICAL DECISION-SUPPORT; SIMULATION; CT	Medical analytics relating to quality and safety measures have become particularly timely and of high importance in contemporary medical practice. In medical imaging, the dynamic relationship between medical imaging quality and radiation safety creates challenges in quantifying quality or safety independently. By creating a standardized measurement which simultaneously accounts for quality and safety measures (i.e., quality safety index), one can in theory create a standardized method for combined quality and safety analysis, which in turn can be analyzed in the context of individual patient, exam, and clinical profiles. The derived index measures can be entered into a centralized database, which in turn can be used for comparative performance of individual and institutional service providers. In addition, data analytics can be used to create customizable educational resources for providers and patients, clinical decision support tools, technology performance analysis, and clinical/economic outcomes research.

Data-Driven Decision Support for Radiologists: Re-using the National Lung Screening Trial Dataset for Pulmonary Nodule Management	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Decision support; Data mining; Decision support techniques; Web technology	SYSTEM	Real-time mining of large research trial datasets enables development of case-based clinical decision support tools. Several applicable research datasets exist including the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a dataset unparalleled in size and scope for studying population-based lung cancer screening. Using these data, a clinical decision support tool was developed which matches patient demographics and lung nodule characteristics to a cohort of similar patients. The NLST dataset was converted into Structured Query Language (SQL) tables hosted on a web server, and a web-based JavaScript application was developed which performs real-time queries. JavaScript is used for both the server-side and client-side language, allowing for rapid development of a robust client interface and server-side data layer. Real-time data mining of user-specified patient cohorts achieved a rapid return of cohort cancer statistics and lung nodule distribution information. This system demonstrates the potential of individualized real-time data mining using large high-quality clinical trial datasets to drive evidence-based clinical decision-making.

A heuristic algorithm for solving the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problems	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Minimum sum-of-squares clustering; Global optimization; Nonsmooth optimization; k-means algorithm; Global k-means algorithm	GLOBAL K-MEANS; SEARCH; BRANCH	Clustering is an important task in data mining. It can be formulated as a global optimization problem which is challenging for existing global optimization techniques even in medium size data sets. Various heuristics were developed to solve the clustering problem. The global -means and modified global -means are among most efficient heuristics for solving the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem. However, these algorithms are not always accurate in finding global or near global solutions to the clustering problem. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of the modified global -means algorithm in finding global solutions. We use an auxiliary cluster problem to generate a set of initial points and apply the -means algorithm starting from these points to find the global solution to the clustering problems. Numerical results on 16 real-world data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the global and modified global -means algorithms in finding global solutions to clustering problems.

Here, data mining methods were combined with serial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and clinical and laboratory parameters to predict 6-month functional outcome and mortality in patients with TBI. Data of consecutive adult patients presenting at a trauma center with moderate-to-severe head injury were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical parameters including serial GCS measurements at emergency department, 7th day, and 14th day and laboratory data were included for analysis (n=115). We employed artificial neural network (ANN), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, and logistic regression to predict mortality and functional outcomes at 6 months after TBI. Favorable functional outcome was achieved by 34.8 % of the patients, and overall 6-month mortality was 25.2 %. For 6-month functional outcome prediction, ANN was the best model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 96.13 %, sensitivity of 83.50 %, and specificity of 89.73 %. The best predictive model for mortality was NB with AUC of 91.14 %, sensitivity of 81.17 %, and specificity of 90.65 %. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated GCS measurements on the 7th and 14th day and difference between emergency room and 14th day GCS score as the most influential attributes both in mortality and functional outcome prediction models. Analysis of serial GCS measurements using data mining methods provided additional predictive information in relation to 6-month mortality and functional outcome in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI.

It can facilitate data clustering, classification and information retrieval. As an efficient technique for dimensionality reduction, feature selection is about finding a small feature subset preserving the most relevant information. In this paper, we propose a new criterion, called maximum projection and minimum redundancy feature selection, to address unsupervised learning scenarios. First, the feature selection is formalized with the use of the projection matrices and then characterized equivalently as a matrix factorization problem. Second, an iterative update algorithm and a greedy algorithm are proposed to tackle this problem. Third, kernel techniques are considered and the corresponding algorithm is also put forward. Finally, the proposed algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection methods. Experimental results reported for six publicly datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ikram, A; Qamar, U				Ikram, Aqdas; Qamar, Usman			Developing an expert system based on association rules and predicate logic for earthquake prediction	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Earthquake; Data mining; Prediction; Predicate logic; Expert system		Expert systems (ES) are a branch of applied artificial intelligence. The basic idea behind ES is simply that expertise, which is the vast body of task-specific knowledge, is transferred from a human to a computer. ES provide powerful and flexible means for obtaining solutions to a variety of problems that often cannot be dealt with by other, more traditional and orthodox methods. Thus, their use is proliferating to many sectors of our social and technological life, where their applications are proving to be critical in the process of decision support and problem solving. Earthquake professionals for many decades have recognized the benefits to society from reliable earthquake predictions, but uncertainties regarding source initiation, rupture phenomena, and accuracy of both the timing and magnitude of the earthquake occurrence have often times seemed either very difficult or impossible to overcome. This research proposes and implements an expert system to predict earthquakes from previous data. This is achieved by applying association rule mining on earthquake data from 1972 to 2013. These associations are polished using predicate-logic techniques to draw stimulating production-rules to be used with a rule-based expert system. The proposed expert system was able to predict all earthquakes which actually occurred within 12 h at-most. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed WDTW kernel function provides an optimal match between two time series data by not only allowing a non-linear mapping between two data sequences, but also considering relative significance depending on the phase difference between points on time series data.

Promoting the performance of vertical recommendation systems by applying new classification techniques	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Recommendation system; Classification; Naive Bayes; KNN; Association rules; Fuzzy logic		Recommender systems (RSs) have proven to be valuable means for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. RSs are software tools providing suggestions for items of interest to users; hence, they typically apply techniques and methodologies from Data Mining. The most frequently used technique is the classification as it matches the aims of RSs that basically classify items based on user's preferences. The main contribution of this paper is in the area of applying classification techniques to enhance the performance of RSs. In this paper, an Intelligent Adaptive Vertical Recommendation (IAVR) system will be introduced. IAVR recommends text documents related to a specific domain. Basically, the paper concentrates on the first phase of IAVR, which contains two modules; the first is a distiller, while the second is a multi-class classifier. The proposed distiller is employed as a binary classifier that elects documents related to the domain of interest. It is built upon a novel neuro-fuzzy system as well as a modified K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. On the other hand, the proposed multi-class classifier merges a new instance of Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, that depends on a proposed learning technique called "accumulative learning", with association rules. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed classifiers, which accordingly promote the overall system's recommendation accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In bread wheat, despite the high number of resistance loci that have been cataloged to date, only few have been cloned, underlying the need for genomics-guided investigations capable of providing a prompt and acute knowledge on the identity of effective resistance genes that can be used in breeding programs. Proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) encoded by the major plant disease resistance (R) genes play an important role in the responses of plants to various pathogens. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of NBS-encoding genes within the whole wheat genome was performed, and the genome scale characterization of this gene family was established. From the recently published wheat genome sequence, we used a data mining and automatic prediction pipeline to identify 580 complete ORF candidate NBS-encoding genes and 1,099 partial-ORF ones. Among complete gene models, 464 were longer than 200 aa, among them 436 had less than 70 % of sequence identity to each other. This gene models set was deeply characterized. (1) First, we have analyzed domain architecture and identified, in addition to typical domain combinations, the presence of particular domains like signal peptides, zinc fingers, kinases, heavy-metal-associated and WRKY DNA-binding domains. (2) Functional and expression annotation via homology searches in protein and transcript databases, based on sufficient criteria, enabled identifying similar proteins for 60 % of the studied gene models and expression evidence for 13 % of them. (3) Shared orthologous groups were defined using NBS-domain proteins of rice and Brachypodium distachyon. (4) Finally, alignment of the 436 NBS-containing gene models to the full set of scaffolds from the IWGSC's wheat chromosome survey sequence enabled high-stringence anchoring to chromosome arms. The distribution of the R genes was found balanced on the three wheat sub-genomes. In contrast, at chromosome scale, 50 % of members of this gene family were localized on 6 of the 21 wheat chromosomes and 22 % of them were localized on homeologous group 7. The results of this study provide a detailed analysis of the largest family of plant disease resistance genes in allohexaploid wheat. Some structural traits reported had not been previously identified and the genome-derived data were confronted with those stored in databases outlining the functional specialization of members of this family. The large reservoir of NBS-type genes presented and discussed will, firstly, form an important framework for marker-assisted improvement of resistance in wheat, and, secondly, open up new perspectives for a better understanding of the evolution dynamics of this gene family in grass species and in polyploid systems.

J	Loh, WK; Kim, SP; Hong, SK; Moon, YS				Loh, Woong-Kee; Kim, Sang-Pil; Hong, Sun-Kyong; Moon, Yang-Sae			Envelope-based boundary image matching for smart devices under arbitrary rotations	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Smart devices; Smartphone applications; Boundary image matching; Data mining; Rotation-invariant distance; Similar sequence matching	TIME-SERIES DATABASES; MOVING AVERAGE TRANSFORM; RETRIEVAL; DISTANCE; FEATURES; MOBILE; SHAPE	Recently, a variety of smart devices have been introduced for entertainment or industrial purposes, and there have been a lot of needs for image matching applications exploiting a large number of images stored in those smart devices. Boundary image matching identifies similar boundary images using their corresponding time-series, and supporting the rotation invariance is crucial to provide more intuitive matching results not only in conventional computing devices but also in smart devices such as smartphones, smart pads, and smart cameras. Computing the rotation-invariant distance between image time-series, however, is a very time-consuming process since it requires a lot of Euclidean distance computations for all possible rotations. We here note that, for smart devices, a very efficient mechanism of computing rotation-invariant distances is required. For this purpose, in this paper we use a novel notion of envelope-based lower bound proposed by Keogh et al. (VLDB J 18:611-630, 2009) to reduce the number of distance computations dramatically. With the help of Keogh et al.'s prior work (Keogh in Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 406-417, 2002; Keogh et al. in VLDB J 18:611-630, 2009), we first explain how to construct a single envelope from a query sequence and how to obtain a lower bound of the rotation-invariant distance using the envelope. We then explain that the single envelope lower bound can reduce a number of distance computations. This single envelope approach, however, may cause bad performance since it may incur a larger lower bound due to considering all possible rotated sequences in a single envelope. To solve this problem, we present a concept of rotation interval, and using the concept of multiple envelopes proposed by Keogh et al. (VLDB J 18:611-630, 2009) with these rotation intervals, we then generalize the envelope-based lower bound by exploiting multiple envelopes rather than a single envelope. We also propose equi-width and envelope-minimization divisions as the method of determining rotation intervals in the multi-envelope approach. We further present an advanced multi-step matching algorithm that progressively prunes search spaces by dividing the rotation interval in half. Experimental results show that our envelope-based solutions outperform naive solutions by one to three orders of magnitude. We believe that this performance improvement makes our algorithms very suitable for smart devices.

Approximately 25 % of all people in Europe and the USA experience a mental disorder at least once in their lifetime. Currently, monitoring mental disorders relies on subjective clinical self-reporting rating scales, which were developed more than 50 years ago. In this paper, we discuss how mobile phones can support the treatment of mental disorders by (1) implementing human-computer interfaces to support therapy and (2) collecting relevant data from patients' daily lives to monitor the current state and development of their mental disorders. Concerning the first point, we review various systems that utilize mobile phones for the treatment of mental disorders. We also evaluate how their core design features and dimensions can be applied in other, similar systems. Concerning the second point, we highlight the feasibility of using mobile phones to collect comprehensive data including voice data, motion and location information. Data mining methods are also reviewed and discussed. Based on the presented studies, we summarize advantages and drawbacks of the most promising mobile phone technologies for detecting mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorder. Finally, we discuss practical implementation details, legal issues and business models for the introduction of mobile phones as medical devices.

Its task is to identify sample points markedly deviating from the normal data. A reliable outlier detector needs to build a model which encloses the normal data tightly. In this paper, an improved one-class SVM (OC-SVM) classifier is proposed for outlier detection problems. We name this method OC-SVM with minimum within-class scatter (OC-WCSSVM), which exploits the inner-class structure of the training set via minimizing the within-class scatter of the training data. This can construct a more accurate hyperplane for outlier detection, such that the margin between the training data and the origin in a higher dimensional space is as large as possible, while at the same time the decision boundary around the normal data is as tight as possible. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset and 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed OC-WCSSVM algorithm is effective and superior to the compared algorithms.

One of the most important elements developed to deal with the health of the space avionics is the integrated system health management. Fault diagnostics, a safety-critical process in the integrated system health management, has become more complex as the number of avionics systems within the spacecraft has grown, so failure data are now multidimensional, often incomplete, and have cumulatively acquired uncertainties. Therefore, an accurate fault diagnostics model is needed to handle these types of data and ensure information is adequately adapted and efficiently updated. To date, there has been little research focused on efficient and effective space avionics fault diagnostics. This article presents a novel integrated system health management-oriented intelligent diagnostics methodology based on data mining. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the methodology, which demonstrates the significant benefits of data mining for the efficient processing of massive, incomplete data, and the ability of using a robust diagnostic Bayesian network to identify faults with uncertainty in a dynamic environment. The combined approach shows how some limitations can be overcome with an improved diagnostic performance. For application, sensory information must initially be discretized to Boolean values. Data mining is then used to mine for useful association rules and to learn the dynamic Bayesian network structure. After parameter training, the diagnostics is conducted. This methodology can be applied to systems of varying sizes and is flexible enough to accommodate other efficient diagnostic methods.

This is particularly true for colleges, universities, and other nonprofit organizations-who have seen sharp declines in private contributions, endowment income, and government grants in the past few years, and face fierce competition for donor dollars (Wall Str J p. R1, 2011). In this paper, we present a finite-mixture model framework to segment the alumni population of a university in the Midwestern United States based on the monetary value of annual contributions. A salient feature of the model is that it exploits longitudinal data, i.e., contribution sequences. Another important feature of the model is that it supports the identification of unobserved heterogeneities in the population's giving behavior. Our empirical study presents substantive insights gained through the processing of the full contribution sequences, and establishes the presence of seven distinct segments of alumni in the population. Results provide a basis to support the design of segment-tailored solicitations, and guide the allocation of resources (e.g., telemarketing dollars) to fundraising activities.

In particular, we focus our study on users' communicative interactions, identified by the symbol @. We collected a corpus of about 200,000 Twitter posts, and we annotated it with our personality recognition system. This system exploits linguistic features, such as punctuation and emoticons, and statistical features, such as follower count and retweeted posts. We tested the system on a data set annotated with personality models produced by human subjects and against a software for the analysis of Twitter data. Social network analysis shows that, whereas secure users have more mutual connections, neurotic users post more than secure ones and have the tendency to build longer chains of interacting users. Clustering coefficient analysis reveals that, whereas secure users tend to build stronger networks, neurotic users have difficulty in belonging to a stable community; hence, they seek for new contacts in online social networks.

The research presented in this paper investigates the characteristics of a wide range of driving behaviors linking driving states to the drivers' actions. The proposed methodology is structured such that a known state can be linked to multiple actions, thus accounting for the effects of unknown driving state factors. A two-step algorithm was developed and used for the segmentation and clustering of driving behaviors. The algorithm segments and clusters car-following behaviors based on eight state-action variables: the longitudinal acceleration, the lateral acceleration, the yaw rate, the vehicle speed, the lane offset, the yaw angle, the range, and the range rate. The results of this methodology are state-action clusters that define the driving pattern of drivers. The sample used in this paper included 20 different drivers, i.e., ten car and ten truck drivers. The results revealed that behavior patterns were different between car drivers but not between truck drivers. The results also show that car drivers exhibit behaviors that are unique to each driver, whereas truck drivers show a common driving pattern. The characteristics and frequency of recognized driving patterns are provided in this paper, along with the corresponding modeling parameters of each pattern.

Particularly in the case of disruptions, when traditional route choice models may not be valid, this is an advantage. This paper proposes a method for deducing the chosen route of passengers based on smart card data and validates this method on a real-life data set. The method deduces the correct route for about 95% of the journeys per day in our validation sample, and also in the case of disruptions. Moreover, it is shown how this method can be used to analyze and evaluate passenger service by a case study based on a real-life data set of Netherlands Railways, which is the largest passenger railway operator in the Netherlands.

Chelidonium majus L. (C. majus) is a herbaceous perennial plant of the Papaveraceae family. C. majus is rich of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids: protopine, chelidonine, stylopine, coptisine, berberine, sanguinarine and chelerythrine. Each one of them is endowed with a peculiar pharmacological/toxicological profile. Different C. majus extracts, obtained from different plant parts and under different extraction conditions, contain the above-mentioned alkaloids in different amounts with regard to each other. Consequently they are expected to exert an extremely wide range of therapeutic and/or toxic effects. In this paper, data mining techniques, such as multi-linear regressions and Gaussian processes, were efficiently used to develop a fast and easy approach by which it is possible to predict how different parts of the plant and different extraction conditions lead to C. majus extracts characterized by different chemical composition, in terms of alkaloid contents. In particular, for each alkaloid a model was developed which correlates specific parts of the plant and extraction conditions with the quantity of the desired alkaloid. All models were statistically validated for their goodness of fit and robustness and are characterized by correlation coefficient values (R-2) up to 0.9618 and cross-validated correlation coefficient values (LOO-CV R-2) up to 0.8343. Thus, each model can help in the selection of the proper parts of the plant and extraction conditions to be exploited in order to obtain a particular extract enriched of a particular alkaloid and endowed with desired properties. Another advantage is that the data mining approach presented here could even be applied to other plants, and for other chemical entities. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is crucial for healthcare professionals to understand the nature and proper use of data available in pharmacovigilance practice. Objectives To (a) compare performance of EU-ADR [electronic healthcare record (EHR) exemplar] and FAERS [spontaneous reporting system (SRS) exemplar] databases in detecting signals using "positive" and "negative" drug-event reference sets; and (b) evaluate the impact of timing bias on sensitivity thresholds by comparing all data to data restricted to the time before a warning/regulatory action. Methods Ten events with known positive and negative reference sets were selected. Signals were identified when respective statistics exceeded defined thresholds. Main outcome measure Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy were calculated. In addition, the effect of regulatory action on the performance of signal detection in each data source was evaluated. Results The sensitivity for detecting signals in EHR data varied depending on the nature of the adverse events and increased substantially if the analyses were restricted to the period preceding the first regulatory action. Across all events, using data from all years, a sensitivity of 45-73 % was observed for EU-ADR and 77 % for FAERS. The specificity was high and similar for EU-ADR (82-96 %) and FAERS (98 %). EU-ADR data showed range of PPV (78-91 %) and accuracy (78-72 %) and FAERS data yielded a PPV of 97 % with 88 % accuracy. Conclusion Using all cumulative data, signal detection in SRS data achieved higher specificity and sensitivity than EHR data. However, when data were restricted to time prior to a regulatory action, performance characteristics changed in a manner consistent with both the type of data and nature of the ADR. Further research focusing on prospective validation of is necessary to learn more about the performance and utility of these databases in modern pharmacovigilance practice.

J	Smarr, BL				Smarr, Benjamin Lee			Digital Sleep Logs Reveal Potential Impacts of Modern Temporal Structure on Class Performance in Different Chronotypes	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS			English	Article						sleep logs; students; learning; memory; chronotype; human; sex difference	MORNINGNESS-EVENINGNESS; CIRCADIAN PHASE; TIME; DEPRIVATION; MEMORY; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; HUMANS; SEX	Stability of sleep and circadian rhythms are important for healthy learning and memory. While experimental manipulations of lifestyle and learning outcomes present major obstacles, the ongoing increase in data sources allows retrospective data mining of people's sleep timing variation. Here I use digital sleep-log data generated by 1109 students in a biology lab course at the University of Washington to test the hypothesis that higher variance in time asleep and later sleep-onset times negatively correlate with class performance, used here as a real-world proxy for learning and memory. I find that sleep duration variance and mean sleep-onset times both significantly correlate with class performance. These correlations are powerful on weeknights but undetectable on Friday and Saturday nights (free nights). These correlations also show sex differences, with women showing stronger (both larger and more powerful) negative correlations than men. Finally, although these data come with no demographic information beyond sex, the constructed demographic groups of larks and owls within the sexes reveal a significant decrease in performance of owls relative to larks in male students, whereas the correlation of performance with sleep-onset time for all male students was only a near-significant trend. This provides a proof of concept that deeper demographic mining of digital logs in the future may identify subgroups for which certain sleep phenotypes have greater predictive value for performance outcomes. The data analyzed are consistent with known patterns, including sleep-timing delays from weeknights to free nights and sleep-timing delays in men relative to women. These findings support the hypothesis that modern schedule impositions on sleep and circadian timing have consequences for real-world learning and memory. This study also highlights the low-cost, large-scale benefits of personal, daily, digital records as an augmentation of sleep and circadian studies.

Most often for mitochondrial disease, where no metabolic diagnostic biomarkers exist, a deficiency is diagnosed after analysing the respiratory chain enzymes (complexes I-IV) in affected tissues or by identifying one of an ever expanding number of DNA mutations. This presents a great challenge to identify cases to undergo the invasive diagnostic procedures required. An untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry metabolomics approach was used to search for a metabolic biosignature that can distinguish respiratory chain deficient (RCD) patients from clinical controls (CC). A cohort of 37 ethnically diverse cases was used. Sample preparation, liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry methods and data processing methods were standardised. Furthermore the developed methodology used reverse phase chromatography in conjunction with positive electrospray ionisation and hydrophilic interaction chromatography with negative electrospray ionisation. Urine samples of 37 patients representing two different experimental groups were analysed. The two experimental groups comprised of patients with confirmed RCDs and CC. After a variety of data mining steps and statistical analyses a list of 12 features were compiled with the ability to distinguish between patients with RCDs and CC. Although the features of the biosignature needs to be identified and the biosignature validated, this study demonstrates the value of untargeted metabolomics to identify a metabolic biosignature to possibly be applied in the selection criteria for RCDs.

Cytokine profile determined by data-mining analysis set into clusters of non-small-cell lung cancer patients according to prognosis	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						non-small-cell lung cancer; cytokines; data-mining analysis; prognosis; biomarkers	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; INFLAMMATION; INTERFERON; INTERLEUKIN-6; ASSOCIATION; SURVIVAL; IMMUNITY; MARKERS; RISK	Background: Immunoregulatory cytokines may play a fundamental role in tumor growth and metastases. Their effects are mediated through complex regulatory networks. Human cytokine profiles could define patient subgroups and represent new potential biomarkers. The aim of this study was to associate a cytokine profile obtained through data mining with the clinical characteristics of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods: We conducted a prospective study of the plasma levels of 14 immunoregulatory cytokines by ELISA and a cytometric bead array assay in 110 NSCLC patients before chemotherapy and 25 control subjects. Cytokine levels and data-mining profiles were associated with clinical, quality of life and pathological outcomes. Results: NSCLC patients had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-17a and interferon (IFN)-gamma, and lower levels of IL-33 and IL-29 compared with controls. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with lower hemoglobin levels, worse functional performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG), fatigue and hyporexia. The anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-33 were associated with anorexia and lower body mass index. We identified three clusters of patients according to data-mining analysis with different overall survival (OS; 25.4, 16.8 and 5.09 months, respectively, P = 0.0012). Multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status and data-mining clusters were significantly associated with OS (RR 3.59, [95% CI 1.9-6.7], P < 0.001 and 2.2, [1.2-3.8], P = 0.005). Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that complex cytokine networks may be used to identify patient subgroups with different prognoses in advanced NSCLC. These cytokines may represent potential biomarkers, particularly in the immunotherapy era in cancer research.	[Barrera, L.; Montes-Servin, E.; Salinas-Parra, F.; Banales-Mendez, J.

J	Fan, C; Xiao, F; Yan, CC				Fan, Cheng; Xiao, Fu; Yan, Chengchu			A framework for knowledge discovery in massive building automation data and its application in building diagnostics	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Automation System; Data mining; Building energy performance; Building diagnostics	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; FAULT-DETECTION; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; OPTIMIZATION	Building Automation System (BAS) plays an important role in building operation nowadays. A huge amount of building operational data is stored in BAS; however, the data can seldom be effectively utilized due to the lack of powerful tools for analyzing the large data. Data mining (DM) is a promising technology for discovering knowledge hidden in large data. This paper presents a generic framework for knowledge discovery in massive BAS data using DM techniques. The framework is specifically designed considering the low quality and complexity of BAS data, the diversity of advanced DM techniques, as well as the integration of knowledge discovered by DM techniques and domain knowledge in the building field. The framework mainly consists of four phases, i.e., data exploration, data partitioning, knowledge discovery, and post-mining. The framework is applied to analyze the BAS data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is adopted to identify the most significant time variables to the aggregated power consumption. Then the clustering analysis is used to identify the typical operation patterns in terms of power consumption. Eight operation patterns have been identified and therefore the entire BAS data are partitioned into eight subsets. The quantitative association rule mining (QARM) method is adopted for knowledge discovery in each subset considering most of BAS data are numeric type. To enhance the efficiency of the post-mining phase, two indices are proposed for fast and conveniently identifying and utilizing potentially interesting rules discovered by QARM. The knowledge discovered is successfully used for understanding the building operating behaviors, identifying non-typical operating conditions and detecting faulty conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The challenges become even larger when uncertain data are considered. An important challenge in the classification of uncertain data streams is concept drift and uncertainty of data. This paper studies the problem using extreme learning machine (ELM). We first propose weighted ensemble classifier based on ELM (WEC-ELM) algorithm, which can dynamically adjust classifier and the weight of training uncertain data to solve the problem of concept drift. Furthermore, an uncertainty classifier based on ELM (UC-ELM) algorithm is designed for the classification of uncertain data streams, which not only considers tuple value, but also its uncertainty, improving the efficiency and accuracy. Finally, the performance of our methods is verified through a large number of simulation experiments. The experimental results show that our methods are effective ways to solve the problem of classification of uncertain data streams and are able to solve the problem of concept drift, reduce the execution time and improve the efficiency.

Humans tend to estimate, perceive or visualize clusters cognitively, while digital computers either perform an exact extraction, follow a fuzzy approach, or organize the clusters in a hierarchical tree. In real data sets, the clusters are not only of different densities, but have embedded noise and are nested, thus making their extraction more challenging. In this paper, we propose a density-based technique for extracting connected rectangular clusters that may go undetected by traditional cluster extraction techniques. The proposed technique is inspired by the human cognition approach of appropriately scaling the level of detail, by going from low level of detail, i.e., one-way clustering to high level of detail, i.e., biclustering, in the dimension of interest, as in online analytical processing. A number of experiments were performed using simulated and real data sets and comparison of the proposed technique made with four popular cluster extraction techniques (DBSCAN, CLIQUE, k-medoids and k-means) with promising results.

Logistic regression (LR) models are typically used to estimate these risks. However, in the fields of data mining and machine-learning, many alternative classification and prediction algorithms have been developed. This study aimed to compare the performance of LR to several data mining algorithms for predicting 30-day surgical morbidity in children. Methods: We used the 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric dataset to compare the performance of (1) a LR model that assumed linearity and additivity (simple LR model) (2) a LR model incorporating restricted cubic splines and interactions (flexible LR model) (3) a support vector machine, (4) a random forest and (5) boosted classification trees for predicting surgical morbidity. Results: The ensemble-based methods showed significantly higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV than the simple LR model. However, none of the models performed better than the flexible LR model in terms of the aforementioned measures or in model calibration or discrimination. Conclusion: Support vector machines, random forests, and boosted classification trees do not show better performance than LR for predicting pediatric surgical morbidity. After further validation, the flexible LR model derived in this study could be used to assist with clinical decision-making based on patient-specific surgical risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives are to determine the strongest predictor of hypertriglyceridemia from anthropometric measures and to investigate whether a combination of measures can improve the prediction accuracy compared with individual measures. Methods: A total of 5517 subjects aged 20-90 years participated in this study. The numbers of normal and hypertriglyceridemia subjects were 3022 and 653 females, respectively, and 1306 and 536 males, respectively. We evaluated 33 anthropometric measures for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia using statistical analysis and data mining. Results: In the 20-90-year-old groups, age in women was the variable that exhibited the highest predictive power; however, this was not the case in men in all age groups. Of the anthropometric measures, the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia in women. In men, the rib-to-forehead circumference ratio (RFcR) was the strongest indicator. The use of a combination of measures provides better predictive power compared with individual measures in both women and men. However, in the subgroups of ages 20-50 and 51-90 years, the strongest indicators for hypertriglyceridemia were rib circumference in the 20-50-year-old group and WHtR in the 51-90-year-old group in women and RFcR in the 20-50-year-old group and BMI in the 51-90-year-old group in men. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia may differ according to gender and age. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, JT; Lin, YI; Hou, SY				Wang, Juite; Lin, Yung-I; Hou, Shi-You			A data mining approach for training evaluation in simulation-based training	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Training evaluation; Simulation; Multimedia systems; Data mining	MAINTENANCE; EDUCATION; SELECTION	With the significant evolution of computer technologies, simulation has become a more realistic and effective experiential learning tool to assist in organizational training. Although simulation-based training can improve the effectiveness of training for company employees, there are still many management challenges that need to be overcome. This paper develops a hybrid framework that integrates data mining techniques with the simulation-based training to improve the effectiveness of training evaluation. The concept of confidence-based learning is applied to assess trainees' learning outcomes from the two dimensions of knowledge/skill level and confidence level. Data mining techniques are used to analyze trainees' profiles and data generated from simulation-based training for evaluating trainees' performance and their learning behaviors. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example of a real case of simulation-based infantry marksmanship training in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed methodology can accurately evaluate trainees' performance and their learning behaviors and can discover latent knowledge for improving trainees' learning outcomes.

A limitation with the SPIF process is that the application of the process results in geometric deviations, which means that the resulting shape is not necessarily the desired shape. Errors are introduced in a nonlinear manner for a variety of reasons, but a contributor is the geometry of the desired shape. A local geometry matrix (LGM) representation is used that allows the capture of local geometries in such a way that they are suited to input to a classifier generator. It is demonstrated that a rule-based classifier can be used to train the classifier and generate a classification model. The resulting model can then be used to predict errors with respect to new shapes so that some correction strategy can be applied. The reported evaluation of the proposed IPM indicates that very promising results can be obtained with regard to reducing the shape deviations due to springback.

Recent experimental techniques revealed that the majority of mammalian genomes and other complex organisms are in fact transcribed into non-coding RNAs. Typically, non-coding RNAs are small nucleotide sequences that are not transcribed into proteins and have a profound regulatory role. Present advances in computational biosciences linked their abnormal functionality to many diseases and re-stated the principles of basic therapeutic strategies. The effective identification of non-coding RNAs and their biological role emerges as a new and challenging bioinformatics problem. ncRNAclass ( http://biotools.ceid.upatras.gr/ncrnaclass/) is a web platform that allows for efficient computation of a set of features that can describe effectively the broad class of non-coding RNAs. Moreover, it enables the calculation of features that include information about the targeting behavior of miRNAs. The tool operates under a user-friendly interface and its pilot implementation incorporates prediction models for the well-known class of microRNAs and for prediction their mRNA targets. The prediction models are based on two novel evolutionary Machine Learning algorithms that achieve very high classification performance in comparison with existing methods. The platform is also equipped with a data warehouse, with manually curated sequences, that enables fast information retrieval and data mining utilities.

J	Yun, U; Pyun, G; Yoon, E				Yun, Unil; Pyun, Gwangbum; Yoon, Eunchul			Efficient Mining of Robust Closed Weighted Sequential Patterns Without Information Loss	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Closed weighted sequential pattern mining; information loss; sequential pattern	FREQUENT PATTERNS; DATA STREAMS; CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHM; DATABASES	Sequential pattern mining has become one of the most important topics in data mining. It has broad applications such as analyzing customer purchase data, Web access patterns, network traffic data, DNA sequencing, and so on. Previous studies have concentrated on reducing redundant patterns among the sequential patterns, and on finding meaningful patterns from huge datasets. In sequential pattern mining, closed sequential pattern mining and weighted sequential pattern mining are the two main approaches to perform mining tasks. This is because closed sequential pattern mining finds representative sequential patterns which show exactly the same knowledge as the complete set of frequent sequential patterns, and weight-based sequential pattern mining discovers important sequential patterns by considering the importance of each sequential pattern. In this paper, we study the problem of mining robust closed weighted sequential patterns by integrating two paradigms from large sequence databases. We first show that the joining order between the weight constraints and the closure property in sequential pattern mining leads to different sets of results. From our analysis of joining orders, we suggest robust closed weighted sequential pattern mining without information loss, and present how to discover representative important sequential patterns without information loss. Through performance tests, we show that our approach gives high performance in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, memory usage, and scalability.

However, the development of robust pipelines to relate genotypic functional modules to disease phenotypes through known molecular interactions is still at its early stages. In this article we first discuss methodologies that employ groups of genes in disease classification tasks that aim to link gene expression patterns with disease outcome. Then we present a pathway-based approach for disease classification through a mathematical programming model based on hyper-box principles. Association rules derived from the model are extracted and discussed with respect to pathway-specific molecular patterns related to the disease. Overall, we argue that the use of gene sets corresponding to disease-relevant pathways is a promising route to uncover expression-to-phenotype relations in disease classification and we illustrate the potential of hyper-box classification in assessing the predictive power of functional pathways and uncover the effect of specific genes in the prediction of disease phenotypes.

J	Peters, G				Peters, Georg			Is there any need for rough clustering?	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Rough clustering; Soft clustering; k-means	K-MEANS; FUZZY-SETS; CLASSIFICATION	Clustering plays an important role in data mining. Some of the most famous clustering methods belong to the family of k-means algorithms. A decade ago, Lingras and West enriched the field of soft clustering by introducing rough k-means. Although rough clustering has been a very active field of research a pointed evaluation if it is really needed is still missing. Thus, the objective of the paper is to compare rough k-means and k-means. In k-means the number of correctly clustered objects is to be maximized which corresponds to minimizing the number of incorrectly clustered objects. In contrast to k-means, in rough clustering the numbers of correctly and incorrectly clustered objects are not complements anymore. Hence, in rough clustering the number of incorrectly clustered objects can be explicitly minimized. This is of striking relevance for many real life applications where minimizing the number of incorrectly clustered objects is more important than maximizing the number of correctly clustered objects. Therefore, we argue that rough k-means is often a strong alternative to k-means. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to generate a compendium about the genomic intervals putatively involved in the control of the several fruit quality components, a Meta-quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed starting from a QTL mapping survey individually conducted on four full-sib populations. These progenies were simultaneously genotyped with 1289 SNP markers, of which 52 % were in common for at least two maps. The combination of the genotypic and phenotypic datasets allowed the identification of 56 QTLs, which were subsequently projected into a consensus map, reducing the total number of genomic intervals to 27 MetaQTLs. The majority of these regions, associated to fruit quality traits such as fruit skin color and flesh firmness, resulted also consistent with previous reports presented to date to the scientific community. This MetaQTL overview would represents a valuable source for genome anchoring and data mining investigation, suitable for a further in silico identification of relevant causal genes. As example is reported the case of Md-PG1, a gene known to control fruit firmness in apple and retrieved within the confidence interval of a MetaQTL associated to fruit firmness.

This study uses multitemporal PALSAR L-band radar imagery combined with object-based image analysis, data mining techniques and field data to derive vegetation structure and inundation patterns and characterize major vegetation types in varzea forests of the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve. Our results show that the combination of vegetation cover and inundation extent information can be a good indicator of the complex gradient of habitats along the floodplain. The intersection between vegetation and flood duration classes showed a wider range of combinations than suggested from field based studies. Chavascal areas-chacaracterized as a dense and species-poor shrub/tree community developing in old depressions, abandoned channels, and shallow lakes-had shorter inundation periods than the usually recognized hydroperiod of 180-240 days of flooding, while low varzea-a diverse community that have fewest and smallest species, and highest individual density and that tolerate 120-180 days of flooding every year-was distributed between flood duration ranges that were higher than reported by the literature. Forest communities growing at sites that were never mapped as flooded could indicate areas that only flood during extreme hydrological events, for short periods of time. Our results emphasize the potential contribution of SAR remote sensing to the monitoring and management of wetland environments, providing not only accurate information on spatial landscape configuration and vegetation distribution, but also important insights on the ecohydrological processes that ultimately determine the distribution of complex floodplain habitat mosaics.
