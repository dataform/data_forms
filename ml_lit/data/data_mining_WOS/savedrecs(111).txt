We call this algorithm Parallel Ant-Miner2. This model relies on the extension of real behavior of ants and data mining concepts. The artificial ants are firstly generated and separated into several groups. Each group is assigned a class label which is the consequent parts of the rules it should discover. Ants try to discover rules in parallel and then communicate with each other to update the pheromones in different paths. The communication methods help ants not to gather irrelevant terms of the rule. The parallel executions of ants reduce the speed of convergence and consequently make it possible to extract more new high quality rules by exploring all search space. Our experimental results show that the proposed model is more accurate than the other versions of Ant-Miner.

Many semi-structured data like the NCI dataset having about 250,000 chemical compounds can be expressed by outerplanar graphs. In this paper, we consider a data mining problem of extracting structural features from semi-structured data. First of all, we define a block preserving outerplanar graph pattern as an outerplanar graph having structured variables. Then, we present an effective Apriori-like algorithm for enumerating frequent block preserving outerplanar graph patterns from semi-structured data in incremental polynomial time. Lastly, by reporting some preliminary experimental results on a subset of the NCI dataset, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms.

This paper proposes an improved algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets. Firstly, the index array is proposed, which is used for discovering those items that always appear together. Then, by using bitmap, an algorithm for computing index array is presented. Thirdly, based on the heuristic information provided by index array, frequent items, which co-occur together and share the same support, are merged together. Thus, initial generators are calculated. Finally, based on index array, reduced pre-set and reduced post-set are proposed. It is proved that the reduced pre-set and reduced post-set not only retain the function of pre-set and post-set, but also have smaller sizes. Therefore, the redundant items in pre-set and post-set are deleted, thus making it possible to save a lot of work related to inclusion check. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient especially on dense dataset.

However, conventional probabilistic graphical models with probabilistic inference only model data in vector format, although they are very important in many statistical problems, e.g., model selection. Is it possible to construct multilinear probabilistic graphical models for tensor format data to conduct probabilistic inference, e.g., model selection? This paper provides a positive answer based on the proposed decoupled probabilistic model by developing the probabilistic tensor analysis (PTA), which selects suitable model for tensor format data modeling based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Empirical studies demonstrate that PTA associated with AIC and BIC selects correct number of models.

The question "How are we going to do data mining without violating the privacy of individuals?" is still on the table, and research is being conducted to find efficient methods to do that. Data transformation was previously proposed as one efficient method for privacy preserving data mining when a party needs to out-source the data mining task, or when distributed data mining needs to be performed among multiple parties without each party disclosing its actual data. In this paper we study the safety of distance preserving data transformations proposed for privacy preserving data mining. We show that an adversary can recover the original data, values with very high confidence via knowledge of mutual distances between data objects together with the probability distribution from which they are drawn. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	[Turgay, E.

Validation studies, where the retrievals are compared to the available ground-truth data, are periodically performed with the goal of understanding how to further improve the quality of the retrieval algorithms. This letter describes a data-mining approach aimed to facilitate this highly labor-intensive process. It is based on training a neural network for retrieval and comparing its performance with that of the operational algorithm. The situations, where a neural network is more accurate, point to the weaknesses of the operational algorithm that could be corrected. Use of decision trees is proposed to provide easily interpretable descriptions of such situations. The approach was applied on 3646 collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and AERONET observations over the continental U.S. related to the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness. The experiments showed that the approach is feasible and that it can be a valuable tool for the domain scientists working on the development of retrieval algorithms.

Fuzzy Q-Learning with an Adaptive Representation	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning how to map states to actions so as to maximise a numeric reward signal. Fuzzy Q-Learning (FQL) extends the RL technique Q-Learning to large or continuous problems and has been applied to a wide range of applications from data mining to robot control. Typically, FQL uses a uniform or pre-defined internal representation provided by the human designer. A uniform representation usually provides poor generalisation for control applications, and a pre-defined representation requires the designer to have an in-depth knowledge of the desired control policy. In this paper, the approach taken is to reduce the reliance on a human designer by adapting the internal representation, to improve the generalisation over the control policy, during the learning process. A Hierarchical Fuzzy Rule Based System (HFRBS) is used to improve the generalisation of the control policy through iterative refinement of an initial coarse representation on a classical RL problem called the Mountain Car problem.

Existing tools for motif discovery demonstrate some weaknesses in dealing with reliability and scalability, Therefore, development of advanced algorithms for resolving this problem will be useful. This paper aims to develop data mining techniques for discovering motifs. A mismatch based hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper where three heuristic rules for classifying clusters and a post-processing for ranking and refining the clusters are employed in the algorithm. Our algorithm is evaluated using two sets of DNA sequences with comparisons. Results demonstrate that the proposed techniques in this paper outperform MEME, AlignACE and SOMBRERO for most of the testing datasets.

Our idea is to rely on the attention time of individual users captured through commodity eye-tracking as the essential clue. The prediction of user interest over a certain online item (a document, image or video) is based on the user's attention time acquired using vision-based commodity eye-tracking during his previous reading, browsing or video watching sessions over the same type of online materials. After acquiring a user's attention times over a collection of online materials, our algorithm can predict the user's probable attention time over a new online item through data mining. Based on our proposed algorithm, we have developed a new online content recommender system for documents, images and videos. The recommendation results produced by our algorithm are evaluated by comparing with those manually labeled by users as well as by commercial search engines including Google (Web) Search, Google Image Search and YouTube.

Frequent patterns are essential for generating association rules, time series analysis, classification, etc. There are two categories of algorithms for data mining, the generate-and-test approach (Apriori-like) and the pattern growth approach (FP-tree). Recently, many methods have been proposed for solving this problem based on an FP-tree as a replacement for Apriori-like algorithms, because these need to scan the database many times. However, even for the pattern growth method, the execution time takes long when the database is large or the given support is low. Parallel-distributed computing is good strategy for solving this problem. Some parallel algorithms have been proposed, however, the execution time increases rapidly when the database increases or when the given minimum threshold is small. In this study, an efficient parallel-distributed mining algorithm based on an FP-tree structure - the Tidset-based Parallel FP-tree (TPFP-tree) - is proposed. In order to exchange transactions efficiently, transaction identification set (Tidset) was used to directly choose transactions without scanning databases. The algorithm was verified on a Linux cluster with 16 computing nodes. It was also compared with a PFP-tree algorithm. The dataset generated by IBM's Quest Synthetic Data Generator to verify the performance of algorithms was used. The experimental results showed that this algorithm can reduce the execution time when the database grows. Moreover, it was also observed that this algorithm had better scalability than the PFP-tree.

J	Kuramochi, M; Karypis, G				Kuramochi, Michihiro; Karypis, George			Discovering frequent geometric subgraphs	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						graph mining; pattern discovery; geometric subgraphs	ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION; GRAPHS	Data mining-based analysis methods are increasingly being applied to data sets derived from science and engineering domains that model various physical phenomena and objects. In many of these data sets, a key requirement for their effective analysis is the ability to capture the relational and geometric characteristics of the underlying entities and objects. Geometric graphs, by modeling the various physical entities and their relationships with vertices and edges, provide a natural method to represent such data sets. In this paper we present gFSG, a computationally efficient algorithm for finding frequent patterns corresponding to geometric subgraphs in a large collection of geometric graphs. gFSG is able to discover geometric subgraphs that can be rotation, scaling, and translation invariant, and it can accommodate inherent errors on the coordinates of the vertices. We evaluated its performance using a large database of over 20,000 chemical structures, and our results show that it requires relatively little time, can accommodate low support values, and scales linearly with the number of transactions.

This can be done by studying the changes in TCP packet round-trip time. in this paper, we propose a new algorithm by using data mining method to find the round-trip time from the time-stamps of TCP send and echo packets. Previous algorithms produce either good packet matches on very few packets, or poor matches on many packets. This method gives us better round-trip time and more matched packets than other algorithms proposed in the past. it can estimate the length of a connection more accurate than other methods and has largely decreased false positive error and false negative error in detecting stepping-stone intrusion comparing with existing methods.

A behavior is a pattern in the sequence of activities. An array of sensors captures the status of appliances. Models for the occupant's activities are built from the captured data using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The models of behavior are built using the hidden Markov model (HMM) technique. Predictive models can be used in a number of ways: to enhance user experience, to maximize resource usage efficiency, for safety and security. This work focuses on supporting independent living and enhancing quality of life of older persons. The ultimate goal is for the system to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. In this paper, we present the results of comparing supervised and unsupervised classification techniques applied to the problem of modeling activity for the purpose of modeling behavior in a home.

However, they are not necessarily intuitive to humans. Conventional scientific visualization methods are intuitive, but limited by depth, dimension, and resolution. The purpose of this study is to bridge the gap with transformation algorithms for mapping the data from an abstract space to an intuitive one, which include shape correlation, periodicity, multiphysics, and spatial Bayesian. We tested this approach with the oceanographic case study. We found that the interactive visualization increases robustness in object tracking and positive detection accuracy in object prediction. We also found that the interactive method enables the user to process the image data at less than 1 min per image versus 30 min per image manually. As a result, our test system can handle at least 10 times more data sets than traditional manual analyses. The results also suggest that minimal human interactions with appropriate computational transformations or cues may significantly increase the overall productivity.

The discovery of such information is enabled by the combined use of novel bioinformatics tools and data mining techniques requiring the integration of huge data sources and the composition of different software tools. The main phases of such emerging applications comprise the loading, management, preprocessing, mining, and visualization of spectra, as well as the analysis of discovered knowledge models. The collection, storage, and analysis of spectra produced in different laboratories can make use of the services of computational Grids, which offer efficient data transfer primitives, effective management of large data stores, and large computing power. In this paper we present MS-Analyzer, a Grid-based software platform for the integrated management and analysis of spectra data. MS-Analyzer provides efficient spectra management through a specialized spectra database, and supports the semantic composition of spectra preprocessing services and data mining services to analyze spectra on the Grid.

The discrepancies in nomenclature, various schemas and incompatible formats of biological databases, however, result in a significant lack of interoperability among databases. Therefore, data preparation is a key prerequisite for biological database mining. Integrating diverse biological molecular databases is an essential action to cope with the heterogeneity of biological databases and guarantee efficient data mining. However, the inconsistency in biological databases is a key issue for data integration. This paper proposes a framework to detect the inconsistency in biological databases using ontologies. A numeric estimate is provided to measure the inconsistency and identify those biological databases that are appropriate for further mining applications. This aids in enhancing the quality of databases and guaranteeing accurate and efficient mining of biological databases.

J	Barnes, CF				Barnes, Christopher F.			Image-driven data mining for image content segmentation, classification, and attribution	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						direct sum successive approximation; image-driven data mining (IDDM); image information mining; residual vector quantization; similarity searching	VECTOR QUANTIZATION	Image-driven data mining methods are described for image content segmentation, classification, and attribution, where each pixel location of an image-under-analysis is the center point of a pixel-block query that returns an estimated class label. Feature attribute estimates may also be mined when sufficient attribute strata exist in the data warehouse. Novel methods are presented for pixel-block mining, pattern similarity scoring, class label assignments, and attribute mining. These methods are based on a direct sum tree structure called a sigma-tree that is utilized with near-neighbor similarity scoring. The sigma-tree structure provides a solution to the challenge of high computation/memory costs of pixel-block similarity searching. The or-trees are integrated into warehouse subsystems that provide referential capability into feature attribute data, resulting in a foundation for data mining called Source Optimized, Labeled, DIgital Expanded Representations (SOLDIER). The variable depth "bit-plane" data representations produced by or-tree path selections provide an approach to image content segmentation, and provide a structure for formulation of Bayesian classification with data-adaptive Parzen classifiers with variably sized windows. Preliminary methods and results for postprocessing of mined feature-thematic layers for higher level scene understanding are also presented. Sample results are shown with synthetic aperture radar images and with high-resolution pan-sharpened satellite images of the Payagala, Sri Lanka area before the site was devastated by the 2004 Asian Tsunami.

[3, 19, 20] There are several problems associated with this theory. On the practical side, among other problems, the strict requirement of triangle inequality is unrealistic in some applications; on the theoretical side, the universality theorems for normalized information distances were only proved in a weak form. In this paper, we will introduce a complementary theory that resolves or avoids these problems. This article also serves as a brief expository summary for this area.

J	Verykios, VS; Pontikakis, ED; Theodoridis, Y; Chang, L				Verykios, Vassilios S.; Pontikakis, Emmanuel D.; Theodoridis, Yannis; Chang, Liwu			Efficient algorithms for distortion and blocking techniques in association rule hiding	DISTRIBUTED AND PARALLEL DATABASES			English	Article						data mining; privacy; association rules		Data mining provides the opportunity to extract useful information from large databases. Various techniques have been proposed in this context in order to extract this information in the most efficient way. However, efficiency is not our only concern in this study. The security and privacy issues over the extracted knowledge must be seriously considered as well. By taking this into consideration, we study the procedure of hiding sensitive association rules in binary data sets by blocking some data values and we present an algorithm for solving this problem. We also provide a fuzzification of the support and the confidence of an association rule in order to accommodate for the existence of blocked/unknown values. In addition, we quantitatively compare the proposed algorithm with other already published algorithms by running experiments on binary data sets, and we also qualitatively compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in hiding association rules. We utilize the notion of border rules, by putting weights in each rule, and we use effective data structures for the representation of the rules so as (a) to minimize the side effects created by the hiding process and (b) to speed up the selection of the victim transactions. Finally, we study the overall security of the modified database, using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm of the WEKA data mining tool, and we discuss the advantages and the limitations of blocking.

For example, through data mining, sensible information such as private information or patterns may be inferred from non-sensible information or unclassified data. There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. Output privacy tries to hide the mining results by minimally altering the data. Input privacy tries to manipulate the data so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected. For output privacy in hiding association rules, current approaches require hidden rules or patterns to be given in advance [10, 18-21, 24, 27]. This selection of rules would require data mining process to be executed first. Based on the discovered rules and privacy requirements, hidden rules or patterns are then selected manually. However, for some applications, we are interested in hiding certain constrained classes of association rules such as collaborative recommendation association rules [15, 22]. To hide such rules, the pre-process of finding these hidden rules can be integrated into the hiding process as long as the recommended items are given. In this work, we propose two algorithms, DCIS (Decrease Confidence by Increase Support) and DCDS (Decrease Confidence by Decrease Support), to automatically hiding collaborative recommendation association rules without pre-mining and selection of hidden rules. Examples illustrating the proposed algorithms are given. Numerical simulations are performed to show the various effects of the algorithms. Recommendations of appropriate usage of the proposed algorithms based on the characteristics of databases are reported.

G., Provenza, L. P., Saygin, Y., & Theodoridis, Y. (2004). State-of-the-art in privacy preserving data mining. SIGMOD Record 33(1), 50-57, March 2004]. For example, through data mining, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information or even patterns, from non-sensitive information or unclassified data. There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining. The first type of privacy, called output privacy, is that the data is minimally altered so that the mining result will not disclose certain privacy. The second type of privacy, called input privacy, is that the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected. In output privacy of hiding association rules, current approaches require hidden rules or patterns been given in advance [Dasseni, E., Verykios, V., Elmagarmid, A., & Bertino, E. (2001). Hiding association rules by using confidence and support. In Proceedings of 4th information hiding workshop, Pittsburgh, PA (pp. 369-383); Oliveira, S., & Zaiane, O. (2002).

IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 16(4), 434-447]. This selection of rules would require data mining process to be executed first. Based on the discovered rules and privacy requirements, hidden rules or patterns are then selected manually. However, for some applications, we are interested in hiding certain constrained classes of association rules such as informative association rule sets [Li J., Shen H., & Topor R. (2001). Mining the smallest association rule set for predictions. In Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE international conference on data mining (pp. 361-368)]. To hide such rule sets, the pre-process of finding these hidden rules can be integrated into the hiding process as long as the predicting items are given. In this work, we propose two algorithms, ISL (Increase Support of LHS) and DSR (Decrease Support of RHS), to automatically hiding informative association rule sets without pre-mining and selection of hidden rules. Examples illustrating the proposed algorithms are given. Numerical experiments are performed to show the various effects of the algorithms. Recommendations of appropriate usage of the proposed algorithms based on the characteristics of databases are reported. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In fact, integration and comprehensive evaluation of available controlled data can highlight information patterns leading to unveil new biomedical knowledge. Here, we describe Genome Function INtegrated Discover (GFINDer), a Web-accessible three-tier multidatabase system we developed to automatically enrich lists of user-classified genes with several functional and phenotypic controlled annotations, and to statistically evaluate them in order to identify annotation categories significantly over- or underrepresented in each considered gene class. Genomic controlled annotations from Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, Pfam, InterPro, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) were integrated in GFINDer and several categorical tests were implemented for their analysis. A controlled vocabulary of inherited disorder phenotypes was obtained by normalizing and hierarchically structuring disease accompanying signs and symptoms from OMIM Clinical Synopsis sections. GFINDer modular architecture is well suited for further system expansion and for sustaining increasing workload. Testing results showed that GFINDer analyses can highlight gene functional and phenotypic characteristics and differences, demonstrating its value in supporting genomic biomedical approaches aiming at understanding the complex biomolecular mechanisms underlying patho-physiological phenotypes, and in helping the transfer of genomic results to medical practice.

J	Nanopoulos, A; Papadopoulos, AN; Manolopoulos, Y				Nanopoulos, Alexandros; Papadopoulos, Apostolos N.; Manolopoulos, Yannis			Mining association rules in very large clustered domains	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						association rules; clustering; item domain grouping; data mining	ALGORITHM; TREE; GENERATION; DATABASES; MEMORY	Emerging applications introduce the requirement for novel association-rule mining algorithms that will be scalable not only with respect to the number of records (number of rows) but also with respect to the domain's size (number of columns). In this paper, we focus on the cases where the items of a large domain correlate with each other in a way that small worlds are formed, that is, the domain is clustered into groups with a large number of intra-group and a small number of inter-group correlations. This property appears in several real-world cases, e.g., in bioinformatics, e-commerce applications, and bibliographic analysis, and can help to significantly prune the search space so as to perform efficient association-rule mining. We develop an algorithm that partitions the domain of items according to their correlations and we describe a mining algorithm that carefully combines partitions to improve the efficiency. Our experiments show the superiority of the proposed method against existing algorithms, and that it overcomes the problems (e.g., increase in CPU cost and possible I/O thrashing) caused by existing algorithms due to the combination of a large domain and a large number of records.

J	Huang, G; Li, X; He, J; Li, X				Huang, Guangyan; Li, Xiaowei; He, Jing; Li, Xin			Data mining via minimal spanning tree clustering for prolonging lifetime of wireless sensor networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						clustering; data mining; wireless sensor networks; energy efficiency; minimal spanning tree		Clustering is applied in wireless sensor networks for increasing energy efficiency. Clustering methods in wireless sensor networks are different from those in traditional data mining systems. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm based on Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) and Maximum Energy resource on sensors named MSTME. Also, specified constrains of clustering in wireless sensor networks and several evaluation metrics are given. MSTME performs better than already known clustering methods of Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Base Station Controlled Dynamic Clustering Protocol (BCDCP) in wireless sensor networks when they are evaluated by these evaluation metrics. Simulation results show MSTME increases energy efficiency and network lifetime compared with LEACH and BCDCP in two-hop and multi-hop networks, respectively.

J	Xu, Y; Li, Y				Xu, Yue; Li, Yuefeng			Mining non-redundant association rules based on concise bases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						association rules; redundant rules; frequent itemsets; closed itemsets; generators; centainty factors		Association rule mining has many achievements in the area of knowledge discovery. However, the quality of the extracted association rules has not drawn adequate attention from researchers in data mining community. One big concern with the quality of association rule mining is the size of the extracted rule set. As a matter of fact, very often tens of thousands of association rules are extracted among which many are redundant, thus useless. In this paper, we first analyze the redundancy problem in association rules and then propose a reliable exact association rule basis from which more concise nonredundant rules can be extracted. We prove that the redundancy eliminated using the proposed reliable association rule basis does not reduce the belief to the extracted rules. Moreover, this paper proposes a level wise approach for efficiently extracting closed itemsets and minimal generators - a key issue in closure based association rule mining.

Extending the participatory learning paradigm to include source credibility	FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						learning; critic; data mining; agent modeling; types of observations; terrorist modeling		We provide an overview of the participatory learning paradigm (PLP) and discuss the importance of the acceptance function in determining which observations are used for learning. We introduce a formal model that uses this (PLP) We then extend this model in two directions. First, we consider situations in which we have incomplete observations, we only have observations about a subset of the variables of interest. Next we extend this model to allow for the inclusion in the learning process of information about the learning agents belief about the credibility of the source of the learning experience. Here we distinguish between the content of a learning experience and the source of the experience. We provide a means to allow the learning agents belief about the credibility of the source to determine the effect of the content. Furthermore we suggest a method to allow the modification of agents belief about the credibility of the source to also be part of the learning process.

The exploration of three-dimensional (3-D) anthropometry scanning data along with other existing subject medical profiles using data mining techniques becomes an important research issue for medical decision support. This research attempts to construct a prediction model for hypertension using anthropometric body surface scanning data. This research adopts classification trees to reveal the relationship between a subject's 3-D scanning data and hypertension disease using the hybrid of the association rule algorithm (ARA) and genetic algorithms (GAs) approach. The ARA is adopted to obtain useful clues based on which the GA is able to proceed its searching tasks in a more efficient way. The proposed approach was experimented and compared with a regular genetic algorithm in predicting a subject's hypertension disease. Better computational efficiency and more accurate prediction results from the proposed approach are demonstrated.

Data mining on a transformer partial discharge data using the self-organizing map	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article						partial discharges; data mining; feature extraction; principal component analysis; self-organizing map		Although experts all over the world have investigated methods for partial discharge (PD) detection and classification for over 50 years, until now there is still no universal method available for this purpose. Even in the future, it would not be possible to define a universal method for unambiguous classification and localization of PD sources in complex insulating systems (e.g. transformers or generators) due to the unlimited variations of PD source type and its location. This paper deals with PD signals obtained by remote radiometric measurements performed on a power transformer. Extensive PD measurements were performed in the substation. Since fingerprints of the remote radiometric measurements are not available, the formation of clusters with similar features obtained from captured PD data is crucial. A data mining technique known as Self-organizing Map (SOM) for the analysis and interpretation of captured PD data is used. Since each signal contains a large number of samples, before applying the SOM, the dimensionality reduction based on principal component analysis is performed. As a result of a data mining process a clear separation of PDs emanating from a transformer and discharges emanating from its surrounding is achieved.

Many decision support systems need to support online interactive frequent itemset mining, which is a challenging task because frequent itemset mining is a computation intensive repetitive process. One solution is to precompute frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose a compact disk-based data structure - CFP-tree to store precomputed frequent itemsets on a disk to support online mining requests. The CFP-tree structure effectively utilizes the redundancy in frequent itemsets to save space. The compressing ratio of a CFP-tree can be as high as several thousands or even higher. Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets from a CFP-tree, as well as efficient algorithms to construct and maintain a CFP-tree, are developed. Our performance study demonstrates that with a CFP-tree, frequent itemset mining requests can be responded to promptly. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For example, the audit trails of a workflow management system or the transaction logs of an enterprise resource planning system can be used to discover models describing processes, organizations, and products. Traditionally, process mining has been applied to structured processes. In this paper, we argue that process mining can also be applied to less structured processes supported by computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. In addition, the ProM framework is described. Using ProM a wide variety of process mining activities are supported ranging from process discovery and verification to conformance checking and social network analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient query filtering for streaming time series with applications to semisupervised learning of time series classifiers	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						time series; data mining; streams; monitoring; semisupervised learning		In this paper, we define time series query filtering, the problem of monitoring the streaming time series for a set of predefined patterns. This problem is of great practical importance given the massive volume of streaming time series available through sensors, medical patient records, financial indices and space telemetry. Since the data may arrive at a high rate and the number of predefined patterns can be relatively large, it may be impossible for the comparison algorithm to keep up. We propose a novel technique that exploits the commonality among the predefined patterns to allow monitoring at higher bandwidths, while maintaining a guarantee of no false dismissals. Our approach is based on the widely used envelope-based lower-bounding technique. As we will demonstrate on extensive experiments in diverse domains, our approach achieves tremendous improvements in performance in the offline case, and significant improvements in the fastest possible arrival rate of the data stream that can be processed with guaranteed no false dismissals. As a further demonstration of the utility of our approach, we demonstrate that it can make semisupervised learning of time series classifiers tractable.

J	Berti-Equille, L				Berti-Equille, Laure			Data quality awareness: a case study for cost optimal association rule mining	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						quality awareness mining; data quality management; data quality metadata; cost model; association rule mining		The quality of discovered association rules is commonly evaluated by interestingness measures (commonly support and confidence) with the purpose of supplying indicators to the user in the understanding and use of the new discovered knowledge. Low-quality datasets have a very bad impact over the quality of the discovered association rules, and one might legitimately wonder if a so-called "interesting" rule noted LHS -> RHS is meaningful when 30% of the LHS data are not up-to-date anymore, 20% of the RHS data are not accurate, and 15% of the LHS data come from a data source that is well-known for its bad credibility. This paper presents an overview of data quality characterization and management techniques that can be advantageously employed for improving the quality awareness of the knowledge discovery and data mining processes. We propose to integrate data quality indicators for quality aware association rule mining. We propose a cost-based probabilistic model for selecting legitimately interesting rules. Experiments on the challenging KDD-Cup-98 datasets show that variations on data quality have a great impact on the cost and quality of discovered association rules and confirm our approach for the integrated management of data quality indicators into the KDD process that ensure the quality of data mining results.

J	Agarwal, D				Agarwal, Deepak			Detecting anomalies in cross-classified streams: a Bayesian approach	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						multidimensional; multiple testing; hierarchical Bayesian; active learning	MULTIPLE COMPARISONS	We consider the problem of detecting anomalies in data that arise as multidimensional arrays with each dimension corresponding to the levels of a categorical variable. In typical data mining applications, the number of cells in such arrays are usually large. Our primary focus is detecting anomalies by comparing information at the current time to historical data. Naive approaches advocated in the process control literature do not work well in this scenario due to the multiple testing problem-performing multiple statistical tests on the same data produce excessive number of false positives. We use an empirical Bayes method which works by fitting a two-component Gaussian mixture to deviations at current time. The approach is scalable to problems that involve monitoring massive number of cells and fast enough to be potentially useful in many streaming scenarios. We show the superiority of the method relative to a naive "per component error rate" procedure through simulation. A novel feature of our technique is the ability to suppress deviations that are merely the consequence of sharp changes in the marginal distributions. This research was motivated by the need to extract critical application information and business intelligence from the daily logs that accompany large-scale spoken dialog systems. We illustrate our method on one such system.

Significant development of the Internet and easier access to it have contributed to collecting large amounts of information about users' characteristics. Along with these changes, concerns about privacy of data have emerged. Several methods of preserving privacy for association rules mining have been proposed in literature: MASK scheme and its optimizations. This paper provides new solutions concerning efficiency for this scheme and considers different methods of distorting data using randomization techniques. Effectiveness of these solutions has been tested and presented in this paper.

It aims at detecting patterns which contrast two classes and has been extensively investigated for attribute-value representations. In this work we propose a method, named Mr-EP, which discovers EPs from data scattered in multiple tables of a relational database. Generated EPs can capture the differences between objects of two classes which involve properties possibly spanned in separate data tables. We implemented Mr-EP in a pre-existing multi-relational data mining system which is tightly integrated with a relational DBMS, and then we tested it on two sets of geo-referenced data.

Some applications use batch models, which perform clustering on the document collection in aggregate. In this paper, we analyze and compare the performance of three recently-proposed batch topic models Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) mixtures and von-Mises Fisher (vMF) mixture models. In cases where offline clustering on complete document collections is infeasible due to resource and response-rate constraints, online unsupervised clustering methods that process incoming data incrementally are necessary. To this end, we propose online variants of vMF, EDCM and LDA. Experiments on large real-world document collections, in both the offline and online settings, demonstrate that though LDA is a good model for finding word-level topics, vMF finds better document-level topic clusters more efficiently, which is often important in text mining applications. Finally, we propose a practical heuristic for hybrid topic modeling, which learns online topic models on streaming text and intermittently runs batch topic models on aggregated documents offline. Such a hybrid model is useful for several applications (e.g., dynamic topic-based aggregation of user-generated content in social networks) that need a good tradeoff between the performance of batch offline algorithms and efficiency of incremental online algorithms.

This paper proposes a learning strategy that deals with building a multi-target classifier and takes advantage from well known data mining techniques. To address the intrinsic difficulty of selecting features in order to promote the classification accuracy, the paper considers the use of a set of binary classifiers each of ones is devoted to predict a single class of the multi-classification problem. These classifiers are similar to local experts whose knowledge (about the features that are most correlated to each class value) is taken into account by the learning strategy for selecting an optimal set of features. Results of the experiments performed on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

The protocol applies a branching diagnostic program with classification labels in the leaves to the user's attribute vector. The user learns only the label assigned by the program to his vector; the diagnostic program itself remains secret. The program's owner does not learn anything. Our construction is significantly more efficient than those obtained by direct application of generic secure multi-party computation techniques. We use our protocol to implement a privacy-preserving version of the Clarify system for software fault diagnosis, and demonstrate that its performance is acceptable for many practical scenarios.

The method, named REC (Rule Evolution for Classifiers), has three main features: it applies genetic programming to perform a search in the space of potential solutions; a procedure allows biasing the search towards regions of comprehensible hypothesis with high predictive quality and it includes a strategy for the selection of an optimum subset of rules (classifier) from the rules obtained as the result of the evolutionary process. A comparative study between this method and the rule induction algorithm C5.0 is carried out for two application problems (data sets). Experimental results show the advantages of using the method proposed.			ecarreno@unsl.edu.ar; legiu@unsl.edu.ar; nwagner@aug.edu					Bojarczuk CC, 2000, IEEE ENG MED BIOL, V19, P38, DOI 10.1109/51.853480; Deb K., 2001, MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIM; Hong JH, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3003, P78; Koza J.

LFA uses a statistical model to predict how students perform in each practice of a knowledge component (KC), and identifies over-practiced or under-practiced KCs. By using the LFA findings on the Cognitive Tutor geometry Curriculum, we optimized the curriculum with the goal of improving student learning efficiency. With a control group design, we analyzed the learning performance and the learning time of high school students participating in the Optimized Cognitive Tutor geometry curriculum. Results were compared to students participating in the traditional Cognitive Tutor geometry curriculum. Analyses indicated that students in the optimized condition saved a significant amount of time in the optimized curriculum units, compared with the time spent by the control group. There was no significant difference in the learning performance of the two groups in either an immediate post test or a two-week-later retention test.

Adaptive systems would greatly benefit from having a user model of the learner's motivation, especially if integrated with information about knowledge. In this paper a log file analysis for eliciting motivation knowledge is presented, as a first step towards a user model for motivation. Several data mining techniques are used in order to find the best method and the best indicators for disengagement prediction. Results show a very good level of prediction: around 87% correctly predicted instances of all three levels of engagement and 93% correctly predicted instances of disengagement. Data sets with reduced attribute sets show similar results, indicating that engagement level can be predicted from information like reading pages and taking tests, which are common to most e-Learning systems.

The Chandra source Catalog	ASTRONOMICAL DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS XVI	ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC CONFERENCE SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual Conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems	OCT 15-18, 2006	Tucson, AZ					The Chandra X-ray Center (CXC) has undertaken the production of the Chandra Source Catalog, a data-mining project that makes use of the continuously growing Chandra public archive. The distinguishing characteristic of Chandra, the NASA Great Observatory for exploring the universe in the X-rays, is its sub-arcsecond resolution, which provides the most sensitive and detailed view of the similar to(0.3-7) keV sky presently attainable. The Catalog will characterize the X-ray sky at high resolution and with accurate astrometry, making use of all the imaging Chandra data. It will provide a uniform reduction of the Chandra archive, that will be a major interface for the Virtual Observatory; will be continuously updated as more data enters the public domain during the on-going Chandra mission; and will enable a dynamic interaction to produce user-configured views with on-the-fly analysis work-flows. In this paper we describe the Catalog, and the software and hardware needed for its realization.

However, MGs often show an intra-class combinatorial redundancy that makes an exhaustive storage and use impractical. In this respect, the succinct system of minimal generators (SSMG) recently introduced by Dong et al. is a first step towards a lossless reduction of this redundancy. However, as shown elsewhere, some of the claims about SSMG, e.g., its invariant size and lossless nature, do not hold. As a remedy, we propose here a new succinct family which restores the losslessness by adding few further elements to the SSMG core, while theoretically grounding the whole. Computing means for the new family are presented together with the empirical evidences about its relative size w.r.t. the entire MG family and similar structures from the literature.

Moreover automatic data-mining techniques like clustering of news streams into topical groups can fully recover the underlying true class labels of data if and only if all classes are well separated In reality, especially for news streams, this is clearly not the case. The question to ask is thus this: if we cannot recover the full C classes by clustering, what is the largest K < C clusters we can find that best resemble the K underlying classes? Using the intuition that bursty topics are more likely to correspond to important events that are of interest to analysts, we propose several new bursty vector space models (B-VSM) for representing a news document. B-VSM takes into account the burstiness (across the full corpus and whole duration) of each constituent word in a document at the time of publication. We benchmarked our B-VSM against the classical TFIDF-VSM on the task of clustering a collection of news stream articles with known topic labels. Experimental results show that B-VSM was able to find the burstiest clusters/topics. Further it also significantly improved the recall and precision for the top K clusters/topics.

Unsupervised learning is clearly beneficial for initial understanding of data streams, and consequently various clustering algorithms have been developed and applied in UDM systems for the purpose of mining data streams. However, unsupervised data mining techniques require human intervention for further understanding and analysis of the clustering results. This becomes an issue as UDM applications aim to support mobile and highly dynamic users/applications and there is a need for real-time decision making and interpretation of results. In this paper we present an approach to automate the annotation of results obtained from ubiquitous data stream clustering to facilitate interpreting and use of the results to enable real-time, mobile decision making.

The required information is captured by web servers and stored in web usage data logs. The first phase of web usage mining is the pre processing phase. In the preprocessing phase, first, relevant information is filtered from the logs. Data preprocessing is a critical step in web usage mining. The results of data preprocessing is relevant to the next steps, such as transaction identification, path analysis, association rule mining, sequential pattern mining, and so forth. Feature selection is a preprocessing step in data mining, and it is very effective in reducing dimensions, reducing the irrelevant data, increasing the learning accuracy and improving comprehensiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach for feature selection based on Rough set Theory for web usage mining.	[Inbarani, H.

The MES is an efficient process control method for many enterprises. But, the MES is not an analysis technique for process control. Therefore, we will supplement a data mining technology and RFID tag information to generate a more efficient process control system. In order to accomplish this, we designed and implemented an efficient product control system and adapted it to a TFT LCD production line using RFID tag information and data mining. As a result, the method proposed solved defects in parts and problems of personnel expenses.	Anyang Univ, Anyang, South Korea	Kim, C (reprint author), Anyang Univ, Anyang, South Korea.

Existing fault-tolerant CMP proposals that implement dual modular redundancy (DMR) do so by statically binding pairs of adjacent cores via dedicated communication channels and buffers. This can result in unnecessary power and performance losses in cases where one core is defective (in which case the entire DMR pair must be disabled), or when cores exhibit different frequency leakage characteristics due to process variations (in which case the pair runs at the speed of the slowest core). Static DMR also hinders power den sity/thermal management, as DMR pairs running code with similar power/thermal characteristics are necessarily placed next to each other on the die. We present dynamic core coupling (DCC), an architectural technique that allows arbitrary CMP cores to verify each other's execution while requiring no static core binding at design time or dedicated communication hardware. Our evaluation shows that the performance overhead of DCC over a CMP without fault tolerance is 3% on SPEC2000 benchmarks, and is within 5% for a set of scalable parallel scientific and data mining applications with lip to eight threads (16 processors). Our results also show that DCC has the potential to significantly outperform existing static DMR schemes.

Recommendation systems in ubiquitous computing environment should have the capability of context-awareness. In this research, we developed a music recommendation system, which we shall call C-2_Music, which utilizes not only the user's demographics and behavioral patterns but also the user's context. For a specific user in a specific context, the C-2_Music recommends the music that the similar users listened most in the similar context. In evaluating the performance of C-2_Music using a real world data, it outperforms the comparative system that utilizes the user's demographics and behavioral patterns only.

Traditional mining algorithms on database were not adapted to data stream. Recently, some approximate sequential pattern mining algorithms over data stream were presented which solved some problems except the one of wasting too many system resources in processing long sequences. According to observation and proof, a novel approximate sequential pattern mining algorithm is proposed named GraSeq. GraSeq uses directed weighted graph structure and stores the synopsis of sequences with only one scan of data stream; furthermore, a subsequences matching method is mentioned to reduce the cost of long sequences' processing and a conception validnode is introduced to improve the accuracy of mining results. Our experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm is effective and efficient.

Methods for incremental updating decision rules based on the indiscernibility, tolerance relation and similarity relations in rough set theory have been previously studied in literature. The characteristic relation-based rough sets approach provides more informative results than the approach employing the indiscernibility, tolerance relations and similarity relations based approach. In this paper, we extend rough sets based on characteristic relations for incrementally updating decision rules. An extensive experimental evaluation validates the efficiency of the proposed approach which may he used to handle a dynamic maintenance of decision rules in data mining.

Colonoscopy is the accepted screening method for detection of colorectal cancer or its precursor lesions, colorectal polyps. Indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal cancer related deaths. However, not all cancers or large polyps are detected at the time of colonoscopy, and studies of why this occurs are needed. Currently, there is no objective way to measure in detail what exactly is achieved during the procedure (i.e., quality of the colonoscopic procedure). In this paper, we present new algorithms that analyze a video file created during colonoscopy and derive quality measurements of how the colon mucosa is inspected. The proposed algorithms are unique applications of existing data mining techniques: decision tree and support vector machine classifiers applied to videos from medical domain. The algorithms are to be integrated into a novel system aimed at automatic analysis for quality measures of colonoscopy.

The cooperation of these software agents provides efficient monitoring, analyzing, and managing the data of patient where abnormal patterns are detected to have an advance treatment and prevent loss of life. In this paper, a framework for ubiquitous healthcare based on multi-agent is presented. This paper proposes a mobile agent for diagnosis support in ubiquitous healthcare. The expert mobile agent (EMA) classifies the data of patient by using neuro-fuzzy algorithm for consultation report. A pre-processing method based on the profile of an expert is used to filter the data from the history of patient. Result of neuro-fuzzy from cross-validation test shows a high accurate classification in data compared to other highly accurate classifiers.

Many situations demand from publishing data without revealing the confidential information in it. Among several data protection methods proposed in the literature, those based on linear regression are widely used for numerical data. The main objective of these methods is to minimize both the disclosure risk (DR) and the information lost (IL). However, most of these techniques try to protect the non-confidential attributes based on the values of the confidential attributes in the data set. In this situation, when these two sets of attributes are strongly correlated, the possibility of an intruder to reveal confidential data increases, making these methods unsuitable for many typical scenarios. In this paper we propose a new type of methods called LiROP-k methods that, based on linear regression, avoid the problems derived from the correlation between attributes in the data set. We propose the vectorization, sorting and partitioning of all values in the attributes to be protected in the data set, breaking the semantics of these attributes inside the record. We present two different protection methods: a synthetic protection method called LiROPs-k and a perturbative method, called LiROPp-k. We show that, when the attributes in the data set are highly correlated, our methods present lower DR than other protection methods based on linear regression.

This paper addresses the problem of locating subdimensional motifs in real-valued, multivariate time series, which requires the simultaneous discovery of sets of recurring patterns along with the corresponding relevant dimensions. While many approaches to motif discovery have been developed, most are restricted to categorical data, univariate time series, or multivariate data in which the temporal patterns span all of the dimensions. In this paper, we present an expected linear-time algorithm that addresses a generalization of multivariate pattern discovery in which each motif may span only a subset of the dimensions. To validate our algorithm, we discuss its theoretical properties and empirically evaluate it using several data sets including synthetic data and motion capture data collected by an on-body inertial sensor.

We introduce one such language, called IQL. IQL is intended as a general, descriptive, declarative, extendable and implementable language for inductive querying that supports the mining of both local and global patterns, reasoning about inductive queries and query processing using logic, as well as the flexible incorporation of new primitives and solvers. IQL is an extension of the tuple relational calculus that includes functions as primitives. The language integrates ideas from several other declarative programming languages, such as pattern matching and function typing. We hope that it will be useful as an overall specification language for integrating data mining systems and principles.

Sequential pattern is traditionally formed as (A, B) where A and B are frequent sequence in a transaction database. We extend this definition to include sequential patterns of forms (A, -B), (-A, B) and (-A, -B), which present negative sequential patterns among sequences. We call patterns of the form (A, B) positive sequential patterns, and patterns of the other forms negative patterns. Negative sequential patterns can also provide very useful insight view into the data set although they are different from positive ones. We put forward a discovery algorithm for mining negative sequential patterns from large transaction database in this paper.

Although it is argued that mapping tools may require interaction from humans (domain experts) for best accuracy, in general, automatic ontology mapping is an AI-Complete problem. Finding matchings (correspondences) between the concepts of two ontologies is the first step towards solving this problem but matchings are normally not directly executable for data exchange or query translation. This paper presents an systematic approach to combining ontology matching, object reconciliation and multi-relational data mining to find the executable mapping rules in a highly automatic manner. Our approach starts from an iterative process to search the matchings and do object reconciliation for the ontologies with data instances. Then the result of this iterative process is used for mining frequent queries. Finally the semantic mapping rules can be generated from the frequent queries. The results show our approach is highly automatic without losing much accuracy compared with human-specified mappings.

Data Mining (DM) techniques have showed their advantages on helping to manage this information and transforming it in useful knowledge. However, due to the dynamics of the environment of Telecommunications Networks, the simple application or adaptation of DM techniques is not enough to obtain timely a deeper knowledge. In this paper, this problem is addressed by applying DM techniques in real time. First, we propose a methodology taking into account all the processes involved in transforming telecommunications data into information, and finally to knowledge. Second, we propose a framework for the utilization of Intelligent Agents to help the process of DM in real time. To illustrate our approach, we describe a real-life case study based on the integration of Intelligent Agents and DM technologies for obtaining in real time knowledge that is critical for managing telecommunication networks.

J	Shen, JJ; Chang, CC; Li, YC				Shen, Jau-Ji; Chang, Chin-Chen; Li, Yu-Chiang			Combined association rules for dealing with missing values	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						association rule; data mining; missing value; relational database	KNOWLEDGE	With the rapid increase in the use of databases, the problem of missing values inevitably arises. The techniques developed to recover these missing values effectively should be highly precise in order to estimate the missing values completely. The mining of association rules can effectively establish the relationship among items in databases. Therefore, discovered association rules are usually applied to recover the missing values in databases. This study presents a Fast Recycle Combined Association Rules (FRCAR) method to fill in the missing values. FRCAR applies a technique to recycle sub-frequent itemsets and bit-arrays to discover more association rules than the Missing Value Completion (MVC) approach. The experimental result demonstrates that FRCAR results in a higher recovery rate and higher recovery accuracy for missing values.

In recent studies, the use of two interestingness measures at the same time was prevailing. Mining of Pareto-optimal borders according to support and confidence, or support and anti-support are examples of that approach. Here, we consider induction of "if..., then..." association rules with a fixed conclusion. We investigate ways to limit the set of rules non-dominated wrt support and confidence or support and anti-support, to a subset of truly interesting rules. Analytically, and through experiments, we show that both of the considered sets can be easily reduced by using the valuable semantics of confirmation measures.

The research area of Data Mining has become a paramount requirement in order to cope with the acquired information by locating and extracting patterns from these data volumes. Possibilistic networks comprise one prominent Data Mining technique that is capable of encoding dependence and independence relations between variables as well as dealing with imprecision. It will be argued that the learning of the network structure only provides an overview of the qualitative component, yet the more interesting information is contained inside the network parameters, namely the potential tables. In this paper we introduce a new visualization technique that allows for a detailed inspection of the quantitative component of possibilistic networks.

The current state-of-the-art of these interfaces is restricted to access extensional data in databases in Datalog form, disallowing access to compound terms. However, recent years have seen the evolution of relational database management systems in order to enable them to store and manage more complex information. Of this complex data, one of the most interesting and fast growing is that of spatial data. In this paper we describe the application of the MY-DDAS deductive database system to the handling of spatial data, and the needed extensions, namely the ability to handle vectorial geometric attributes from database relations, the definition of spatial operators, and a visualization framework, in order to obtain a spatial deductive database system, that can be used as a geographic information system. We argue that such a system can improve the state-of-the-art of spatial data handling in all of its aspects, namely in spatial data modeling, spatial querying and spatial data mining. We describe, in particular, the application of such a logic-powered geographic information system to two real-world problems.

Most previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes. In practice, different customers may have different preferences on nominal attributes. In this paper, we identify an interesting data mining problem, finding favorable facets, which has not been studied before. Given a set of points in a multidimensional space, for a specific target point p we want to discover with respect to which combinations of orders (e.g., customer preferences) on the nominal attributes p is not dominated by any other points. Such combinations are called the favorable facets of p. We consider both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the mining. A given point may have many favorable facets. We propose the notion of minimal disqualifying condition (MDC) which is effective in summarizing favorable facets. We develop efficient algorithms for favorable facet mining for different application scenarios. The first method computes favorable facets on the fly. The second method pre-computes all minimal disqualifying conditions so that the favorable facets can be looked up in constant time. An extensive performance study using both synthetic and real data sets is reported to verify their effectiveness and efficiency.

However, it is still not clear when a measure is truly effective in large data sets. Recent studies have identified a critical property, null-(transaction) invariance, for measuring event associations in large data sets, but many existing measures do not have this property. We thus re-examine the mill-invariant measures and find interestingly that they can be expressed as a generalized mathematical mean, and there exists a total ordering of them. This ordering provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps us understand and select the proper measure for different applications.

PPDM technologies allow us to extract relevant knowledge from a large amount of data, while hide sensitive data or information from disclosure. Several research questions have often being asked: (1) what kind of option available for privacy preserving? (2) Which method is more popular? (3) how to measure the performance of these algorithms? And (4) how effective of these algorithms in preserving privacy? To help answer these questions, we conduct an extensive review of 29 recent references from years 2000 to 2006 for analysis.

Analysis guided visual exploration of multivariate data	VAST: IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL ANALYTICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 2007, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology	OCT 30-NOV 01, 2007	Sacramento, CA	IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm, ACM SIGGRAPH		visual analytics; visual knowledge discovery; discovery management; analysis guided exploration		Visualization systems traditionally focus on graphical representation of information. They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line, because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle these problems, it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualization systems. In this paper, we present a novel analysis-guided exploration system, called the Nugget Management System (NMS). It leverages the collaborative effort of human comprehensibility and machine computations to facilitate users' visual exploration processes. Specifically, NMS first extracts the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on the interests of users. Given that similar nuggets may be re-discovered by different users, NMS consolidates the nugget candidate set by clustering based on their semantic similarity. To solve the problem of inaccurate discoveries, localized data mining techniques are applied to refine the nuggets to best represent the captured patterns in datasets. Lastly, the resulting well-organized nugget pool is used to guide users' exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of NMS, we integrated NMS into Xmd-vTool, a freeware multivariate visualization system. User studies were performed to compare the users' efficiency and accuracy in finishing tasks on real datasets, with and without the help of NMS. Our user studies confirmed the effectiveness of NMS.

However, the increase of email users has resulted in the dramatic increase of spam emails during the past few years. As spammers always try to find a way to evade existing filters, newfilters need to be developed to catch spam. Ontologies allow for machine-understandable semantics of data It is important to share information with each other for more effective spam filtering. Thus, it is necessary to build ontology and a,framework for efficient email filtering. Using ontology that is specially designed to filter spam, bunch of unsolicited bulk email could be filtered out on the system. This paper proposes to find an efficient spam email filtering method using adaptive ontology.

In contrast, we are working to develop data mining techniques to discover patterns consisting of complex relationships between entities. Our research is particularly applicable to domains in which the data is event driven, such as counter-terrorism intelligence analysis. In this paper we describe an algorithm designed to operate over relational data received from a continuous stream. Our approach includes a mechanism for summarizing discoveries from previous data increments so that the globally best patterns can be computed by examining only the new data increment. We then describe a method by which relational dependencies that span across temporal increment boundaries can be efficiently resolved so that additional pattern instances, which do not reside entirely in a single data increment, can be discovered. We also describe a method for change detection using a measure of central tendency designed for graph data. We contrast two formulations of the change detection process and demonstrate the ability to identify salient changes along meaningful dimensions and recognize trends in a relational data stream.

Some proposals based on the insertion of local search and data mining (DM) modules in a genetic algorithm (GA) are presented. Four algorithms were developed: a GA, a GA with a local search procedure, a GA including a DM module and a GA including local search and DM. Experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of DM and local search modules in GA can improve the solution quality produced by this method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The DM process can be described as a multi-phase pipeline process, and in each phase there could be many optional methods. This makes the workflow for DM very complex and it can be modeled only by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A heterogeneous computing system needs an effective and efficient scheduling framework, which orchestrates all the computing hardware to perform multiple competitive DM workflows. Motivated by the need for a practical solution of the scheduling problem for the DM workflow, this paper proposes a dynamic DAG scheduling algorithm according to the characteristics of an execution time estimation model for DM jobs. Based on an approximate estimation of job execution time, this algorithm first maps DM jobs to machines in a decentralized and diligent (defined in this paper) manner. Then the performance of this initial mapping can be improved through job migrations when necessary. The scheduling heuristic used considers the factors of both the minimal completion time criterion and the critical path in a DAG. We implement this system in an established multi-agent system environment, in which the reuse of existing DM algorithms is achieved by encapsulating them into agents. The system evaluation and its usage in oil well logging analysis are also discussed.

One involves transporting astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the other involves computing histograms from multiple high-volume data streams. Both rely on newly developed data transport and data mining middleware. Specifically, we describe a new version of the UDT network protocol called Composible-UDT, a file transfer utility based upon UDT called UDT-Gateway, and an application for building histograms on high-volume data flows called BESH (for Best Effort Streaming Histogram).

In this paper the fuzzy pincer search algorithm is proposed. It generates fuzzy association rules by adopting combined top-down and bottom-up approaches. A fuzzy grid representation is used to reduce the number of scans of the database and our algorithm trims down the number of candidate fuzzy grids at each level. It has been observed that fuzzy association rules provide more realistic visualization of the knowledge extracted from databases.

J	Di Fatta, G; Berthold, MR				Di Fatta, G; Berthold, MR			Dynamic load balancing for the distributed mining of molecular structures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						distributed computing; peer-to-peer computing; dynamic load balancing; subgraph mining; frequent patterns; biochemical databases; molecular compounds	ASSOCIATION RULES; PARALLEL	In molecular biology, it is often desirable to find common properties in large numbers of drug candidates. One family of methods stems from the data mining community, where algorithms to find frequent graphs have received increasing attention over the past years. However, the computational complexity of the underlying problem and the large amount of data to be explored essentially render sequential algorithms useless. In this paper, we present a distributed approach to the frequent subgraph mining problem to discover interesting patterns in molecular compounds. This problem is characterized by a highly irregular search tree, whereby no reliable workload prediction is available. We describe the three main aspects of the proposed distributed algorithm, namely, a dynamic partitioning of the search space, a distribution process based on a peer-to-peer communication framework, and a novel receiver-initiated load balancing algorithm. The effectiveness of the distributed method has been evaluated on the well-known National Cancer Institute's HIV-screening data set, where we were able to show close-to linear speedup in a network of workstations. The proposed approach also allows for dynamic resource aggregation in a nondedicated computational environment. These features make it suitable for large-scale, multidomain, heterogeneous environments, such as computational grids.

Traditionally, techniques involving higher-level (semantic) object detection and complex feature extraction have been employed for scene understanding. On the basis of this understanding, corresponding text descriptions are generated for a given image. In this paper, we pose the auto-annotation problem as that of multi-relational association rule mining where the relations exist between image-based features, and textual annotations. The central idea is to combine low-level image features such as color, orientation, intensity, etc. and corresponding text annotations to generate association rules across multiple tables using multi-relational association mining. Subsequently, we use these association rules to auto-annotate test images. In this paper we also present a multi-relational extension to the FP-tree algorithm to accomplish the association rule mining task effectively. The motivation for using multi-relational association rule mining for multimedia data mining is to exhibit the potential accorded by multiple descriptions for the same image (such as multiple people labeling the same image differently). Moreover, multi-relational association rule mining can also benefit the auto-annotation process by pruning the number of trivial associations that are generated if text and image features were combined in a single table through a join. In this paper, we discuss these issues and the results of our auto-annotation experiments on different test sets. Another contribution of this paper is highlighting a need to develop robust evaluation metrics for the image annotation task.

J	Littau, D; Boley, D				Littau, David; Boley, Daniel			Streaming data reduction using low-memory factored representations	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						streaming data; data reduction; clustering; PDDP; matrix approximation	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHMS	Many special purpose algorithms exist for extracting information from streaming data. Constraints are imposed on the total memory and on the average processing time per data item. These constraints are usually satisfied by deciding in advance the kind of information one wishes to extract, and then extracting only the data relevant for that goal. Here, we propose a general data representation that can be computed using modest memory requirements with limited processing power per data item, and yet permits the application of an arbitrary data mining algorithm chosen and/or adjusted after the data collection process has begun. The new representation allows for the at-once analysis of a significantly larger number of data items than would be possible using the original representation of the data. The method depends on a rapid computation of a factored form of the original data set. The method is illustrated with two real datasets, one with dense and one with sparse attribute values.

J	Chang, JH; Lee, WS				Chang, JH; Lee, WS			Finding frequent itemsets over online data streams	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data streams; frequent itemsets; data mining; lexicographic tree; delayed-insertion; itemset pruning		Conventional data mining methods for finding frequent itemsets require considerable computing time to produce their results from a large data set. Due to this reason, it is almost impossible to apply them to an analysis task in an online data stream where a new transaction is continuously generated at a rapid rate. An algorithm for finding frequent itemsets over an online data stream should support flexible trade-off between processing time and mining accuracy. Furthermore, the most up-to-date resulting set of frequent itemsets should be available quickly at any moment. To satisfy these requirements, this paper proposes a data mining method for finding frequent itemsets over an online data stream. The proposed method examines each transaction one-by-one without any candidate generation process. The count of an itemset that appears in each transaction is monitored by a lexicographic tree resided in main memory. The current set of monitored itemsets in an online data stream is minimized by two major operations: delayed- insertion and pruning. The former is delaying the insertion of a new itemset in recent transactions until the itemset becomes significant enough to be monitored. The latter is pruning a monitored itemset when the itemset turns out to be insignificant. The number of monitored itemsets can be flexibly controlled by the thresholds of these two operations. As the number of monitored itemsets is decreased, frequent itemsets in the online data stream are more rapidly traced while they are less accurate. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed through a series of experiments in order to identify its various characteristics. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wesley; Wang, Wei-Tse; Shen, Jau-Ji			A data mining approach to database compression	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						database compression; data mining; association rules	STATISTICAL DATABASES; HUFFMAN; ALGORITHM; SCHEME; SETS	Data mining can dig out valuable information from databases to assist a business in approaching knowledge discovery and improving business intelligence. Database stores large structured data. The amount of data increases due to the advanced database technology and extensive use of information systems. Despite the price drop of storage devices, it is still important to develop efficient techniques for database compression. This paper develops a database compression method by eliminating redundant data, which often exist in transaction database. The proposed approach uses a data mining structure to extract association rules from a database. Redundant data will then be replaced by means of compression rules. A heuristic method is designed to resolve the conflicts of the compression rules. To prove its efficiency and effectiveness, the proposed approach is compared with two other database compression methods.

Nevertheless, the effective use of these systems often requires data preprocessing before applying a learning algorithm. This is especially important for multidimensional heterogeneous data presented by a large number of features of different types. Dimensionality reduction (DR) is one commonly applied approach. The goal of this paper is to study the impact of natural clustering-clustering according to expert domain knowledge-on DR for supervised learning (SL) in the area of antibiotic resistance. We compare several data-mining strategies that apply DR by means of feature extraction or feature selection with subsequent SL on microbiological data. The results of our study show that local DR within natural clusters may result in better representation for SL in comparison with the global DR on the whole data.

The poison message failure can propagate in the network and cause unstable network. In this paper, we apply machine learning, data mining technique in network fault management area. We use k-nearest neighbor method to identify the poison message failure. Also we integrate the k-nearest neighbor method with message filtering approach. We also propose a "probabilistic" k-nearest neighbor method that outputs a probability distribution (rather than the identity) of the poison message. Through extensive simulations, we show that k-nearest neighbor method is very effective in identifying the responsible message type.

As a station ages, the graphite bricks that comprise the core can distort and may eventually crack. As the core cannot be replaced the core integrity ultimately determines the station life. Monitoring these distortions is usually restricted to the routine outages, which occur every few years, as this is the only time that the reactor core can be accessed by external sensing equipment. However, during weekly refueling activities measurements are taken from the core for protection and control purposes. It is shown in this paper that these measurements may be interpreted for condition monitoring purposes, thus potentially providing information relating to core condition on a more frequent basis. This paper describes the data-mining approach adopted to analyze this data and also describes a software system designed and implemented to support this process. The use of this software to develop a model of expected behavior based on historical data, which may highlight events containing unusual features possibly indicative of brick cracking, is also described. Finally, the implementation of this newly acquired understanding in an automated analysis system is described.

J	Atzmueller, M; Baumeister, J; Puppe, F				Atzmueller, M; Baumeister, J; Puppe, F			Semi-automatic learning of simple diagnostic scores utilizing complexity measures	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Industrial Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)	JUL 04-07, 2004	Leipzig, GERMANY	Inst Comp Vis & Appl Comp Sci		diagnostic scores; knowledge discovery; complexity measures; data mining	EXPERT-SYSTEM; KNOWLEDGE	Objective: Knowledge acquisition and maintenance in medical domains with a large application domain ontology is a difficult task. To reduce knowledge elicitation costs, semi-automatic learning methods can be used to support the domain specialists. They are usually not only interested in the accuracy of the learned knowledge: the understandability and interpretability of the learned models is of prime importance as well. Then, often simple models are more favorable than complex ones. Methods and material: We propose diagnostic scores as a promising approach for the representation of simple diagnostic knowledge, and present a method for inductive learning of diagnostic scores. It can be incrementally refined by including background knowledge. We present complexity measures for determining the complexity of the learned scores. Results: We give an evaluation of the presented approach using a case base from the fielded system SonoConsult. We further discuss that the user can easily balance between accuracy and complexity of the learned knowledge applying the presented measures. Conclusions: We argue that semi-automatic learning methods can support the domain specialist efficiently when building (diagnostic) knowledge systems from scratch. The presented complexity measures allow for an intuitive assessment of the Learned patterns. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the most common distance join queries is the closest-pair query ( CPQ). Given two datasets D(A) and D(B) the CPQ retrieves the pair ( a, b), where a 2 DA and b is an element of D(B), having the smallest distance between all pairs of objects. An extension to this problem is to generate the k closest pairs of objects ( k-CPQ). In several cases spatial constraints are applied, and object pairs that are retrieved must also satisfy these constraints. Although the application of spatial constraints seems natural towards a more focused search, only recently they have been studied for the CPQ problem with the restriction that D(A) = D(B). In this work, we focus on constrained closest-pair queries, between two distinct datasets D(A) and D(B), where objects from D(A) must be enclosed by a spatial region R. Several algorithms are presented and evaluated using real-life and synthetic datasets. Among them, a heap-based method enhanced with batch capabilities outperforms the other approaches as it is demonstrated by an extensive performance evaluation.

J	Vergilio, SR; Pozo, A				Vergilio, SR; Pozo, A			A grammar-guided genetic programming framework configured for data mining and software testing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						evolutionary computation; data mining; software testing; grammars	ALGORITHMS	Genetic Programming (GP) is a powerful software induction technique that can be applied to solve a wide variety of problems. However, most researchers develop tailor-made GP tools for solving specific problems. These tools generally require significant modifications in their kernel to be adapted to other domains. In this paper, we explore the Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) approach as an alternative to overcome such limitation. We describe a GGGP based framework, named Chameleon, that can be easily configured to solve different problems. We explore the use of Chameleon in two domains, not usually addressed by works in the literature: in the task of mining relational databases and in the software testing activity. The presented results point out that the use of the grammar-guided approach helps us to obtain more generic GP frameworks and that they can contribute in the explored domains.

J	Wang, W; Zhang, AD				Wang, W; Zhang, AD			Extracting semantic concepts from images: a decisive feature pattern mining approach	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						multimedia semantic understanding; multimedia data mining; multimedia information retrieval; multimedia processing and pattern recognition		One major challenge in the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and computer vision research is to bridge the so-called "semantic gap" between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts, that is, extracting semantic concepts from a large database of images effectively. In this paper, we tackle the problem by mining the decisive feature patterns (DFPs). Intuitively, a decisive feature pattern is a combination of low-level feature values that are unique and significant for describing a semantic concept. Interesting algorithms are developed to mine the decisive feature patterns and construct a rule base to automatically recognize semantic concepts in images. A systematic performance study on large image databases containing many semantic concepts shows that our method is more effective than some previously proposed methods. Importantly, our method can be generally applied to any domain of semantic concepts and low-level features.

It provides a wealth of scientific information such as experimental data and requires a suitable automated data mining and analysis tool for its meaningful exploration. The Java based software presented here, ChemXtreme, is developed for harvesting chemical information from the Internet employing the Google API in combination with a distributed client/server text analysis architecture based on JavaRMI. It represents the first and until now the only toolkit for automated structured data retrieval from the Internet which is itself open source. ChemXtreme employs the "search the search engine" strategy, where the URLs returned from the search engine are analyzed further via textual pattern analysis. This process resembles the manual analysis of the hit list, where relevant data are captured and, by means of human intervention, are mined into a format suitable for further analysis. ChemXtreme on the other hand transforms chemical information automatically into a structured format suitable for storage in databases and further analysis and also provides links to the original information source. The query data retrieved from the search engine by the server is encoded, encrypted, and compressed and then sent to all the participating active clients in the network for parsing. Relevant information identified by the clients on the retrieved Web sites is sent back to the server, verified, and added to the database for data mining and further analysis. The distributed further analysis of URLs in a client/server architecture scales very favorably, thus producing only minimal overhead.

S	Alfred, R; Kazakov, D		Li, X; Zaiane, OR; Li, ZH		Alfred, Rayner; Kazakov, Dimitar			Data summarization approach to relational domain learning based on frequent pattern to support the development of decision making	ADVANCED DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications	AUG 14-16, 2006	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	Xian Software Pk, Web Informat Syst Engn Soc, IEEE Queensland Sect, Univ Queensland				A new approach is needed to handle huge dataset stored in multiple tables in a very-large database. Data mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) promise to play a crucial role in the way people interact with databases, especially decision support databases where analysis and exploration operations are essential. In this paper, we present related works in Relational Data Mining, define the basic notions of data mining for decision support and the types of data aggregation as a means of categorizing or summarizing data. We then present a novel approach to relational domain learning to support the development of decision making models by introducing automated construction of hierarchical multi-attribute model for decision making. We will describe how relational dataset can naturally be handled to support the construction of hierarchical multi-attribute model by using relational aggregation based on pattern's distance. In this paper, we presents the prototype of "Dynamic Aggregation of Relational Attributes" (hence called DARA) that is capable of supporting the construction of hierarchical multi-attribute model for decision making. We experimentally show these results in a multi-relational domain that shows higher percentage of correctly classified instances and illustrate set of rules extracted from the relational domains to support decision-making.

However, the mining analysis is not performed and supervised by the final user, the management of the organization, since the knowledge of mathematical models as well as expert database administration skills is required. This paper describes a distributed architecture for association rule mining analysis in the retail area, designed to be used directly by the management of an organization and implemented as a Java web application. The rule discovery algorithm is executed at the database server that hosts the source data warehouse, while the only used client tool is a web browser. The user interactively initiates the rule discovery process through a simple user interface, which is used later to browse, sort and compare the discovered rules.

Automated Knowledge Discovery from Simulators	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	6th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 20-22, 2006	Bethesda, MD	Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc		simulator; knowledge discovery; landscape characterization; active learning; asteroid collisions; SVM		In this paper, we explore one aspect of knowledge discovery from simulators, the landscape characterization problem, where the aim is to identify regions in the input/parameter/model space that lead to a particular output behavior. Large-scale numerical simulators are in widespread use by scientists and engineers across a range of government agencies, academia, and industry; in many cases, simulators provide the only means to examine processes that are infeasible or impossible to study otherwise. However, the cost of simulation studies can be quite high, both in terms of the time and computational resources required to conduct the trials and the manpower needed to sift through the resulting output. Thus, there is strong motivation to develop automated methods that enable more efficient knowledge extraction. Unlike traditional data mining, knowledge discovery from simulators is not limited to a static, pre-determined dataset; instead, the simulator itself can be used as an oracle to generate new data of our own choosing. We exploit this opportunity by employing active learning and support vector machines (SVMs) to choose which are the most valuable simulation trials to run next. On two real-world scientific simulators, one for asteroid collisions and one for magnetospheric modeling, we demonstrate twofold and sixfold reductions, respectively, in the number of simulator trials required to achieve a particular level of fidelity in landscape characterization as compared with a standard grid-based sampling approach.

The performance of Ant-Miner with the new pruning procedure is evaluated and compared with the performance of the original Ant-Miner across several datasets. The results show that the new pruning procedure has a mixed effect on the performance of Ant-Miner. On one hand, overall it tends to decrease the classification accuracy more often than it improves it. On the other hand, the new pruning procedure in general leads to the discovery of classification rules that are considerably shorter, and so simpler (more easily interpretable by the users) than the rules discovered by the original Ant-Miner.

A new discrete particle swarm algorithm applied to attribute selection in a bioinformatics data set	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		particle swarm; optimization; data mining; attribute selection; Naive Bayes classifier; bioinformatics		Many data mining applications involve the task of building a model for predictive classification. The goal of such a model is to classify examples (records or data instances) into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables (attributes) not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of a classification or prediction model. Superfluous variables can also increase the costs of building a model - particularly on large data sets. We propose a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm designed for attribute selection. The proposed algorithm deals with discrete variables, and its population of candidate solutions contains particles of different sizes. The performance of this algorithm is compared with the performance of a standard binary PSO algorithm on the task of selecting attributes in a bioinformatics data set. The criteria used for comparison are: (1) maximizing predictive accuracy; and (2) finding the smallest subset of attributes.

Firstly, the concepts and their properties of information entropy and cross entropy (CE) are analysed and studied. On this foundation, we prove that symmetrical cross entropy (SCE) proposed here based on I E satisfies three axioms of the distance, i.e. nonnegativity, symmetry and triangle inequation. So SCE is a kind of distance measure, which can be used to measure the degree of variation between two random variables. Secondly, for convenience, we propose a new concept of improved polynomial entropy (IPE) based on polynomial entropy (PE), and explain that WE is equivalent to SCE. Thirdly, we make IPE separability criterion of the classes for feature extraction, and design a novel feature extraction algorithm based on IPE. Fianlly, the experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed here is valid and reliable, and it provides a new research approach for feature extraction, data mining and pattern recognition.

Mining approximate motifs in time series	DISCOVERY SCIENCE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Discovery Science	OCT 07-10, 2006	Barcelona, SPAIN					The problem of discovering previously unknown frequent patterns in time series, also called motifs, has been recently introduced. A motif is a subseries pattern that appears a significant number of times. Results demonstrate that motifs may provide valuable insights about the data and have a wide range of applications in data mining tasks. The main motivation for this study was the need to mine time series data from protein folding/unfolding simulations. We propose an algorithm that extracts approximate motifs, i.e. motifs that capture portions of time series with a similar and eventually symmetric behavior. Preliminary results on the analysis of protein unfolding data support this proposal as a valuable tool. A.dditional experiments demonstrate that the application of utility of our algorithm is not limited to this particular problem. Rather it can be an interesting tool to be applied in many real world problems.

In early years of this research, people mainly worked on two types of heterogeneous data (denoted by pair-wise co-clustering); while recently more and more attention was paid to multiple types of heterogeneous data (denoted by high-order co-clustering). In this paper, we studied the high-order co-clustering of objects with star-structured interrelationship, i.e., there is a central type of objects that connects the other types of objects. Actually, this case could be a very good model for many real-world applications, such as the co-clustering of Web images, their low-level visual features, and the surrounding text. We used a tripartite graph to represent the interrelationships among different objects, and proposed a consistent information theory which generates an effective algorithm to obtain the co-clusters of different types of objects. Experiments on a Web image show that our proposed algorithm is a better choice compared with previous work on heterogeneous object co-clustering.

It is now generally believed that amino acid sequences of proteins are not random, and thus the patterns of amino acids that we observe in the protein sequences are also non-random. In this study, we have attempted to decipher the nature of associations between different amino acids that are present in a protein. This very basic analysis provides insights into the co-occurrence of certain amino acids in a protein. Such association rules are desirable for enhancing our understanding of protein composition and hold the potential to give clues regarding the global interactions amongst some particular sets of amino acids occuring in proteins. Presence of strong non-trivial associations suggests further evidence for non-randomness of protein sequences. Knowledge of these rules or constraints is highly desirable for the in-vitro synthesis of artificial proteins.

The traditional approach to the construction of such knowledge bases is manual and therefore extremely time consuming. The ubiquity of the internet now makes large-scale community collaboration for the construction of knowledge bases, such as the successful online encyclopedia "Wikipedia", possible. We propose an extension of this model to the collaborative annotation of molecular data. We argue that a semantic wiki provides the functionality required for this project since this can capitalize on the existing representations in biological ontologies. We discuss the use of a different relationship model than the one provided by RDF and OWL to represent the semantic data. We argue that this leads to a more intuitive and correct way to enter semantic content in the wiki. Furthermore, we show how formal ontologies could be used to increase the usability of the software through type-checking and automatic reasoning.

Understanding this mechanism is an important open problem in data mining. Our new theoretical approach (based on spectral clustering and translational symmetry) explains why the cluster centers of k-means naturally tend to form sinusoidal patterns.

The classification rule mining algorithm based-on ant colony optimization (ACO) is researched in this paper. Some improvements are implemented based on existing research to enhance classification predictive accuracy and simplicity of rules. Multi-population parallel strategy is proposed, the cost-based discretization method is adopted, and parameters in the algorithm are adjusted step by step. With these improvements, performance of the algorithm is advanced, and classification predictive accuracy is enhanced. Finally, SIMiner, a self-development data mining software system based on swarm intelligence, is applied to experiment on six data sets taken from UCI Repository on Machine Learning. The results illuminate the algorithm proposed in this paper has better performance in predictive accuracy and simplicity of rules.

In this paper we present and discuss an inductive reasoning procedure for mining frequent patterns from the knowledge bases represented in OWL DLP. OWL DLP, also known as Description Logic Programs, lies at the intersection of the expressivity of OWL DL and Logic Programming. Our method is based on a special trie data structure inspired by similar, efficient structures used in classical and relational data mining settings. Conjunctive queries to OWL DLP knowledge bases are the language of frequent patterns.

Quantifications of such queries express global properties between datasets, including subset inclusion and disjointness. These operations are basic tools in set-theoretic data-mining procedures such as frequent-itemset-mining. In this work we formalize a family of such queries syntactically and we consider how they can be evaluated in a privacy-preserving fashion. We present a syntax-driven compiler that produces a protocol for each query and we show that semantically such queries correspond to basic set operation predicates between datasets. Using our compiler and based on the fact that it is syntax-driven, two parties can generate various privacy-preserving protocols with different complexity behavior that allow them to efficiently and securely evaluate the predicate of interest without sharing information about the datasets they possess. Our compiler sheds new light on the complexity of privacy-preserving evaluation of predicates such as disjointness and subset-inclusion and achieves substantial complexity improvements compared to previous works in terms of round as well as communication complexity. In particular, among others, we present protocols for both predicates that require one-round of interaction and have communication less than the size of the universe, while previously the only one round protocols known had communication proportional to the size of the universe.

It uses frequent term sets to identify clusters. The approach fails when the number of frequent sets of terms is large. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a method for generating the FIHC's hierarchy of clusters by using only frequent closed sets. The new approach is validated on a number of Cluto package datasets. The experiments prove that our version of FIHC is faster up to two orders of magnitude than the original.

This research makes an attempt to develop a rough sets based model that can capture the essential information from business travelers, a segment of the market that to date has been entirely overlooked by academic researchers in data mining. Utilizing the primary data collected from an Omnibus survey carried out in Hong Kong in late 2005, experimental findings showed that the induced decision rules could classify 82% of the cases in the testing set and 41% of the classified cases were correctly estimated. Most importantly, there was no statistically significant difference between the estimated values and actual values.

The classification of three peach varieties based on near infrared spectra was researched in the practical context. Principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for pattern recognition in this research. PCA is a very effective data mining way; it is applied to enhance species features and reduce data dimensionality. ANN with back propagation algorithm was used for the data compression tasks as well as class discrimination tasks. The first 9 principal components computed by PCA were applied as inputs to a back propagation neural network with one hidden layer. This model was used to predict the varieties of 15 unknown samples. The recognition rate of the model for the unknown sample was 100%. So this paper could offer an effective pattern recognition way.

This paper makes a review of current methods of feature selection and proposes a unified strategy of feature selection, which divides overall procedures of feature selection into two stages, first to determine the FIF (Feature Important Factor) of features according to DM tasks, second to select features according to FIF. For classifying problems, we propose a new method for determining FIF based on decision trees and provide practical suggestion for feature selection. Through analysis on experiments conducted on UCI datasets, such a unified strategy of feature selection is proven to be effective and efficient.

Structural cohesion is defined as the minimum number of terrorists, who if removed from the group, would disconnect the group. We tested bottom-up measures from SNA (cliques, n-cliques, n-clans and k-plex) using dataset of 9-11 terrorist network, and found that Mohamed Atta, who was known as ring leader of the plot, participated maximum number of groups generated by the structural cohesion measures. We discuss the results of recently introduced algorithms for constructing hierarchy of terrorist networks, so that investigators can view the structure of nonhierarchical organizations, in order to destabilize terrorist networks. Based upon the degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and dependence centrality measures, a method is proposed to construct the hierarchical structure of complex networks. It is tested on the September 11, 2001 terrorist network constructed by Valdis Krebs. In addition we also briefly discuss various roles in the network i.e., position role index, which discovers various positions in the network, for example, leaders / brokers and followers.

Despite the vast amount of attention focused on methods for scan detection, the state-of-the-art methods suffer from high rate of false alarms and low rate of scan detection. In this paper, we formalize the problem of scan detection as a data mining problem. We show how the network traffic data sets can be converted into a data set that is appropriate for running off-the-shelf classifiers on. Our method successfully demonstrates that data mining models can encapsulate expert knowledge to create an adaptable algorithm that can substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods for scan detection in both coverage and precision.

A new version of the ant-miner algorithm discovering unordered rule sets	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		ant colony optimization; data mining; classification rules	COLONY; OPTIMIZATION	The Ant-Miner algorithm, first proposed by Parpinelli and colleagues, applies an ant colony optimization heuristic to the classification task of data mining to discover an ordered list of classification rules. In this paper we present a new version of the Ant-Miner algorithm, which we call Unordered Rule Set Ant-Miner, that produces an unordered set of classification rules. The proposed version was evaluated against the original Ant-Miner algorithm in six public-domain datasets and was found to produce comparable results in terms of predictive accuracy. However, the proposed version has the advantage of discovering more modular rules, i.e., rules that can be interpreted independently from other rules - unlike the rules in an ordered list, where the interpretation of a rule requires knowledge of the previous rules in the list. Hence, the proposed version facilitates the interpretation of discovered knowledge, an important point in data mining.

With most of the organizations starting on-line operations, the threat of security breaches is increasing. Since a database stores a lot of valuable information, its security has become paramount. One mechanism to safeguard the information in these databases is to use an intrusion detection system(IDS). In every database, there are a few attributes or columns that are more important to be tracked or sensed for malicious modifications as compared to the other attributes. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm named weighted data dependency rule miner (WDDRM) for finding dependencies among the data items. The transactions that do not follow the extracted data dependency rules are marked as malicious. We show that WDDRM handles the modification of sensitive attributes quite accurately.

There are currently over 500 BRCS registered at the World Data Center for Microorganisms. All of these institutes offer information on their cultures independently and there is no efficient linkage between the biological material and its related data held by information providers such as Genbank, Swissprot and PubMed. As a result, researchers searching for information on microbial strains or species frequently encounter inconsistencies. This paper presents the StrainInfo.net bioportal for integrating the information provided by BRCS and third party information holders. It is shown how intelligent data integration is the best protection against information overkill and is a necessary precursor for more advanced data mining to further exploit the assets of BRCS. To establish a solid service to the research community, the suggested integration is accomplished following the knuckles-and-nodes approach. Initially implemented as a web interface, the underlying system also provides possibilities for setting up web services. The StrainInfo.net bioportal will be made available at http://www.StrainInfo.net.

L_MCAMMO can be divided into two basic steps: first, the most suitable re-segmenting scale is found by MCAMMO, which is a scale space method with mathematical morphology operators; second, the segmented result at this scale is re-segmented to obtain the final linear belts. These steps are essentially a multi-scale binary image segmentation process, and can also be treated as hierarchical clustering if we view the points under each connected component as one cluster. The final number of clusters is the one which survives (relatively, not absolutely) the longest scale range, and the clustering which first realizes this number of clusters is the most suitable segmentation. The advantages of MCAMMO in general and L_MCAMMO in particular, are: no need to pre-specify the number of clusters, a small number of simple inputs, capable of extracting clusters with arbitrary shapes, and robust to noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated by the real-life experiments in the mining of seismic belts in China.

Spatial reasoning ought to play a very important role in spatial data mining, but the research combined SR and SDM are very few. This paper describes the conception and implementation of SRSDM, the tool for data mining in spatial databases based on spatial reasoning method. Most spatial data mining systems only support topological relation, nearly all previous GIS and AI researches focused on single spatial aspect. Those were quite inadequate for practical applications. We propose a new spatial knowledge representation which integrates topology, direction, distance and size relations. SRSDM includes three parts: extracting spatial relations, frameworks for traditional or new data mining algorithms.

We propose in this paper a Scalable Representative Instance Selection And Ranking (SRISTAR pronounced 3STAR) mechanism, which carries two unique features: (1) it provides a representative instance ranking list, so that users can always select instances from the top to the bottom based on the number of examples they prefer; and (2) it investigates the behaviors of the underlying examples for instance selection, and the selection procedure tries to optimize the expected future error. Given a dataset, we first cluster instances into small data cells, each of which consists of instances with similar behaviors. Then we progressively evaluate data cells and their combinations, and order them into a list such that the learners built from the top cells are more accurate..

However, it is not feasible to directly apply SOM for clustering transactional data. This paper proposes the Transactions Clustering using SOM (TCSOM) algorithm for clustering binary transactional data. In the TCSOM algorithm, a normalized Dot Product norm based dissimilarity measure is utilized for measuring the distance between input vector and output neuron. And a modified weight adaptation function is employed for adjusting weights of the winner and its neighbors. More importantly, TCSOM is a one-pass algorithm, which is extremely suitable for data mining applications. Experimental results on real datasets show that TCSOM algorithm is superior to those state-of-the-art transactional data clustering algorithms with respect to clustering accuracy.

J	Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD				Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD			Cost-constrained data acquisition for intelligent data preparation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; intelligent data preparation; data acquisition; cost-sensitive; machine learning; instance ranking	LEARNING ALGORITHMS	Real-world data is noisy and can often suffer from corruptions or incomplete values that may impact the models created from the data. To build accurate predictive models, data acquisition is usually adopted to prepare the data and complete missing values. However, due to the significant cost of doing so and the inherent correlations in the data set, acquiring correct information for all instances is prohibitive and unnecessary. An interesting and important problem that arises here is to select what kinds of instances to complete so the model built from the processed data can receive the "maximum" performance improvement. This problem is complicated by the reality that the costs associated with the attributes are different, and fixing the missing values of some attributes is inherently more expensive than others. Therefore, the problem becomes that given a fixed budget, what kinds of instances should be selected for preparation, so that the learner built from the processed data set can maximize its performance? In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem, and the essential idea is to combine attribute costs and the relevance of each attribute to the target concept, so that the data acquisition can pay more attention to those attributes that are cheap in price but informative for classification. To this end, we will first introduce a unique Economical Factor (EF) that seamlessly integrates the cost and the importance ( in terms of classification) of each attribute. Then, we will propose a cost-constrained data acquisition model, where active learning, missing value prediction, and impact-sensitive instance ranking are combined for effective data acquisition. Experimental results and comparative studies from real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

J	Li, J; Dou, DJ; Wu, Z; Kim, SW; Agarwal, V				Li, J; Dou, DJ; Wu, Z; Kim, SW; Agarwal, V			Public review for an Internet routing forensics framework for discovering rules of abnormal BGP events	COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW			English	Article								Abnormal BGP events such as attacks, misconfigurations, electricity failures, can cause anomalous or pathological routing behavior at either global level or prefix level, and thus must be detected in their early stages. Instead of using ad hoc methods to analyze BGP data, in this paper we introduce an Internet Routing Forensics framework to systematically process BGP routing data, discover rules of abnormal BGP events, and apply these rules to detect the occurrences of these events. In particular, we leverage data mining techniques to train the framework to learn rules of abnormal BGP events, and our results from two case studies show that these rules are effective. In one case study, rules of worm events discovered from the BGP data during the outbreaks of the CodeRed and Nimda worms were able to successfully detect worm impact on BGP when an independent worm, the Slammer, subsequently occurred. Similarly, in another case study, rules of electricity blackout events obtained using BGP data from the 2003 East Coast blackout were able to detect the BGP impact from the Florida blackout caused by Hurricane Frances in 2004.

J	Viswanath, P; Murty, MN; Bhatnagar, S				Viswanath, P; Murty, MN; Bhatnagar, S			Overlap pattern synthesis with an efficient nearest neighbor classifier	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						nearest neighbor classifier; pattern synthesis; compact representation; data mining	ERROR RATE ESTIMATION; BOOTSTRAP	Nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is the most popular non-parametric classifier. It is a simple classifier with no design phase and shows good performance. Important factors affecting the efficiency and performance of NN classifier are (i) memory required to store the training set, (ii) classification time required to search the nearest neighbor of a given test pattern, and (iii) due to the curse of dimensionality the number of training patterns needed by it to achieve a given classification accuracy becomes prohibitively large when the dimensionality of the data is high. In this paper, we propose novel techniques to improve the performance of NN classifier and at the same time to reduce its computational burden. These techniques are broadly based on: (i) overlap based pattern synthesis which can generate a larger number of artificial patterns than the number of input patterns and thus can reduce the curse of dimensionality effect, (ii) a compact representation of the given set of training patterns called overlap pattern graph (OLP-graph) which can be incrementally built by scanning the training set only once and (iii) an efficient NN classifier called OLP-NNC which directly works with OLP-graph and does implicit overlap based pattern synthesis. A comparison based on experimental results is given between some of the relevant classifiers. The proposed schemes are suitable for applications dealing with large and high dimensional datasets like those in data mining. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Active learning algorithms recognize that not all exemplars are created equal. Thus, the concepts of exemplar age and difficulty are used to filter the original data set such that training epochs are only conducted over a small subset of the original data set. The ensuing Hierarchical Dynamic Subset Selection algorithm introduces definitions for exemplar difficulty suitable to an unsupervised learning context and therefore appropriate Self-organizing map (SOM) stopping criteria. The algorithm is benchmarked on several real world data sets with training set exemplar counts in the region of 30-500 thousand. Cluster accuracy is demonstrated to be at least as good as that from the original SOM algorithm while requiring a fraction of the computational overhead.

Existing path- based indexes and query processing algorithms are not efficient for searching complex structures beyond simple paths, even when the queries are high- selective. We introduce the definition of minimal infrequent structures ( MIS), which are structures that 1) exist in the data, 2) are not frequent with respect to a support threshold, and 3) all substructures of them are frequent. By indexing the occurrences of MIS, we can efficiently locate the high- selective substructures of a query, improving search performance significantly. An efficient data mining algorithm is proposed, which finds the minimal infrequent structures. Their occurrences in the XML data are then indexed by a lightweight data structure and used as a fast filter step in query evaluation. We validate the efficiency and applicability of our methods through experimentation on both synthetic and real data.

Short-term load forecasting plays a key role in power system operation and planning. However, it has complicated nonlinear factors due to the weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, etc. In this paper, data mining is used to preprocess input data so that some rules and clustering results are efficiently obtained. After data preprocessing, this paper constructs a fuzzy inference based predictor at each cluster. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of daily maximum load forecasting.

The approaches usually followed in the analysis of geospatial data with the aim of knowledge discovery are essentially characterised by the development of new algorithms, which treat the position and extension of objects mainly through the manipulation of their coordinates. In this paper a new approach to this process is presented, where geographic identifiers give the positional aspects of geographic data. These identifiers are manipulated using qualitative reasoning principles, which allow for the inference of new spatial relations required for the data mining step of the knowledge discovery process. The analysis of a demographic database, with the proposed principles, enabled the discovery of patterns that are hidden in the explored geo-spatial and demographic data.

J	Oh, SJ; Kim, JY				Oh, SJ; Kim, JY			A sequence-element-based hierarchical clustering algorithm for categorical sequence data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						data mining; hierarchical clustering; sequences; similarity measure		Recently, there has been enormous growth in the amount of commercial and scientific data, such as protein sequences, retail transactions, and web-logs. Such datasets consist of sequence data that have an inherent sequential nature. However, few existing clustering algorithms consider sequentiality. In this paper, we study how to cluster these sequence datasets. We propose a new similarity measure to compute the similarity between two sequences. In the proposed measure, subsets of a sequence are considered, and the more identical subsets there are, the more similar the two sequences. In addition, we propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm and an efficient method for measuring similarity. Using a splice dataset and synthetic datasets, we show that the quality of clusters generated by our proposed approach is better than that of clusters produced by traditional clustering algorithms.

J	Becker, K; Ghedini, C				Becker, K; Ghedini, C			A documentation infrastructure for the management of data mining projects	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						knowledge discovery in databases; documentation; organizational memory; project management	COLLABORATIVE APPLICATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; WEB; HYPERMEDIA; RETRIEVAL; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; DESIGN; TOOL	Effective project management is a key factor for successful Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) projects. The systematic documentation of previous knowledge, experiments, data and results is a helpful means of keeping track of the project current status. Despite its value, documentation is most often perceived as an overhead. We propose a documentation infrastructure composed of a documentation model and a supporting environment that allows the capture, storage and retrieval of KDD process-related information and artifacts. The paper describes this infrastructure, and reports preliminary experiences on its use. Preliminary results reveal generalized satisfaction with regard to infrastructure expressiveness and functionality, and highlight the contributions of the documentation produced for improving project management, project execution and team communication. The role of documentation in learning and reuse was also identified. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We analyze in detail the original process of fuzzy hierarchical induction and extend it with two new characteristics which improve applicability of the original approach to scientific data mining. These are a consistency of our fuzzy induction model, and an approximate drilling-down technique allowing a user to retrieve estimated explanations of the generated abstract concept. An application to discovery of multi-level association rules from environmental data stored in a Toxic Release Inventory is presented.

Here we show that this problem can be elegantly and efficiently tackled by meta-clustering the clusters produced in several different runs of the algorithm, especially if "sofy" clustering algorithms (such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) are used both at the object- and the meta-level. The essential difference w.r.t. other meta-clustering approaches consists in the fact that our algorithm detects frequently occurring sub-clusters (rather than complete clusters) in the various runs, which allows it to outperform existing algorithms. Additionally, we show how to per-form two-way meta-clustering, i.e. take both object and sample dimensions of clusters simultaneously into account, a feature which is essential e.g. for biclustering gene expression data, but has not been considered before.

The paper proposes novel methods of perception based time series data mining using perceptual patterns, fuzzy rules and linguistic descriptions. The methods of perception based forecasting using perceptual trends and moving approximation (MAP) transform are discussed. The first method uses perception based function for modeling qualitative forecasting given by expert judgments. The second method uses MAP transform and measure of local trend associations for description of perceptual pattern corresponding to the region of forecasting. Finally, the method of generation of association rules for multivariate time series based on MAP and fuzzy trends is discussed. Multivariate time series are considered as description of system dynamics. In this case association rules can be considered as relationships between system elements additional to spatial, causal etc. relations existing in the system. The proposed methods are illustrated on examples of artificial and real time series.

We describe an approach to addressing this problem that allows individuals to specify constraints on the way their own data is used. Our solution uses formal methods to allow developers of software that processes personal data to provide assurances that the software meets the specified privacy constraints. In the domain of privacy, it is often not sufficient to express properties of interest as a relation between the input and output of a program as is done for general program correctness. Here we consider a stronger class of properties that allows us to express constraints on information flow. In particular, we can express that an algorithm does not leak any information from particular "sensitive" values. We describe a general methodology for expressing this kind of information flow property as Hoare-style program verification judgments. We begin with the Java Modelling Language (JML), which is a behavioral interface specification language designed for Java, and we extend the language to include new concepts and keywords for expressing such properties. We use the Krakatoa tool which starts from JML-annotated Java programs, generates proof obligations in the Coq Proof Assistant, and helps to automate their proofs. We extend the Krakatoa tool to understand our extensions to JML and to generate the new form of required proof obligations.

However, recent research criticized that discovering subsequence patterns in time series using clustering approaches is meaningless. It is due to the presence of trivial matched subsequences in the formation of the time series subsequences using sliding window method. The objective of this paper is to propose a threshold-free approach to improve the method for segmenting long stock time series into subsequences using sliding window. The proposed approach filters the trivial matched subsequences by changing Perceptually Important Point (PIP) detection and reduced the dimension by PIP identification.

CoLe allows for the cooperation of different mining agents and the combination of the mined knowledge into knowledge structures that no individual mining agent can produce alone. CoLe organizes the work in rounds so that knowledge discovered by one mining agent can help others in the next round. We implemented a multi-agent system based on CoLe for mining diabetes data, including an agent using a genetic algorithm for mining event sequences, an agent with improvements to the PART algorithm for our problem and a combination agent with methods to produce hybrid rules containing conjunctive and sequence conditions. In our experiments, the CoLe-based system outperformed the individual mining algorithms, with better rules and more rules of a certain quality. From the medical perspective, our system confirmed hypertension has a tight relation to diabetes, and it also suggested connections new to medical doctors.

The heuristic reduct algorithm is based on frequencies of attributes appeared in discernibility matrix. We also present to add dynamic information about the performances of various data mining tools over specific data sources to the Knowledge Grid service for supporting the estimation. This information can be added as additional metadata stored in Knowledge Metadata Repository of Grid.

In this paper, we present the integration of Association rules and Classification rules using Concept Lattice. This gives more accurate classifiers for Classification. The algorithm used is incremental in nature. Any increase in the number of classes, attributes or transactions does not require the access to the previous database. The incremental behavior is very useful in finding classification rules for real time data such as image processing. The algorithm requires just one database pass through the entire database. Individual classes can have different support threshold and pruning conditions such as criteria for noise and number of conditions in the classifier.

It is observed that the areas of the plot for the two parts of a dichotomy may be used as an aggregate measure of their relative dominance. An optimization model is developed to determine a topology (or weighted configuration of the attributes) that maximizes the resolution of this measure with respect to a given set of reference dichotomies.

Since its conditional independence assumption is rarely true, numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve naive Bayes, among which tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) [3] achieves a significant improvement in term of classification accuracy, while maintaining efficiency and model simplicity. In many real-world data mining applications, however, an accurate ranking is more desirable than a classification. Thus it is interesting whether TAN also achieves significant improvement in term of ranking, measured by AUC(the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) [8, 1]. Unfortunately, our experiments show that TAN performs even worse than naive Bayes in ranking. Responding to this fact, we present a novel learning algorithm, called forest augmented naive Bayes (FAN), by modifying the traditional TAN learning algorithm. We experimentally test our algorithm on all the 36 data sets recommended by Weka [12], and compare it to naive Bayes, SBC [6], TAN [3], and C4.4 [10], in terms of AUC. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms significantly in yielding accurate rankings. Our work provides an effective and efficient data mining algorithm for applications in which an accurate ranking is required.

Evaluating indirect and direct classification techniques for network intrusion detection	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						network intrusion detection; multi-category classifications; binary classifiers; combining strategies; base learners		The network intrusion detection domain has seen increased research that exploit data mining and machine learning techniques and principles. Typically, multi-category classification models are built to classify network traffic instances either as normal or belonging to a specific attack category. While many existing works on data mining in intrusion detection have focused on applying direct classification methods, to our knowledge indirect classification techniques have not been investigated for intrusion detection. In contrast to indirect classification techniques, direct classification techniques generally extend associated binary classifiers to handle multi-category classification problems. An indirect classification technique decomposes (binarization) the original multi-category problem into multiple binary classification problems. The classification technique used to train the set of binary classification problems is called the base classifier. Subsequently, a combining strategy is used to merge the results of the binary classifiers. We investigate two binarization techniques and three combining strategies, yielding six indirect classification methods. This study presents a comprehensive comparative study of five direct classification methods with the thirty indirect classification models ( six indirect classification models for each of the five base classifiers). To our knowledge, there are no existing works that evaluate as many indirect classification techniques and compare them with direct classification methods, particularly for network intrusion detection. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project is used to evaluate the different techniques. It is empirically shown that certain indirect classification techniques yield better network intrusion detection models.

Most personalization systems employ explicitly provided user preferences rather than implicit rating data obtained automatically by collecting users' interactions. In this paper, we show that in complex information systems such as digital libraries, implicit rating data can help to characterize users' research and learning interests, and can be used to cluster users into meaningful groups. Thus, in our personalized recommender system based on collaborative filtering, we employ a user tracking system and a user modeling technique to capture and store users' implicit ratings. Also, we describe the effects (on community finding) of using four different types of implicit rating data.

Contemporary literature illustrates an abundance of adaptive algorithms for mining association rules. However, most literature is unable to deal with the peculiarities, such as missing values and dynamic data creation, that are frequently encountered in fields like medicine. This paper proposes an uncertainty rule method that uses an adaptive threshold for filling missing values in newly added records. A new approach for mining uncertainty rules and filling missing values is proposed, which is in turn particularly suitable for dynamic databases, like the ones used in home care systems. Methods. in this study, a new data mining method named FiMV (Filling Missing Values) is illustrated based on the mined uncertainty rules. Uncertainty rules have quite a similar structure to association rules and are extracted by an algorithm proposed in previous work, namely AURG (Adaptive Uncertainty Rule Generation). The main target was to implement an appropriate method for recovering missing values in a dynamic database, where new records are continuously added, without needing to specify any kind of thresholds beforehand. Results: The method was applied to a home care monitoring system database. Randomly, multiple missing values for each record's attributes (rate 5-20% by 5% increments) were introduced in the initial dataset. FiMV demonstrated 100% completion rates with over 90% success in each case, while usual approaches, where all records with missing values are ignored or thresholds are required, experienced significantly reduced completion and success rates. Conclusions: It is concluded that the proposed method is appropriate for the data-cleaning step of the Knowledge Discovery process in databases. The latter, containing much significance for the output efficiency of any data mining technique, can improve the quality of the mined information.

The proposed approach involves statistics, data partitioning, parameter reduction, and data mining. The proposed approach was tested on a 750 MW commercial coal-fired boiler affected with a fouling problem that leads to boiler pluggage that causes unscheduled shutdowns. The rare-event detection approach presented in the paper identified several critical time-based data segments that are indicative of the ash pluggage.

We propose three related slope one schemes with predictors of the form f(x) = x + b, which precompute the average: difference between the ratings of one item and another for users who rated both. Slope one algorithms are easy to implement, efficient to query, reasonably accurate, and they support both online queries and dynamic updates, which makes them good candidates for real-world systems. The basic SLOPE ONE scheme is suggested as a new reference scheme for collaborative filtering. By factoring in items that a user liked separately from items that a user disliked, we achieve results competitive with slower memory-based schemes over the standard benchmark Each Movie and Movielens data sets while better fulfilling the desiderata of CF applications.

Moreover, most clustering algorithms consider the contribution of each sample for classification uniformly. In fact, different samples should be of different contribution for clustering result. For this purpose, a novel typical-sample-weighted clustering algorithm is proposed for large data sets. By the atom clustering, the new algorithm extracts the typical samples to reduce the data amount. Then the extracted samples are weighted by their corresponding typicality and then clustered by the classical fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. Finally, the Mahalanobis distance is employed to classify each original sample into obtained clusters. It is obvious that the novel algorithm can improve the speed and robustness of the traditional FCM algorithm. The experimental results with various test data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important detection that is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity and system availability from attacks. Data mining is being used to clean, classify, and examine large amount of network data to correlate common infringement for intrusion detection. The main reason for using Data Mining Techniques for Intrusion Detection Systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. The amount of data accumulated each day by a network is huge. Several Data Mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rules are proving to be useful for gathering different knowledge for Intrusion Detection. This paper presents the idea of applying data mining techniques to intrusion detection systems to maximize the effectiveness in identifying attacks, thereby helping the users to construct more secure information systems.

Rough sets promise to open up an important dimension in this direction. The present article surveys the role of artificial neural networks, fuzzy sets and genetic algorithms, with particular emphasis on rough sets, in Bioinformatics. Since the work entails processing huge amounts of incomplete or ambiguous biological data, the knowledge reduction capability of rough sets, learning ability of neural networks, uncertainty handling capacity of fuzzy sets and searching potential of genetic algorithms are synergistically utilized.

However, the dynamical algorithm of the CHSOM is sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers, and the model will no longer preserve the topology of the data space as we will show in this paper. The outliers introduce an influence to the GHSOM model during the training process by locating prototypes far from the majority of data and generating maps for few samples data. Therefore, the network will not effectively represent the topological structure of the data under study. In this paper, we propose a variant to the GHSOM algorithm that is robust under the presence of outliers in the data by being resistant to these deviations. We call this algorithm Robust GHSOM (RGHSOM). We will illustrate our technique on synthetic and real data sets.

A further improvement could be achieved by combining the best suited NN-based data mining techniques with a mechanism we call "execution chain evaluation". This means that disassembled instruction chains axe processed by the NN in order to detect malicious code. The proposed detection engine was trained and tested in various ways. Examples were taken from all publicly available polymorphic shellcode engines as well as from self-designed engines. A prototype implementation of our sensor has been realized and integrated as a plug-in into the SNORT (TM) [13] intrusion detection system.

This newly suggested model uses association rule mining to generate classification rules associating observed features with class labels. Given the binary nature of association rules, these classification models do not take into account repetition of features when categorizing. In this paper, we enhance the idea of associative classifiers with associations with re-occurring items and show that this mixture produces a good model for classification when repetition of observed features is relevant in the data mining application at hand.

Today this kind of activities is implemented through e-services to directly involve customers into business processes. Traditionally Customer Service Management involves application of data mining techniques to discover usage patterns from the company knowledge memory. Hence grouping of customers/requests to clusters is one of major technique to improve the level of company customization. The goal of this paper is to present an efficient for implementation approach for clustering users and their requests. The approach uses ontology as knowledge representation model to improve the semantic interoperability between units of the company and customers.

Collaborative filtering is the most popular technique in implementing a recommender system. Association rule mining is a powerful data mining method to search for interesting relationships between items by finding the items frequently appeared together in a transaction database. In this paper, we apply quantitative association rules to mining the relationships between items, and then utilize the relationships between items to alleviate the data sparsity problem in the neighborhood-based algorithms. The proposed method considers not only similarities between users, but also similarities between items. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that our algorithm outperforms the conventional Pearson method and adjusted cosine method.

Association rule mining is a powerful analysis tool to extract the useful meanings and associations from large databases and many automated systems have been developed for mining association rules. However, most of these systems usually mine many association rules from large databases and it is not easy for a user to extract meaningful rules. Visualization has become an important tool in the data mining process for extracting meaningful knowledge and information from large data sets. Though there are several techniques for visualizing mined association rules, most of these techniques visualize the entire set of discovered association rules on a single screen. Such a dense display can overwhelm analysts and reduce their capability of interpretation. In this paper we present a novel technique called VisAR for visualizing mined association rules. VisAR consists of four major stages for visualizing mined association rules. These stages include managing association rules, filtering association rules of interest, visualizing selected association rules, and interacting with the visualization process. Our technique allows an analyst to view only a particular subset of association rules which contain selected items of interest. VisAR is able to display not only many-to-one but also many-to-many association rules. Moreover, our technique can overcome problems of screen clutter and occlusion.

A number of related methods have been proposed based on the well-known learning models like decision tree or neural network. However, these kinds of classification methods may not perform well in mining time sequence datasets like time-series gene expression data. In this paper, we propose a new data mining method, namely Classifr-By-Sequence (CBS), for classifying large time-series datasets. The main methodology of CBS method is to integrate the sequential pattern mining with the probabilistic induction such that the inherent sequential patterns can be extracted efficiently and the classification task be done more accurately. Meanwhile, CBS method has the merit of simplicity in implementation. Through experimental evaluation, the CBS method is shown to outperform other methods greatly in the classification accuracy.

The discovery from these rules requires deep interpretation from domain knowledge. Although several solutions have been proposed in the studies on data mining and knowledge discovery, these studies are not focused on similarities between rules obtained. When one rule r(1) has reasonable features and the other rule r(2) with high similarity to r(1) includes unexpected factors, the relations between these rules will become a trigger to the discovery of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach to show the similar and dissimilar relations between rules based on multidimensional scaling, which assign a two-dimensional cartesian coordinate to each data point from the information about similiaries between this data and others data. We evaluated this method on two medical data sets, whose experimental results show that knowledge useful for domain experts could be found.

The IBM Almaden synthetic data generator has been commonly used for performance evaluation. One recent work shows that the data generated is not good enough for benchmarking as it has very different characteristics from real-world data sets. Hence there is a great need to use real-world data sets as benchmarks. However, organizations hesitate to provide their data due to privacy concerns. Recent work on privacy preserving association rule mining addresses this issue by modifying real data sets to hide sensitive or private rules. However, modifying individual values in read data may impact on other, non-sensitive rules. In this paper, we propose a feasible solution to the NP-complete problem of inverse frequent set mining. Since solving this problem by linear programming techniques is very computationally prohibitive, we apply graph-theoretical results to divide the original iternsets into components that preserve maximum Likelihood estimation. We then use iterative proportional fitting method to each component. The technique is experimentally evaluated with two real data sets and one synthetic data set. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient for reconstructing market basket data set from a given set of frequent itemsets while preserving sensitive information.

Our focus is data sharing among parties involved in a data mining task. We study how to share private or confidential data in the following scenario: multiple parties, each having a private data set, want to collaboratively conduct association rule mining without disclosing their private data to each other or any other parties. To tackle this demanding problem, we develop a secure protocol for multiple parties to conduct the desired computation. The solution is distributed, i.e., there is no central, trusted party having access to all the data. Instead, we define a protocol using homomorphic encryption techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private.

In this paper, we combine the two strategies of data transform and data hiding to propose a new randomization method, Randomized Response with Partial Hiding (RRPH), for distorting the original data. Then, an effective naive Bayes classifier is presented to predict the class labels for unknown samples according to the distorted data by RRPH. Shown in the analytical and experimental results, our method can obtain significant improvements in terms of privacy, accuracy, and applicability.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to accomplish the conceptual design of data warehouses together with data mining association rules, allowing us to implement the association rules defined in the conceptual modeling phase. The great advantage of our approach is that the association rules are specified from the early stages of a data warehouse project and based on the main final user requirements and data warehouse goals, instead of specifying them on the final database implementation structures such as tables, rows or columns. Finally, to show the benefit of our approach we implement the specified association rules on a commercial data warehouse management server.

J	Oh, SH; Lee, WS				Oh, SH; Lee, WS			A clustering-based anomaly intrusion detector for a host computer	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						intrusion detection; anomaly detection; data mining; clustering; user profiling		For detecting the anomalous behavior of a user effectively, most researches have concentrated on statistical techniques. However, since statistical techniques mainly analyze the average behavior of a user's activities, some anomalies can be detected inaccurately. In addition, it is difficult to model intermittent activities performed periodically. In order to model the normal behavior of a user closely, a set of various features can be employed. Given an activity of a user, the values of those features that are related to the activity represent the behavior of the activity. Furthermore, activities performed in a session of a user can be regarded as a semantically atomic transaction. Although it is possible to apply clustering technique to these values to extract the normal behavior of a user, most of conventional clustering algorithms do not consider any transactional boundary in a data set. In this paper, a transaction-based clustering algorithm for modeling the normal behavior of a user is proposed. Based on the activities of the past transactions, a set of clusters for each feature can be found to represent the normal behavior of a user as a concise profile. As a result, any anomalous behavior in an online transaction of the user can be effectively detected based on the profile of the user.

Often the data is noisy and even approximate classification is of extreme importance. The difficulty of such classification stems from the fact that usually the data has many incomparable attributes, and often results in the question of clustering problems in high dimensional spaces. Since they require measuring distance between every pair of data points, standard algorithms for computing the exact clustering solutions use quadratic or "nearly quadratic" running time; i.e., O(dn(2-alpha(d))) time where n is the number of data points, d is the dimension of the space and a(d) approaches 0 as d grows. In this paper, we show (for three fairly natural clustering rules) that computing an approximate solution can be done much more efficiently. More specifically, for agglomerative clustering (used, for example, in the Alta Vista(TM) search engine), for the clustering defined by sparse partitions, and for a clustering based on minimum spanning trees we derive randomized (1+epsilon) approximation algorithms with running times (O) over tilde (d(2)n(2-gamma))where gamma > 0 depends only on the approximation parameter epsilon and is independent of the dimension d.

J	Nanopoulos, A; Manolopoulos, Y				Nanopoulos, A; Manolopoulos, Y			Memory-adative association rules mining	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						association rules; memory fluctuations; resource management; data mining		New application areas resulted in an increase of the diversity of the workloads that Data Base Management Systems have to confront. Resource management for mixed workloads is attained with the prioritization of their tasks, which during their execution may be forced to release some of their resources. In this paper, we consider workloads that consist of mixtures of OLTP transactions and association rule mining queries. We propose and evaluate a new scheme for memory-adaptive association rule mining. It is designed to be used in the case of memory fluctuations, which are due to OLTP transactions that run with higher priority. The proposed scheme uses dynamic adjustment to the provided buffer space. Thus, it avoids the drawbacks of simple but naive approaches; namely the thrashing due to large disk accesses that can be caused by the direct use of virtual memory or long delay times due to suspension. Detailed experimental results, which consider a wide range of factors, indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SVC leads to the optimal hyperplane (maximal margin) criterion for separable datasets but, in the nonseparable case, the SVC minimizes the L-1 norm of the training errors plus a regularizing term, to control the machine complexity. The L-1 norm is chosen because it allows to solve the minimization with a Quadratic Programming (QP) scheme, as in the separable case. But the L-1 norm is not truly an "error counting" term as the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) inductive principle indicates, leading therefore to a biased solution. This effect is specially severe in low complexity machines, such as linear classifiers or machines with few nodes (neurons, kernels, basis functions). Since one of the main goals in data mining is that of explanation, these reduced architectures are of great interest because they represent the origins of other techniques such as input selection or rule extraction. Training SVMs as accurately as possible in these situations (i.e., without this bias) is, therefore, an interesting goal. We propose here an unbiased implementation of SVC by introducing a more appropriate "error counting" term. This way, the number of classification errors is truly minimized, while the maximal margin solution is obtained in the separable case. QP can no longer be used for solving the new minimization problem, and we apply instead an iterated Weighted Least Squares (WLS) procedure. This modification in the cost function of the Support Vector Machine to solve ERM was not possible up to date given the Quadratic or Linear Programming techniques commonly used, but it is now possible using the iterated WLS formulation. Computer experiments show that the proposed method is superior to the classical approach in the sense that it truly solves the ERM problem.

This network meets data mining requirements such as smart architecture, user interaction, and performance. The evolving neural network has a smart architecture in that it is able to select inputs from the environment and controls its topology. A built-in objective function of the network offers user interaction for customized classification. The bagging technique, which uses a portion of the training set in multiple networks, is applied to the ensemble of evolving neural networks in order to improve classification performance. The ensemble of evolving neural networks is tested by various data sets and produces better performance than both classical neural networks and simple ensemble methods.

The advantages of the SOMs are that they preserve the topology of the data space, they project high dimensional data to a lower dimension representation scheme, and are able to find similarities in the data. However, the learning algorithm of the SOM is sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers as we will show in this paper. Due to the influence of the outliers in the learning process, some neurons (prototypes) of the ordered map get located far from the majority of data, and therefore, the network will not effectively represent the topological structure of the data under study. In this paper, we propose a variant to the learning algorithm that is robust under the presence of outliers in the data by being resistant to these deviations. We call this algorithm Robust SOM (RSOM). We will illustrate our technique on synthetic and real data sets.

Its idea stems from the work of phylogeneticists of the Societe Francaise de Systematique and proposes to test an innovative method for inferring phylogenetic classifications. The main idea in Phylsyst is to represent the reasoning of an expert phylogeneticist constructing a cladogram following Hermig principles. Several methods of artificial intelligence concur to Phylsyst's efficient implementation of a phylogeneticist expert reasoning, the main one being data mining. Although phylogenetic tree mining has been little addressed in the data mining community, we hypothesize that this community has much to contribute to the worldwide efforts worldwide to Assemble the Tree Of Life.

Our approach integrates novel statistical modelling procedures based on an information-theoretic measure of complexity. We form a three-way hybrid between: information measures of complexity, multiple regression models, and genetic algorithms (GAs). We demonstrate our new approach using a simulated example and on a real data set to illustrate the versatility and the utility of the new approach.

The aim of such linkages is to merge all records relating to the same entity, such as a patient or a customer. If no common unique entity identifiers (keys) are available in all data sources, the linkage needs to be performed using the available identifying attributes, like names and addresses. Data confidentiality often limits or even prohibits successful data linkage, as either no consent can be gained (for example in biomedical studies) or the data holders are not willing to release their data for linkage by other parties. We present methods for confidential data linkage based on hash encoding, public key encryption and n-gram similarity comparison techniques, and show how blind data linkage can be performed.

A promising approach for mining such biological sequence data is mining frequent subsequences. One way to limit the number of patterns discovered is to determine only the most specific frequent subsequences which subsume a large number of more general patterns. In the biological domain, a wealth of knowledge on the relationships between the symbols of the underlying alphabets (in particular, amino acids) of the sequences has been acquired, which can be represented in concept graphs. Using such concept graphs, much longer frequent patterns can be discovered which are more meaningful from a biological point of view. In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining most specific frequent patterns in biological data in the presence of concept graphs. While the well-known methods for frequent sequence mining typically follow the paradigm of bottom-up pattern generation, we present a novel top-down method (ToMMS) for mining such patterns. ToMMS (1) always generates more specific patterns before more general ones and (2) performs only minimal generalizations of infrequent candidate sequences. Due to these properties, the number of patterns generated and tested is minimized. Our experimental results demonstrate that ToMMS clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the bioinformatics community as well as from the data mining community for reasonably low minimum support thresholds.

The algorithms are by nature probabilistic and based on hashing. They exploit properties of simple discrete probabilistic models and their design is tightly coupled with their analysis, itself often founded on methods from analytic combinatorics. Singularly efficient solutions have been found that defy information theoretic lower bounds applicable to deterministic algorithms. Characteristics like the total number of elements, cardinality (the number of distinct elements), frequency moments, as well as unbiased samples can be gathered with little loss-of information and only a small probability of failure. The algorithms are applicable to traffic monitoring in networks, to data base query optimization. and to some of the basic tasks of data mining. They apply to massive data streams and in many cases require strictly minimal auxiliary storage.

This paper exploits the fact that the decisions from a non-linear SVM could be decoded into linguistic rules based on the information provided by support vectors and its decision function. Given a support vector of a certain class, cross points between each line, which is extended from the support vector along each axis, and SVM decision hyper-curve are searched first. A hyper-rectangular rule is derived from these cross points. The hyper-rectangle is tuned by a tuning phase in order to exclude those out-class data points. Finally, redundant rules are merged to produce a compact rule set. Simultaneously, important attributes could be highlighted in the extracted rules. Rule extraction results from our proposed method could follow decisions of SVM classifiers very well. Comparisons between our method and other rule extraction methods are also carried out on several benchmark data sets. Higher rule accuracy is obtained in our method with fewer number of premises in each rule.

Our main objective was to compare two discretization techniques, both based on cluster analysis, with a new rule induction algorithm called MLEM2, in which discretization is performed simultaneously with rule induction. The MLEM2 algorithm is an extension of the existing LEM2 rule induction algorithm, working correctly only for symbolic attributes and being a part of the LERS data mining system. For the two strategies, based on cluster analysis, rules were induced by the LEM2 algorithm. Our results show that MLEM2 outperformed both strategies based on cluster analysis and LEM2, in terms of complexity (size of rule sets and the total number of conditions) and, more importantly, in terms of error rates.

Automated signal generation aims to focus the attention of experts on drug - adverse event associations which are disproportionally present in the database. Although adverse events are coded by means of controlled vocabularies such as the MedDRA dictionary, this semantic information is not taken into account for signal generation. Objective: To improve the performance of current signal detection algorithms using knowledge based approach. Method: We developed a formal ontology of ADRs and built a data mining tool that uses description logic representations of MedDRA terms to group medically related case reports. Results: This knowledge based approach increased the sensitivity of signal detection with no decrease in specificity. Discussion: A knowledge based approach improved the performance of signal detection tools. However, the huge workload involved in the knowledge engineering step limits the use of this approach for machine learning.

We describe a graphical visualization tool, VOPlot, which can be interfaced with data in VOTable format to form a valuable aid in scientific discovery. The VOPlot toolkit, developed by us, is available as either a stand-alone tool or as a web-based applet fully integrated with the VizieR catalogue service. The VOPlot tool is very versatile, and can be used to perform a number of graphical tasks and simple statistical estimations. VOPlot can produce output in postscript and VOTable formats and can be easily integrated with packages that require visualization support. It has full two-way communication with Aladin, and has been adopted in packages like LEDAS. We describe VOPlot and recent enhancements to it, and demonstrate its usefulness in science applications. This paper provides a brief description of VOPlot. The toolkit was developed by Persistent Systems(1) and IUCAA(2) in collaboration with CDS, Strasbourg as part of the Virtual Observatory India initiative.

We utilized Rosetta, a public domain implementation of rough sets on the PIDD in order to determine how we could generate a predictive rule set with the highest accuracy and the fewest number of rules. Having a reduced rule set is advantageous as it provides focus on the salient attributes and makes application in clinical practice more efficient (and likely). In this paper, we report the use of a genetic algorithm based rough set approach to classification of diabetes and achieved a success rate on the test set of 83%. This classification accuracy favors highly compared to other, reported results, which ranged from 65% to 75%. In addition, we were able to achieve this accuracy with less than 100 rules. The high accuracy and low rule number provides support to the use of rough sets as a datamining tool in biological databases.

It defines a hierarchical temporal rule language to express complex patterns present in multivariate time series. The Temporal Data Mining Method is the accompanying framework to discover temporal knowledge based on this rule language. A semiotic hierarchy of temporal patterns, which are not a priori given, is built in a bottom up manner from static logical descriptions of multivariate time instants. We demonstrate the methods using music data, extracting typical parts of songs.

Various perspectives of multi-objective design information support a constantly improving understanding of both subjective and quantitative relationships between variables and objectives. This information emerges from cluster-oriented genetic algorithm (COGA) output and is further defined by appropriate data mining, processing and visualization techniques. The intention is to support implicit learning and reduce complexity through the presentation of differing perspectives relating to solution / objective interaction and dependencies. It is proposed that the developing systems could support intuitional understanding of the problem domain. Further proposed agent-based support and interactive elements for the various processes are also introduced.

However, they have high computational demands. In order to alleviate this, parallel evolutionary algorithms have been developed. Unfortunately, the implementation of parallel evolutionary algorithms can be complicated, and often requires specific hardware and software environments. This frequently results in very problem-specific parallel evolutionary algorithms with lit-tie scope for reuse. This paper investigates the use of the JavaSpaces technology to overcome these problems. This technology is free of charge, simplifies the implementation of parallel/distributed applications, and is independent of hardware and software environments. Several approaches for the implementation of different parallel evolutionary algorithms using JavaSpaces are proposed and successfully tested.

Various techniques currently exist for graph matching of data structures such as the Adjacency Matrix or Algebraic Representation of Graphs. The Graph Representation can be easily converted to a string representation. Both Graph and String Representations miss semantic relationships that exist in the data. These relationships can be captured by using semi-structured XML as a representation format. We already have an approach to integrate different data formats into a Unified Database. The technique is successfully applied to diverse Protein Databases in a Bioinformatics Domain. An XML representation of this comprehensive database preserving order and semantic relationships is already generated. In this paper we propose an approach to a Semantic Protein Map (PMAP) by building a shared ontology on our structured database model.

The first is the extension from a propositional representation to datalog, and the second is the condensed representation of frequent itemsets by means of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). We combine the notion of frequent datalog queries with iceberg concept lattices (also called closed itemsets) of FCA and introduce two kinds of iceberg query lattices as condensed representations of frequent datalog queries. We demonstrate that iceberg query lattices provide a natural way to visualize relational association rules in a non-redundant way.

In this paper, we introduce the Universal RED problem model, or UniRED, which transforms the discrete attributes reduction problems on Boolean space into continuous global optimization problems on real space. Based on this transformation, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm RED2.1 for attributes reduction problems. In order to examine the efficiency of our algorithms, we conduct the comparison between our algorithm RED2.1 and other reduction algorithms on some problems from UCI repository. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of our algorithm.

Such documents are called tree-structured documents. Many tree-structured documents contain large plain texts. In order to extract structural features among words from tree-structured documents, we consider the problem of finding frequent structured patterns among words in tree-structured documents. Let k greater than or equal to 2 be an integer and (W-1, W-2,..., W-k) a list of words which are sorted in lexicographical order. A consecutive path pattern on (W-1, W-2, ..., W-k) is a sequence <t(1); t(2);...; t(k-1)> of labeled rooted ordered trees such that, for i = 1, 2,..., k - 1, (1) t(i) consists of only one node having the pair (W-i, Wi+1) as its label, or (2) t(i) has just two nodes whose degrees are one and which are labeled with W-i and Wi+1, respectively. We present a data mining algorithm for finding all frequent consecutive path patterns in tree-structured documents. Then, by reporting experimental results on our algorithm, we show that our algorithm is efficient for extracting structural features from tree-structured documents.

Here, the structure of the data is just as important as its content. When data contains large amount of different labels, both fully labeled and partially labeled data may be useful. More informative patterns can be found in the database if some of the pattern nodes can be regarded as 'unlabeled'. We study the problem of discovering typical fully and partially labeled patterns of graph data. Discovered patterns are useful in many applications, including: compact representation of source information and a road-map for browsing and querying information sources.

It has been applied in a variety of fields such as data mining, pattern recognition or process control. It is significant to find high performance algorithms for attribute reduction. Most of presented algorithms were incomplete and the work on complete algorithms was comparatively little. This paper presented a complete algorithm based on the principle of discernibility matrix and discussed the time complexity of the algorithm. The proof of the completeness of the algorithm was also given in the paper. Finally, the validity of the algorithm was demonstrated by two classical databases in the UCI repository.

Feature selection is used to improve the performance of data mining algorithms by removing the irrelevant and redundant features. By positional cross-identification, the multi-wavelength data of 1656 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 3718 stars, and 173 galaxies are obtained from optical (USNO-A2.0), X-ray (ROSAT), and infrared (Two Micron All- Sky Survey) bands. In this paper we applied a kind of filter approach named ReliefF to select features from the multi-wavelength data. Then we put forward the naive Bayes classifier to classify the objects with the feature subsets and compare the results with and without feature selection, and those with and without adding weight to features. The result shows that the naive Bayes classifier based on ReliefF algorithms is robust and efficient to preselect AGN candidates.

The algorithm changes the computing method of the support and confidence in association rules mining by adding query structure and attribute relations to the computation. Since there is no causal relationship in the access of attributes in queries, the method is more appropriate to describe user query behaviors than itemsets used by association rules. The method can be used in database intrusion detection system to prevent database from illegal intrusions effectively. Realization, performance and application of the algorithm are discussed in the paper.

In this paper, the "rough set theory" is intensively researched and a concept of extended discernibility matrix is introduced, which makes use of an algorithm "ROUSTIDA" to analyze incomplete data, which is based on "rough set theory". The advantage of this algorithm is that, it uses only the information given by the processed data and does not rely on other model assumptions. Experimental result shows this algorithm is efficient, comprehensible and adoptable for a pre-processing step before a data-mining method is employed.

J	Ho, TB; Nguyen, TD; Shimodaira, H; Kimura, M				Ho, TB; Nguyen, TD; Shimodaira, H; Kimura, M			A knowledge discovery system with support for model selection and visualization	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						KDD; model selection; visualization; user's participation		The process of knowledge discovery in databases consists of several steps that are iterative and interactive. In each application, to go through this process the user has to exploit different algorithms and their settings that usually yield multiple models. Model selection, that is, the selection of appropriate models or algorithms to achieve such models, requires meta-knowledge of algorithm/model and model performance metrics. Therefore, model selection is usually a difficult task for the user. We believe that simplifying the process of model selection for the user is crucial to the success of real-life knowledge discovery activities. As opposed to most related work that aims to automate model selection, in our view model selection is a semiautomatic process, requiring an effective collaboration between the user and the discovery system. For such a collaboration, our solution is to give the user the ability to try various alternatives and to compare competing models quantitatively by performance metrics, and qualitatively by effective visualization. This paper presents our research on model selection and visualization in the development of a knowledge discovery system called D2MS. The paper addresses the motivation of model selection in knowledge discovery and related work, gives an overview of D2MS, and describes its solution to model selection and visualization. It then presents the usefulness of D2MS model selection in two case studies of discovering medical knowledge in hospital data - on meningitis and stomach cancer - using three data mining methods of decision trees, conceptual clustering, and rule induction.

Traditional data-mining strategies obtain necessary data from internal and external data sources and pool all the data into a huge homogeneous dataset for discovery. In contrast, our data-mining strategy identifies quality data from (internal and external) data sources for a mining task. A framework is advocated for generating quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that application of this new data collecting technique can not only identify quality data, but can also efficiently reduce the amount of data that must be considered during mining.

J	Chang, BCH; Halgamuge, SK				Chang, BCH; Halgamuge, SK			Approximate symbolic pattern matching for protein sequence data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						sequence pattern matching; approximate sequence matching; protein sequences; fuzzy; data mining	MOTIF	In protein sequences, often two sequences that share similar substrings have similar functional properties. Learning of the characteristics and properties of an unknown protein is much easier if its likely functional properties can be predicted by finding the substrings already known from other protein sequences. The sequence pattern search algorithm proposed in this paper searches for similar matches between a pattern and a sequence by using fuzzy logic and calculates the degree of similarity from a sequence inference step. Proteins from 11 domain families are used for simulation and the result shows that the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying sequences that have a similar pattern compared to their family protein motifs.

Using our approach, the effort spent on data mining can be drastically reduced while the knowledge extracted from the data is kept up to date. Our methodology is based on a temporal representation for patterns, in which both the content and the statistics of a pattern are modeled. We divide the KDD process into two phases. In the first phase, data from the first period is mined and interesting rules and patterns are identified. In the second phase, using the data from subsequent periods, statistics of these rules are extracted in order to decide whether or not they still hold. We applied this technique in a case study on mining mail log data. Our results show that a minimal set of patterns reflecting the invariant properties of the dataset can be identified, and that interesting changes to the population can be recognized indirectly by monitoring a subset of the patterns found in the first phase.

While simple statistical summaries are computed to assess basic outcomes, Intelligent Data Analysis and Temporal Data mining techniques are applied to gain insight and to discover knowledge on the causes of unsatisfactory clinical results. In particular, different techniques, comprising multi-scale filtering, Temporal Abstractions, association rules discovery and subgroup discovery are applied on the time series. The paper describes the application domain, the basic goals of the project and the methodological approach applied for time series data analysis. The current results of the project, obtained on the data coming from more than 2500 dialysis sessions of 33 patients monitored for seven months, are also shown.

Normalisation and validity aggregation strategies are proposed to improve the prediction of the number of relevant clusters. The effect of different intracluster and intercluster distances on this prediction process is studied. This approach is applied to a publicly released medulloblastomas tumour data set. The results suggest that it may represent an effective tool to support biomedical knowledge discovery tasks based on gene expression data.

However, almost all of these methods are based on the assumption that the objects under consideration are represented in terms of feature vectors, or collections of attribute values. In the present paper we argue that symbolic representations, such as strings, trees or graphs, have a representational power that is significantly higher than the representational power of feature vectors. On the other hand, operations on these data structure that are typically needed in data mining and machine learning are more involved than their counterparts on feature vectors. However, recent progress in graph matching and related areas has led to many new practical methods that seem to be very promising for a wide range of applications.

We feel that the systems should be able to generate links dynamically using a mapping mechanism to generate the hypermedia constructs instead of the links being hard-coded. This paper provides a systematic procedure for analyzing IS and building mapping rules to supplement them with a rich layer of links and other navigation, structuring, and annotation tools, resulting in new ways to view and manage knowledge and information relationships.

In previous research, heuristic methods (Genetic algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search) have been used to optimise a single measure of interest. This paper proposes the use of multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithms to allow the user to interactively select a number of interest measures and deliver the best nuggets (an approximation to the Pareto-optimal set) according to those measures. Initial experiments are conducted on a number of databases, using an implementation of the Fast Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA), and two well known measures of interest. Comparisons with the results obtained using modern heuristic methods are presented. Results indicate the potential of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for the task of nugget discovery.

Our universe of discourse is concerned with the data mining techniques of data warehouses revealing the importance of multivariate structures of social-economic data which influence criminality. Distinct tasks require different data structures and various data mining exercises in data warehouses. The proposed problem solution strategy allows choosing an appropriate method in recognition processes. The ensembles of diverse and accurate classifiers are constructed on the base of multidimensional classification and clusterisation methods. Factor analysis is introduced into data mining process for revealing influencing impacts of factors. The temporal nature and multidimensionality of the target object is revealed in dynamic model using multidimension regression estimates. The paper describes the strategy of integrating the methods of multiple statistical analysis in cases, where a great set of variables is observed in short time period. The demonstration of the data analysis strategy is performed using real social and economic development of data warehouses in different regions of Lithuania.

However, this knowledge discovery, problem is complicated by several challenges, such as excessive noise in the data, data that does not naturally exist as transactions, a need to operate in real time, and a domain where frequency may not be the best discriminator. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining technique that addresses these challenges and discovers regularly-occurring interactions with a smart home. We also discuss a case study that shows the data mining technique can improve the accuracy of two prediction algorithms, thus demonstrating multiple uses for a home automation system. Finally, we present an analysis of the algorithm and results obtained using inhabitant interactions.

Currently, most of the works focus on independent data, such as the items in the marketing basket. However, the objects in the real world often have close relationship with each other. How to extract frequent patterns from these relations is the objective in this paper. We use graphs to model the relations, and select a simple type for analysis. Combining the graph theory and algorithms to generate frequent patterns, a new algorithm Topology, which can mine these graphs efficiently, has been proposed. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by doing experiments with synthetic datasets and real data. The experimental results show that Topology can do the job well. At the end of this paper, the potential improvement is mentioned.

A graph is a general model to represent data and has been used in many domains like cheminformatics and bioinformatics. Mining patterns from graph databases is challenging since graph related operations, such as subgraph testing, generally have higher time complexity than the corresponding operations on itemsets, sequences, and trees, which have been studied extensively. In this paper we propose a novel frequent subgraph mining algorithm: FFSM, which employs a vertical search scheme within an algebraic graph framework we have developed to reduce the number of redundant candidates proposed. Our empirical study on synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that FFSM achieves a substantial performance gain over the current start-of-the-art subgraph mining algorithm gSpan.

In recent years, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply AUC, has been proposed as an alternative single-number measure for evaluating performance of learning algorithms. In our previous work, we proved that AUC is, in general, a better measure (defined precisely) than accuracy. Many popular data mining algorithms should then be re-evaluated in terms of AUC. For example, it is well accepted that Naive Bayes and decision trees are very similar in accuracy. How do they compare in AUC? Also, how does the recently developed SVM (Support Vector Machine) compare to traditional learning algorithms in accuracy and AUC? We will answer these questions in this paper Our conclusions will provide important guidelines in data mining applications on real-world datasets.

In this paper, we revisit this problem, with a new goal, i.e. Can we develop an efficient parallel algorithm Jor decision tree construction that can be parallelized in the same way as algorithms Jor other major mining tasks ?. We report a new approach to decision tree construction, which we refer to as SPIES (Statistical Pruning of Intervals for Enhanced Scalability). This approach combines RainForest based AVC groups with sampling to achieve memory efficient processing of numerical attributes. Overall, this algorithm has the following properties: 1) no preprocessing or sorting of input data is required, 2) the size of the data-structure required in the main memory is very small, 3) the only disk-traffic required is one pass for splitting nodes for each level of the tree, and no writing-back of data, 4) very low communication volume when this algorithm is parallelized, and 5) the same level of accuracy as an algorithm that does not use sampling or pruning. We show that this algorithm can be efficiently parallelized using the same high-level interface and runtime support that was previously used to parallelize association mining and clustering algorithms. This, we believe, is an important step towards offering high-level interfaces for parallel data mining. Moreover, we have efficiently parallelized this algorithm on a cluster of SMPs, i.e. combining shared memory and distributed memory parallelism, and over disk-resident datasets.

One of the intrusion detection, anomaly detection is a method of treating abnormal behaviors that deviate from modeled normal behaviors as suspicious attack. Research on data mining for intrusion detection focused on association rules, frequent episodes and classification. However despite the usefulness of rules that include temporal dimension and the fact that the audit data has temporal attribute, the above methods were limited in static rule extraction and did not consider temporal attributes. Therefore, we propose a new classification for intrusion detection. The proposed method is the CTAR(short for, Classification based on Temporal Class-Association Rules) and it extends combination of association rules and classification, CARs(short for, Class-Association Rules) by including temporal attribute. CTAR discovers rules in multiple time granularities and users can easily understand the discovered rules and temporal patterns. Finally, we proof that a prediction model (classifier) built from CTAR method yields better accuracy than a prediction model built from a traditional methods by experimental results.

To increase efficiency of basic sequence mining algorithms, generally based on a levelwise approach, more recent algorithms try to introduce some constraints to prune the search space during the discovery process. Nevertheless, existing algorithms are actually limited to extract frequent sequences made up of items of a database. In this paper, we generalize the notion of sequence to define what we call logical sequence where each element of a sequence may contain some logical variables. Then we show how we can extend constrained sequence mining to constrained frequent logical sequence mining(1).

Random Forest is used here to measure the relative importance of each input variable in the data. The technique is fast and can greatly reduce the number of variables with little compromise, especially for highly redundant data like neural ensemble spike trains. It also naturally preserves the identiflability of the original information source unlike other techniques, for example the Principal Component Analysis that mixes up the content of the variables irrecoverably and projects it into different set of variables.

This disadvantge is also present in more recent approaches using Self-Organizing Maps [4,22]. On the present work, and exploiting past sucesses in recently proposed Stigmergic Ant Systems [16,17] a robust online classifier is presented, which produces class decisions on a continuous stream data, allowing for continuous mappings. Results show that increasingly better results are achieved, as demonstraded by other authors in different areas [9,2].

S	Richards, D; Malik, U		Zaiane, OR; Simoff, SJ; Djeraba, C		Richards, D; Malik, U			Mining propositional knowledge bases to discover multi-level rules	MINING MULTIMEDIA AND COMPLEX DATA	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Multimedia Data Mining	JUL, 2002	EDMONTON, CANADA					This paper explores how knowledge in the form of propositions in an expert system can be used as input into data mining. The output is multi-level knowledge which can be used to provide structure, suggest interesting concepts, improve understanding and support querying of the original knowledge. Appropriate algorithms for mining knowledge must take into account the peculiar features of knowledge which distinguish it from data. The most obvious and problematic distinction is that only one of each rule exists. This paper introduces the possible benefits of mining knowledge and describes a technique for reorganizing knowledge and discovering higher-level concepts in the knowledge base. The rules input may have been acquired manually (we describe a simple technique known as Ripple Down Rules for this purpose) or automatically using an existing data mining technique. In either case, once the knowledge exists in propositional form, Formal Concept Analysis is applied to the rules to develop an abstraction hierarchy from which multi-level rules can be extracted. The user is able to explore the knowledge at and across any of the levels of abstraction to provide a much richer picture of the knowledge and understanding of the domain.

Our previous research has exposed us to a variety of real-world biological datasets that contain attributes whose values are sets of elements, instead of just individual elements. However, very few data mining tools accept datasets that contain these set-valued attributes, and none of them allow the mining of association rules directly from this type of data. We introduce in this paper two algorithms for mining (classification) association rules directly from set-valued data and compare their performance. We have implemented a system based on one of these algorithms and have applied it to a number of biological datasets. We describe here our system and highlight its merits by means of comparing the results achieved with it and the failed attempts to mine association rules from those datasets using standard tools. Our system makes the creation of input files containing set-valued data much easier, and makes the mining of association rules directly from these data possible.

To reduce this sampling bias problem a data mining procedure is proposed for detecting underrepresented relevant sequences. The procedure is aimed at helping domain experts achieve a cost-effective qualitative enlargement of knowledge through an in-depth study of a small number of statistically underrepresented and functionally interesting sequences. Our procedure consists of: (i) learning a class-conditional distribution model on each class of labeled data; (ii) applying the models to select statistically underrepresented unlabeled sequences; and (iii) automatically evaluating their interestingness. An application of the proposed approach is illustrated on an important problem of increasing the data set of confirmed disordered proteins. The obtained results demonstrate the promise of the proposed approach for an efficient reduction of sampling bias in biological databases.

While most of the existing algorithms are developed for efficient mining of frequent patterns, it has been noted recently that some of the infrequent patterns, such as indirect associations, provide useful insight into the data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, called HI-mine, based on a new data structure, called HI-struct, for mining the complete set of indirect associations between items. Our experimental results show that HI-mine's performance is significantly better than that of the previously developed algorithm for mining indirect associations on both synthetic and real world data sets over practical ranges of support specifications.

Here, we show the great potential of synergies between these research areas on the basis of four exemplary studies where techniques are transferred from one of the disciplines to the other. Methods: Reviewing and analyzing exemplary and specific projects at the intersection of medical informatics, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics from our experience in an interdisciplinary research group. Results. Synergy emerges when techniques and solutions from medical informatics, bioinformatics, or neuroinformatics are successfully applied in one of the other disciplines. Synergy was found in 1. the modeling of neurophysiological systems for medical therapy development, 2. the use of image processing techniques from medical computer vision for the analysis of the dynamics of cell nuclei, and 3. the application of neuroinformatics tools for data mining in bioinformatics and as classifiers in clinical oncology. Conclusions. Each of the three different disciplines have delivered technologies that are readily applicable in the other disciplines. The mutual transfer of knowledge and techniques proved to increase efficiency and accuracy in a manifold of applications. In particular, we expect that clinical decision support systems based on techniques derived from neuro- and bioinformatics have the potential to improve medical diagnostics and will finally lead to a personalized delivery of healthcare.

While traditional approaches concentrate on mining algorithms, we focus on explaining mined results. The mining task can be viewed as unsupervised learning that searches for interesting patterns. The construction and evaluation of mined patterns can be formulated as supervised learning that builds explanations. The proposed framework is therefore a simple combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning. The basic ideas are illustrated using association mining. The notion of conditional association is used to represent plausible explanations of an association. The condition in a conditional association explicitly expresses the plausible explanations of an association.

It is argued that there is an urgent need for formal and mathematical modeling of data mining. A formal framework provides a solid basis for a systematic study of many fundamental issues, such as representations and interpretations of primitive notions of data mining, data mining algorithms, explanations and applications of data mining results. A multi-level framework is proposed for modeling data mining based on results from many related fields. Formal concepts are adopted as the primitive notion. A concept is jointly defined as a pair consisting of the intension and the extension of the concept, namely, a formula in a certain language and a subset of the universe. An object satisfies the formula of a concept if the object has the properties as specified by the formula, and the object belongs to the extension of the concept. Rules are used to describe relationships between concepts. A rule is expressed in terms of the intensions of the two concepts and is interpreted in terms of the extensions of the concepts. Several different types of rules are investigated. The usefulness and meaningfulness of discovered knowledge are examined using a utility model and an explanation model.

The author developed another variation in this family K-Harmonic Means (KHM). It has been demonstrated using a small number of "benchmark" datasets that KHM is more robust than K-means and EM. In this paper, we compare their performance statistically. We run K-means, K-Harmonic Means and EM on each of 3600 pairs of (dataset, initialization) to compare the statistical average and variation of the performance of these algorithms. The results axe that, for low dimensional datasets, KHM performs consistently better than KM, and KM performs consistently better than EM over a large variation of clustered-ness of the datasets and a large variation of initializations. Some of the reasons that contributed to this difference are explained.

A graph-based representation of structural information combined with a substructure discovery technique has been shown to be successful in knowledge discovery. The SUBDUE substructure discovery system provides one such combination of approaches. This work presents SUBDUE and the development of its clustering functionalities. Several examples are used to illustrate the validity of the approach both in structured and unstructured domains, as well as to compare SUBDUE to the Cobweb clustering algorithm. We also develop a new metric for comparing structurally-defined clusterings. Results show that SUBDUE successfully discovers hierarchical clusterings in both structured and unstructured data.

J	Cho, SB				Cho, SB			Exploring features and classifiers to classify gene expression profiles of acute leukemia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						biological data mining; feature selection; classification; gene expression profile; acute leukemia; AML; ALL	CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; CANCER	Bioinformatics has recently drawn a lot of attention to efficiently analyze biological genomic information with information technology, especially pattern recognition. In this paper, we attempt to explore extensive features and classifiers through a comparative study of the most promising feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. The gene information from a patient's marrow expressed by DNA microarray, which is either the acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is used to predict the cancer class. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Backpropagation neural network, self-organizing map, structure adaptive self-organizing map, support vector machine, inductive decision tree and k-nearest neighbor have been used for classification. Experimental results indicate that backpropagation neural network with Pearson's correlation coefficients produces the best result, 97.1% of recognition rate on the test data.

MyPYTHIA's design objectives include evaluating the quality and performance of scientific software on Grid platforms, creating knowledge about which software and computational services should be selected for solving particular problems, selecting parameters of software (or of computational services) based on user-specified computational objectives, providing access to performance data and knowledge bases over the Web and enabling recommendations for targeted application domains. MyPYTHIA uses a combination of statistical analysis, pattern extraction techniques and a database of software performance to map feature-based representations of problem instances to appropriate software. MyPYTHIA's open architecture allows the user to customize it for conducting individual case studies. We describe the architecture as well as several scientific domains of knowledge enabled by such case studies. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

In the proposed approach, the GSA technique is embedded into a neural network frame in anticipation of improving the detection capability of bad data. Thanks to the clustering capability exhibited by GSA in which the number of clusters can be optimally determined, the proposed approach becomes highly effective to localize the group of abnormal data. This proposed approach has been tested through the data collected from different scenarios made on an IEEE 30-bus system and 118-bus systems. Test results reveal the feasibility of the method for the data diagnosis applications.

J	Takeuchi, I; Bengio, Y; Kanamori, T				Takeuchi, I; Bengio, Y; Kanamori, T			Robust regression with asymmetric heavy-tail noise distributions	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								In the presence of a heavy-tail noise distribution, regression becomes much more difficult. Traditional robust regression methods assume that the noise distribution is symmetric, and they downweight the influence of so-called outliers. When the noise distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased regression estimators. Motivated by data-mining problems for the insurance industry, we propose a new approach to robust regression tailored to deal with asymmetric noise distribution. The main idea is to learn most of the parameters of the model using conditional quantile estimators (which are biased but robust estimators of the regression) and to learn a few remaining parameters to combine and correct these estimators, to minimize the average squared error in an unbiased way. Theoretical analysis and experiments show the clear advantages of the approach. Results are on artificial data as well as insurance data, using both linear and neural network predictors.

J	Hung, E; Cheung, DW				Hung, E; Cheung, DW			Parallel mining of outliers in large database	DISTRIBUTED AND PARALLEL DATABASES			English	Article						data mining; outlier detection; parallel algorithm		Data mining is a new, important and fast growing database application. Outlier (exception) detection is one kind of data mining, which can be applied in a variety of areas like monitoring of credit card fraud and criminal activities in electronic commerce. With the ever-increasing size and attributes (dimensions) of database, previously proposed detection methods for two dimensions are no longer applicable. The time complexity of the Nested-Loop (NL) algorithm (Knorr and Ng, in Proc. 24th VLDB, 1998) is linear to the dimensionality but quadratic to the dataset size, inducing an unacceptable cost for large dataset. A more efficient version (ENL) and its parallel version (PENL) are introduced. In theory, the improvement of performance in PENL is linear to the number of processors, as shown in a performance comparison between ENL and PENL using Bulk Synchronization Parallel (BSP) model. The great improvement is further verified by experiments on a parallel computer system IBM 9076 SP2. The results show that it is a very good choice to mine outliers in a cluster of workstations with a low-cost interconnected by a commodity communication network.

The Centre for Adaptive Systems at the University of Sunderland was appointed by the DTI to run one of the two demonstrator clubs in the UK. The purpose of these clubs was to facilitate technology transfer between academia and industry, in the areas of fault diagnosis and prediction, intelligent control systems, and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Sunderland SSDM Club decided to use the various industrial members' problems and data to build a number of 'mini-demonstrators'. In the KDD cluster, three demonstrator applications were developed, accompanied by supporting material and a series of seminars, which illustrated the various stages in the KDD process to all club members. This paper describes three KDD application demonstrators, developed with data from a manufacturing company, with consultants in business clustering, and from data from a local police force, to investigate the phenomena of repeat victimization. The work involved data pre-processing, data transformation. data mining, and the development of visual tools for interpretation. With both the business clustering and police data much of the time was spent in data preparation, and so tools were developed so that the members could conduct their own data mining and interpretation experiments, lessening the need for the extraction of domain knowledge from the members.

Experiments have been achieved by the Biological Institute of Lille and many data has been generated. To exploit these data, data mining tools are required and we propose a two-phase optimisation approach using a specific genetic algorithm. During the first step, we select significant features with a specific genetic algorithm. Then, during the second step, we cluster affected individuals according to the features selected by the first phase. The paper describes the specificities of the genetic problem that we are studying, and presents in detail the genetic algorithm that we have developed to deal with this very large size feature selection problem. Results on both artificial and real data are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We consider here the application of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a clustering problem of Gaussian and t distributions. Earlier work in the MML clustering was conducted in regards to the multinomial and Gaussian distributions (Wallace and Boulton, 1968) and in addition, the von Mises circular and Poisson distributions (Wallace and Dowe, 1994, 2000). Our current work extends this by applying the Gaussian distribution to the more general t distribution. Point estimation of the t distribution is performed using the MML approximation proposed by Wallace and Freeman (1987). A comparison of the MML estimations of the t distribution to those of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in terms of their Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances is also provided. Within each component, our application also performs a model selection on whether a particular group of data is best modelled as a Gaussian or a t distribution. The proposed modelling method is then applied to several artificially generated datasets. The modelling results are compared to the results obtained when using the MML clustering of Gaussian distributions. Our modelling method compares quite well to an alternative clustering program (EMMIX) which uses various modelling criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

If the training of the classifier is also quick, this could become in some application domains a good asset for the classifier Many techniques and algorithms for automatic text categorization have been devised. According to published literature, some are more accurate than others, and some provide more interpretable classification models than others. However none can combine all the beneficial properties enumerated above. In this paper we present a novel approach for automatic text categorization that borrows from market basket analysis techniques using association rule mining in the data-mining field. We focus on two major problems: (1)finding the best term association rules in a textual database by generating and pruning; and (2) using the rules to build a text classifier Our text categorization method proves to be efficient and effective, and experiments on well-known collections show that the classifier performs well. In addition, training as well as classification are both fast and the generated rules are human readable.

However when they can be transformed into meaningful symbols like technical patterns, it becomes an easier task. Most recent work on time series queries only concentrates on how to identify a given pattern from a time series. Researchers do not consider the problem of identifying a suitable set of time points for segmenting the time series in accordance with a given set of pattern templates (e.g., a set of technical patterns for stock analysis). On the other hand, using fixed length segmentation is a primitive approach to this problem; hence, a dynamic approach (with high controllability) is preferred so that the time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively according to the needs of the users and the applications. In view of the facts that such a segmentation problem is an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary time series segmentation algorithm. This approach allows a sizeable set of stock patterns to be generated for mining or query. In addition, defining the similarity between time series (or time series segments) is of fundamental importance in fitness computation. By identifying the perceptually important points directly from the time domain, time series segments and templates of different lengths can be compared and intuitive pattern matching can be carried out in an effective and efficient manner Encouraging experimental results are reported from tests that segment the time series of selected Hong Kong stocks.

J	Genkin, A; Kulikowski, CA; Muchnik, I				Genkin, A; Kulikowski, CA; Muchnik, I			Set covering submodular maximization: An optimal algorithm for data mining in bioinformatics and medical informatics	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						protein functional annotation; medical decision making; set covering causal model; submodular function; optimal algorithm	PROBABILISTIC CAUSAL MODEL; PROTEIN; ANNOTATION; DOMAINS	In this paper A e show how several problems in different areas of data mining and knowledge discovery can be viewed as finding the optimal covering of a finite set. Many such problems arise in biomedical and bioinformatics research. For example, protein functional annotation based on sequence information is an ubiquitous bioinformatics problem. It consists of finding a set of homolog (high similarity) sequences of known function to a given an-lino acid sequence of unknown function from the various annotated sequence data bases. These can then be used as clues in suggesting further experimental analysis of the new protein. In the present paper we show that these optimization problems can be stated as maximizations of submodular functions on the set of candidate subsets - a generalization that may be especially useful when conclusions from data mining need to be interpreted by human experts. This is common to a number of examples we consider below: diagnostic hypothesis generation, logical methods of data analysis, conceptual clustering. and proteins functional annotations.

Often these models must be explainable as well as accurate. While decision tables are easy to interpret and explain to virtually all users, there has been little study of whether such simple models are powerful enough to use for data mining. This paper presents SORCER, a learning system that induces second-order decision tables from a given data set. Second-order tables are database relations in which rows have sets of atomic values as components. Using sets of values interpreted as disjunctions, second-order tables provide simple and compact representations that both enhance comprehensibility and facilitate efficient management. Unlike many other learning systems, to further promote comprehensibility, SORCER attempts to generate a minimum number of rows. SORCER's induction algorithm can be viewed as a table compression technique in which a traditional table, representing training data, is transformed into a second-order table with fewer rows by merging rows in ways that preserve consistency with the training data. We compare SORCER to three classification systems: C4.5, CBA and a Naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental results on 26 data sets show that the average error rate obtained from SORCER, using a simple compression method, is lower than those of the Naive Bayesian classifier and C4.5 and is competitive with CBA's average error rate. Using a slightly more sophisticated compression, SORCER's average error rate is the lowest of all.	IHMC, Pensacola, FL 32501 USA	Hewett, R (reprint author), IHMC, Pensacola, FL 32501 USA.

Clustering and sequential analysis are two primary techniques for mining navigational patterns from Web and application server logs. The characteristics of the log data and mining tasks require new data representation methods and analysis algorithms to be tested in the e-commerce environment. In this paper we present a cube model to represent Web access sessions for data mining. The cube model organizes session data into three dimensions. The COMPONENT dimension represents a session as a set of ordered components {c(1), c(2),..., c(P)}, in which each component c(i) indexes the ith visited page in the session. Each component is associated with a set of attributes describing the page indexed by it, such as the page ID, category and view time spent at the page. The attributes associated with each component are defined in the ATTRIBUTE dimension. The SESSION dimension indexes individual sessions. In the model, irregular sessions are converted to a regular data structure to which existing data mining algorithms can be applied while the order of the page sequences is maintained. A rich set of page attributes is embedded in the model for different analysis purposes. We also present some experimental results of using the partitional clustering algorithm to cluster sessions. Because the sessions are essentially sequences of categories, the k-modes algorithm designed for clustering categorical data and the clustering method using the Markov transition frequency (or probability) matrix, are used to cluster categorical sequences.

Despite the fact that association rules are regarded as highly comprehensible and useful for data mining and decision support in fields such as marketing, retail, demographics, among others, lengthy outputs may discourage users from using the technique. In this paper we propose a post-processing methodology and tool for browsing/visualizing large sets of association rules. The method is based on a set of operators that transform sets of rules into sets of rules, allowing focusing on interesting regions of the rule space. Each set of rules can be then seen with different graphical representations. The tool is web-based and uses SVG. Association rules are given in PMML.

The reformulation uses the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle as a way of costing each hyperplane via a two-part message. This message defines a separating hyperplane. The length of this message is used as an objective function for a search through the hypothesis space of possible hyperplanes used to dichotomise a set of data points. Two preliminary MML implementations are presented here, which differ in the (Bayesian) coding schemes used and the search procedures. The generalisation ability of these two reformulations on both artificial and real data sets are compared against current implementations of Support Vector Machines-namely SVMlight, the Lagrangian Support Vector Machine and SMOBR. It was found that, in general, all implementations improved as the size of the data sets increased. The MML implementations tended to perform best on the inseparable data sets and the real data set. Our preliminary MML scheme showed itself to be a strong competitor against the classical SVM, despite inefficiencies in the current scheme.

Typical clustering operations in web mining involve finding natural groupings of web resources or web users. Researchers have pointed out some important differences between clustering in conventional applications and clustering in web mining. For example, the clusters and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. Moreover, due to a variety of reasons inherent in web browsing and web logging, the likelihood of bad or incomplete data is higher. As a result, researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in web mining clustering applications. This paper describes how rough set theory can also be used to develop clustering schemes for web mining. The unsupervised classification described in the paper uses properties of rough sets along with Genetic Algorithms to represent clusters as interval sets. The paper also describes the design of an experiment including data collection and the clustering process. The experiment is used to create interval set representations of groups of web visitors.

Conventional clusters have crisp boundaries, i.e. each object belongs to only one cluster. The clusters and associations in data mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. An object may belong to more than one cluster. Researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in data mining clustering applications. Recently, two different methodologies based on properties of rough sets were proposed for developing interval representations of clusters. One approach is based on Genetic Algorithms, and the other is an adaptation of K-means algorithm. Both the approaches have been successful in generating intervals of clusters. The efficiency of the clustering algorithm is an important issue when dealing with a large dataset. This paper provides comparison of the time complexity of the two rough clustering algorithms.

It detects interesting patterns such as clusters, associations, deviations, similarities, and differences in sets of texts. Current text mining methods use simplistic representations of text contents, such as keyword vectors, which imply serious limitations on the kind and meaningfulness of possible discoveries. We show how to do some typical mining tasks using conceptual graphs as formal but meaningful representation of texts. Our methods involve qualitative and quantitative comparison of conceptual graphs, conceptual clustering, building a conceptual hierarchy, and application of data mining techniques to this hierarchy in order to detect interesting associations and deviations. Our experiments show that, despite widespread misbelief, detailed meaningful mining with conceptual graphs is computationally affordable.

In the last decade, simulations of software processes were used in several settings and environments. This paper gives a short overview of the benefits of software process simulation and describes the development of a discrete-event model, a technique rarely used before in that field. The model introduced in this paper captures the behavior of a detailed code inspection process.

The determination of the underlying cause-effect relations using data mining techniques and empirical data is explained. Finally, the paper gives an outlook on our future work.

Since the distributed knowledge discovery process is both data and computational intensive, the Grid is a natural platform for deploying a high performance data mining service. The focus of this paper is on the cote services of such a Grid infrastructure. In particular we concentrate our attention on the design and implementation of specialized broker aware of data source locations and resource needs of data mining tasks. Allocation and scheduling decisions are taken on the basis of performance cost metrics and models that exploit knowledge about previous executions, and use sampling to acquire estimate about execution behavior.

In order to represent structural features common to such semistructured data, we propose a regular term tree which is a rooted tree pattern consisting of ordered tree structures and internal structured variables. For a regular ordered term tree t, the term tree language of t, denoted by L(t), is the set of all trees which are obtained from t by substituting arbitrary trees for all variables in t. In this paper, we consider a polynomial time learnability of the class OTTC = JL(t) \ t epsilon OTTJ from positive data, where OTT denotes the set of all regular ordered term trees. First of all, we present a polynomial time algorithm for solving the minimal language problem for OTT which is, given a set of labeled trees S, to find a term tree t in OTT such that L(t) is minimal among all term tree languages which contain all trees in S. Moreover, by using this algorithm and the polynomial time algorithm for solving the membership problem for OTT in our previous work [15], we show that OTTC is polynomial time inductively inferable from positive data. This result is an ex, tension of our previous results in [14].

The aim of this investigation was to provide starting points for an analysis that could be used to enhance the educational offer in this area in general, and knowledge transfer from academia to industry and business sector in particular. In addition to general findings concerning the collected materials such as contents, target audience, and teaching materials, we discuss issues such as connections with real-world problems. The work has been done as part of the activities of SolEuNet, a network of expert teams from academia and business sponsored by the European Commission, offering tools and expertise designed to meet customized data mining and decision support needs. For SolEuNet, the aim of the analysis of educational programs was to enhance its own educational offer by finding prospective market niches and by identifying useful guidelines for seminar and courses design. In this paper we report on these investigations with the aim of providing readers with insight into state of the art and trends of education in machine learning, data mining and decision support as reflected on the web, and to give useful links to materials that could help when designing and preparing courses.

The purpose is to discover patterns of dependency in general multivariate time-varying systems, and to construct a suitable representation for the function expressing those dependencies. The patterns of dependency are represented by multivariate, non-linear, autoregressive models. Given a set of time series, the models relate future values of one target series with past values of all such series, including itself. The model space is explored with a genetic algorithm, whereas the functional approximation is constructed with a similarity based neuro-fuzzy heterogeneous network. This approach allows rapid prototyping of interesting interdependencies, especially in poorly known complex multivariate processes. This method contains a high degree of parallelism at different levels of granularity, which can be exploited when designing distributed implementations, such as workcrew computation in a master-slave paradigm. In the present paper, a first implementation at the highest granularity level is presented. The implementation was tested for performance and portability in different homogeneous and heterogeneous Beowulf clusters with satisfactory results. An application example with a known time series problem is presented.

We present a profit mining approach to reduce this gap. In profit mining, we are given a set of past transactions and pre-selected target items, and we like to build a model for recommending target items and promotion strategies to new customers, with the goal of maximizing the net profit. We identify several issues in profit mining and propose solutions. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach using data sets of a wide range of characteristics.

It has been applied in such fields as machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analyzing and control algorithm acquiring successfully. Many researchers have studied rough sets in different view. In this paper, the authors discuss the reduction of knowledge using information entropy in rough set theory. First, the changing tendency of the conditional entropy of decision attributes given condition attributes is studied from the viewpoint of information. Then, two new algorithms based on conditional entropy are developed. These two algorithms are analyzed and compared with MIBARK algorithm. Furthermore, our simulation results show that the algorithms can find the minimal reduction in most cases.

The main paradigm underlying the whole approach consists in integrating several concepts and techniques into a single computing environment, i.e. Sigma ynergos, in such a way that the requisites and possibilities of each of the constituent components complement one another and the thus obtained result becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The components of Sigma ynergos include distributed system capabilities and a number of libraries containing algorithms for: computer vision, modeling and simulation of biological visual systems, data and classification analysis, software validation and comparative evaluation, Internet, off-the-shelf application, image databases, artificial intelligence, data mining, and visualization resources. In this paper special emphasis is placed upon the Internet, distributed implementation and biological vision. After outlining the principal requisites and potentials underlying each of such components, some specific situations of interest arising from the integration of two or more of such elements are described and discussed. Details concerning the integration with Internet and the implementation of the laboratory as a distributed system are provided, and a complete case-example is presented. This applications regards the implementation of a psychophysical experiment aimed at investigating human perception of pictorial complexity, including the derivation of a mathematic-computational framework modeling such a perception as well as the use of the Internet as a source of stimuli and for reporting the obtained results. In addition, the mathematic-computational model is derived by using a parallel version of the genetic algorithm running on the distributed system of PCs. The obtained encouraging results substantiate the potential of this vision laboratory for multidisciplinary vision research.

The similarity join combines two point sets of a multidimensional vector space such that the result contains all point pairs where the distance does not exceed a parameter E. In this paper, we propose the Epsilon Grid Order, a new algorithm for determining the similarity join of very large data sets. Our solution is based on a particular sort order of the data points, which is obtained by laying an equi-distant grid with cell length E over the data space and comparing the grid cells lexicographically. A typical problem of grid-based approaches such as MSJ or the epsilon -kdB-tree is that large portions of the data sets must be held simultaneously in main memory. Therefore, these approaches do not scale to large data sets. Our technique avoids this problem by an external sorting algorithm and a particular scheduling strategy during the join phase. In the experimental evaluation, a substantial improvement over competitive techniques is shown.

An example of such regularity is "Salaries of employees generally do not decrease." TDs compare attributes over time using operators of {<, =, >, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, not equal}. We define a satisfiability problem that is the dual of the logical implication problem for TDs and we investigate the computational complexity of both problems. As TDs allow expressing meaningful trends, "mining" them from existing databases is interesting. For the purpose of TD mining, TD satisfaction is characterized by support and confidence measures. We study the problem TDMINE: given a temporal database, mine the TDs that conform to a given template and whose support and confidence exceed certain threshold values. The complexity of TDMINE is studied, as well as algorithms to solve the problem.	Univ Mons, B-7000 Mons, Belgium	Wijsen, J (reprint author), Univ Mons, B-7000 Mons, Belgium.

J	Bradford, JP; Fortes, JAB				Bradford, JP; Fortes, JAB			Characterization and parallelization of decision-tree induction	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						program characterization; parallelization; memory hierarchy; data mining; decision-tree induction		This paper examines the performance and memory-access behavior of the C4.5 decision-tree induction program, a representative example of data mining applications, for both uniprocessor and parallel implementations. The goals of this paper are to characterize C4.5, in particular its memory hierarchy usage, and to decrease the run-time of C4.5 via algorithmic improvement and parallelization. Performance is studied via RSIM, an execution driven simulator, for three uniprocessor models that exploit instruction level parallelism to varying degrees. This paper makes the following four contributions. The first contribution is presenting a complete characterization of the C4.5 decision-tree induction program. The results show that with the exception of the input data set, the working set fits into an 8-Kbyte data cache; the instruction working set also fits into an 8-Kbyte instruction cache. For data sets larger than the L2 cache, performance is limited by accesses to main memory. The results further establish that four-way issue can provide up to a factor of two performance improvement over single-issue for larger L2 caches; for smaller L2 caches, out-of-order dispatch provides a large performance improvement over in-order dispatch. The second contribution made by this paper is examining the effect on the memory hierarchy of changing the layout of the input dataset in memory, showing again that the performance is limited by memory accesses. One proposed data layout decreases the dynamic instruction count by up to 24%, but usually results in lower performance due to worse cache behavior. Another proposed data layout does not improve the dynamic instruction count over the original layout, but has better cache behavior and decreases the run-time by up to a factor of two. Third, this paper presents the first decision-tree induction program parallelized for a ccNUMA architecture. A method for splitting the decision tree hash table is discussed that allows the hash table to be updated and accessed simultaneously without the use of locks. The performance of the parallel version is compared to the original version of C4.5 and a uniprocessor version of C4.5 using the best data layout found. Speedup curves from a six-processor Sun E4000 SMP system show a speedup on the induction step of 3.99, and simulation results show that the performance is mostly unaffected by increasing the remote memory access time until it is over a factor of ten greater than the local memory access time. Last, this paper characterizes the parallelized decision-tree induction program. Compared to the uniprocessor version, the parallel version exerts significantly less pressure on the memory hierarchy, with the exception of having a much larger first level data working set.

This inverse problem is usually solved by least-squares fitting of the Stokes profiles. However least-squares inversion is too slow for the new generation of solar instruments (THEMIS, SOLIS, Solar-B,...) which will produce an ever-growing flood of spectral data. The solar community urgently requires a new approach capable of handling this information explosion, preferably in real-time. We have successfully applied pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to tackle this problem. For example, we have developed PCA-inversion, a database search technique based on Principal Component Analysis of the Stokes profiles. Search is fast because it is carried out in low dimensional PCA feature space, rather than the high dimensional space of the spectral signals. Such a data compression approach has been widely used for search and retrieval in many areas of data mining. PCA-inversion is the basis of a new inversion code called FATIMA (Fast Analysis Technique for the Inversion of Magnetic Atmospheres). Tests on data from HAO's Advanced Stokes Polarimeter show that FATIMA is over two orders of magnitude faster than least squares inversion. Initial tests on an alternative code (DIANNE - Direct Inversion based on Artificial Neural NEtworks) show great promise of achieving real-time performance. In this paper we present the latest achievements of FATIMA and DIANNE, two powerful examples of how pattern recognition techniques can revolutionize data analysis in astronomy.

In general, incremental learning is necessary when the number of examples is infinite, very large or presented one by one. We have performed this extension in the FLIP system, an implementation of the IFLP framework. Several examples of programs which have been induced indicate that our extension pays off in practice. An experimental study of some parameters which affect this efficiency is performed and some applications for programming practice are illustrated, especially small classification problems and data-mining of semi-structured data.

We focus on issues related to deploying a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment, We describe our approaches to address three types of issues: accuracy, efficiency, and usability To improve accuracy, data mining programs are used to analyze audit data and extract features that can distinguish normal activities from intrusions; we use artificial anomalies along with normal and/or intrusion data to produce more effective misuse and anomaly detection models. To improve efficiency, the computational costs of features are analyzed and a multiple-model cost-based approach is used to produce detection models with low cost and high accuracy. We also present a distributed architecture for evaluating cost-sensitive models in real-time. To improve usability, adaptive learning algorithms are used to facilitate model construction and incremental updates; unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are used to reduce the reliance on labeled data. We also present an architecture consisting of sensors, detectors, a data warehouse, and model generation components. This architecture facilitates the sharing and storage of audit data and the distribution of new or updated models. This architecture also improves the efficiency and scalability of the IDS.

Symptoms of such spatial dependence include clustering of similar values by location (e.g., house prices and incomes are similar in a subdivision, wetlands usually lie near other wetlands, pollution gradually dissapates away from the source). This chapter discusses alternative models and methods that can be used to estimate regression relationships for this type of sample data.

Remote sensing provides the only viable basis for the production of this information. This paper reports research undertaken as part of the MODIS effort to map the land cover of North America using the ARTMAP neural network. The main objective is to design a system called ART-VIP (ART for Visualisation and Image Processing) that integrates the ARTMAP neural network algorithm into a standard public domain image processing software, and to help users analyse and interpret the dynamics of the ARTMAP neural network with scientific visualisation tools. The provision of public domain software and methodologies facilitates the use of the ARTMAP neural network architecture for other land cover classification problems.

The CodeWeb tool takes this simple idea further by a deeper analysis of a large collection of applications to see what characteristic usage of the library is like. We demonstrate the tool by showing how the KDE core libraries are used in real-life KDE applications. Moreover we look at a recently developed feature that helps software developer sport an application from an old version of a library to a new one.

The technique measures the association between the system components (such as files) in terms of data and control flow dependencies among the groups of highly related entities that are scattered throughout the components. The application of data mining techniques allows to extract the maximum association among the groups of entities. This association is used as a measure of closeness among the system files in order to collect them into subsystems using an optimization clustering technique. A two-phase supervised clustering process is applied to incrementally generate the clusters and control the quality of the system decomposition. In order to address the complexity issues, the whole clustering space is decomposed into sub-spaces based on the association property. At each iteration, the sub-spaces are analyzed to determine the most eligible sub-space for the next cluster which is then followed by an optimization search to generate a new cluster.

Data mining has attracted considerable attention both in the research and commercial arenas in recent years, involving the application of a variety of techniques from both computer science and statistics. The chapter discusses how computer scientists and statisticians approach data from different but complementary viewpoints and highlights the fundamental differences between statistical and computational views of data mining. In doing so we review the historical importance of statistical contributions to machine learning and data mining, including neural networks, graphical models, and flexible predictive modeling. The primary conclusion is that closer integration of computational methods with statistical thinking is likely to become increasingly important in data mining applications.

J	White, HD				White, HD			Computing a curriculum: descriptor-based domain analysis for educators	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information analysis; data mining; curriculum analysis; curriculum evaluation; higher education; bibliographic databases	SCIENCE; LIBRARY	College educators need objective ways of assessing coverage, overlaps, and gaps in courses in their curricula, of validating their present offerings, and of monitoring subject-matter trends. This article presents a new methodology for attaining these goals through the use of descriptors from commercial bibliographic databases. A small set of master terms is chosen to model a college, department, or academic degree program, and then large numbers of descriptors that co-occur with the master terms are downloaded in online retrievals. The number of master terms with which descriptors intersect, and the number of documents these intersections produce, yield weights by which the descriptors' relevance to the curriculum can be prioritized. Curricula are thus grounded in the subject indexing of evolving literatures. Suitably arranged, the descriptors form a rich outline of the subject matter, both central and peripheral, that coursework in a field might cover. From this outline, the descriptors with the highest weights are extracted as a "Virtual Curriculum," against which the subject-matter of existing courses can be validated. If individual courses are assigned duplicate high-weight terms, overlaps in course content become visible. High-weight terms that cannot be matched to any existing courses reveal possible curricular Saps. Because online bibliographic databases are dynamic, domain analyses such as this can be repeated periodically to monitor trends and update judgments. A single analyst can carry out ail or much of the work; the main costs are for online searching and the analyst's time. The results are comparable to those produced by a national committee of experts. The study reported here used nine master terms to model the curricula for Drexel University's graduate programs in information systems and library and information science. Descriptors from the INSPEC and ERIC databases were processed with Dialog search software (principally the RANK command) and SPSS. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Clustering is used to classify policy holders into homogeneous risk groups. Within each cluster a neural network is then used to predict retention rates given demographic and policy information, including the premium change from one year to the next. It is shown that the prediction results are significantly improved by further dividing each cluster according to premium change. This work is part of a larger data mining framework proposed to determine optimal premium prices in a data-driven manner.

J	Zivanovic, R				Zivanovic, R			Local regression-based short-term load forecasting	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						short-term load forecasting; local polynomial regression; locally adaptive models; nonparametric statistics; forecasting; power systems		This paper presents a novel method for short-term load forecasting based on local polynomial regression. Before applying the local regression, data mining algorithm selects historic load sequences satisfying known factors that are characterising required load model. Further on, the selected sequences are pre-processed with robust location estimator (M-estimator) in order to reduce serial correlation and to eliminate outliers in historic data. On pre-processed load data we applied locally a truncated Taylor expansion to approximate functional relationship between load and load-affecting factors. Two methods for selecting optimal smoothing parameters (window size and polynomial degree) for local approximations are presented in the paper. These algorithms offer to us close insight into trade-off between bias and variance of the local approximations. In that way, they are able to help in selecting smoothing parameters locally (for each local fit) to fulfil the load modelling requirements. An example is presented at the end of this paper that clearly demonstrates the main features of this method.

New techniques were needed because previous data mining algorithms were overwhelmed by the staggering number of very frequent, but entirely unpredictive patterns that exist in the plan database. This paper combines several techniques fur pruning out unpredictive and redundant patterns which reduce the size of the returned rule set by more than three orders of magnitude. PLANMINE has also been fully integrated into two real-world planning systems. We experimentally evaluate the rules discovered by PLANMINE, and show that they are extremely useful for understanding and improving plans, as well as for building monitors that raise alarms before failures happen.

Clustering algorithms, association rule mining algorithms and OLAP tools all rely on efficient query processors being able to deal with high-dimensional data. Inside such a query processor, multidimensional index structures are used as a basic technique. As the implementation of such an index structure is a difficult and time-consuming task, we propose a new approach to implement an index structure on top of a commercial relational database system. In particular, we map the index structure to a relational database design and simulate the behavior of the index structure using triggers and stored procedures. This can be easily done for a very large class of multidimensional index structures. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency, we implemented an X-tree on top of Oracle8. We ran several experiments on large databases and recorded a performance improvement up to a factor of 11.5 compared to a sequential scan of the database.

J	Palpanas, T				Palpanas, T			Knowledge discovery in data warehouses	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article							PATTERNS	As the size of data warehouses increase to several hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes, the need for methods and tools that will automate the process of knowledge extraction, or guide the user to subsets of the dataset that are of particular interest, is becoming; prominent. In this survey paper we explore the problem of identifying and extracting interesting knowledge from large collections of data residing in data warehouses, by using data mining techniques. Such techniques have the ability to identify patterns and build succinct models to describe the data. These models can also be used to achieve summarization and approximation. We review the associated work in the OLAP, data mining and approximate query answering literature. We discuss the need for the traditional data mining techniques to adapt, and accommodate the specific characteristics of OLAP systems. We also examine the notion of interestingness of data, as a tool to guide the analysis process. We describe methods that have been proposed in the literature for determining what is interesting to the user and what is not, an;l how these approaches can be incorporated in the data mining algorithms.

Regulators, concerned that insurance companies will use this information to discriminate against applicants who have a genetic risk factor but who are still healthy, have implemented genetic privacy legislation in at least Is states. However, in previous work we have demonstrated that such legislation will have unintended consequences it will reduce consumer participation in the market without making those remaining better off. This paper identifies a mechanism, a pure bundling strategy, that insurance companies may implement in this regulatory environment to restore (or maximize) consumer participation in the market and to discourage such discrimination among insureds. This problem is examined through System Dynamics, a simulation-based modeling technique. The results will have significant implications for policy designs implemented by insurance companies, and for legislation implemented by industry regulators, and therefore, for the insurability of the individuals that rely on this market for health insurance coverage.

In this paper, we introduce a new method, called branch grafting method, for R-tree implementation. The major motivation of this proposed technique is to produce more desirable result and to reduce the number of nodes created in the R-tree. We present this method by comparing it with reinsertion method as used in R*-tree. Experiments have been carried out, and the strength of this proposed method is outlined.

The discovery of marketing related navigation patterns requires the development of data mining algorithms capable of the discovery of sequential access patterns from web logs. This paper introduces a new algorithm called MiDAS that extends traditional sequence discovery with a wide range of web-specific features. Domain knowledge is described as flexible navigation templates that can specify generic navigational behaviour of interest, network structures for the capture of web site topologies, concept hierarchies and syntactic constraints. Unlike existing approaches MiDAS supports sequence discovery from multidimensional data, which allows the detection of sequences across monitored attributes, such as URLs and http referrers. Three methods for pruning the sequences, resulting in three different types of navigational behaviour are presented. The experimental evaluation has shown promising results in terms of functionality as well as scalability.

J	Das, G; Mannila, H				Das, Gautam; Mannila, Heikki			Context-Based Similarity Measures for Categorical Databases	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								Similarity between complex data objects is one of the central notions in data mining. We propose certain similarity (or distance) measures between various components of a 0/1 relation. We define measures between attributes, between rows, and between subrelations of the database. They find important applications in clustering, classification, and several other data mining processes. Our measures are based on the contexts of individual components. For example, two products (i.e., attributes) are deemed similar if their respective sets of customers (i.e., subrelations) are similar. This reveals more subtle relationships between components, something that is usually missing in simpler measures. Our problem of finding distance measures can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations. We present an iterative algorithm which, when seeded with random initial values, converges quickly to stable distances in practice (typically requiring less than five iterations). The algorithm requires only one database scan. Results on artificial and real data show that our method is efficient, and produces results with intuitive appeal.			gautamd@microsoft.com; Mannila@nokia.com					Agrawal R., 1995, P 21 INT C VER LARG, P490; AGRAWAL R, 1993, P 4 INT C FDN DAT OR; Cheesman P, 1996, ADV KNOWLEDGE DISCOV, P153; Das G., 1998, Proceedings Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; DEERWESTER S, 1990, J AM SOC INFORM SCI, V41, P391, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199009)41:6<391::AID-ASI1>3.0.CO;2-9; GANTI V, 1999, P 5 INT C KNOWL DISC; Gibson D., 1998, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth International Conference on Very-Large Databases; Gibson D., 1998, P 9 ACM C HYP HYP; GOLDIN DQ, 1995, INT C PRINC PRACT CO; Guha S, 1999, PROC INT CONF DATA, P512, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.1999.754967; HAN EH, 1997, WORKSH RES ISS DAT M; HAN JW, 1992, PROC INT CONF VERY L, P547; Jagadish H.

In this paper, we propose five principles that any measure must satisfy to be considered useful for ranking the interestingness of summaries generated from databases. We investigate the problem within the context of summarizing a single dataset which can be generalized in many different ways and to many levels of granularity. We perform a comparative sensitivity analysis of fifteen well-known diversity measures to identify those which satisfy the proposed principles. The fifteen diversity measures have previously been utilized in various disciplines, such as information theory, statistics, ecology, and economics. Their use as objective measures of interestingness for ranking summaries generated from databases is novel. The objective of this work is to gain some insight into the behaviour that can be expected from each of the diversity measures in practice, and to begin to develop a theory of interestingness against which the utility of new measures can be assessed.

B	Jin, XD; Reynolds, RG			IEEE; IEEE	Jin, XD; Reynolds, RG			Mining knowledge in large scale databases using cultural algorithms with constraint handling mechanisms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2000 CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC2000)	JUL 16-19, 2000	LA JOLLA, CA	IEEE Neural Network Council, Evolutionary Programming Soc, Inst Elect Engineers, Parallel Problem Solving Nat, EvoNet, Evolut Artificielle, ANTS, SEAL				This paper proposes a framework for Evolutionary Systems to mine implicit knowledge in large scale databases. The idea here is to construct knowledge-based evolutionary systems that apply the power of evolution computation to facilitate the data mining processes, This framework provides the possibility of making two processes, the data mining process and the optimization process, work simultaneously and reciprocally. Based on Cultural Algorithms, the data mining process is supported by symbolic reasoning in the belief space, and the optimization process is supported by evolutionary search in the population space. The evolutionary search in databases can facilitate the data mining process, while the data mining process can also provide knowledge to expedite the search in databases. I.e. the data mining process and the evolutionary search can be integrated and benefit from each other. This new approach was applied to a large-scale temporal-spatial database, and the results indicate that it successfully mined out some very interesting patterns that are unknown before, Another advantage of this approach is that it doesn't have to access all information in the database in order to identify some interesting patterns, by automatically "select" useful cases from a large database to avoid the exhaustive search to every cases, This suggests a great potential to reach the goal of efficiency and effectiveness for data mining.

In our view this is mainly due to the variation in ILP engines, especially with respect to input specification, as well as the limited attention for relational database issues. In this paper we describe an approach which uses UML as the common specification language for a large range of ILP engines. Having such a common language will enable a wide range of users, including non-experts, to model problems and apply different engines without any extra effort. The process involves transformation of UML into a language called CDBL, that is then translated to a variety of input formats for different engines.

The algorithm extracts data points lying close to the class boundaries, which form a much reduced but critical set for classification. The problem of large memory requirements for training SVM's in batch mode is circumvented by adopting an active incremental learning algorithm. The learning strategy is motivated from the condensed nearest neighbor classification technique. Experimental results presented show that such active incremental learning enjoy superiority in terms of computation time and condensation ratio, over related methods.

We argue that in contrast to today's loosely-coupled tools, data mining should be regarded as advanced database querying and supported by Database Management Systems (DBMSs). In this paper we describe our research prototype system, which logically extends DBMS functionality, offering extensive support for pattern discovery, storage and management. We focus on the system architecture and novel SQL-based data mining query language, which serves as the user interface to the system.

The niche peaks, which constitute the final cluster centers, are identified based on Deterministic Crowding (DC). The problem of crossover interactions in DC is eliminated by restricting the mating to members of the same niche only. Finally, the correct number of niche peaks or fluster centers is extracted from the final population. Genetic Optimization makes our approach much Less prone to suboptimal solutions than other objective function based approaches, and frees it from the necessity of an analyitical derivation of the prototypes. As a result, our approach can handle a vast array of general subjective, even non-metric dissimilarities, and is thus useful in many applications such as Web and data mining. Additionally, the use of robust weights makes it less sensitive to the presence of noise than most traditional unsupervised clustering techniques.

This method is particularly useful for specialist morphological analysis of shapes of selected organs of abdominal cavity conducted to diagnose disease symptoms occurring in the main pancreatic ducts, upper segments of ureters and renal pelvis. Analysis of the correct morphology of these organs is possible with the application of the sequential and tree method belonging to the group of syntactic methods of pattern recognition. The objective of this analysis is to support early diagnosis of disease lesions, mainly characteristic for carcinoma and pancreatitis, based on examinations of ERCP images and a diagnosis of morphological lesions in ureters as well as renal pelvis based on an analysis of urograms. In the analysis of ERCP images the main objective is to recognise morphological Lesions in pancreas ducts characteristic for carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis, while in the case of kidney radiogram analysis the aim is to diagnose local irregularities of ureter lumen and to examine the morphology of renal pelvis and renal calyxes. Diagnosing the above mentioned lesion has been conducted with the use of syntactic methods of pattern recognition, in particular the languages of description of features of shapes and context-free sequential attributed grammars. These methods allow to recognise and describe in a very efficient way the aforementioned lesions on images obtained as a result of initial image professing of width diagrams of the examined structures. Additionally, in order to support the analysis of the correct structure of renal pelvis a method using the tree grammar for syntactic pattern recognition to define its correct morphological shapes has been presented.

It can be used to provide useful structural information on data as well as enable clustering. In this paper we present an elegant method for measuring the similarity between homogeneous datasets. The algorithm presented is efficient in storage and scale, has the ability to adjust to time constraints. and can provide the user with likely causes of similarity or dis-similarity. One potential application of our similarity measure is in the distributed data mining domain. Using the notion of similarity across databases as a distance metric one can generate clusters of similar datasets. Once similar datasets are clustered, each cluster can be independently mined to generate the appropriate rules for a given cluster. The similarity measure is evaluated on a dataset from the Census Bureau, and synthetic datasets from IBM.

An integration method needs to be able either to evaluate and select the most appropriate data mining technique or to combine two or more techniques efficiently. A recent integration method for the dynamic integration of multiple data mining techniques is based on the assumption that each of the data mining techniques is the best one inside a certain subarea of the whale domain area. This method uses an instance-based learning approach to collect information about the competence areas of the mining techniques and applies a distance function to determine how close a new instance is to each instance of the training set. The nearest instance or instances are used to predict the performance of the data mining techniques. Because the quality of the integration depends heavily on the suitability of the used distance function our goal is to analyze the characteristics of different distance functions. In this paper we investigate several distance functions as the very commonly used Euclidean distance function, the Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric (HEOM), and the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), among others. We analyze the effects of the use of different distance functions to the accuracy achieved by dynamic integration when the parameters describing datasets vary. We include also results of our experiments with different datasets which include both nominal and continuous attributes.

The use of traditional tools and techniques to discover knowledge is ruthless and does not give the right information at the right time. Data mining should provide tactical insights to support the strategic directions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic approach that uses knowledge discovered in previous episodes. The proposed approach is shown to be effective for solving problems related to the efficiency of handling database updates, accuracy of data mining results, gaining more knowledge and interpretation of the results, and performance. Our results do not depend on the approach used to generate itemsets. In our analysis, we have used an Apriori-like approach as a local procedure to generate large itemsets. We prove that the Dynamic Data Mining algorithm is correct and complete.

More and more information sources have linked online through WWW, but finding information on the WWW is also a great challenge. For most of the users, the information retrieved is not well organized and the access time is considered high on the WWW currently. Therefore, there is a need to develop a good mechanism to organize and manage the tremendous size and various kinds of information to facilitate the functionality of a search engine for information retrieval on the WWW in response to such a demand, we propose a Markov Model Mediator (MMM) mechanism which employs the affinity-based data mining techniques to organize and manage the information sources so that the most relevant documents are clustered together to achieve higher recall and precision values for information retrieval on the WWW.

Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-of-detail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, out method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that H-BLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization. The versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated using examples from visual data mining.

Our work concentrates on the problem of finding associations between visual content in large image databases. Discovering association rules has been the focus of many studies in the last few years. However, for multimedia data such as images or video frames, the algorithms proposed in the literature are not sufficient since they miss relevant frequent item-sets due to the peculiarity of visual data, like repetion of features, resolution levels, etc. We present in this paper an approach for mining spatial relationships from large visual data repositories. The approach proceeds in three steps: feature localization, spatial relationship abstraction, and spatial association discovery. The mining process considers the issue of scalability and contemplates various feature localization abstactions at different resolution levels.

The output from this process, the generation of rules of various types, has raised the question of how rules can be considered interesting. We argue that, in many cases, it is the meta-rule that holds the most interest. That is, given a set of known rules about a dataset, it is the confluence of rules relating to a small subset of characteristics that commonly becomes the focus of interest. In earlier work, we investigated the manner in which meta-rules, rules describing rules, could be discovered and used within a data mining system. In this paper we extend this and present an approach that enable meta-rules to be found incrementally. The emphasis of the work is on temporal data mining as we find that temporal data readily lends itself to data mining techniques, however, as can be seen from the paper, the temporal component can easily be abstracted out and the results are thus also applicable in a non-temporal domain.

The association rule model was recently proposed in order to discover useful patterns and dependencies in such data. This paper discusses a method for indexing market basket data efficiently for similarity search. The technique is likely to be very useful in applications which utilize the similarity in customer buying behavior in order to make peer recommendations. We propose an index called the signature table, which is very flexible in supporting a wide range of similarity functions. The construction of the index structure is independent of the similarity function, which can be specified at query time. The resulting similarity search algorithm shows excellent scalability with increasing memory availability and database size.

The specific application we dealt with is the analysis of data concerning the wafer production process with the goal of determining possible causes for errors, resulting in lots of faulty wafers. Even though our application is very specific and deals with a specific manufacturing sector (e.g. semiconductor fabrication), we believe that our experience can be relevant to other manufacturing sectors and provide significant feedback on the use of data mining techniques.

However, most learning algorithms only use labeled examples. Thus we address the problem of learning with the help of positive and unlabeled data given a small number of labeled examples. We present both theoretical and empirical arguments showing that learning algorithms can be improved by the use of both unlabeled and positive data. As an illustrating problem, we consider the learning algorithm from statistics for monotone conjunctions in the presence of classification noise and give empirical evidence of our assumptions. We give theoretical results for the improvement of Statistical Query learning algorithms from positive and unlabeled data, Lastly, we apply these ideas to tree induction algorithms. We modify the code of C4.5 to get an algorithm which takes as input a set LAB of labeled examples, a set POS of positive examples and a set UNL of unlabeled data and which uses these three sets to construct the decision tree. We provide experimental results based on data; taken from UCI repository which confirm the relevance of this approach.

In this paper, we present four algorithms that output such crucial variables in PAC model with membership queries. The first algorithm executes the task under any unknown distribution by measuring the distance between virtual and real targets. The second algorithm; space under an arbitrary distribution. The third exhausts virtual version algorithm exhausts universal set under the uniform distribution. The fourth algorithm measures influence of variables under the uniform distribution. Knowing the number r of relevant variables, the first algorithm runs in almost linear time for r. The second and the third ones use less membership queries than the first one, but runs in time exponential for r. The fourth one enumerates highly influential variables in quadratic time for r.

B	Smith, A; Suri, S			SIAM; SIAM; SIAM	Smith, A; Suri, S			Rectangular tiling in multi-dimensional arrays	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH ANNUAL ACM-SIAM SYMPOSIUM ON DISCRETE ALGORITHMS			English	Proceedings Paper	10th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms	JAN 17-19, 1999	BALTIMORE, MD	ACM, SIAM				We study the following tiling problem in d dimensions: given a d-dimensional rectangular array of non-negative numbers and an integer rho, partition the array into at most rho rectangular subarrays so that the maximum weight of any subarray is minimized; the weight of a subarray is the sum of its elements. The rectangular tiling problem is motivated by applications in data mining, data partitioning, and video compression. Recently, Khanna, Muthukrishnan, and Paterson [SODA '98],showed that the tiling problem is NP-Complete and gave a 2.5-approximation algorithm for d = 2. In this paper, we extend their result to multidimensional arrays, and give an algorithm with approximation ratio (d+3/2), for d greater than or equal to 2. The algorithm can be implemented to run in worst-case time O(N + rho log N) time, where N is the size of the array, and the constant is of the order d!. We also obtain a similar algorithm for the dual tiling problem, where the goal is to compute a tiling of weight at most W using as few tiles as possible. Our algorithm yields an approximation factor (2d + I). We implemented our algorithm and ran simulation tests on multidimensional arrays with random data. In our limited experiments, the algorithm always produced approximations close to two.

In this paper, we examine new developments in data mining and its application to personalization in E-commerce. Personalization is what merchants and publishers want to do to tailor the Web site or advertisement and product promotion to a customer based on his past behavior and inference from other like-minded people. E-commerce offers the opportunity to deploy this type of one-to-one marketing instead of the traditional mass marketing. The technology challenges to support personalization will be discussed. These include the need to perform clustering and searching in very high dimensional data space with huge amount of data. We'll examine some of the new data mining technologies developed that can support personalization.

J	Michie, D				Michie, D			Learning concepts from data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Current data-mining practice employs relatively :low-level machine learning algorithms-statistical, neural-net, genetic, decision-tree, etc.-to trawl large data-sets for new classifiers. Usefulness of classifiers is then assessed according to accuracy in classifying new data, e.g. for stockmarket prediction or for assigning causes in medical diagnosis. User-transparency is often a secondary consideration. But in some applications the priorities are reversed. (1) In the "designer drug" industry, predictive classifiers are more valuable if they also provide chemists with new leads, while minimizing the frequency of the false positives. Screening fossil fuel emissions for hazardous components, on the other hand, requires minimization of false negatives. The high user-transparencies required in both cases are obtainable only with relational descriptions and rule languages, going beyond attribute-value representations. (2) In the simulator training of aircraft pilots, and of operators of other real-time devices, predictive control laws can provide a basis for machine-generated real-time advice to trainees. Study of human simulator-based control learning indicates a subgoal structure. It also suggests that both acquisition by the learner of new subgoals, and reorganization of perceived causal links among problem elements are involved in real-time skill learning. Design implications for automated coaches are worthy of consideration. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their structure is a tree where the leaf nodes are constants and the inner nodes are either sets or tuples. There is one operation defined, less than or equal to, which determines whether one complex object is contained in another one. A query of the form: is a piece of information x contained in a database DB, can simply be formulated as 'x less than or equal to DB'. On the basis of the less than or equal to operation a lattice is defined. The lower upper bound of two complex objects x and v is the operator, '+' which will be shown to be equivalent to the operation 'adding x to y'. Similarly a '*' operation being the greatest lower bound can be defined for two complex objects and determines the information common to the two objects. It will also be shown that rules can be introduced very easily. By means of this the notions of deductive databases and data mining can be defined in a natural way.

Any systems, approaches or techniques that are concerned with information need to take into account the temporal aspect of data. Data mining refers to a set of techniques for discovering previously unknown information from existing data in large databases and therefore, the information discovered will be of limited value if its temporal aspects, i.e, validity, periodicity, are not considered. This paper presents a generic definition of temporal patterns and a framework for discovering them. A query language for the mining of such patterns is presented in detail. As an instance of generic patterns, temporal association rules are used as examples of the proposed approach.

It adopts the count distribution approach and has incorporated two powerful candidate pruning techniques, i.e., distributed pruning and global pruning. It has a simple communication scheme which performs only one round of message exchange in each iteration. We found that the two pruning techniques are very sensitive to data skewness, which describes the degree of non-uniformity of the itemset distribution among the database partitions. Distributed pruning is very effective when data skewness is high. Global pruning is more effective than distributed pruning even for the mild data skewness case. We have implemented the algorithm on an IBM SP2 parallel machine. The performance studies confirm our observation on the relationship between the effectiveness of the two pruning techniques and data skewness. It has also shown that FPM outperforms CD (Count Distribution) consistently, which is a parallel version of the popular Apriori algorithm [2, 3]. Furthermore, FPM has nice parallelism of speedup, scaleup and sizeup.

With a huge amount of data stored in spatial databases and the introduction of spatial components to many relational or object-relational databases, it is important to study the methods for spatial data warehousing and on-line analytical processing of spatial data. In this paper, we study methods for spatial OLAP, by integration of nonspatial on-line analytical processing (OLAP) methods with spatial database implementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model, which consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and measures, is proposed. Methods for computation of spatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied, with several strategies proposed, including approximation and partial materialization of the spatial objects resulted from spatial OLAP operations. Some techniques for selective materialization of the spatial computation results are worked out, and the performance study has demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques.

In IJCAI '97, we challenged the AI community to address this problem by creating adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by mining visitor access data collected in Web server logs. In this paper we introduce our own approach to this broad challenge. Specifically, we investigate the problem of index page synthesis - the automatic creation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Web site. First, are formalize this problem as a clustering problem and introduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call cluster mining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space into disjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (and possibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, a cluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input and outputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we show experimentally that PageGather is both faster (by a factor of three) and more effective than traditional clustering algorithms on this task. Our experiment relies on access logs collected over a month from an actual web site.

Immense data may be needed to train a classifier for good accuracy. The state-of-art classifiers [21, 25] need an in-memory data structure of size O(N), where N is the size of the training data, to achieve efficiency. For large data sets, such a data structure will not fit in the internal memory. The best previously known classifier does a quadratic number of I/Os for large N. In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm (classifier) called MIND (MINing an Databases). MIND can be phrased in such a way that its implementation is very easy using the extended relational calculus SQL, and this in turn allows the classifier to be built into a relational database system directly. MIND is truly scalable with respect to I/O efficiency, which is important since scalability is a key requirement for any data mining algorithm. We built a prototype of MIND in the relational database manager DB2 and benchmarked its performance. We describe the working prototype and report the measured performance with respect to the previous method of choice. MIND scales not only with the size of the datasets but also with the number of processors on an IBM SP2 computer system. Even on uniprocessors, MIND scales well beyond the dataset sizes previously published for classifiers. We also give some insights that may have an impact on the evolution of the extended relational calculus SQL.

Traditionally, texts have been analysed using various information retrieval related methods and natural language processing. In this paper, we present our first experiments in applying general methods of data mining to discovering phrases and co-occurring terms. We also describe the text mining process developed. Our results show that data mining methods - with appropriate preprocessing - can be used in text processing, and that by shifting the focus the process can be used to obtain results for various purposes.

The current algorithms proposed for data mining of association rules make repeated passes over the database to determine the commonly occurring itemsets (or set of items). For large databases, the I/O overhead in scanning the database can be extremely high. In this paper we show that random sampling of transactions in the database is an effective method for finding association rules. Sampling can speed up the mining process by more than an order of magnitude by reducing I/O costs and drastically shrinking the number of transactions to be considered. We may also be able to make the sampled database resident in main-memory. Furthermore, we show that sampling can accurately represent the data patterns in the database with high confidence. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of sampling on different databases, and study the relationship between the performance, and the accuracy and confidence of the chosen sample.

They are also useful in the integration of artificial intelligence and database. However, when recursive rules are involved, the amount of deduced facts can become too large to be practically stored, viewed or analyzed. This seriously hinders the usefulness of deductive databases. In order to overcome this problem, we propose four methods to discover characteristic rules from large amount of deduction results without actually having to store all the deduction results. This paper presents the first step in the application of knowledge discovery techniques to deductive databases with large deduction results.

J	Narayanan, A				Narayanan, A			Revisable knowledge discovery in databases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							LOGIC; CIRCUMSCRIPTION; INHERITANCE	This article introduces the idea of using nonmonotonic inheritance networks for the storage and maintenance of knowledge discovered in data (revisable knowledge discovery in databases). While existing data mining strategies for knowledge discovery in databases typically involve initial structuring through the use of identification trees and the subsequent extraction of rules from these trees for use in rule-based expert systems, such strategies have difficulty in coping with additional information which may conflict with that already used for the automatic generation of rules. In the worst case, the entire automatic sequence may have to be repeated. If nonmonotonic inheritance networks are used instead of rules for storing knowledge discovered in databases, additional conflicting information can be inserted directly into such structures, thereby bypassing the need for recompilation.

Opcode sequences as representation of executables for data-mining-based unknown malware detection	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Malware detection; Computer security; Data mining; Machine learning; Supervised learning	FEATURE-SELECTION; INTRUSION DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS; CRITERIA; KERNEL	Malware can be defined as any type of malicious code that has the potential to harm a computer or network. The volume of malware is growing faster every year and poses a serious global security threat. Consequently, malware detection has become a critical topic in computer security. Currently, signature-based detection is the most widespread method used in commercial antivirus. In spite of the broad use of this method, it can detect malware only after the malicious executable has already caused damage and provided the malware is adequately documented. Therefore, the signature-based method consistently fails to detect new malware. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect unknown malware families. This model is based on the frequency of the appearance of opcode sequences. Furthermore, we describe a technique to mine the relevance of each opcode and assess the frequency of each opcode sequence. In addition, we provide empirical validation that this new method is capable of detecting unknown malware. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cagliero, L				Cagliero, Luca			Discovering Temporal Change Patterns in the Presence of Taxonomies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; mining methods and algorithms	ASSOCIATION RULES; LARGE DATABASES	Frequent itemset mining is a widely exploratory technique that focuses on discovering recurrent correlations among data. The steadfast evolution of markets and business environments prompts the need of data mining algorithms to discover significant correlation changes in order to reactively suit product and service provision to customer needs. Change mining, in the context of frequent itemsets, focuses on detecting and reporting significant changes in the set of mined itemsets from one time period to another. The discovery of frequent generalized itemsets, i.e., itemsets that 1) frequently occur in the source data, and 2) provide a high-level abstraction of the mined knowledge, issues new challenges in the analysis of itemsets that become rare, and thus are no longer extracted, from a certain point. This paper proposes a novel kind of dynamic pattern, namely the HIstory GENeralized Pattern (HIGEN), that represents the evolution of an itemset in consecutive time periods, by reporting the information about its frequent generalizations characterized by minimal redundancy (i.e., minimum level of abstraction) in case it becomes infrequent in a certain time period. To address HIGEN mining, it proposes HIGEN MINER, an algorithm that focuses on avoiding itemset mining followed by postprocessing by exploiting a support-driven itemset generalization approach. To focus the attention on the minimally redundant frequent generalizations and thus reduce the amount of the generated patterns, the discovery of a smart subset of HIGENs, namely the NON-REDUNDANT HIGENs, is addressed as well. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasets show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as its usefulness in a real application context.

J	Castellanos-Garzon, JA; Garcia, CA; Novais, P; Diaz, F				Castellanos-Garzon, Jose A.; Armando Garcia, Carlos; Novais, Paulo; Diaz, Fernando			A visual analytics framework for cluster analysis of DNA microarray data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; DNA-microarrays; Cluster analysis; Visual analytics; Metric spaces; Boundary points; Surface reconstruction	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; INFORMATION VISUALIZATION; COMPUTATION; VALIDATION; PATTERNS	Cluster analysis of DNA microarray data is an important but difficult task in knowledge discovery processes. Many clustering methods are applied to analysis of data for gene expression, but none of them is able to deal with an absolute way with the challenges that this technology raises. Due to this, many applications have been developed for visually representing clustering algorithm results on DNA microarray data, usually providing dendrogram and heat map visualizations. Most of these applications focus only on the above visualizations, and do not offer further visualization components to the validate the clustering methods or to validate one another. This paper proposes using a visual analytics framework in cluster analysis of gene expression data. Additionally, it presents a new method for finding cluster boundaries based on properties of metric spaces. Our approach presents a set of visualization components able to interact with each other; namely, parallel coordinates, cluster boundary genes, 3D cluster surfaces and DNA microarray visualizations as heat maps. Experimental results have shown that our framework can be very useful in the process of more fully understanding DNA microarray data. The software has been implemented in Java, and the framework is publicly available at http://www.analiticavisual.com/jcastellanos/3DVisualCluster/3D-VisualCluster. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bouguila, N; Ziou, D				Bouguila, Nizar; Ziou, Djemel			A countably infinite mixture model for clustering and feature selection	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Non-parametric Bayesian methods; Dirichlet process; Clustering; Feature selection; Mixture models; Generalized Dirichlet; MCMC; Categorization	GENERALIZED DIRICHLET MIXTURE; UNSUPERVISED SELECTION; ALGORITHM; SCENE	Mixture modeling is one of the most useful tools in machine learning and data mining applications. An important challenge when applying finite mixture models is the selection of the number of clusters which best describes the data. Recent developments have shown that this problem can be handled by the application of non-parametric Bayesian techniques to mixture modeling. Another important crucial preprocessing step to mixture learning is the selection of the most relevant features. The main approach in this paper, to tackle these problems, consists on storing the knowledge in a generalized Dirichlet mixture model by applying non-parametric Bayesian estimation and inference techniques. Specifically, we extend finite generalized Dirichlet mixture models to the infinite case in which the number of components and relevant features do not need to be known a priori. This extension provides a natural representation of uncertainty regarding the challenging problem of model selection. We propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to learn the resulted infinite mixture. Through applications involving text and image categorization, we show that infinite mixture models offer a more powerful and robust performance than classic finite mixtures for both clustering and feature selection.

J	Cil, I				Cil, Ibrahim			Consumption universes based supermarket layout through association rule mining and multidimensional scaling	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Supermarket layout; Retailing; Consumption universe; Association rule mining; Market basket analysis; Apriori algorithm; Multidimensional scaling	SHELF SPACE ALLOCATION; FACILITY LAYOUT; STORE ENVIRONMENT; RETAIL; PRODUCT; MODEL; ASSORTMENT; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMERS	The success of retail business is influenced by its fast response and its ability in understanding consumers' behaviors. Analysis of transaction data is the key for taking advantage of these new opportunities, which enables supermarkets to understand and predict customer behavior, has become a crucial technique for effective decision-making and strategy formation. We propose a methodological framework for the use of the knowledge discovery process and its visualization to improve store layout. This study examines the layout strategy in relation to supermarket retail stores and assists managers in developing better layout for supermarkets. We use the buying association measure to create a category correlation matrix and we apply the multidimensional scale technique to display the set of products in the store space. This is a new approach to supermarket layout from industrial categories to consumption universes that is consumer-oriented store layout approach through a data mining approach. This framework is useful for both academia and retail industry. For industry professionals, it may be used to guide development of successful layout. Retailers can utilize the proposed model to dynamically improve their in-store conversion rate. As the empirical study, a practical application proceeded for Migros Turk, a leading Turkish retailing company. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solutions described in this paper include high-level composition and deployment consisting of a scripting-based environment and a manager system based on an architecture description language (ADL), a dynamically managed pool of component containers, and interoperability with other component models such as Grid Component Model (GCM). We demonstrate how the proposed methodology can be implemented by combining the unique features of the Common Component Architecture (CCA) model together with the H2O resource sharing platform, resulting in the MOCCA component framework. Applications and tests include data mining using the Weka library, Monte Carlo simulation of the formation of clusters of gold atoms, as well as a set of synthetic benchmarks. The conclusion is that the component approach to scientific applications can be successfully applied to both grid and cloud infrastructures.

Density-preserving projections for large-scale local anomaly detection	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Anomaly detection; Dimensionality reduction	OUTLIERS; ALGORITHMS	Outlier or anomaly detection is a fundamental data mining task with the aim to identify data points, events, transactions which deviate from the norm. The identification of outliers in data can provide insights about the underlying data generating process. In general, outliers can be of two kinds: global and local. Global outliers are distinct with respect to the whole data set, while local outliers are distinct with respect to data points in their local neighbourhood. While several approaches have been proposed to scale up the process of global outlier discovery in large databases, this has not been the case for local outliers. We tackle this problem by optimising the use of local outlier factor (LOF) for large and high-dimensional data. We propose projection-indexed nearest-neighbours (PINN), a novel technique that exploits extended nearest-neighbour sets in a reduced-dimensional space to create an accurate approximation for k-nearest-neighbour distances, which is used as the core density measurement within LOF. The reduced dimensionality allows for efficient sub-quadratic indexing in the number of items in the data set, where previously only quadratic performance was possible. A detailed theoretical analysis of random projection (RP) and PINN shows that we are able to preserve the density of the intrinsic manifold of the data set after projection. Experimental results show that PINN outperforms the standard projection methods RP and PCA when measuring LOF for many high-dimensional real-world data sets of up to 300,000 elements and 102,600 dimensions. A further investigation into the use of high-dimensionality-specific indexing such as spatial approximate sample hierarchy (SASH) shows that our novel technique holds benefits over even these types of highly efficient indexing. We cement the practical applications of our novel technique with insights into what it means to find local outliers in real data including image and text data, and include potential applications for this knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a method for trajectory segmentation and sampling based on the representativeness of the (sub)trajectories in the MOD. In order to find the most representative subtrajectories, the following methodology is proposed. First, a novel global voting algorithm is performed, based on local density and trajectory similarity information. This method is applied for each segment of the trajectory, forming a local trajectory descriptor that represents line segment representativeness. The sequence of this descriptor over a trajectory gives the voting signal of the trajectory, where high values correspond to the most representative parts. Then, a novel segmentation algorithm is applied on this signal that automatically estimates the number of partitions and the partition borders, identifying homogenous partitions concerning their representativeness. Finally, a sampling method over the resulting segments yields the most representative subtrajectories in the MOD. Our experimental results in synthetic and real MOD verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, also in comparison with other sampling techniques.

The complex architecture of modern vehicles makes fault diagnosis and isolation a non-trivial task. The association mining isolates anomaly cases from the millions of service and claims records. ASTEK has shown 86% accuracy in correctly identifying the anomaly cases. The text mining subscribes to the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) ontology, which provides the necessary domain-specific knowledge. The root causes associated with the anomaly cases are identified by discovering frequent symptoms associated with the part failures along with the repair actions used to fix the part failures. The best-practice knowledge is disseminated to the dealers involved in the anomaly cases. ASTEK has been implemented as a prototype in the service and quality department of GM and its performance has been validated in the real life set up. On an average, the analysis time is reduced from few weeks to few minutes, which in real life industry are significant improvements.

Several recent studies have highlighted from a qualitative perspective the nature of these interactions and their utility in drug discovery. However, a common limitation is a lack of adequate tools to mine these interactions comprehensively, since exhaustive searches of the protein data bank are time-consuming and difficult to perform. Consequently, fundamental questions remain unanswered: How unique or how common are the protein-ligand interactions observed in a given drug design project when compared to all complexed structures in the protein data bank? Which interaction patterns might explain the affinity of a tool compound toward unwanted targets? To answer these questions and to enable the systematic and comprehensive study of protein-ligand interactions, we introduce PROLIX (Protein Ligand Interaction Explorer), a tool that uses sophisticated fingerprint representations of protein-ligand interaction patterns for rapid data mining in large crystal structure databases. Our implementation strategy pursues a branch-and-bound technique that enables mining against thousands of complexes within a few seconds. Key elements of PROLIX include (i) an intuitive interface that enables users to formulate complex queries easily, (ii) exceptional speed for results retrieval, and (iii) a sophisticated results summarization. Herein we describe the algorithms developed to enable complex queries and fast retrieval of search results, as well as the intuitive aspects of the user interface and summarization viewer.

In this study, an early warning system (EWS) model based on data mining for financial risk detection is presented. CHAID algorithm has been used for development of the EWS. Developed EWS can be served like a tailor made financial advisor in decision making process of the firms with its automated nature to the ones who have inadequate financial background. Besides, an application of the model implemented which covered 7853 SMEs based on Turkish Central Bank (TCB) 2007 data. By using EWS model, 31 risk profiles, 15 risk indicators, 2 early warning signals, and 4 financial road maps has been determined for financial risk mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Mining fuzzy association rules from low-quality data	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy association rules; Low-quality data	GENETIC ALGORITHM	Data mining is most commonly used in attempts to induce association rules from databases which can help decision-makers easily analyze the data and make good decisions regarding the domains concerned. Different studies have proposed methods for mining association rules from databases with crisp values. However, the data in many real-world applications have a certain degree of imprecision. In this paper we address this problem, and propose a new data-mining algorithm for extracting interesting knowledge from databases with imprecise data. The proposed algorithm integrates imprecise data concepts and the fuzzy apriori mining algorithm to find interesting fuzzy association rules in given databases. Experiments for diagnosing dyslexia in early childhood were made to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.	[Palacios, A. M.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Comp Sci, Gijon 33204, Spain; [Gacto, M.

OFP_CLASS: a hybrid method to generate optimized fuzzy partitions for classification	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy discretization; Fuzzy sets; Genetic algorithms; Fuzzy decision trees	DISCRETIZATION ALGORITHM; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; FEATURE-SELECTION; RULES; TREES; MODEL	The discretization of values plays a critical role in data mining and knowledge discovery. The representation of information through intervals is more concise and easier to understand at certain levels of knowledge than the representation by mean continuous values. In this paper, we propose a method for discretizing continuous attributes by means of fuzzy sets, which constitute a fuzzy partition of the domains of these attributes. This method carries out a fuzzy discretization of continuous attributes in two stages. A fuzzy decision tree is used in the first stage to propose an initial set of crisp intervals, while a genetic algorithm is used in the second stage to define the membership functions and the cardinality of the partitions. After defining the fuzzy partitions, we evaluate and compare them with previously existing ones in the literature.

PolarityRank: Finding an equilibrium between followers and contraries in a network	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ranking algorithms; Graphs; Relevance computing; Sentiment analysis; Data mining	LEARNING ALGORITHMS	In this paper we present the relevance ranking algorithm named PolarityRank. This algorithm is inspired in PageRank, the webpage relevance calculus method used by Google, and generalizes it to deal with graphs having not only positive but also negative weighted arcs. Besides the definition of our algorithm, this paper includes the algebraic justification, the convergence demonstration and an empirical study in which PolarityRank is applied to two unrelated tasks where a graph with positive and negative weights can be built: the calculation of word semantic orientation and instance selection from a learning dataset.

Both aspects have been assessed in a software effort estimation setting by previous studies. However, no univocal conclusion as to which technique is the most suited has been reached. This study addresses this issue by reporting on the results of a large scale benchmarking study. Different types of techniques are under consideration, including techniques inducing tree/rule-based models like M5 and CART, linear models such as various types of linear regression, nonlinear models (MARS, multilayered perceptron neural networks, radial basis function networks, and least squares support vector machines), and estimation techniques that do not explicitly induce a model (e.g., a case-based reasoning approach). Furthermore, the aspect of feature subset selection by using a generic backward input selection wrapper is investigated. The results are subjected to rigorous statistical testing and indicate that ordinary least squares regression in combination with a logarithmic transformation performs best. Another key finding is that by selecting a subset of highly predictive attributes such as project size, development, and environment related attributes, typically a significant increase in estimation accuracy can be obtained.

J	Lutu, PEN; Engelbrecht, AP				Lutu, Patricia E. N.; Engelbrecht, Andries P.			Using OVA modeling to improve classification performance for large datasets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Model aggregation; Ensemble classification; Boosting; OVA classification; Dataset selection; Dataset partitioning; Dataset sampling; ROC analysis	FEATURE-SELECTION; VARIANCE; BIAS	One-Versus-All (OVA) classification is a classifier construction method where a k-class prediction task is decomposed into k 2-class sub-problems. One base model is constructed for each sub-problem and the base models are then combined into one model. Aggregate model implementation is the process of constructing several base models which are then combined into a single model for prediction. In essence, OVA classification is a method of aggregate modeling. This paper reports studies that were conducted to establish whether OVA classification can provide predictive performance gains when large volumes of data are available for modeling as is commonly the case in data mining. It is demonstrated in this paper that firstly, OVA modeling can be used to increase the amount of training data while at the same time using base model training sets whose size is much smaller than the total amount of available training data. Secondly, OVA models created from large datasets provide a higher level of predictive performance compared to single k-class models. Thirdly, the use of boosted OVA base models can provide higher predictive performance compared to un-boosted OVA base models. Fourthly, when the combination algorithm for base model predictions is able to resolve tied predictions, the resulting aggregate models provide a higher level of predictive performance.

In this paper, we consider situations with linguistic, interval or fuzzy preference information, and develop some fuzzy ordered distance measures, such as linguistic ordered weighted distance measure, uncertain ordered weighted distance measure, linguistic hybrid weighted distance measure, and uncertain hybrid weighted distance measure, etc. After that, based on hybrid weighted distance measures, we establish a consensus reaching process of group decision making with linguistic, interval, triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy preference information.

J	Outrata, J; Vychodil, V				Outrata, Jan; Vychodil, Vilem			Fast algorithm for computing fixpoints of Galois connections induced by object-attribute relational data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Galois connection; Object-attribute data; Formal concept analysis; Frequent itemset mining	LATTICES	Fixpoints of Galois connections induced by object-attribute data tables represent important patterns that can be found in relational data. Such patterns are used in several data mining disciplines including formal concept analysis, frequent itemset and association rule mining, and Boolean factor analysis. In this paper we propose efficient algorithm for listing all fixpoints of Galois connections induced by object-attribute data. The algorithm, called FCbO, results as a modification of Kuznetsov's CbO in which we use more efficient canonicity test. We describe the algorithm, prove its correctness, discuss efficiency issues, and present an experimental evaluation of its performance and comparison with other algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In order to cope with this situation, decision makers in healthcare (managerial, administrative and/or clinical) need to be increasingly more effective and efficient at what they do. Along with expertise, information and knowledge are the other key sources for better decisions. Data mining techniques are becoming a popular tool for extracting information/knowledge hidden deep into large healthcare databases. In this study, using a large, feature-rich, nationwide inpatient databases along with four popular machine learning techniques, we developed predictive models; and using an information fusion based sensitivity analysis on these models, we explained the surgical outcome of a patient undergoing a coronary artery bypass grafting. In this study, support vector machines produced the best prediction results (87.74%) followed by decision trees and neural networks. Studies like this illustrate the fact that accurate prediction and better understanding of such complex medical interventions can potentially lead to more favorable outcomes and optimal use of limited healthcare resources.

J	Falavigna, G				Falavigna, Greta			Financial ratings with scarce information: A neural network approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Rating judgements; Artificial neural networks	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DATA MINING APPROACH; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; BANKS; FAILURE; MODELS; RATIOS	On a wake of Basel II Accord in 2004, banks and financial institutions can build an internal rating system. This work focuses on Italian small firms that are more hard to judge because quite often financial data are not simply available. The aim of this paper is to propose a simulation model for assigning rating judgements to these firms, using poor financial information. The proposed model produces a simulated counterpart of Bureau van Dijk-K Finance (BvD) rating judgements. It is clear that there are problems when small firms must be judged because it is difficult to obtain financial data; indeed in Italy these enterprises must deposit the balance-sheet in reduced form. Suggested methodology is a three-layer process where each of them is formed by, respectively, one, two and four feed-forward artificial neural networks with back-propagation algorithm. The proposed model is a good solution for evaluating small firms with poor financial information but not only: the research underlines and supports the ability of artificial neural networks of learning and reproducing some aspects or some features or behaviours of reality.

However, current algorithms for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences use very restrictive definitions of sequential rules, which make them unable to recognize that similar rules can describe a same phenomenon. This can have many undesirable effects such as (1) similar rules that are rated differently, (2) rules that are not found because they are considered uninteresting when taken individually, (3) and rules that are too specific, which makes them less likely to be used for making predictions. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a more general form of sequential rules such that items in the antecedent and in the consequent of each rule are unordered. We propose an algorithm named CMRules for mining this form of rules. The algorithm proceeds by first finding association rules to prune the search space for items that occur jointly in many sequences. Then it eliminates association rules that do not meet the minimum confidence and support thresholds according to the sequential ordering. We evaluate the performance of CMRules in three different ways. First, we provide an analysis of its time complexity. Second, we compare its performance (in terms of execution time, memory usage and scalability) with an adaptation of an algorithm from the literature that we name CMDeo. For this comparison, we use three real-life public datasets, which have different characteristics and represent three kinds of data. In many cases, results show that CMRules is faster and has a better scalability for low support thresholds than CMDeo. Lastly, we report a successful application of the algorithm in a tutoring agent.

J	Huang, CF				Huang, Chien-Feng			A hybrid stock selection model using genetic algorithms and support vector regression	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Stock selection; Support vector regression; Genetic algorithms; Parameter optimization; Feature selection; Model validation	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINES; PREDICTION; RETURNS; MARKET; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; RATIOS	In the areas of investment research and applications, feasible quantitative models include methodologies stemming from soft computing for prediction of financial time series, multi-objective optimization of investment return and risk reduction, as well as selection of investment instruments for portfolio management based on asset ranking using a variety of input variables and historical data, etc. Among all these, stock selection has long been identified as a challenging and important task. This line of research is highly contingent upon reliable stock ranking for successful portfolio construction. Recent advances in machine learning and data mining are leading to significant opportunities to solve these problems more effectively. In this study, we aim at developing a methodology for effective stock selection using support vector regression (SVR) as well as genetic algorithms (GAs). We first employ the SVR method to generate surrogates for actual stock returns that in turn serve to provide reliable rankings of stocks. Top-ranked stocks can thus be selected to form a portfolio. On top of this model, the GA is employed for the optimization of model parameters, and feature selection to acquire optimal subsets of input variables to the SVR model. We will show that the investment returns provided by our proposed methodology significantly outperform the benchmark. Based upon these promising results, we expect this hybrid GA-SVR methodology to advance the research in soft computing for finance and provide an effective solution to stock selection in practice.

Thus, this paper describes some new advances for the detection of non-technical losses in the customers of one of the most important power utilities of Spain and Latin America: Endesa Company. The study is within the framework of the MIDAS project that is being developed at the Electronic Technology Department of the University of Seville with the funding of this company. The advances presented in this article have an objective of detecting customers with anomalous drops in their consumed energy (the most-frequent symptom of a non-technical loss in a customer) by means of a windowed analysis with the use of the Pearson coefficient. On the other hand, besides Bayesian networks, decision trees have been used for detecting other types of patterns of non-technical loss. The algorithms have been tested with real customers of the database of Endesa Company. Currently, the system is in operation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As an alternative, elderly care can be provided through home-based, automatic, health-monitoring systems. Here we propose data-mining algorithms in a system for the automatic recognition of health problems, activities and falls through the analysis of gait. The gait of the elderly is captured using a motion-capture system and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with a data-mining approach in order to classify it into five health states: 1) normal, 2) with hemiplegia, 3) with Parkinson's disease, 4) with pain in the back and 5) with pain in the leg, or into five activities/falls: 1) accidental fall, 2) unconscious fall, 3) walking, 4) standing/sitting, 5) lying down/lying. We propose and analyze four data-mining approaches: 1) CML - Classical machine-learning approach with raw sensor data, 2) SCML - Classical machine-learning approach with semantic attributes, 3) MDTW - Multidimensional dynamic time-warping approach with raw sensor data and 4) SMDTW Multidimensional dynamic time-warping approach with semantic attributes. According to the results of the experiments, SMDTW achieved the highest classification accuracy of the four proposed approaches, and transforming the raw data into the semantic attributes significantly improved the performance of the approaches. Since the observed health problems are related also to postural instability and danger of falling, their early detection helps to prevent elderly people from falling.

As web applications adopt input sanitization routines to prevent web security risks, static code attributes that represent the characteristics of these routines may be useful for predicting web application vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify various input sanitization methods into different types and propose a set of static code attributes that represent these types. Then we use data mining methods to predict SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications. Preliminary experiments show that our proposed attributes are important indicators of such vulnerabilities.

A new variational Bayesian algorithm with application to human mobility pattern modeling	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Variational Bayes (VB); Gaussian mixture model (GMM); Component splitting; Human mobility pattern; Data mining	MIXTURE-MODELS; UNKNOWN NUMBER; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPONENTS	A new variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm, split and eliminate VB (SEVB), for modeling data via a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is developed. This new algorithm makes use of component splitting in a way that is more appropriate for analyzing a large number of highly heterogeneous spiky spatial patterns with weak prior information than existing VB-based approaches. SEVB is a highly computationally efficient approach to Bayesian inference and like any VB-based algorithm it can perform model selection and parameter value estimation simultaneously. A significant feature of our algorithm is that the fitted number of components is not limited by the initial proposal giving increased modeling flexibility. We introduce two types of split operation in addition to proposing a new goodness-of-fit measure for evaluating mixture models. We evaluate their usefulness through empirical studies. In addition, we illustrate the utility of our new approach in an application on modeling human mobility patterns. This application involves large volumes of highly heterogeneous spiky data; it is difficult to model this type of data well using the standard VB approach as it is too restrictive and lacking in the flexibility required. Empirical results suggest that our algorithm has also improved upon the goodness-of-fit that would have been achieved using the standard VB method, and that it is also more robust to various initialization settings.

However, how to effectively use and update discovered patterns is still an open research issue, especially in the domain of text mining. Since most existing text mining methods adopted term-based approaches, they all suffer from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. Over the years, people have often held the hypothesis that pattern (or phrase)-based approaches should perform better than the term-based ones, but many experiments do not support this hypothesis. This paper presents an innovative and effective pattern discovery technique which includes the processes of pattern deploying and pattern evolving, to improve the effectiveness of using and updating discovered patterns for finding relevant and interesting information. Substantial experiments on RCV1 data collection and TREC topics demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves encouraging performance.

J	Koufakou, A; Secretan, J; Georgiopoulos, M				Koufakou, Anna; Secretan, Jimmy; Georgiopoulos, Michael			Non-derivable itemsets for fast outlier detection in large high-dimensional categorical data	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Anomaly detection; Frequent itemset mining; Non-Derivable itemsets; Categorical datasets	DATA SETS; ALGORITHMS	Detecting outliers in a dataset is an important data mining task with many applications, such as detection of credit card fraud or network intrusions. Traditional methods assume numerical data and compute pair-wise distances among points. Recently, outlier detection methods were proposed for categorical and mixed-attribute data using the concept of Frequent Itemsets (FIs). These methods face challenges when dealing with large high-dimensional data, where the number of generated FIs can be extremely large. To address this issue, we propose several outlier detection schemes inspired by the well-known condensed representation of FIs, Non-Derivable Itemsets (NDIs). Specifically, we contrast a method based on frequent NDIs, FNDI-OD, and a method based on the negative border of NDIs, NBNDI-OD, with their previously proposed FI-based counterparts. We also explore outlier detection based on Non-Almost Derivable Itemsets (NADIs), which approximate the NDIs in the data given a delta parameter. Our proposed methods use a far smaller collection of sets than the FI collection in order to compute an anomaly score for each data point. Experiments on real-life data show that, as expected, methods based on NDIs and NADIs offer substantial advantages in terms of speed and scalability over FI-based Outlier Detection method. What is significant is that NDI-based methods exhibit similar or better detection accuracy compared to the FI-based methods, which supports our claim that the NDI representation is especially well-suited for the task of detecting outliers. At the same time, the NDI approximation scheme, NADIs is shown to exhibit similar accuracy to the NDI-based method for various delta values and further runtime performance gains. Finally, we offer an in-depth discussion and experimentation regarding the trade-offs of the proposed algorithms and the choice of parameter values.

Several commercial and academic platforms have been built, and many institutions have deployed these products to help their investigators find local collaborators. Recent studies, though, have shown the growing importance of multiuniversity teams in science. Unfortunately, the lack of a standard data-exchange model and resistance of universities to share information about their faculty have presented barriers to forming an institutionally supported national network. This case report describes an initiative, which, in only 6 months, achieved interoperability among seven major research-networking products at 28 universities by taking an approach that focused on addressing institutional concerns and encouraging their participation. With this necessary groundwork in place, the second phase of this effort can begin, which will expand the network's functionality and focus on the end users.

Their detection usually relies on voluntary reporting or medical chart reviews. The objective of this paper is to automatically detect cases of ADEs by data mining. 115 447 complete past hospital stays are extracted from six French, Danish, and Bulgarian hospitals using a common data model including diagnoses, drug administrations, laboratory results, and free-text records. Different kinds of outcomes are traced, and supervised rule induction methods (decision trees and association rules) are used to discover ADE detection rules, with respect to time constraints. The rules are then filtered, validated, and reorganized by a committee of experts. The rules are described in a rule repository, and several statistics are automatically computed in every medical department, such as the confidence, relative risk, and median delay of outcome appearance. 236 validated ADE-detection rules are discovered; they enable to detect 27 different kinds of outcomes. The rules use a various number of conditions related to laboratory results, diseases, drug administration, and demographics. Some rules involve innovative conditions, such as drug discontinuations.

J	De Bie, T				De Bie, Tijl			Maximum entropy models and subjective interestingness: an application to tiles in binary databases	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Maximum entropy principle; Subjective interestingness measures; Prior information; Rectangular databases; Swap randomizations	COMPLEX NETWORKS	Recent research has highlighted the practical benefits of subjective interestingness measures, which quantify the novelty or unexpectedness of a pattern when contrasted with any prior information of the data miner (Silberschatz and Tuzhilin, Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD95), 1995; Geng and Hamilton, ACM Comput Surv 38(3):9, 2006). A key challenge here is the formalization of this prior information in a way that lends itself to the definition of a subjective interestingness measure that is both meaningful and practical. In this paper, we outline a general strategy of how this could be achieved, before working out the details for a use case that is important in its own right. Our general strategy is based on considering prior information as constraints on a probabilistic model representing the uncertainty about the data. More specifically, we represent the prior information by the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution subject to these constraints. We briefly outline various measures that could subsequently be used to contrast patterns with this MaxEnt model, thus quantifying their subjective interestingness. We demonstrate this strategy for rectangular databases with knowledge of the row and column sums. This situation has been considered before using computation intensive approaches based on swap randomizations, allowing for the computation of empirical p-values as interestingness measures (Gionis et al., ACM Trans Knowl Discov Data 1(3):14, 2007). We show how the MaxEnt model can be computed remarkably efficiently in this situation, and how it can be used for the same purpose as swap randomizations but computationally more efficiently. More importantly, being an explicitly represented distribution, the MaxEnt model can additionally be used to define analytically computable interestingness measures, as we demonstrate for tiles (Geerts et al., Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Discovery science (DS04), 2004) in binary databases.

As data is constantly arriving, time for processing is limited. Clustering has to be performed in a single pass over the incoming data and within the possibly varying inter-arrival times of the stream. Likewise, memory is limited, making it impossible to store all data. For clustering, we are faced with the challenge of maintaining a current result that can be presented to the user at any given time. In this work, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that automatically adapts to the speed of the data stream. It makes best use of the time available under the current constraints to provide a clustering of the objects seen up to that point. Our approach incorporates the age of the objects to reflect the greater importance of more recent data. For efficient and effective handling, we introduce the ClusTree, a compact and self-adaptive index structure for maintaining stream summaries. Additionally we present solutions to handle very fast streams through aggregation mechanisms and propose novel descent strategies that improve the clustering result on slower streams as long as time permits. Our experiments show that our approach is capable of handling a multitude of different stream characteristics for accurate and scalable anytime stream clustering.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of excitatory networks which are essentially temporal models where all connections are stimulative, rather than inhibitive. The emphasis on excitatory connections facilitates learning of network models by creating bridges to frequent episode mining. Specifically, we show that frequent episodes help identify nodes with high mutual information relationships and that such relationships can be summarized into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). This leads to an algorithm that is significantly faster than state-of-the-art methods for inferring DBNs, while simultaneously providing theoretical guarantees on network optimality. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through an application in neuroscience, where we show how strong excitatory networks can be efficiently inferred from both mathematical models of spiking neurons and several real neuroscience datasets.

J	Sut, N; Simsek, O				Sut, Necdet; Simsek, Osman			Comparison of regression tree data mining methods for prediction of mortality in head injury	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Regression tree; Classification; Head injury; Mortality	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABLES	With this research, we sought to examine the performance of six different regression tree data mining methods to predict mortality in head injury. Using a data set consisting of 1603 head injury cases, we assessed the performance of: the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method; the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) method; the Exhaustive CHAID (E-CHAID) method; the Quick, Unbiased, Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST) method; the Random Forest Regression and Classification (RFRC) method; and the Boosted Tree Classifiers and Regression (BTCR) method, in each case based on sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive, and accuracy rates. Next, we compared their areas under the (Receiver Operating Characteristic) ROC curves. Finally, we examined whether they could be grouped in meaningful clusters with hierarchical cluster analysis. Areas under the ROC curves of regression tree data mining methods ranged from 0.801 to 0.954 (p < 0.001 for all). In predicting mortality in head injury under the ROC curve, the BTCR method achieved both the highest area (0.954) and accuracy rate (93.0%), while the CART method achieved both the lowest area (0.801) and accuracy rate (91.1%). All of the regression tree data mining methods were clustered in the same grouping, but the BTCR method was at the origin of the cluster while the CART and QUEST methods produced results that were least like the others. The BTCR, demonstrating a 93.0% accuracy rate and showing statistically significantly differences from the others, may be a helpful tool in medical decision-making for predicting mortality in head injury.

J	Tang, L; Liu, H				Tang, Lei; Liu, Huan			Leveraging social media networks for classification	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Social media; Social network analysis; Relational learning; Within-network classification; Collective inference	SCHOOL	Social media has reshaped the way in which people interact with each other. The rapid development of participatory web and social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, also brings about many data mining opportunities and novel challenges. In particular, we focus on classification tasks with user interaction information in a social network. Networks in social media are heterogeneous, consisting of various relations. Since the relation-type information may not be available in social media, most existing approaches treat these inhomogeneous connections homogeneously, leading to an unsatisfactory classification performance. In order to handle the network heterogeneity, we propose the concept of social dimension to represent actors' latent affiliations, and develop a classification framework based on that. The proposed framework, SocioDim, first extracts social dimensions based on the network structure to accurately capture prominent interaction patterns between actors, then learns a discriminative classifier to select relevant social dimensions. SocioDim, by differentiating different types of network connections, outperforms existing representative methods of classification in social media, and offers a simple yet effective approach to integrating two types of seemingly orthogonal information: the network of actors and their attributes.

J	Wozniak, M				Wozniak, Michal			A hybrid decision tree training method using data streams	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Nested generalized exemplar; Nearest hyperrectangle; Concept drift; Decision tree; Incremental learning; Pattern recognition	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	Classical classification methods usually assume that pattern recognition models do not depend on the timing of the data. However, this assumption is not valid in cases where new data frequently become available. Such situations are common in practice, for example, spam filtering or fraud detection, where dependencies between feature values and class numbers are continually changing. Unfortunately, most classical machine learning methods (such as decision trees) do not take into consideration the possibility of the model changing, as a result of so-called concept drift and they cannot adapt to a new classification model. This paper focuses on the problem of concept drift, which is a very important issue, especially in data mining methods that use complex structures (such as decision trees) for making decisions. We propose an algorithm that is able to co-train decision trees using a modified NGE (Nested Generalized Exemplar) algorithm. The potential for adaptation of the proposed algorithm and the quality thereof are evaluated through computer experiments, carried out on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

J	Chen, SS; Huang, TCK; Lin, ZM				Chen, Shih-Sheng; Huang, Tony Cheng-Kui; Lin, Zhe-Min			New and efficient knowledge discovery of partial periodic patterns with multiple minimum supports	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Data mining; Partial periodicity; FP-tree; Multiple minimum supports	TIME-SERIES DATABASES	The problem of mining partial periodic patterns is an important issue with many applications. Previous studies to find these patterns encounter efficiency and effectiveness problem. The efficiency problem is that most previous methods were proposed to find frequent partial periodic patterns by extending the well-known Apriori-like algorithm. However, these methods generate many candidate partial periodic patterns to calculate the patterns' supports, spending much time for discovering patterns. The effective problem is that only one minimum support threshold is set to find frequent partial periodic patterns but the results is not practical for real-world. In real-life circumstances, some rare or specific events may occur with lower frequencies but their occurrences may offer some vital information to be referred in decision making. If the minimum support is set too high, the associations between events along with higher and lower frequencies cannot be evaluated so that significant knowledge will be ignored. In this study, an algorithm to overcome these two problems has been proposed to generating redundant candidate patterns and setting only one minimum support threshold. The algorithm greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness. First, it eliminates the need to generate numerous candidate partial periodic patterns thus reducing database scanning. Second, the minimum support threshold of each event can be specified based in its real-life occurring frequency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Apiletti, D; Baralis, E; Cerquitelli, T				Apiletti, Daniele; Baralis, Elena; Cerquitelli, Tania			Energy-saving models for wireless sensor networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; Energy-saving models; Data mining; Clustering; Data stream analysis	PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM	Nowadays, wireless sensor networks are being used for a fast-growing number of different application fields (e.g., habitat monitoring, highway traffic monitoring, remote surveillance). Monitoring (i.e., querying) the sensor network entails the frequent acquisition of measurements from all sensors. Since sensor data acquisition and communication are the main sources of power consumption and sensors are battery-powered, an important issue in this context is energy saving during data collection. Hence, the challenge is to extend sensor lifetime by reducing communication cost and computation energy. This paper thoroughly describes the complete design, implementation and validation of the SeReNe framework. Given historical sensor readings, SeReNe discovers energy-saving models to efficiently acquire sensor network data. SeReNe exploits different clustering algorithms to discover spatial and temporal correlations which allow the identification of sets of correlated sensors and sensor data streams. Given clusters of correlated sensors, a subset of representative sensors is selected. Rather than directly querying all network nodes, only the representative sensors are queried by reducing the communication, computation and power costs. Experiments performed on both a real sensor network deployed at the Politecnico di Torino labs and a publicly available dataset from Intel Berkeley Research lab demonstrate the adaptability and the effectiveness of the SeReNe framework in providing energy-saving sensor network models.

J	Garg, R; Smith, MD; Telang, R				Garg, Rajiv; Smith, Michael D.; Telang, Rahul			Measuring Information Diffusion in an Online Community	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; empirical research; information diffusion; new content discovery; online music community; peer influence; social influence	WORD-OF-MOUTH; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS; PRODUCT REVIEWS; COMMUNICATION; INTERNET; BEHAVIOR; SALES; IDENTIFICATION; CONVERSATIONS; INFLUENTIALS	Measuring peer influence in social networks is an important business and policy question that has become increasingly salient with the development of globally interconnected information and communication technology networks. However, in spite of the new data sources available today, researchers still face many of the same measurement challenges that have been present in the literature for over four decades: homophily, reflection and selection problems, identifying the source of influence, and determining preexisting knowledge. The goal of this paper is to develop an empirical approach for measuring information diffusion and discovery in online social networks that have these measurement challenges. We develop such an approach and apply it to data collected from 4,000 users of an online music community. We show that peers on such networks significantly increase music discovery. Moreover, we demonstrate how future research can use this method to measure information discovery and diffusion using data from other online social networks.

ILP has become a popular subject in the field of data mining due to its ability to discover patterns in relational domains. Several ILP-based concept discovery systems are developed which employs various search strategies, heuristics and language pattern limitations. LINUS, GOLEM, CIGOL, MIS, FOIL, PROGOL, ALEPH and WARMR are well-known ILP-based systems. In this work, firstly introductory information about ILP is given, and then the above-mentioned systems and an ILP-based concept discovery system called (CD)-D-2 are briefly described and the fundamentals of their mechanisms are demonstrated on a running example.

In the case of arrays with nonnegative entries, the low-rank approximation problem is well posed. In addition, due to the large dimension of the problem, the decomposition can be rather efficiently calculated with the help of preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithms, as subsequently shown, if equipped with an algebraic calculation of the globally optimal stepsize in low dimension. Other algorithms are also studied (gradient and quasi-Newton approaches) for comparisons. Two versions of each algorithm are considered: the enhanced line search version (ELS), and the backtracking version alternating with ELS. Computer simulations are provided and demonstrate the good behavior of these algorithms dedicated to nonnegative arrays, compared to others put forward in the literature. Finally, applications in the context of data analysis illustrate various algorithms. The main advantage of the suggested approach is to explicitly take into account the nonnegative nature of the loading matrices in the problem parameterization, instead of enforcing positive entries by projection. According to the experiments we have run, such an approach also happens to be more robust with respect to possible modeling errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shi, Y; Zhang, L				Shi, Yong; Zhang, Li			COID: A cluster-outlier iterative detection approach to multi-dimensional data analysis	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; Outlier detection; Multi-dimensional data; Cluster and outlier diversity		Nowadays, most data mining algorithms focus on clustering methods alone. Also, there are a lot of approaches designed for outlier detection. We observe that, in many situations, clusters and outliers are concepts whose meanings are inseparable to each other, especially for those data sets with noise. Thus, it is necessary to treat both clusters and outliers as concepts of the same importance in data analysis. In this paper, we present our continuous work on the cluster-outlier iterative detection algorithm (Shi in SubCOID: exploring cluster-outlier iterative detection approach to multi-dimensional data analysis in subspace. Auburn, pp. 132-135, 2008; Shi and Zhang in Towards exploring interactive relationship between clusters and outliers in multi-dimensional data analysis. IEEE Computer Society. Tokyo, pp. 518-519, 2005) to detect the clusters and outliers in another perspective for noisy data sets. In this algorithm, clusters are detected and adjusted according to the intra-relationship within clusters and the inter-relationship between clusters and outliers, and vice versa. The adjustment and modification of the clusters and outliers are performed iteratively until a certain termination condition is reached. This data processing algorithm can be applied in many fields, such as pattern recognition, data clustering, and signal processing. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Especially dimension reduction combined with feature fusion is an effective preprocessing step when the data are described by multiple feature sets. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Discriminative Canonical Correlation Analysis ( DCCA) are feature fusion methods based on correlation. However, they are different in that DCCA is a supervised method utilizing class label information, while CCA is an unsupervised method. It has been shown that the classification performance of DCCA is superior to that of CCA due to the discriminative power using class label information. On the other hand, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised dimension reduction method and it is known as a special case of CCA. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between DCCA and LDA, showing that the projective directions by DCCA are equal to the ones obtained from LDA with respect to an orthogonal transformation. Using the relation with LDA, we propose a new method that can enhance the performance of DCCA. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better classification performance than the original DCCA.

J	Huang, ZX; Lu, XD; Duan, HL				Huang, Zhengxing; Lu, Xudong; Duan, Huilong			Mining association rules to support resource allocation in business process management	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rules; Data mining; Resource allocation; Business process management	STAFF ASSIGNMENT; RECOMMENDATION	Resource allocation is of great importance for business process management. In business process execution, a set of rules that specify resource allocation is always implied. Although many approaches have been offered to support resource allocation, they are not sufficient to derive interesting resource allocation rules which ensure that each activity is performed by suitable resource. Hence, this paper introduces an association rule mining based approach to mine interesting resource allocation rules from event log. The idea is to concern the ordered correlations between items in event log, and then to present two efficient algorithms to mine real "interesting" rules. The event log of radiology CT-scan examination process provided by the Chinese Huzhou hospital is used to verify the proposed approach. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach not only is able to extract the rules more efficient and much faster, but also can discover more important resource allocation rules.

J	Wang, YT; Cheng, JT				Wang, Yao-Te; Cheng, Ju-Tzu			Mining periodic movement patterns of mobile phone users based on an efficient sampling approach	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Sampling; Sequential pattern; Periodic maximal promising movement pattern	PREDICTION	In m-commerce services, the periodic movement trends of customers at specific periods can be adopted to allocate the resources of telecommunications systems effectively and offer personalized location-based services. This study explores the mining of periodic maximal promising movement patterns. A detailed process for mining periodic maximal promising movement patterns based on graph mapping and sampling techniques is devised to enhance mining efficiency. First, a random sample of movement paths from time intervals is taken. Second, a unique path graph structure is built to store the movement paths obtained from the sample. Third, a graph traversal algorithm is developed to identify the maximal promising movement patterns. Finally, vector operations are undertaken to examine the maximal promising movement patterns in order to derive the periodic maximal promising movement patterns. Experimental results reveal that the sampling approach with mining has excellent execution efficiency and scalability in the investigation of periodic maximal promising movement patterns.

Dynamic discreduction using Rough Sets	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Rough Set; Discretization; Classification; Data mining; TRIP steel	RETAINED AUSTENITE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TRIP STEELS; MICROSTRUCTURE; DISCRETIZATION; TRANSFORMATION; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Discretization of continuous attributes is a necessary pre-requisite in deriving association rules and discovery of knowledge from databases. The derived rules are simpler and intuitively more meaningful if only a small number of attributes are used, and each attribute is discretized into a few intervals. The present research paper explores the interrelation between discretization and reduction of attributes. A method has been developed that uses Rough Set Theory and notions of Statistics to merge the two tasks into a single seamless process named dynamic discreduction. The method is tested on benchmark data sets and the results are compared with those obtained by existing state-of-the-art techniques. A real life data on TRIP steel is also analysed using the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Though these people may try to use many different tactics to discover deception, previous research tells us that this cannot be accomplished successfully without aid. This manuscript reports on the promising results of a research study where data and text mining methods along with a sample of real-world data from a high-stakes situation is used to detect deception. At the end, the information fusion based classification models produced better than 74% classification accuracy on the holdout sample using a 10-fold cross validation methodology. Nonetheless, artificial neural networks and decision trees produced accuracy rates of 73.46% and 71.60% respectively. However, due to the high stakes associated with these types of decisions, the extra effort of combining the models to achieve higher accuracy is well warranted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, P; Zhu, QS; Huang, B				Yang, Peng; Zhu, Qingsheng; Huang, Biao			Spectral clustering with density sensitive similarity function	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Spectral clustering; Random walk; Density sensitive; Similarity function		In recent years, spectral clustering has become quite popular for data analysis because it can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra tools and do not suffer from the problem of local optima. The clustering effect by using such spectral method, however, depends heavily on the description of similarity between instances of the datasets. In this paper, we defined the adjustable line segment length which can adjust the distance in regions with different density. It squeezes the distances in high density regions while widen them in low density regions. And then a density sensitive distance measure satisfied by symmetric, non-negative, reflexivity and triangle inequality was present, by which we can define a new similarity function for spectral clustering. Experimental results show that compared with conventional Euclidean distance based and Gaussian kernel function based spectral clustering, our proposed algorithm with density sensitive similarity measure can obtain desirable clusters with high performance on both synthetic and real life datasets.

J	Yeh, DY; Cheng, CH; Chen, YW				Yeh, Duen-Yian; Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Chen, Yen-Wen			A predictive model for cerebrovascular disease using data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cerebrovascular disease; Data mining; Decision tree; Predictive model	NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS; HYPERTENSION; SYSTEM; QUALITY; CARE	Cerebrovascular disease has been ranked the second or third of top 10 death causes in Taiwan and has caused about 13,000 people death every year since 1986. Once cerebrovascular disease occurs, it not only leads to huge cost of medical care, but even death. All developed countries in the world put cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment in high priority, and invested considerable budget and human resource in long-term studies, in order to reduce the heavy burden. As the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease is complex and variable, it is hard to make accurate diagnosis in advance. However, in perspective of preventive medicine, it is necessary to build a predictive model to enhance the accurate diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, coupled with the 2007 cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment program of a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan, this study aimed to apply the classification technology to construct an optimum cerebrovascular disease predictive model. From this predictive model, cerebrovascular disease classification rules were extracted and used to improve the diagnosis and prediction of cerebrovascular disease. This study acquired 493 valid samples from this cerebrovascular disease prevention and treatment program, and adopted three classification algorithms, decision tree, Bayesian classifier and back propagation neural network, to construct classification models, respectively. After analyzing and comparing classification efficiencies - sensitivity and accuracy, the decision tree constructed model was chosen as the optimum predictive model for cerebrovascular disease. In this model, the sensitivity and accuracy were 99.48% and 99.59%, respectively, and eight important influence factors of predicting cerebrovascular disease and 16 diagnosis classification rules were extracted. Five experienced cerebrovascular doctors assessed these rules, and confirmed them to be useful to the current clinical medical condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A log-linear approach to mining significant graph-relational patterns	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Significant patterns; Log-linear models; Link-based data; Graphical models	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DATABASES; EFFICIENT; NETWORKS; RULES	Objects in many application domains can be characterized as link-based data, having both network (graph) information as well as structured information describing the nodes. Discovery of frequent patterns in this setting is vulnerable to problems that cannot occur in pattern mining on conventional data without network information. While patterns may appear to reflect novel characteristics of a combination of graph and node information, they may be expected based on patterns that could be found using conventional data mining techniques. We introduce a significance measure that identifies patterns that are unexpected based on node attributes in isolation and neighbor correlations. A statistical log-linear model is extended for this purpose and the structural symmetry of the link-based data is accounted for. Eliminating insignificant results reduces the output quantity by orders of magnitude. Efficiency is achieved by designing the pattern mining algorithm as a hybrid of conventional pattern mining and graph data mining.

J	da Silva, FAB; Senger, H				da Silva, Fabricio A. B.; Senger, Hermes			Scalability limits of Bag-of-Tasks applications running on hierarchical platforms	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Multiprocessor systems; Scheduling and task partitioning; Scalability	HETEROGENEOUS CLUSTERS; INDEPENDENT TASKS; SHARING FILES; NETWORKS; GRIDS	Bag-of-Tasks applications are parallel applications composed of independent (i.e., embarrassingly parallel) tasks, which do not communicate with each other, may depend upon one or more input files, and can be executed in any order. Each file may be input for more than one task. Examples of Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) applications include Monte Carlo simulations, massive searches (such as key breaking), image manipulation applications and data mining algorithms. A common framework to execute BoT applications is the master-slave topology, in which the user machine is used to control the execution of tasks. In this scenario, a large number of concurrent tasks competing for resources (e.g.. CPU and communication links) severely limits application execution scalability. This paper is devoted to study the scalability of BoT applications running on multi-node systems (such as clusters and multi-clusters) organized as hierarchical platforms, considering several communication paradigms. Our study employs a set of experiments that involves the simulation of various large-scale platforms. The results presented provide important guidelines for improving the scalability of practical applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[da Silva, Fabricio A.

NAVIGALA: AN ORIGINAL SYMBOL CLASSIFIER BASED ON NAVIGATION THROUGH A GALOIS LATTICE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Supervised classification; Galois (or concept) lattice; decision tree; graphical documents; graphical symbols recognition		This paper deals with a supervised classification method, using Galois Lattices based on a navigation-based strategy. Coming from the field of data mining techniques, most literature on the subject using Galois lattices relies on selection-based strategies, which consists of selecting/choosing the concepts which encode the most relevant information from the huge amount of available data. Generally, the classification step is then processed by a classical classifier such as the k-nearest neighbors rule or the Bayesian classifier. Opposed to these selection-based strategies are navigation-based approaches which perform the classification stage by navigating through the complete lattice (similar to the navigation in a classification tree), without applying any selection operation. Our approach, named Navigala, proposes an original navigation-based approach for supervised classification, applied in the context of noisy symbol recognition. Based on a state of the art dealing with Galois Lattices classification based methods, including a comparison between possible selection and navigation strategies, this paper proposes a description of NAVIGALA and its implementation in the context of symbol recognition. Some objective quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the approach are proposed, in order to highlight the relevance of the method.

Classification through incremental max-min separability	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Data mining; Data analysis; Supervised learning; Piecewise linear classifier	PIECEWISE-LINEAR CLASSIFIERS; DESIGN	Piecewise linear functions can be used to approximate non-linear decision boundaries between pattern classes. Piecewise linear boundaries are known to provide efficient real-time classifiers. However, they require a long training time. Finding piecewise linear boundaries between sets is a difficult optimization problem. Most approaches use heuristics to avoid solving this problem, which may lead to suboptimal piecewise linear boundaries. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for globally training hyperplanes using an incremental approach. Such an approach allows one to find a near global minimizer of the classification error function and to compute as few hyperplanes as needed for separating sets. We apply this algorithm for solving supervised data classification problems and report the results of numerical experiments on real-world data sets. These results demonstrate that the new algorithm requires a reasonable training time and its test set accuracy is consistently good on most data sets compared with mainstream classifiers.

Constructing credit auditing and control & management model with data mining technique	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						CRISP-DM model; Credit card; Data mining; Artificial neural network (ANN); Decision tree		The 2008 financial tsunami, hitting the globe across all types of industries, causing tides of bankruptcies and severe unemployment, had its epicenter at American subprime in the housing market. In fact, the US subprime storm was just a premonition, while the root cause of the financial tsunami lied in the oversupply of structured credit products. Credit card business, one of the structured credit products, which under an intensively competitive environment, have been released by many banks with high spread, high return, and easy-to-apply appeals to carter to consumers needs. In order to allure the customers, some banks even go to the extent as simplify the credit rating, which in turn has increased credit risk, causing high non-performing ratio, increased debt collection cost, and growing bad debt counts. Accordingly, credit risk auditing plays a vital role in the successful management of credit card business. In response to such needs, the present study aims to conduct analysis and investigation on the current status of the industry with CRISP-DM model. First, customers' demographic data and payment-related statistics were analyzed to identify feature variables, which were then sorted out as demographic data, debt data, payment rating etc. Next, by utilizing artificial neural network of data mining technique, the study tries to predict customer's regular pattern of consumption, payment and/or default and bad debt, and to develop a set of credit granting principle by employing the decision tree technique. Since data mining classification model has a greater power in discriminating credit card granting, it can thus be used to construct accurate credit variable rules and predictive model, to further improve credit checking effect and credit risk control. Using the credit auditing data of a certain bank as a case study, the study intends to verify that the model constructed by the researcher can effectively identify the potential key factors of its credit card granting rule, to minimize the cost loss of Model I and Model II credit business, and eventually enhance the stability and profitability of the bank's credit card business.

Basically, time series are decomposed into short segments, and short-term trends of the time series within the segments (e.g., average, slope, and curvature) are described by means of polynomial models. Then, the classifiers assess short sequences of trends in subsequent segments with their rule premises. The conclusions gradually assign an input to a class. As the classifier is a generative model of the processes from which the time series are assumed to originate, anomalies can be detected, too. Segmentation and piecewise polynomial modeling are done extremely fast in only one pass over the time series. Thus, the approach is applicable to problems with harsh timing constraints. We lay the theoretical foundations for this classifier, including a new distance measure for time series and a new technique to construct a dynamic classifier from a static one, and demonstrate its properties by means of various benchmark time series, for example, Lorenz attractor time series, energy consumption in a building, or ECG data.

Michael			A Potential Causal Association Mining Algorithm for Screening Adverse Drug Reactions in Postmarketing Surveillance	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Adverse drug reactions (ADRs); data mining; fuzzy logic; postmarketing surveillance; potential causal association rules (PCARs); recognition-primed decision model (RPD)	CONVERTING ENZYME-INHIBITORS; SIGNAL GENERATION; SAFETY; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; SYSTEM	Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, "A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model," Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, " A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making," in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16 206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.

However, it takes a certain period of time to assess which failures occur most frequently. In an empirical investigation of the Firefox and Thunderbird crash report databases, we found that only 10 to 20 crashes account for the large majority of crash reports; predicting these "top crashes" thus could dramatically increase software quality. By training a machine learner on the features of top crashes of past releases, we can effectively predict the top crashes well before a new release. This allows for quick resolution of the most important crashes, leading to improved user experience and better allocation of maintenance efforts.

To compare with the expensive media advertisements, direct marketing could provide exclusive products and services for specific consumers. Also, this method could reduce transaction costs. The communication channel is diverse because virtual shop stores and online shopping are springing up. Therefore, this study proposes the application of Internet marketing to the direct selling industry and the cosmetics market in Taiwan. This study implements association rules and cluster analysis as approaches for data mining. By doing so, we analyze consumer adumbration, lifestyle habits and purchasing behavior. Finally, this study finds some models including cluster consumer purchase preference and demand in order to generate different marketing alternatives for decisions. These research results can help attract more direct marketing firms to open up broader markets and earn higher profits for direct selling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sufi, F; Khalil, I; Mahmood, AN				Sufi, Fahim; Khalil, Ibrahim; Mahmood, Abdun Naser			A clustering based system for instant detection of cardiac abnormalities from compressed ECG	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cardiac abnormality classification; Compressed ECG; CVD diagnosis; Symmetricity of bi-class clustering; CVD alert mechanism	TRANSMISSION; MECHANISM	Compressed Electrocardiography (ECG) is being used in modern telecardiology applications for faster and efficient transmission. However, existing ECG diagnosis algorithms require the compressed ECG packets to be decompressed before diagnosis can be applied. This additional process of decompression before performing diagnosis for every ECG packet introduces undesirable delays, which can have severe impact on the longevity of the patient. In this paper, we first used an attribute selection method that selects only a few features from the compressed ECG. Then we used Expected Maximization (EM) clustering technique to create normal and abnormal ECG clusters. Twenty different segments (13 normal and 7 abnormal) of compressed ECG from a MIT-BIH subject were tested with 100% success using our model. Apart from automatic clustering of normal and abnormal compressed ECG segments, this paper presents an algorithm to identify initiation of abnormality. Therefore, emergency personnel can be contacted for rescue mission, within the earliest possible time. This innovative technique based on data mining of compressed ECGs attributes, enables faster identification of cardiac abnormalities resulting in an efficient telecardiology diagnosis system.

Additionally, these models need to provide decision-makers with "summarized" and valuable knowledge, that has to be subjected to a thorough evaluation procedure, easily translated to services and/or actions in actual decision making situations, and integratable with existing Environmental Management Systems (EMSs). On this basis, our current study investigates the potential of various machine learning algorithms as tools for air quality (AQ) episode forecasting and assesses them - given the corresponding domain-specific requirements - using an evaluation procedure, tailored to the task at hand. Among the algorithms employed in the experimental phase, our main focus is on ZCS-DM, an evolutionary rule-induction algorithm specifically designed to tackle this class of problems - that is classification problems with skewed class distributions, where cost-sensitive model building is required. Overall, we consider this investigation successful, in terms of its aforementioned goals and constraints: obtained experimental results reveal the potential of rule-based algorithms for urban AQ forecasting, and point towards ZCS-DM as the most suitable algorithm for the target domain, providing the best trade-off between model performance and understandability.

J	Bang, YK; Lee, CH				Bang, Young-Keun; Lee, Chul-Heui			Fuzzy time series prediction using hierarchical clustering algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Non-linear time series; Multiple model fuzzy predictors; Cross-correlation clustering algorithm; Hierarchical clustering algorithms	IDENTIFICATION	In many cases, the k-means clustering algorithm has been most frequently used to the field of data mining, fuzzy control systems and prediction since it was designed in simple procedures and excellent ability of classification. However, it sometimes brought about the failed results for non-linear data by classification behavior caused by just considering the statistical characteristics of non-linear data such as distances between data. To overcome the problems above, this paper proposes a new clustering algorithm of which the structure hierarchically classifies non-linear data. The proposed hierarchical classification technique consists of two levels, called upper clusters and lower fuzzy sets, using the cross-correlation clustering algorithm combined with the k-means clustering algorithm (HCKA), and it was able to improve classification accuracy. In addition, this paper constructs multiple model fuzzy predictors (MMFPs) corresponding to difference data of original time series, which was able to reflect the various characteristics of the time series to the proposed system. Simulation results show that the proposed system was effective and useful for modeling and predicting non-linear time series. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bermejo, P; Gamez, JA; Puerta, JM				Bermejo, Pablo; Gamez, Jose A.; Puerta, Jose M.			A GRASP algorithm for fast hybrid (filter-wrapper) feature subset selection in high-dimensional datasets	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Feature selection; Classification; GRASP; Filter; Wrapper; High-dimensional datasets	SEARCH METHODS	Feature subset selection is a key problem in the data-mining classification task that helps to obtain more compact and understandable models without degrading (or even improving) their performance. In this work we focus on FSS in high-dimensional datasets, that is, with a very large number of predictive attributes. In this case, standard sophisticated wrapper algorithms cannot be applied because of their complexity, and computationally lighter filter-wrapper algorithms have recently been proposed. In this work we propose a stochastic algorithm based on the GRASP meta-heuristic, with the main goal of speeding up the feature subset selection process, basically by reducing the number of wrapper evaluations to carry out. GRASP is a multi-start constructive method which constructs a solution in its first stage, and then runs an improving stage over that solution. Several instances of the proposed GRASP method are experimentally tested and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms over 12 high-dimensional datasets. The statistical analysis of the results shows that our proposal is comparable in accuracy and cardinality of the selected subset to previous algorithms, but requires significantly fewer evaluations.

Improving learning management through semantic web and social networks in e-learning environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social networks; Learning Management Systems; e-Learning; Ontologies	TECHNOLOGIES	Internet social networks have arisen in the last years as powerful tools where people exchange knowledge and multimedia content. They help to share interests between groups of people with common features. Undoubtedly, there is an inherent social network in any e-learning system, where the main actors are teachers, learners and learning resources. Most e-learning software are mainly focused in content dissemination and group work, but the possibilities that Internet LMSs could offer go further. Recently, there has been research work focused on Web Communities for learning and their formulation as Social Networks. Thus, social network analysis may be applied to infer group structures and to make intelligent recommendation systems and data mining. This paper proposes a method for the formulation and interpretation of learning management platforms as social networks. In order to achieve a major generalization, we develop an ontology to integrate the information from different Learning Management Systems. After that, a personalized social network is extracted from the ontology. This change in the point of view of a LMS could be a challenge to make further studies about learners, teachers and learning resources to obtain a better understanding of their social structure, and therefore to make or improve decisions about the learning process.

J	Fontana, FA; Zanoni, M				Fontana, Francesca Arcelli; Zanoni, Marco			A tool for design pattern detection and software architecture reconstruction	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Reverse engineering; Software architecture reconstruction; Design pattern detection; Data mining techniques; Metrics computations	SOURCE CODE; REVERSE; TAXONOMY; VIEWS	It is well known that software maintenance and evolution are expensive activities, both in terms of invested time and money. Reverse engineering activities support the obtainment of abstractions and views from a target system that should help the engineers to maintain, evolve and eventually re-engineer it. Two important tasks pursued by reverse engineering are design pattern detection and software architecture reconstruction, whose main objectives are the identification of the design patterns that have been used in the implementation of a system as well as the generation of views placed at different levels of abstractions, which let the practitioners focus on the overall architecture of the system without worrying about the programming details it has been implemented with. In this context we propose an Eclipse plug-in called MARPLE (Metrics and Architecture Reconstruction Plug-in for Eclipse), which supports both the detection of design patterns and software architecture reconstruction activities through the use of basic elements and metrics that are mechanically extracted from the source code. The development of this platform is mainly based on the exploitation of the Eclipse framework and plug-ins as well as of different Java libraries for data access and graph management and visualization. In this paper we focus our attention on the design pattern detection process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Survey of Outlier Detection Methods in Network Anomaly Identification	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						anomaly; outlier; NIDS; density-based; distance-based; unsupervised	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS; DATA SETS; ALGORITHMS	The detection of outliers has gained considerable interest in data mining with the realization that outliers can be the key discovery to be made from very large databases. Outliers arise due to various reasons such as mechanical faults, changes in system behavior, fraudulent behavior, human error and instrument error. Indeed, for many applications the discovery of outliers leads to more interesting and useful results than the discovery of inliers. Detection of outliers can lead to identification of system faults so that administrators can take preventive measures before they escalate. It is possible that anomaly detection may enable detection of new attacks. Outlier detection is an important anomaly detection approach. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of well-known distance-based, density-based and other techniques for outlier detection and compare them. We provide definitions of outliers and discuss their detection based on supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of network anomaly detection.	[Gogoi, Prasanta; Bhattacharyya, D.

In this paper, we propose an ideal linear multi-secret sharing scheme, based on monotone span programs, where each subset of the set of participants may have the associated secret. Our scheme can be used to meet the security requirement in practical applications, such as secure group communication and privacy preserving data mining etc. We also prove that our proposed scheme satisfies the definition of a perfect multi-secret sharing scheme.

J	Hsu, CY; Hsu, YC; Lin, SF				Hsu, Chi-Yao; Hsu, Yung-Chi; Lin, Sheng-Fuu			Reinforcement evolutionary learning using data mining algorithm with TSK-type fuzzy controllers	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fuzzy system; Control; Symbiotic evolution; Reinforcement learning; Association rules; R-ELDMA	SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DESIGN; SYSTEMS; NETWORK; HYBRID; GA	Reinforcement evolutionary learning using data mining algorithm (R-ELDMA) with a TSK-type fuzzy controller (TFC) for solving reinforcement control problems is proposed in this study. R-ELDMA aims to determine suitable rules in a TFC and identify suitable and unsuitable groups for chromosome selection. To this end, the proposed R-ELDMA entails both structure and parameter learning. In structure learning, the proposed R-ELDMA adopts our previous research - the self-adaptive method (SAM) - to determine the suitability of TFC models with different fuzzy rules. In parameter learning, the data-mining based selection strategy (DSS), which proposes association rules, is used. More specifically, DSS not only determines suitable groups for chromosomes selection but also identifies unsuitable groups to be avoided selecting chromosomes to construct a TFC. Illustrative examples are presented to show the performance and applicability of the proposed R-ELDMA. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Liao, SH; Chen, YJ; Lin, YT				Liao, Shu-hsien; Chen, Yin-ju; Lin, Yi-tsun			Mining customer knowledge to implement online shopping and home delivery for hypermarkets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rule; Cluster analysis; On-line shopping; Home delivery; Electronic commerce; Database marketing	TECHNOLOGIES; PATTERNS; BUSINESS; SYSTEM; RULES; MODEL; WEB	With advances in modern technology, the Internet population has increased year by year globally. For young customers who consider convenience and speed as prerequisites, online shopping has become a new type of consumption. In addition, business-to-customer (B2C) home delivery markets have taken shape gradually, because virtual stores have risen and developed, e.g. mail-order, TV marketing, e-commerce. To integrate the above statements, this study combines online shopping and home delivery, and attempts to use association rules to determine unknown bundling of fresh products and non-fresh products in a hypermarket. Customers are then divided up in clusters by clustering analysis, and the catalog is design based on each of the cluster's consumption preferences. By this method, to increase the catalogue's attraction to customers, hypermarkets are offered an online shopping and home delivery business model for sales services and propositions.

In order to obtain accurate and comprehensible classification rules from databases, a new approach is proposed by combining advantages of artificial neural networks (ANN) and swarm intelligence. Method: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a group of very powerful tools applied to prediction, classification and clustering in different domains. The main disadvantage of this general purpose tool is the difficulties in its interpretability and comprehensibility. In order to eliminate these disadvantages, a novel approach is developed to uncover and decode the information hidden in the black-box structure of ANNs. Therefore, in this paper a study on knowledge extraction from trained ANNs for classification problems is carried out. The proposed approach makes use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to transform the behaviors of trained ANNs into accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Particle swarm optimization with time varying inertia weight and acceleration coefficients is designed to explore the best attribute-value combination via optimizing ANN output function. Results: The weights hidden in trained ANNs turned into comprehensible classification rule set with higher testing accuracy rates compared to traditional rule based classifiers.

Information Distance in Multiples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Data mining; information distance; Kolmogorov complexity; multiples; pattern recognition; similarity	SEQUENCE DISTANCE; COMPRESSION; SIMILARITY; COMPLEXITY; STRINGS	Information distance is a parameter-free similarity measure based on compression, used in pattern recognition, data mining, phylogeny, clustering and classification. The notion of information distance is extended from pairs to multiples (finite lists). We study maximal overlap, metricity, universality, minimal overlap, additivity and normalized information distance in multiples. We use the theoretical notion of Kolmogorov complexity which for practical purposes is approximated by the length of the compressed version of the file involved, using a real-world compression program.

J	Yang, WH; Dai, DQ; Yan, H				Yang, Wen-Hui; Dai, Dao-Qing; Yan, Hong			Finding Correlated Biclusters from Gene Expression Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biclustering; pattern classification; gene expression data; singular-value decomposition; data mining; biology computing	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; MICROARRAY DATA; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; PATTERNS; MODELS; MATRIX	Extracting biologically relevant information from DNA microarrays is a very important task for drug development and test, function annotation, and cancer diagnosis. Various clustering methods have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data, but when analyzing the large and heterogeneous collections of gene expression data, conventional clustering algorithms often cannot produce a satisfactory solution. Biclustering algorithm has been presented as an alternative approach to standard clustering techniques to identify local structures from gene expression data set. These patterns may provide clues about the main biological processes associated with different physiological states. In this paper, different from existing bicluster patterns, we first introduce a more general pattern: correlated bicluster, which has intuitive biological interpretation. Then, we propose a novel transform technique based on singular value decomposition so that identifying correlated-bicluster problem from gene expression matrix is transformed into two global clustering problems. The Mixed-Clustering algorithm and the Lift algorithm are devised to efficiently produce delta-corBiclusters. The biclusters obtained using our method from gene expression data sets of multiple human organs and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrate clear biological meanings.

Applications to pattern recognition and machine learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Work-Conference on the Interplay Between Natural and Artificial Computation	JUN 22-26, 2009	Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN			Artificial neural networks; Granular computing; Learning automata theory; Pattern recognition; Machine learning		In this paper the fusion of artificial neural networks, granular computing and learning automata theory is proposed and we present as a final result ANLAGIS, an adaptive neuron-like network based on learning automata and granular inference systems. ANLAGIS can be applied to both pattern recognition and learning control problems. Another interesting contribution of this paper is the distinction between presynaptic and post-synaptic learning in artificial neural networks. Tc illustrate the capabilities of ANLAGIS some experiments on knowledge discovery in data mining and machine learning are presented. The main, novel contribution of ANLAGIS is the incorporation of Learning Automata Theory within its structure; the paper includes also a novel learning scheme for stochastic learning automata.

J	Cheong, M; Lee, VCS				Cheong, Marc; Lee, Vincent C. S.			A microblogging-based approach to terrorism informatics: Exploration and chronicling civilian sentiment and response to terrorism events via Twitter	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Twitter; Microblogging; Terrorism informatics; Visualization; Data mining; Sentiment analysis; Demographic analysis; Civilian response		The study of terrorism informatics utilizing the Twitter microblogging service has not been given apt attention in the past few years. Twitter has been identified as both a potential facilitator and also a powerful deterrent to terrorism. Based on observations of Twitter's role in civilian response during the recent 2009 Jakarta and Mumbai terrorist attacks, we propose a structured framework to harvest civilian sentiment and response on Twitter during terrorism scenarios. Coupled with intelligent data mining, visualization, and filtering methods, this data can be collated into a knowledge base that would be of great utility to decision-makers and the authorities for rapid response and monitoring during such scenarios. Using synthetic experimental data, we demonstrated that the proposed framework has yielded meaningful graphical visualizations of information, to reveal potential response to terrorist threats. The novelty of this study is that microblogging has never been studied in the domain of terrorism informatics. This paper also contributes to the understanding of the capability of conjoint structured data and unstructured content mining in extracting deep knowledge from noisy twitter messages, through our proposed structured framework.

J	Das, AK; Sil, J				Das, Asit Kumar; Sil, Jaya			An efficient classifier design integrating rough set and set oriented database operations	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Rough set theory; Decision tree; Graph theory	MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; REDUCTION; PRINCIPLE	Feature subset selection and dimensionality reduction of data are fundamental and most explored area of research in machine learning and data mining domains. Rough set theory (RST) constitutes a sound basis for data mining, can be used at different phases of knowledge discovery process. In the paper, by integrating the concept of RST and relational algebra operations, a new attribute reduction algorithm has been presented to select the minimum set of attributes, called reducts, required for classification of data. Firstly, the conditional attributes are partitioned into different groups according to their score, calculated using projection (Pi) and division (divided by) operations of relational algebra. The groups based on their scores are sorted in ascending order while the first group contains maximum information is uniquely used for generating the reducts. The non-reduct attributes are combined with the elements of the next group and the modified group is considered for computing the reducts. The process continues until all groups are exhausted and thus a final set of reducts is obtained. Then applying decision tree algorithm on each reduct, decision rule sets are generated, which are later pruned by removing the extraneous components. Finally, by involving the concept of probability theory and graph theory minimum number of rules is obtained used for building an efficient classifier. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First phase of churn management starts with profile creation for the subscribers. Profiling process evaluates call detail data, financial information, calls to customer service, contract details, market details and geographic and population data of a given state. In this study, input features are clustered by x-means and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms to put the subscribers into different discrete classes. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is executed to develop a sensitive prediction model for churn management by using these classes. First prediction step starts with parallel Neuro fuzzy classifiers. After then, FIS takes Neuro fuzzy classifiers' outputs as input to make a decision about churners' activities.

J	Li, JX; Wang, GA; Chen, HC				Li, Jiexun; Wang, G. Alan; Chen, Hsinchun			Identity matching using personal and social identity features	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Identity management; Identity matching; Probabilistic relational model; Social context	HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES; NAIVE BAYES; MODEL	Identity verification is essential in our mission to identify potential terrorists and criminals. It is not a trivial task because terrorists reportedly assume multiple identities using either fraudulent or legitimate means. A national identification card and biometrics technologies have been proposed as solutions to the identity problem. However, several studies show their inability to tackle the complex problem. We aim to develop data mining alternatives that can match identities referring to the same individual. Existing identity matching techniques based on data mining primarily rely on personal identity features. In this research, we propose a new identity matching technique that considers both personal identity features and social identity features. We define two groups of social identity features including social activities and social relations. The proposed technique is built upon a probabilistic relational model that utilizes a relational database structure to extract social identity features. Experiments show that the social activity features significantly improve the matching performance while the social relation features effectively reduce false positive and false negative decisions.

J	Li, JP; Burke, EK; Qu, R				Li, Jingpeng; Burke, Edmund K.; Qu, Rong			Integrating neural networks and logistic regression to underpin hyper-heuristic search	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hyper-heuristic; Data mining; Educational timetabling; Neural network; Logistic regression	TIMETABLING PROBLEMS; DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHM; SPACE; GRAPH; DISCOVERY	A hyper-heuristic often represents a heuristic search method that operates over a space of heuristic rules. It can be thought of as a high level search methodology to choose lower level heuristics. Nearly 200 papers on hyper-heuristics have recently appeared in the literature. A common theme in this body of literature is an attempt to solve the problems in hand in the following way: at each decision point, first employ the chosen heuristic(s) to generate a solution, then calculate the objective value of the solution by taking into account all the constraints involved. However, empirical studies from our previous research have revealed that, under many circumstances, there is no need to carry out this costly 2-stage determination and evaluation at all times. This is because many problems in the real world are highly constrained with the characteristic that the regions of feasible solutions are rather scattered and small. Motivated by this observation and with the aim of making the hyper-heuristic search more efficient and more effective, this paper investigates two fundamentally different data mining techniques, namely artificial neural networks and binary logistic regression. By learning from examples, these techniques are able to find global patterns hidden in large data sets and achieve the goal of appropriately classifying the data. With the trained classification rules or estimated parameters, the performance (i.e. the worth of acceptance or rejection) of a resulting solution during the hyper-heuristic search can be predicted without the need to undertake the computationally expensive 2-stage of determination and calculation. We evaluate our approaches on the solutions (i.e. the sequences of heuristic rules) generated by a graph-based hyper-heuristic proposed for exam timetabling problems. Time complexity analysis demonstrates that the neural network and the logistic regression method can speed up the search significantly. We believe that our work sheds light on the development of more advanced knowledge-based decision support systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, surgical processes are modeled by following various approaches. This diversity lacks a commonly agreed-upon conceptual foundation and thus impedes the comparability, the interoperability, and the uniform interpretation of process data. Objective: However, it would be beneficial if scientific models, in the same context, shared a coherent conceptual and formal mathematical basis. Such a uniform foundation would simplify the acquisition and exchange of data, the transition and interpretation of study results, and the transfer and adaptation of methods and tools. Therefore, we propose a generic, formal framework for specifying surgical processes, which is presented together with its design methodology. Methods: The methodology follows a four-level translational approach and comprises an ontological foundation for the formal level that orients itself by linguistic theories. Results: A unifying framework for modeling surgical processes that is ontologically founded and formally and mathematically precise was developed. The expressive power and the unifying capacity of the presented framework are demonstrated by applying it to four contemporary approaches for surgical process modeling by using the common underlying formalization. Conclusions: The presented four-level approach allows for capturing the knowledge of the surgical intervention formally. Natural language terms are consistently translated to an implementation level to support research fields where users express their expert knowledge about processes in natural language, but, in contrast to this, statistical analysis or data mining need to be performed based on mathematically formalized data sets. The availability of such a translational approach is a valuable extension for research regarding the operating room of the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

J	Farvaresh, H; Sepehri, MM				Farvaresh, Hamid; Sepehri, Mohammad Mehdi			A data mining framework for detecting subscription fraud in telecommunication	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Fraud detection; Data mining; Neural networks; Decision tree; Support vector machines; Ensembles; Telecommunication	CREDIT SCORING MODELS; SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MARKET-SEGMENTATION; CHURN PREDICTION; SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	Service providing companies including telecommunication companies often receive substantial damage from customers' fraudulent behaviors. One of the common types of fraud is subscription fraud in which usage type is in contradiction with subscription type. This study aimed at identifying customers' subscription fraud by employing data mining techniques and adopting knowledge discovery process. To this end, a hybrid approach consisting of preprocessing, clustering, and classification phases was applied, and appropriate tools were employed commensurate to each phase. Specifically, in the clustering phase SOM and K-means were combined, and in the classification phase decision tree (C4.5), neural networks, and support vector machines as single classifiers and bagging, boosting, stacking, majority and consensus voting as ensembles were examined. In addition to using clustering to identify outlier cases, it was also possible - by defining new features - to maintain the results of clustering phase for the classification phase. This, in turn, contributed to better classification results. A real dataset provided by Telecommunication Company of Tehran was applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The efficient use of synergy among these techniques significantly increased prediction accuracy. The performance of all single and ensemble classifiers is evaluated based on various metrics and compared by statistical tests. The results showed that support vector machines among single classifiers and boosted trees among all classifiers have the best performance in terms of various metrics. The research findings show that the proposed model has a high accuracy, and the resulting outcomes are significant both theoretically and practically. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tseng, VS; Hsieh, MH; Lin, KW				Tseng, Vincent S.; Hsieh, Ming-Hua; Lin, Kawuu W.			A NOVEL CACHE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHM FOR COOPERATIVE CACHING IN WIRELESS MULTIMEDIA SENSOR NETWORKS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Multimedia sensor networks; Cache replacement; Temporal region requesting pattern; Data mining	AD-HOC NETWORKS; ENVIRONMENT; SCHEME	In recent years, integrated applications with multimedia devices and wireless sensor networks promoted the evolution of wireless sensor networks, namely wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). The applications in WMSNs have to focus on both energy saving and application-level quality of service (QoS). Due to the characteristics in WMSNs, such as resource constraints and variable channel capacity, efficiently achieving the application-level QoS in WMSNs is a challenging task. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a new kind of pattern named temporal region requesting pattern (TRRP) and a novel algorithm named TRRP-Mine for mining TRRPs efficiently. We also designed a temporal region requesting cost function of cache replacement, abbreviated as TRRC, for the cooperative caching multimedia content in WMSNs. Empirical evaluations under various simulation conditions showed that the proposed method delivers excellent performance in terms of hit rate and the number of replacements.

J	Wu, YY; Chen, YL; Chang, RI				Wu, Yu-Ying; Chen, Yen-Liang; Chang, Ray-I			Mining negative generalized knowledge from relational databases	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Attribute-oriented induction; Negative pattern; Multiple-level mining; Generalized knowledge	ATTRIBUTE-ORIENTED INDUCTION; ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; REDUCTION	Attribute-oriented induction (AOI) is a useful data mining method for extracting generalized knowledge from relational data and users' background knowledge. Concept hierarchies can be integrated with the AOI method to induce multi-level generalized knowledge. However, the existing AOI approaches are only capable of mining positive knowledge from databases; thus, rare but important negative generalized knowledge that is unknown, unexpected, or contradictory to what the user believes, can be missed. In this study, we propose a global negative attribute-oriented induction (GNAOI) approach that can generate comprehensive and multiple-level negative generalized knowledge at the same time. Two pruning properties, the downward level closure property and the upward superset closure property, are employed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, and a new interest measure, nim(cl), is exploited to measure the degree of the negative relation. Experiment results from a real-life dataset show that the proposed method is effective in finding global negative generalized knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, YP; Mueller, F; Cui, XH; Potok, T				Zhang, Yongpeng; Mueller, Frank; Cui, Xiaohui; Potok, Thomas			Data-intensive document clustering on graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						High-performance computing; Accelerators; Data-intensive computing		Document clustering is a central method to mine massive amounts of data. Due to the explosion of raw documents generated on the Internet and the necessity to analyze them efficiently in various intelligent information systems, clustering techniques have reached their limitations on single processors. Instead of single processors, general-purpose multi-core chips are increasingly deployed in response to diminishing returns in single-processor speedup due to the frequency wall, but multi-core benefits only provide linear speedups while the number of documents in the Internet is growing exponentially. Accelerating hardware devices represent a novel promise for improving the performance for data-intensive problems such as document clustering. They offer more radical designs with a higher level of parallelism but adaptation to novel programming environments. In this paper, we assess the benefits of exploiting the computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to study two fundamental problems in document mining, namely to calculate the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and cluster a large set of documents. We transform traditional algorithms into accelerated parallel counterparts that can be efficiently executed on manycore GPU architectures. We assess our implementations on various platforms, ranging from stand-alone GPU desktops to Beowulf-like clusters equipped with contemporary GPU cards. We observe at least one order of magnitude speedups over CPU-only desktops and clusters. This demonstrates the potential of exploiting GPU clusters to efficiently solve massive document mining problems. Such speedups combined with the scalability potential and accelerator-based parallelization are unique in the domain of document-based data mining, to the best of our knowledge.

Among them, the decision tree (DT), back-propagation network (BPN), and support vector machine (SVM) are popular and can be applied to various areas. Nevertheless, different problems may require different parameter values when applying DT, BPN or SVM. If parameter values are not set well, results may turn out to be unsatisfactory. Further, a dataset may contain many features; however, not all features are beneficial for classifications. Therefore, a scatter search (SS) approach is proposed to obtain the better parameters and select the beneficial subset of features to attain better classification results. The above classification algorithms have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and suitability is influenced by the characteristics of the problem. If the algorithms can function together in a so-called ensemble, it is expected that better results can be obtained. Therefore, this study adapts ensemble to further enhance the classification accuracy rate. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, datasets in UCI (University of California, Irvine) were applied as the test problem set. The corresponding results were compared to several well-known, published approaches. The comparative study shows that the proposed approach improved the classification accuracy rate in most datasets. Thus, the proposed approach can be useful to both practitioners and researchers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This issue occurs when the number of examples representing one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. The aim of this work is to shortly review the main issues of this problem and to describe two common approaches for dealing with imbalance, namely sampling and cost sensitive learning. Additionally, we will pay special attention to some open problems, in particular we will carry out a discussion on the data intrinsic characteristics of the imbalanced classification problem which will help to follow new paths that can lead to the improvement of current models, namely size of the data-set, small disjuncts, the overlapping between the classes and the data fracture between training and test distribution.

The main objective is to study, for a given subset of the universe U, all such parameterized approximations, i.e., for all parameter values. For an approximation space (U, R), where R is an equivalence relation, there is only one type of such parameterized approximations. For an approximation space (U, R), where R is an arbitrary binary relation, three types of parameterized approximations are introduced in this paper: singleton, subset and concept. We show that the number of parameterized approximations of given type is not greater than the cardinality of U. Additionally, we show that singleton parameterized approximations are not useful for data mining, since such approximations; in general, are not even locally definable.

Those data are often used to train classification rules in view of making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training datasets are biased in what regards sensitive attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on biased sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on non-sensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive attributes. This paper discusses how to clean training datasets and outsourced datasets in such a way that legitimate classification rules can still be extracted but indirectly discriminating rules cannot.

J	Hung, CC; Peng, WC				Hung, Chih-Chieh; Peng, Wen-Chih			A regression-based approach for mining user movement patterns from random sample data	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						User movement patterns; Data mining; Mobile data management	MOVING BEHAVIORS; PCS NETWORKS	Mobile computing systems usually express a user movement trajectory as a sequence of areas that capture the user movement trace. Given a set of user movement trajectories, user movement patterns refer to the sequences of areas through which a user frequently travels. In an attempt to obtain user movement patterns for mobile applications, prior studies explore the problem of mining user movement patterns from the movement logs of mobile users. These movement logs generate a data record whenever a mobile user crosses base station coverage areas. However, this type of movement log does not exist in the system and thus generates extra overheads. By exploiting an existing log, namely, call detail records, this article proposes a Regression-based approach for mining User Movement Patterns (abbreviated as RUMP). This approach views call detail records as random sample trajectory data, and thus, user movement patterns are represented as movement functions in this article. We propose algorithm LS (standing for Large Sequence) to extract the call detail records that capture frequent user movement behaviors. By exploring the spatio-temporal locality of continuous movements (i.e., a mobile user is likely to be in nearby areas if the time interval between consecutive calls is small), we develop algorithm TC (standing for Time Clustering) to cluster call detail records. Then, by utilizing regression analysis, we develop algorithm MF (standing for Movement Function) to derive movement functions. Experimental studies involving both synthetic and real datasets show that RUMP is able to derive user movement functions close to the frequent movement behaviors of mobile users.

The proposed feature selection method is based on higher order statistics (HOS) calculated for the details of discrete wavelets transform (DWT) of EEG signal. Then a genetic algorithm is used for feature selection. During the experiment classification is conducted on a single trial of EEG signals. The proposed novel method of feature extraction using HOS and DWT gives more accurate results then the algorithm based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

It is circulated and accumulated by knowledge flows (KFs) in the organization to support workers' task needs. Because workers accumulate knowledge of different domains, they may cooperate and participate in several task-based groups to satisfy their needs. In this paper, we propose algorithms that integrate information retrieval and data mining techniques to mine and construct group-based KFs (GKFs) for task-based groups. A GKF is expressed as a directed knowledge graph which represents the knowledge referencing behavior, or knowledge flow, of a group of workers with similar task needs. Task-related knowledge topics and their relationships (flows) can be identified from the knowledge graph so as to fulfill workers' task needs and promote knowledge sharing for collaboration of group members. Moreover, the frequent knowledge referencing path can be identified from the knowledge graph to indicate the frequent knowledge flow of the workers. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, we implement a prototype of the GKF mining system. Our GKF mining methods can enhance organizational learning and facilitate knowledge management, sharing, and reuse in an environment where collaboration and teamwork are essential.

J	Liu, HW; Liu, L; Zhang, HJ				Liu, Huawen; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Huijie			A fast pruning redundant rule method using Galois connection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Rule pruning; Galois connection; Formal concept analysis; Post-analysis	ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; CLASSIFICATION	Besides preprocessing, post-analysis also plays an important role in knowledge discovery. It can effectively assist users to grasp the obtained knowledge. However, many of data mining algorithms merely take performance into consideration and put the post-analysis of results aside. They generate a modest number of rules for the purpose of improving accuracy. Unfortunately, most induced rules are redundant or insignificant. Their presence not only confuses end-users in post-analysis, but also degrades efficiency in future decision task. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate redundant or irrelevant rules as more as possible. In this paper, we present an efficient post-processing method to prune redundant rules by virtue of the property of Galois connection, which inherently constrains rules with respect to objects. Its advantage is that information will not be lost greatly during pruning step. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method is competent for discarding a large number of superfluous rules effectively and a high compression factor will be achieved. What's more, the computational cost of our method is surprisingly lower than the Apriori method. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By applying data mining methods to these data, interesting patterns concerning the users' behaviour can be identified. They help us to find the most effective structure of the e-learning courses, optimize the learning content, recommend the most suitable learning path based on student's behaviour, or provide more personalized environment. We prepare six datasets of different quality obtained from logs of the learning management system and pre-processed in different ways. We use three datasets with identified users' sessions based on 15, 30 and 60 minute session timeout threshold and three another datasets with the same thresholds including reconstructed paths among course activities. We try to assess the impact of different session timeout thresholds with or without paths completion on the quantity and quality of the sequence rule analysis that contribute to the representation of the learners' behavioural patterns in learning management system. The results show that the session timeout threshold has significant impact on quality and quantity of extracted sequence rules. On the contrary, it is shown that the completion of paths has neither significant impact on quantity nor quality of extracted rules.

Clustering and ranking university majors using data mining and AHP algorithms: A case study in Iran	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Clustering; k-means algorithm; Multi-criteria decision making; Analytic hierarchy process; University major ranking problem	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; COLLEGE MAJOR; CHOICE	Although all university majors are prominent, and the necessity of their presence is of no question, they might not have the same priority basis considering different resources and strategies that could be spotted for a country. Their priorities likely change as the time goes by; that is, different majors are desirable at different time. If the government is informed of which majors could tackle today existing problems of world and its country, it surely more esteems those majors. This paper considers the problem of clustering and ranking university majors in Iran. To do so, a model is presented to clarify the procedure. Eight different criteria are determined, and 177 existing university majors are compared on these criteria. First, by k-means algorithm, university majors are clustered based on similarities and differences. Then, by AHP algorithm, we rank university majors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we briefly outline the genesis of, and motivation for, the random forest paradigm as an outgrowth from earlier tree-structured techniques. We elaborate on aspects of prediction error and attendant tuning parameter issues. However, our emphasis is on extending the random forest schema to the multiple response setting. We provide a simple illustrative example from ecology that showcases the improved fit and enhanced interpretation afforded by the random forest framework. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This paper focuses on a methodological framework for the development of an automated data imputation model based on artificial neural networks. Fifteen real and simulated data sets are exposed to a perturbation experiment, based on the random generation of missing values. These data set sizes range from 47 to 1389 records. A perturbation experiment was performed for each data set where the probability of missing value was set to 0.05. Several architectures and learning algorithms for the multilayer perceptron are tested and compared with three classic imputation procedures: mean/mode imputation, regression and hot-deck. The obtained results, considering different performance measures, not only suggest this approach improves the quality of a database with missing values, but also the best results are clearly obtained using the Multilayer Perceptron model in data sets with categorical variables. Three learning rules (Levenberg-Marquardt, BFGS Quasi-Newton and Conjugate Gradient Fletcher-Reeves Update) and a small number of hidden nodes are recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The current research works provide only conceptual, descriptive, and simulation results, focusing mainly on firm resources and general marketing factors. The selection and evaluation of distributors generally incorporate qualitative information: however, analyzing qualitative information is difficult by standard statistical techniques. Consequently, a more suitable approach is desired. In this paper, a method based on Rough set theory, which has been recognized as a powerful tool in dealing with qualitative data in the literature, is introduced and modified for preferred distributor selection. We derived certain decision rules which are able to facilitate distributor selection and identified several significant features based on an empirical study conducted in China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, L; Lv, MQ; Chen, GC				Chen, Ling; Lv, Mingqi; Chen, Gencai			A system for destination and future route prediction based on trajectory mining	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Location-aware computing; Data mining; Route; Destination; Prediction		Location is a key context ingredient and many existing pervasive applications rely on the current locations of their users. However, with the ability to predict the future location and movement behavior of a user, the usability of these applications can be greatly improved. In this paper, we propose an approach to predict both the intended destination and the future route of a person. Rather than predicting the destination and future route separately, we have focused on making prediction in an integrated way by exploiting personal movement data (i.e. trajectories) collected by GPS. Since trajectories contain daily whereabouts information of a person, the proposed approach first detects the significant places where the person may depart from or go to using a clustering-based algorithm called FBM (Forward Backward Matching), then abstracts the trajectories based on a space partitioning method, and finally extracts movement patterns from the abstracted trajectories using an extended CRPM (Continuous Route Pattern Mining) algorithm. Extracted movement patterns are organized in terms of origin-destination couples. The prediction is made based on a pattern tree built from these movement patterns. With the real personal movement data of 14 participants, we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate the performance of our system. The results show that our approach can achieve approximately 80% and 60% accuracy in destination prediction and 1-step prediction, respectively, and result in an average deviation of approximately 60 m in continuous future route prediction. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we implemented a prototype running on mobile phones, which can extract patterns from a user's historical movement data and predict the destination and future route.

J	Deng, ZH; Wang, ZH				Deng, Zhihong; Wang, Zhonghui			A New Fast Vertical Method for Mining Frequent Patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; frequent pattern mining; data structure; algorithm	CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHMS	Vertical mining methods are very effective for mining frequent patterns and usually outperform horizontal mining methods. However, the vertical methods become ineffective since the intersection time starts to be costly when the cardinality of tidset (tid-list or diffset) is very large or there are a very large number of transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel vertical algorithm called PPV for fast frequent pattern discovery. PPV works based on a data structure called Node-lists, which is obtained from a coding prefix-tree called PPC-tree. The efficiency of PPV is achieved with three techniques. First, the Node-list is much more compact compared with previous proposed vertical structure (such as tid-lists or diffsets) since transactions with common prefixes share the same nodes of the PPC-tree. Second, the counting of support is transformed into the intersection of Node-lists and the complexity of intersecting two Node-lists can be reduced to O(m+n) by an efficient strategy, where m and n are the cardinalities of the two Node-lists respectively. Third, the ancestor-descendant relationship of two nodes, which is the basic step of intersecting Node-lists, can be very efficiently verified by Pre-Post codes of nodes. We experimentally compare our algorithm with FP-growth, and two prominent vertical algorithms (Eclat and dEclat) on a number of databases. The experimental results show that PPV is an efficient algorithm that outperforms FP-growth, Eclat, and dEclat.

J	Mahdi, AE; Joorabchi, A				Mahdi, Abdulhussain E.; Joorabchi, Arash			A citation-based approach to automatic topical indexing of scientific literature	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						citation-based indexing; data mining; keyphrase extraction; topical indexing	EXTRACTION	Topical indexing of documents with keyphrases is a common method used for revealing the subject of scientific and research documents to both human readers and information retrieval tools, such as search engines. However, scientific documents that are manually indexed with keyphrases are still in the minority. This article describes a new unsupervised method for automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific documents which yields a performance on a par with human indexers. The method is based on identifying references cited in the document to be indexed and, using the keyphrases assigned to those references, for generating a set of high-likelihood keyphrases for the document. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed method by using it to automatically index a third-party testset of research documents.

J	Seng, JL; Chen, TC				Seng, Jia-Lang; Chen, T. C.			An analytic approach to select data mining for business decision	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Business decision; Selection model		Due to the information technology improvement and the growth of internet, enterprises are able to collect and to store huge amount of data. Using data mining technology to aid the data processing, information retrieval and knowledge generation process has become one of the critical missions to enterprise, so how to use data mining tools properly is user concern. Since not every user completely understand the theory of data mining, choosing the best solution from the functions which data mining tools provides is not easy. If user is not satisfied with the outcome of mining, communication with IT employees to adjust the software costs lots of time. To solve this problem, a selection model of data mining algorithms is proposed. By analyzing the content of business decision and application, user requirements will map to certain data mining category and algorithm. This method makes algorithm selection faster and reasonable to improve the efficiency of applying data mining tools to solve business problems. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The goal is to transform an original dataset X into a protected one X', such that X' does not reveal any relation between confidential and (quasi-)identifier attributes and such that X' can be used to compute reliable statistical information about X. Many specific protection methods have been proposed and analyzed, with respect to the levels of privacy and utility that they offer. However, when measuring utility, only differences between the statistical values of X and X' are considered. This would indicate that datasets protected by SDC methods can be used only for statistical purposes. We show in this paper that this is not the case, because a protected dataset X' can be used to construct good classifiers for future data. To do so, we describe an extensive set of experiments that we have run with different SDC protection methods and different (real) datasets. In general, the resulting classifiers are very good, which is good news for both the SDC and the Privacy-preserving Data Mining communities. In particular, our results question the necessity of some specific protection methods that have appeared in the privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) literature with the clear goal of providing good classification.

J	Yuan, JS; Luo, JB; Wu, Y				Yuan, Junsong; Luo, Jiebo; Wu, Ying			Mining Compositional Features From GPS and Visual Cues for Event Recognition in Photo Collections	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Compositional feature mining; event recognition; geo-tagged images; image data mining	RETRIEVAL; CONTEXT	As digital cameras with Global Positioning System (GPS) capability become available and people geotag their photos using other means, it is of great interest to annotate semantic events (e. g., hiking, skiing, party) characterized by a collection of geotagged photos with timestamps and GPS information at the capture. We address this emerging event classification problem by mining informative features derived from image contents and spatio-temporal traces of GPS coordinates that characterize the underlying movement patterns of various event types, both based on the entire collection as opposed to individual photos. Considering that events are better described by the co-occurrence of objects and scenes, we bundle primitive features such as color and texture histograms or GPS features to form the discriminative compositional feature. A data mining method is proposed to efficiently discover discriminative compositional features of small classification errors. A theoretical analysis is also presented to guide the selection of the data mining parameters. Upon compositional feature mining, we perform the multiclass AdaBoost to further integrate the mined compositional features. Finally, the GPS and visual modalities are united through a confidence-based fusion. Based on a dataset of more than 3000 geotagged images, experimental results have shown the synergy of all of the components in our proposed approach to event classification.

This paper proposes a random effects logistic regression model to predict anomaly detection. Unlike the previous studies on anomaly detection, a random effects model was applied, which accommodates not only the risk factors of the exposures but also the uncertainty not explained by such factors. The specific factors of the risk category such as retained 'protocol type' and 'logged in' are included in the proposed model. The research is based on a sample of 49,427 random observations for 42 variables of the KDD-cup 1999 (Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition) data set that contains 'normal' and 'anomaly' connections. The proposed model has a classification accuracy of 98.94% for the training data set, while that for the validation data set is 98.68%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sandri, M; Zuccolotto, P				Sandri, Marco; Zuccolotto, Paola			Analysis and correction of bias in Total Decrease in Node Impurity measures for tree-based algorithms	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Impurity measures; Ensemble learning; Variable importance	CLASSIFICATION TREES; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE; SELECTION	Variable selection is one of the main problems faced by data mining and machine learning techniques. These techniques are often, more or less explicitly, based on some measure of variable importance. This paper considers Total Decrease in Node Impurity (TDNI) measures, a popular class of variable importance measures defined in the field of decision trees and tree-based ensemble methods, like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines. In spite of their wide use, some measures of this class are known to be biased and some correction strategies have been proposed. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to investigate the source and the characteristics of bias in TDNI measures using the notions of informative and uninformative splits. Secondly, a bias-correction algorithm, recently proposed for the Gini measure in the context of classification, is extended to the entire class of TDNI measures and its performance is investigated in the regression framework using simulated and real data.

J	Tatti, N; Mampaey, M				Tatti, Nikolaj; Mampaey, Michael			Using background knowledge to rank itemsets	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)	SEP 20-24, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN					Assessing the quality of discovered results is an important open problem in data mining. Such assessment is particularly vital when mining itemsets, since commonly many of the discovered patterns can be easily explained by background knowledge. The simplest approach to screen uninteresting patterns is to compare the observed frequency against the independence model. Since the parameters for the independence model are the column margins, we can view such screening as a way of using the column margins as background knowledge. In this paper we study techniques for more flexible approaches for infusing background knowledge. Namely, we show that we can efficiently use additional knowledge such as row margins, lazarus counts, and bounds of ones. We demonstrate that these statistics describe forms of data that occur in practice and have been studied in data mining. To infuse the information efficiently we use a maximum entropy approach. In its general setting, solving a maximum entropy model is infeasible, but we demonstrate that for our setting it can be solved in polynomial time. Experiments show that more sophisticated models fit the data better and that using more information improves the frequency prediction of itemsets.

J	Chen, A; Hong, A				Chen, Argon; Hong, Amos			Sample-Efficient Regression Trees (SERT) for Semiconductor Yield Loss Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Data mining; machine learning; regression analysis; regression tree analysis; variable selection; yield enhancement	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MODEL TREES; INDUCTION	Regression trees have been known to be an effective data mining tool for semiconductor yield analysis. The regression tree is built by iteratively splitting dataset and selecting attributes into a hierarchical tree model. The sample size reduces sharply after few levels of data splitting causing unreliable attribute selection. In contrast, the forward stepwise regression analysis selects critical attributes all the way with the same set of data. Regression analysis is, however, not capable of splitting data into groups with different underlying models. In this research, we propose a sample-efficient regression tree (SERT) approach that combines the forward selection in regression analysis and regression tree methodologies. The proposed approach is shown to be able to fully utilize the dataset's degree of freedom and build piecewise linear model to capture the attribute effects. Case studies show that SERT is effective in discovering yield-loss causes during the yield ramp-up stage where the sample size available for analysis is relatively small.

J	Mohammad, Y; Nishida, T				Mohammad, Yasser; Nishida, Toyoaki			Using physiological signals to detect natural interactive behavior	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						RSST; Psychophysiology; HRI; Data mining		Many researchers in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) domains try to build robots and agents that exhibit human-like behavior in real-world close encounter situations. One major requirement for comparing such robots and agents is to have an objective quantitative metric for measuring naturalness in various kinds of interactions. Some researchers have already suggested techniques for measuring stress level, awareness etc using physiological signals like Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). One problem of available techniques is that they are only tested with extreme situations and cannot according to the analysis provided in this paper distinguish the response of human subjects in natural interaction situations. One other problem of the available techniques is that most of them require calibration and some times ad-hoc adjustment for every subject. This paper explores the usefulness of various kinds of physiological signals and statistics in distinguishing natural and unnatural partner behavior in a close encounter situation. The paper also explores the usefulness of these statistics in various time slots of the interaction. Based on this analysis a regressor was designed to measure naturalness in close encounter situations and was evaluated using human-human and human-robot interactions and shown to achieve statistically significant distinction between natural and unnatural situations.

Specifically, this study combines the inlink and co-link analysis techniques to make a complete examination of the international banking industry. Results from the analysis were compared with the banks' real financial situation to determine the validity and reliability of the link analysis methods. Statistically significant correlations were found between inlink data and several financial variables. A comparison between Asian banks and other banks showed that the former attracted significantly more inlinks. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps generated from co-link data suggest that geographic and linguistic factors determine competitive clusters in the international banking industry. A comparison of the MDS maps from the two different time periods revealed important business information, notably that the Chinese banks moved closer to the major banks from the USA and UK.

J	Bae, MH; Wu, T; Pan, R				Bae, Min Hyeok; Wu, Teresa; Pan, Rong			Mix-ratio sampling: Classifying multiclass imbalanced mouse brain images using support vector machine	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sampling procedure; Imbalanced dataset; Multiclass classification; Support vector machine; Data mining; Brain image segmentation	MULTISPECTRAL MR MICROSCOPY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; NEUROANATOMICAL STRUCTURES; CLASSIFICATION	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classifier designed to achieve optimized classification accuracy. It has been applied to numerous applications associated with images. Yet challenges remain when applying SVM on segmenting mouse brain images. This is due to the fact that each high-resolution mouse brain image is a very large data set and it is a multiclass classification problem with extremely imbalanced data size for different classes. To address these issues, a mix-ratio sampling approach for SVM is proposed which determines various over-sampling ratios for different minority classes. In addition, to improve the imaging classification accuracy, spatial information is incorporated into the classification problem. Five mouse Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) images are collected to test the accuracy of classifying 21 brain structures. The first comparison experiment demonstrates the SVM with mix-ratio sampling method relieves the imbalance problem for multiclass more effectively and efficiently than the SVM with simple over-sampling method. In the second comparison experiment, another classifier, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to compare against SVM based on the same mix-ratio sampled data and the results indicate that SVM shows better classification performance than ANN. Thirdly, the cross validation is conducted to demonstrate SVM with mix-ration sampling can classify multiclass imbalanced data with high accuracy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Malthouse, EC				Malthouse, Edward C.			Accounting for the long-term effects of a marketing contact	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Predictive scoring models; Customer lifetime value; Direct marketing; Data mining	CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE; RESPONSE MODEL; SEGMENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	Organizations that use data mining "scoring" models to estimate the expected revenue resulting from sending a customer some marketing contact such as a catalog, solicitation for a donation, or other offers are underestimating the value of the contact and under-investing in their customers. When a customer responds to the contact the organization will receive the revenue due to the order, which is estimated by the scoring model, but it also benefits because the customer has become a better customer and will thus be more responsive to future contacts. The paper proposes a correction that accounts for the incremental change in customer status and illustrates the correction on two data sets from different industries. In both cases we find that the magnitude of the correlation approximately equals that of the short-term return from the contact. The correction is highly correlated with short-term returns and so the correction has little effect on the rank ordering of the customers. Topics for future research are identified.

We study business confidentiality, as the protection of nonpublic data from institutions, such as companies and people in the public eye. In particular, we relate this concern to the involuntary exposure of confidential Web site information, and we transfer this problem into the field of privacy-preserving data mining. We characterize the possible adversaries interested in disclosing Web site confidential data and the attack strategies that they could use. These attacks are based on different vulnerabilities found in query log for which we present several anonymization heuristics to prevent them. We perform an experimental evaluation to estimate the remaining utility of the log after the application of our anonymization techniques. Our experimental results show that a query log can be anonymized against these specific attacks while retaining a significant volume of useful data.

J	Yun, U; Ryu, KH				Yun, Unil; Ryu, Keun Ho			DISCOVERING IMPORTANT SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS WITH LENGTH-DECREASING WEIGHTED SUPPORT CONSTRAINTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Data mining; knowledge discovery; weighted sequential pattern mining; length-decreasing support constraints	FREQUENT PATTERNS; DATABASES; FRAMEWORK	Sequential pattern mining with constraints has been developed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in mining process. Specifically, there are two interesting constraints for sequential pattern mining. First, some sequences are more important and others are less important. Weight constraints consider the importance of sequences and items within sequences. Second, patterns including only a few items are interesting if they have high support. Meanwhile, long patterns can be interesting although their supports are relatively small. Weight constraints and length-decreasing support constraints are two paradigms aimed at finding important sequential patterns and reducing uninteresting patterns. Although weight and length-decreasing support constraints are vital elements, it is hard to consider both constraints by using previous approaches. In this paper, we integrate weight and length-decreasing support constraints by pushing two constraints into the prefix projection growth method. For pruning techniques, we define the Weighted Smallest Valid Extension property and apply the property to our pruning methods for reducing search space. In performance test, we show that our algorithm mines important sequential patterns with length-decreasing support constraints.

J	Zong, Y; Xu, GD; Zhang, YC; Jiang, H; Li, MC				Zong, Yu; Xu, Guandong; Zhang, Yanchun; Jiang, He; Li, Mingchu			A robust iterative refinement clustering algorithm with smoothing search space	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering; Smoothing search space; Kernel smoothing; Heuristic algorithm	INITIALIZATION	Iterative refinement clustering algorithms are widely used in data mining area, but they are sensitive to the initialization. In the past decades, many modified initialization methods have been proposed to reduce the influence of initialization sensitivity problem. The essence of iterative refinement clustering algorithms is the local search method. The big numbers of the local minimum points which are embedded in the search space make the local search problem hard and sensitive to the initialization. The smaller number of local minimum points, the more robust of initialization for a local search algorithm is. In this paper, we propose a Top-Down Clustering algorithm with Smoothing Search Space (TDCS3) to reduce the influence of initialization. The main steps of TDCS3 are to: (1) dynamically reconstruct a series of smoothed search spaces into a hierarchical structure by 'filling' the local minimum points: (2) at the top level of the hierarchical structure, an existing iterative refinement clustering algorithm is run with random initialization to generate the clustering result: (3) eventually from the second level to the bottom level of the hierarchical structure, the same clustering algorithm is run with the initialization derived from the previous clustering result. Experiment results on 3 synthetic and 10 real world data sets have shown that TDCS3 has significant effects on finding better, robust clustering result and reducing the impact of initialization.

Cooperative clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Cooperative clustering; Similarity histogram; Cooperative contingency graph	GENE-EXPRESSION; ALGORITHMS; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; NETWORK; CANCER; ROBUST	Data clustering plays an important role in many disciplines, including data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and other fields, where there is a need to learn the inherent grouping structure of data in an unsupervised manner. There are many clustering approaches proposed in the literature with different quality/complexity tradeoffs. Each clustering algorithm works on its domain space with no optimum solution for all datasets of different properties, sizes, structures, and distributions. In this paper, a novel cooperative clustering (CC) model is presented. It involves cooperation among multiple clustering techniques for the goal of increasing the homogeneity of objects within the clusters. The CC model is capable of handling datasets with different properties by developing two data structures, a histogram representation of the pair-wise similarities and a cooperative contingency graph. The two data structures are designed to find the matching sub-clusters between different clusterings and to obtain the final set of clusters through a coherent merging process. The cooperative model is consistent and scalable in terms of the number of adopted clustering approaches. Experimental results show that the cooperative clustering model outperforms the individual clustering algorithms over a number of gene expression and text documents datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

When comparing to previous studies on this topic, our research is novel in the following areas: (1) we deal with prepaid clients (previous studies dealt with postpaid clients) who are far more likely to churn, are less stable and much less is known about them (no application, demographical or personal data), (2) we have 1381 potential variables derived from the clients' usage (previous studies dealt with data with at least tens of variables) and (3) we test the stability of models across time for all the percentiles of the lift curve - our test sample is collected six months after the estimation of the model. The main finding from our research is that linear models, especially logistic regression, are a very good choice when modelling churn of the prepaid clients. Decision trees are unstable in high percentiles of the lift curve, and we do not recommend their usage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Performance study of distributed Apriori-like frequent itemsets mining	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distributed data mining; Frequent itemsets generation; The Apriori algorithm; Grid computing	ASSOCIATION RULES; ALGORITHM; DATABASES; PARALLEL; CLUSTER	In this article, we focus on distributed Apriori-based frequent itemsets mining. We present a new distributed approach which takes into account inherent characteristics of this algorithm. We study the distribution aspect of this algorithm and give a comparison of the proposed approach with a classical Apriori-like distributed algorithm, using both analytical and experimental studies. We find that under a wide range of conditions and datasets, the performance of a distributed Apriori-like algorithm is not related to global strategies of pruning since the performance of the local Apriori generation is usually characterized by relatively high success rates of candidate sets frequency at low levels which switch to very low rates at some stage, and often drops to zero. This means that the intermediate communication steps and remote support counts computation and collection in classical distributed schemes are computationally inefficient locally, and then constrains the global performance. Our performance evaluation is done on a large cluster of workstations using the Condor system and its workflow manager DAGMan. The results show that the presented approach greatly enhances the performance and achieves good scalability compared to a typical distributed Apriori founded algorithm.

J	Chang, WW; Yeh, WC; Huang, PC				Chang, Wei-Wen; Yeh, Wei-Chang; Huang, Pei-Chiao			A hybrid immune-estimation distribution of algorithm for mining thyroid gland data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Estimation of distribution algorithms; Immune algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Classification rules	FLOW-SHOP; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; SYSTEM	In this paper we combine the main concepts of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and immune algorithms (IAs) to be a hybrid algorithm called immune-estimation of distribution algorithms (IEDA). Both EDAs and IAs are extended from genetic algorithms (GAs). EDAs eliminate the genetic operation including crossover and mutation from the GAs and places more emphasis on the relation between gene loci. It adopts the distribution of selected individuals in search space and models the probability distributions to generate the next population. However, the primary gap of EDAs is lock of diversity between individuals. Hence, we introduce the IAs that is a new branch in computational intelligence. The main concepts of IAs are suppression and hypermutation that make the individuals be more diversity. Moreover, the primary gap of IAs is to pay no attention to the relation between individuals. Therefore, we combine the main concepts of two algorithms to improve the gaps each other. The classification risk of data mining is applied by this paper and compares the results between IEDA and general GAs in the experiments. We adopt the thyroid gland data set from LICI databases. Based on the obtained results, our research absolute is better than general GAs including accuracy, type I error and type 11 error.

The aim of the proposed approach is to choose an optimal subset of input features using genetic algorithm by eliminating features with little or no predictive information and increase the comprehensibility of resulting HFLANN. Using the functionally expanded of selected features, HFLANN overcomes the nonlinearity nature of problems, which is commonly encountered in single-layer neural networks. The features like simplicity of the architecture and low computational complexity of the network encourage us to use it in classification task of data mining. Further, the issue of statistical tests for comparison of algorithms on multiple datasets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning and data mining studies, has been all but ignored. In this work, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust parametric and nonparametric tests for statistical comparisons of HFLANN with FLANN and RBF classifiers over multiple datasets by an extensive simulation studies.

This article introduces a data mining system that extracts complex behavioral patterns from logged user actions to discover users' high-level strategies. Our application domain is an HCI study aimed at revealing users' strategies in an end-user debugging task and understanding how the strategies relate to gender and to success. We cast this problem as a sequential pattern discovery problem, where user strategies are manifested as sequential behavior patterns. Problematically, we found that the patterns discovered by standard data mining algorithms were difficult to interpret and provided limited information about high-level strategies. To help interpret the patterns as strategies, we examined multiple ways of clustering the patterns into meaningful groups. This collectively led to interesting findings about users' behavior in terms of both gender differences and debugging success. These common behavioral patterns were novel HCI findings about differences in males' and females' behavior with software, and were verified by a parallel study with an independent data set on strategies. As a research endeavor into the interpretability issues faced by data mining techniques, our work also highlights important research directions for making data mining more accessible to non-data-mining experts.

In this paper, we argue that the anomalous behavior of spatial objects in a neighborhood can be truly captured when both (a) spatial autocorrelation (similar behavior of nearby objects due to proximity) and (b) spatial heterogeneity (distinct behavior of nearby objects due to difference in the underlying processes in the region) are taken into consideration for the neighborhood definition. Our approach begins by generating micro neighborhoods around spatial objects encompassing all the information about a spatial object. We selectively merge these based on spatial relationships accounting for autocorrelation and inferential relationships accounting for heterogeneity, forming macro neighborhoods. In such neighborhoods, we then identify (i) spatio-temporal outliers, where individual sensor readings are anomalous, (ii) spatial outliers, where the entire sensor is an anomaly, and (iii) spatio-temporally coalesced outliers, where a group of spatio-temporal outliers in the macro neighborhood are separated by a small time lag indicating the traversal of the anomaly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in neighborhood formation and anomaly detection with experimental results in (i) water monitoring and (ii) highway traffic monitoring sensor datasets. We also compare the results of our approach with an existing approach for spatial anomaly detection.

A model of customer relationship management and business intelligence systems for catalogue and online retailers	INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						E-commerce; Customer relationship management; Business intelligence; Data mining; Catalogue retailer; Online retailer		As more retailers evolve into customer-centric and segment-based business, business intelligence (BI) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems are playing a key role in achieving and maintaining competitive advantage. For the past ten years, the authors have had the rare opportunity of observing and interviewing employees and managers of three different management teams at three separate Fingerhut companies as they experimented with various ITs for their companies. When the first Fingerhut company peaked in 1998, as many as 200 analysts and 40 statisticians mined the database for insights that helped predict consumer shopping patterns and credit behaviour. Data mining and BI helped Fingerhut spot shopping patterns, bring product offerings to the right customers, and nurture customer relationships. By 1998, Fingerhut was the second largest catalogue retailer in the U.S. with revenues nearing $2 billion. However, after Federated acquired Fingerhut in 1999 and made it a subsidiary, Fingerhut Net, it suffered great losses and was eventually liquidated. Finally, a new company, Fingerhut Direct Marketing, was resurrected in 2002 under a new management team, and it once again became successful. What went right? What went wrong? The paper concludes with CRM and BI systems success factors and a discussion of lessons learned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

P-found: Grid-enabling distributed repositories of protein folding and unfolding simulations for data mining	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING-THEORY METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Distributed systems; Service-oriented architecture; Grid	PARALLEL MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; DYNAMEOMICS	The Mound protein folding and unfolding simulation repository is designed to allow scientists to perform data mining and other analyses across large, distributed simulation data sets. There are two storage components in Mound: a primary repository of simulation data that is used to populate the second component, and a data warehouse that contains important molecular properties. These properties may be used for data mining studies. Here we demonstrate how grid technologies can support multiple, distributed Mound installations. In particular, we look at two aspects: firstly, how grid data management technologies can be used to access the distributed data warehouses; and secondly, how the grid can be used to transfer analysis programs to the primary repositories - this is an important and challenging aspect of P-found, due to the large data volumes involved and the desire of scientists to maintain control of their own data. The grid technologies we are developing with the P-found system will allow new large data sets of protein folding simulations to be accessed and analysed in novel ways, with significant potential for enabling scientific discovery.

Synthetic data generators construct artifical data from some models obtained from the original data. Such models are mainly based on statistics and, typically, do not take into account other aspects of interest in artifical intelligence. In this paper we study whether one family of such synthetic data generators (the IPSO family) preserves the properties of the data that are of interest when users plan to apply clustering techniques. In particular, we study the effect of such synthetic data generators on fuzzy clustering. That is, we study the information loss data suffer when the original data are replaced by the synthetic ones.

For the first time in the evolutionary computation literature, a comprehensive test for a rule's statistical significance using Hansen's Superior Predictive Ability is explicitly taken into account in the fitness function, and multi-objective evolutionary optimisation is employed to drive the search towards individual rules with better generalisation abilities. Empirical results on a spot foreign-exchange market index suggest that increased out-of-sample performance can be obtained after accounting for data-mining bias effects in a multi-objective fitness function, as compared to a single-criterion fitness measure that considers solely the average return.

Most of the existing studies for concept drift are based on centralized settings, and are often hard to adapt in a distributed computing environment. In this paper, we investigate a new research problem, P2P concept drift detection, which aims to effectively classify drifting concepts in P2P networks. We propose a novel P2P learning framework for concept drift classification, which includes both reactive and proactive approaches to classify the drifting concepts in a distributed manner. Our empirical study shows that the proposed technique is able to effectively detect the drifting concepts and improve the classification performance.

The usual way to do a similarity search is to map the objects to feature vectors and to model the search as a nearest neighbor query in the multidimensional space where vectors reside. The main critical issues to this process are: the distance function used to measure the proximity between vectors and the index method to accelerate the search. In this paper we propose a formal framework to perform similarity search that provides the user with a high degree of freedom in the choice of both the distance and the index structure used to organize the feature space. More specifically, we introduce a function to approximate eventually any distance function that can be used in conjunction with index structures that divide the feature space in multidimensional rectangular regions. Cases of use and experimental work are presented to demonstrate the applicability and the overhead of the framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, Witkin's field dependence/independence has been widely studied in the area of web searching. It has been suggested that this cognitive style has conceptual links with the holism/serialism. This study aims to investigate the differences between the field dependence/independence and holism/serialism. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study was conducted with 120 students from a UK university. Riding's cognitive style analysis (CSA) and Ford's study preference questionnaire (SPQ) were used to identify the students' cognitive styles. A questionnaire was designed to identify users' preferences for the design of search engines. Data mining techniques were applied to analyse the data obtained from the empirical study. Findings - The results highlight three findings. First, a fundamental link is confirmed between the two cognitive styles. Second, the relationship between field dependent users and holists is suggested to be more prominent than that of field independent users and serialists. Third, the interface design preferences of field dependent and field independent users can be split more clearly than those of holists and serialists.

In particular, we propose a powerful and expressive description language able to represent the spatio-temporal relations appearing in sensor network data along with the environmental information. Furthermore, a general purpose system able to elicit hidden frequent temporal correlations between sensor nodes is presented. The framework has been extended in order to take into account interval-based temporal data by introducing some operators based on a temporal interval logic. A preliminary abstraction step with the aim of segmenting and labelling the real-valued time series into similar subsequences is performed exploiting a kernel density estimation approach. The prposed framework has been evaluated on real world data collected from a wireless sensor network.	[Esposito, Floriana; Basile, Teresa M.

CliDaPa: A new approach to combining clinical data with DNA microarrays	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Breast cancer; DNA microarray; clinical; data mining; clinical tree	GENE-EXPRESSION PATTERNS; BREAST-CANCER; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; DISCOVERY; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; PROFILES; PLATFORM	Traditionally, clinical data have been used as the only source of information to diagnose diseases. Nowadays, other types of information, such as various forms of omics data (e. g. DNA microarrays), are taken into account to improve diagnosis and even prognosis in many diseases. This paper proposes a new approach, called CliDaPa, for efficiently combining both sources of information, namely clinical data and gene expressions, in order to further improve estimations. In this approach, patients are firstly divided into different clusters (represented as a decision tree) depending on their clinical information. Thus, different groups of patients with similar behaviors are identified. Each individual group can be studied and classified separately, using only gene expression data, with different supervised classification methods, such as decision trees, Bayesian networks or lazy induction learning. To validate this method, two datasets based on Breast Cancer, a high social impact disease, have been used. For the proposed approach, internal (0.632 Bootstrap) and external validations have been carried out. Results have shown improvements in accuracy in the internal and external validation compared with the standard methods with clinical data and gene expression data separately. Thus, the CliDaPa algorithm fulfills our proposed objectives.	[Gonzalez, S.; Guerra, L.; Robles, V.; Pena, J.

Nowadays, data mining (DM) classification and prediction techniques are widely used in various fields. However, this approach has not attracted much interest from people in human resource. In this article, we attempt to determine the potential classification techniques for academic talent forecasting in higher education institutions. Academic talents are considered as valuable human capital which is the required talents can be classified by using past experience knowledge discovered from related databases. As a result, the classification model will be used for academic talent forecasting. In the experimental phase, we have used selected DM classification techniques. The potential technique is suggested based on the accuracy of classification model generated by that technique. Finally, the results illustrate there are some issues and challenges rise in this study, especially to acquire a good classification model.

That is why discovering patterns of higher level is an active research field. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between local constraint-based mining and constraint satisfaction problems and we propose an approach to model and mine patterns combining several local patterns, i.e., patterns defined by n-ary constraints. The user specifies a set of n-ary constraints and a constraint solver generates the whole set of solutions. Our approach takes benefit from the recent progress on mining local patterns by pushing with a solver on local patterns all local constraints which can be inferred from the n-ary ones. This approach enables us to model in a flexible way any set of constraints combining several local patterns. Experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Most approaches to association rule mining assume that all items within a dataset have a uniform distribution with respect to support. Therefore, weighted association rule mining (WARM) was introduced to provide a notion of importance to individual items. Previous approaches to the weighted association rule mining problem require users to assign weights to items. This is infeasible when millions of items are present in a dataset. In this paper we propose a method that is based on a novel Valency model that automatically infers item weights based on interactions between items. Our experimentation shows that the weighting scheme results in rules that better capture the natural variation that occurs in a dataset when compared to a miner that does not employ such a weighting scheme.

Information loss should be minimized during the masking process in order to enable a proper exploitation of data. Even though several masking methods have been designed for numerical data, very few of them deal with categorical (textual) information. In this case, the quality of the anonymized dataset is closely related to the preservation of semantics, a dimension which is commonly neglected of shallowly considered in related words. In this paper, a new masking method for unbounded categorical attributes is proposed. It relies on the knowledge modeled in ontologies in order to semantically interpret the input data and perform data transformations aiming to minimize the loss of semantic content. On the contrary to exhaustive methods based on simple hierarchical structures, our approach relies on a set of heuristics in order to guide and optimize the masking process, ensuring its scalability when dealing with big and heterogenous datasets and wide ontologies. The evaluation performed over real textual data suggests that our method is able to produce anonymized datasets which significantly preserve data semantics in comparison to apporaches based on data distribution metrics.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper has applied statistical disclosure control (SDC) techniques to achieve its goal. More precisely, it has introduced the micro-aggregation of web access logs. Findings - The experiments show that the proposed technique provides good results in general, but it is especially outstanding when dealing with relatively small websites. Research limitations/implications - As in all SDC techniques there is always a trade-off between privacy and utility or, in other words, between disclosure risk and information loss. In this proposal, it has borne this issue in mind, providing k-anonymity, while preserving acceptable information accuracy. Practical implications - Web server logs are valuable information used nowadays for user profiling and general data-mining analysis of a website in e-commerce and e-services. This Proposal allows anonymizing such logs, so they can be safely outsourced to other companies for marketing purposes, stored for further analysis, or made publicly available, without risking customer privacy. Originality/value - Current solutions to the problem presented here are very poor and scarce. They are normally reduced to the elimination of sensitive information from query strings of URLs in general. Moreover, to its knowledge, the use of SDC techniques has never been applied to the anonymization of web logs.

Approximating this distance is a fundamental primitive on massive databases, with applications to clustering, nearest neighbor search, network monitoring, regression, sampling, and support vector machines. We give the first 1-pass streaming algorithm for this problem in the turnstile model with O*(epsilon(-2)) space and O*(1) update time. The O* notation hides polylogarithmic factors in epsilon, n, and the precision "required to store vector entries. All previous algorithms either required Omega(epsilon(-3)) space or Omega(epsilon(-2)) update time and/or could not work in the turnstile model (i.e., support an arbitrary number of updates to each coordinate). Our bounds are optimal up to O*(1) factors.

As a consequence, a new paradigm has emerged to respond more effectively to a elms of new problems in Data Mining. In this paper we address the problem of monitoring the evolution of clusters and propose the MClusT framework, which was developed along the lines of this new Change Mining paradigm. MClusT includes a taxonomy of transitions, a tracking method based in Graph Theory; and a transition detection algorithm. To demonstrate its feasibility and applicability we present; real world case studies, using datasets extracted from Banco de Portugal and the Portuguese Institute of Statistics. We also test our approach in a benchmark dataset from TSDL. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the ability of MClusT framework to provide an efficient diagnosis of clusters transitions.

An Epidemiological Modeling and Data Integration Framework	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Computer models; computer simulation; infectious disease transmission	INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; SPREAD; SYSTEM; VIRUS	Objectives: In this work, a cellular automaton software package for simulating different infectious diseases, storing the simulation results in a data warehouse system and analyzing the obtained results to generate prediction models as well as contingency plans, is proposed. The Brisbane H3N2 flu virus, which has been spreading during the winter season 2009, was used for simulation in the federal state of Tyrol, Austria. Methods: The simulation-modeling framework consists of an underlying cellular automaton. The cellular automaton model is parameterized by known disease parameters and geographical as well as demographical conditions are included for simulating the spreading. The data generated by simulation are stored in the back room of the data warehouse using the Talend Open Studio software package, and subsequent statistical and data mining tasks are performed using the tool, termed Knowledge Discovery in Database Designer (KD(3)). Results:The obtained simulation results were used for generating prediction models for all nine federal states of Austria. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a powerful and easy to handle interface for parameterizing and simulating different infectious diseases in order to generate prediction models and improve contingency plans for future events.

It can also be described as a data-driven approach to agriculture, which is strongly connected with a number of data mining problems. One of those is also an inherently important task in agriculture: yield prediction. Given a yield prediction model, which of the predictor variables are the important ones? In the past, a number of approaches have been proposed towards this problem. For yield prediction, a broad variety of regression models for non-spatial data can be adapted for spatial data using a novel spatial cross-validation technique. Since this procedure is at the core of variable importance assessment, it will be briefly introduced here. Given this spatial yield prediction model, a novel approach towards assessing a variable's importance will be presented. It essentially consists of picking each of the predictor variables, one at a time, permutating its values in the test set and observing the deviation of the model's RMSE. This article uses two real-world data sets from precision agriculture and evaluates the above procedure.

FPGA provides a highly parallel, low power, and flexible hardware platform for this domain, while the difficulty of programming FPGA greatly limits its prevalence. MapReduce is a parallel programming framework that could easily utilize inherent parallelism in algorithms. In this paper, we describe FPMR, a MapReduce framework on FPGA, which provides programming abstraction, hardware architecture, and basic building blocks to developers. An on-chip processor scheduler is implemented to maximize the utilization of computation resources and achieve better load balancing. An efficient data access scheme is carefully designed to maximize data reuse and throughput. Meanwhile, the FPMR framework hides the task control, synchronization, and communication away from designers so that more attention can be paid to the application itself A case study of RankBoost acceleration based on FPMR demonstrates that FPMR efficiently helps with the development productivity; and the speedup is 31.8x versus CPU-based implementation. This performance is comparable to a fully manually designed version, which achieves 33.5x speedup. Two other applications: SVM, PageRank are also discussed show the generalization of the framework.

With sheer amounts of data streams are now available for subscription on our smart mobile phones, the potential of using this data for decision making using data stream mining techniques has now been achievable owing to the increasing power of these handheld devices. Wireless communication among these devices using Bluetooth and WiFi technologies has opened the door wide for collaborative mining among the mobile devices within the same range that are running data mining techniques targeting the same application. This paper proposes a new architecture that we have prototyped for realizing the significant applications in this area. We have proposed using mobile software agents in this application for several reasons. Most importantly the autonomic intelligent behaviour of the agent technology has been the driving force for using it in this application. Other efficiency reasons are discussed in details in this paper. Experimental results showing the feasibility of the proposed architecture are presented and discussed.

We use the principle of conservation to identify activity that consistently precedes an outcome in patients, and describe a two-stage process that allows us to efficiently search for such patterns in large datasets. This involves first transforming continuous physiological signals from patients into symbolic sequences, and then searching for patterns in these reduced representations that are strongly associated with an outcome. Our strategy of identifying conserved activity that is unlikely to have occurred purely by chance in symbolic data is analogous to the discovery of regulatory motifs in genomic datasets. We build upon existing work in this area, generalizing the notion of a regulatory motif and enhancing current techniques to operate robustly on non-genomic data. We also address two significant considerations associated with motif discovery in general: computational efficiency and robustness in the presence of degeneracy and noise. To deal with these issues, we introduce the concept of active regions and new subset-based techniques such as a two-layer Gibbs sampling algorithm. These extensions allow for a framework for information inference, where precursors are identified as approximately conserved activity of arbitrary complexity preceding multiple occurrences of an event. We evaluated our solution on a population of patients who experienced sudden cardiac death and attempted to discover electrocardiographic activity that may be associated with the endpoint of death. To assess the predictive patterns discovered, we compared likelihood scores for motifs in the sudden death population against control populations of normal individuals and those with non-fatal supraventricular arrhythmias. Our results suggest that predictive motif discovery may be able to identify clinically relevant information even in the absence of significant prior knowledge.

In order to deploy an RBAC system, one requires to first identify a complete set of roles. This process, known as role engineering, has been identified as one of the costliest tasks in migrating to RBAC. Several approaches have been proposed that mostly use data mining techniques to discover roles. However, most of them do not consider the existing roles and try to define everything from scratch, which is not acceptable for organizations that already have an RBAC system in place. In this paper, we formally define the problem of mining role hierarchy with minimal perturbation and present State Miner, a heuristic solution to find an RBAC state as similar as possible to both the existing state and the optimal state. We present experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	[Takabi, Hassan; Joshi, James B.

Data mining technologies extract hidden information and knowledge from large data stored in databases or data warehouses, thereby supporting the corporate decision making process. In this study, we apply a two-level approach that combines SOM-Ward clustering and decision trees to conduct customer portfolio analysis for a case company. The created two-level model was then used to identify potential high-value customers from the customer base. It was found that this hybrid approach could provide more detailed and accurate information about the customer base for tailoring actionable marketing strategies.

In light of this, the goal of the present paper is to introduce a novel framework to study one interesting topic in cognitive and behavioral studies - multimodal communication between human-human and human-robot interaction. We present an overall solution from data capture, through data coding and validation, to data analysis and visualization. In data collection, we have developed a multimodal sensing system to gather fine-grained video, audio and human body movement data. In data analysis, we propose a hybrid solution based on visual data mining and information-theoretic measures. We suggest that this data-driven paradigm will lead not only to breakthroughs in understanding multimodal communication, but will also serve as a successful case study to demonstrate the promise of data-intensive discovery which can be applied in various research topics in cognitive and behavioral studies.

As an important data mining technique, clustering has been used to analyze XML data. The key issue of XML clustering is how to measure the similarity between XML documents. Traditionally, document clustering methods use the content information to measure the document similarity, the structural information contained in XML documents is ignored. In this paper, we propose a model called Structure and Content Vector Model(SCVM) to represent the structure and content information in XML documents. Based on the model, we define similarity measure that can be used to cluster XML documents. Our experimental results show that the proposed model and similarity measure are effective in identifying similar documents when the structure information contained in XML documents is meaningful. This method can be used to improve the precision and efficiency in XML information retrieval.

However, the search space for mining negative patterns is much bigger than that for positive ones. When the support threshold is low, in particular, there will be huge amounts of negative candidates. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based algorithm to find negative sequential patterns with novel crossover and mutation operations, which are efficient at passing good genes on to next generations without generating candidates. An effective dynamic fitness function and a pruning method are also provided to improve performance. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed method can find negative patterns efficiently and has remarkable performance compared with some other algorithms of negative pattern mining.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) based tracking scheme for abrupt motion problem in Bayesian filtering framework. In our tracking scheme, the particle weight is dynamically estimated by learning the density of states in simulations, and thus the local-trap problem suffered by the conventional MCMC sampling-based methods could be essentially avoided. In addition, we design an adaptive SAMC sampling method to further speed up the sampling process for tracking of abrupt motion. It combines the SAMC sampling and a density grid based statistical predictive model, to give a data-mining mode embedded global sampling scheme. It is computationally efficient and effective in dealing with abrupt motion difficulties. We compare it with alternative tracking methods. Extensive experimental results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in dealing with various types of abrupt motions.

J	Jea, KF; Li, CW				Jea, Kuen-Fang; Li, Chao-Wei			Discovering frequent itemsets over transactional data streams through an efficient and stable approximate approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Data stream; Frequent itemset; Approximation; Combinatorics		A data stream is a massive and unbounded sequence of data elements that are continuously generated at a fast speed. Compared with traditional approaches, data mining in data streams is more challenging since several extra requirements need to be satisfied. In this paper, we propose a mining algorithm for finding frequent itemsets over the transactional data stream. Unlike most of existing algorithms, our method works based on the theory of Approximate Inclusion-Exclusion. Without incrementally maintaining the overall synopsis of the stream, we can approximate the itemsets' counts according to certain kept information and the counts bounding technique. Some additional techniques are designed and integrated into the algorithm for performance improvement. Besides, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested and analyzed through a series of experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose a new approach inspired by the early vision. system, of the primate for data clustering. Human beings are able to locate key points that contains more important information in a complex scene. To realize this function, our approach uses a computational visual attention model that selects and extracts salient areas in visual field by local difference features. Then the extracted salient areas in original visual field can be regarded as the clusters in the data feature space. Without prior knowledge, this attention Model based approach Can identify data clusters with arbitrary shapes at different scales. Finally our algorithm has been tested in the evaluation experiments on the benchmark datasets to show its competitive performance.

Most of the traditional clustering methods can be categorized as local or global ones. In this paper, a novel clustering method that can explore both the local and global information in the data set is proposed. The method, Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR), aims to minimize a cost function that properly trades off the local and global costs. We show that such an optimization problem can be solved by the eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix; which can be done efficiently using iterative methods. Finally, the experimental results on several data sets are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about how their behaviors impact the earth. Therefore, with the emergence of a customer-oriented market, identifying consumers' behaviors has become an important issue for businesses. Determining how to identify target customers who are satisfied and willing to pay more, is an important issue. In this study, we applied data mining techniques to cope with this problem; a list of questionnaires was used to determine the preferences of customers with respect to a green 3C product in Taiwan. in order to tell the differences between the heterogeneous customers, clustering analysis is needed. Behavior variables, psychological variables, geographic variables. demographic variables, environmental knowledge, attitudes toward environmental protection and non-purchasing environmental behaviors were used to profile customers. Step-wise regression and ANOVA analysis were used to obtain the suitable segmentation variables. After clustering analysis, customers were segmented into different groups. The promoter or passive one in each cluster, as indicated by the net promoter score technology, is the satisfied customer in the corresponding cluster. A bi-objective nonlinear mixed integer problem is constructed with multiattribute utility theory; optimal price and promotion strategies can be provided as the foundation for marketing for satisfying both supplier and customer with a win-win concept. Then, business can really transmit the selling information to the users and improve the satisfaction of detractors to increase sales and profit. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhu, D; Li, XB; Wu, SN				Zhu, Dan; Li, Xiao-Bai; Wu, Shuning			Identity disclosure protection: A data reconstruction approach for privacy-preserving data mining	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy; Identity disclosure; k-Anonymity; Data mining; Genetic algorithm	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; K-ANONYMITY; SYSTEMS; REDUCTION; DATABASES; SECURITY	Identity disclosure is one of the most serious privacy concerns in today's information age. A well-known method for protecting identity disclosure is k-anonymity. A dataset provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each individual in the dataset cannot be distinguished from at least k - 1 individuals whose information also appears in the dataset. There is a flaw in k-anonymity that would still allow an intruder to discern the confidential information of individuals in the anonymized data. To overcome this problem, we propose a data reconstruction approach to achieve k-anonymity protection in predictive data mining. In this approach, the potentially identifying attributes are first masked using aggregation (for numeric data) and swapping (for nominal data). A genetic algorithm technique is then applied to the masked data to find a good Subset of it. This Subset is then replicated to form the released dataset that satisfies the k-anonymity constraint.

RST selects the least descriptor sets for discriminating one sample from the others. These descriptor sets are called reducts. RST constructs any possible rules for high activity using the specific reduct. We have used dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors as a validation set of RST This data set has been thoroughly investigated in several studies and the structural requirements for high activity have been well known. The RST-based rules were well matched to these structural requirements and thus utility of RST has been proved. According to the success in this study, further applications to data sets that have more diverse compounds and more noisy activity would be expected (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

From data to knowledge mining	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Data Mining; Knowledge Cohesion; Ontology; Sense Making; Text Mining	IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; METRICS; DESIGN	Most past approaches to data mining have been based on association rules. However, the simple application of association rules usually only changes the user's problem from dealing with millions of data points to dealing with thousands of rules Although this may somewhat reduce the scale of the problem, it is not a completely satisfactory solution. This paper presents interest in exploring certain data sets to extract knowledge, in the form of semantic nets, from large data sets. The KC method has been successfully applied to mine causal relations from oil platform accident reports. In a comparison with association rule techniques for the same domain, KC has shown a significant improvement in the extraction of relevant knowledge, using processing complexity and knowledge manageability as the evaluation criteria.

It is important for students to acquire knowledge and hands-on experience in Web mining during their education in information systems curricula. This paper reports on an experience using open Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that have been made available by major Internet companies (e. g., Google, Amazon, and eBay) in a class project to teach Web mining applications. The instructor's observations of the students' performance and a survey of the students' opinions show that the class project achieved its objectives and students acquired valuable experience in leveraging the APIs to build interesting Web mining applications.

When the label is a continuous variable in the data, two possible approaches based on existing decision tree algorithms can be used to handle the situations. The first uses a data discretization method in the preprocessing stage to convert the continuous label into a class label defined by a finite set of nonoverlapping intervals and then applies a decision tree algorithm. The second simply applies a regression tree algorithm, using the continuous label directly. These approaches have their own drawbacks. We propose an algorithm that dynamically discretizes the continuous label at each node during the tree induction process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the preprocessing approach, the regression tree approach, and several nontree-based algorithms.

Each branch of such a company maintains a separate database over time. The variation of sales of an item over time is an important issue. Thus, we introduce the notion of stability of an item. Stable items are useful in making many strategic decisions for a company. Based on the degree of stability of an item, we design an algorithm for clustering items in different data sources. We have proposed the notion of best cluster by considering average degree of variation of a class.

We model sequences with Markov models whose states correspond to nodes in the provided taxonomy, and each state represents the events in the subtree under the corresponding node. By lumping observed events to states that correspond to internal nodes in the taxonomy, we allow more compact models that are easier to understand and visualize, at the expense of a decrease in the data likelihood. We formally define and characterize our problem, and we propose a scalable search method for finding a good trade-off between two conflicting goals: maximizing the data likelihood, and minimizing the model complexity. We implement these ideas in Taxomo, a taxonomy-driven modeler, which we apply in two different domains, query-log mining and mining of moving-object trajectories. The empirical evaluation confirms the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.

A Parameterized Approach to Spam-Resilient Link Analysis of the Web	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Internet search; information search and retrieval; information storage and retrieval; information technology and systems; distributed systems; systems and software; Web search; general; Web-based services; online information services		Link-based analysis of the Web provides the basis for many important applications-like Web search, Web-based data mining, and Web page categorization-that bring order to the massive amount of distributed Web content. Due to the overwhelming reliance on these important applications, there is a rise in efforts to manipulate (or spam) the link structure of the Web. In this manuscript, we present a parameterized framework for link analysis of the Web that promotes spam resilience through a source-centric view of the Web. We provide a rigorous study of the set of critical parameters that can impact source-centric link analysis and propose the novel notion of influence throttling for countering the influence of link-based manipulation. Through formal analysis and a large-scale experimental study, we show how different parameter settings may impact the time complexity, stability, and spam resilience of Web link analysis. Concretely, we find that the source-centric model supports more effective and robust rankings in comparison with existing Web algorithms such as PageRank.

J	Chen, YW; Larbani, M; Hsieh, CY; Chen, CW				Chen, Yuh-Wen; Larbani, Moussa; Hsieh, Cheng-Yen; Chen, Chao-Wen			Introduction of affinity set and its application in data-mining example of delayed diagnosis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Delayed diagnosis; Emergency room (ER); Affinity set; Data-mining; Topology; Rough set; Neural network; Support vector machine	MISSED INJURY; FUZZY-SETS; TRAUMA; SIMILARITY	At least 44,000 people die in hospitals each year as a result of medical errors, and these deaths are becoming the eighth-leading cause of death in the United States. Thus, medical providers have the responsibility to pay attention for reducing avoidable medical errors and improve patient safety as best as they can. It requires the rapid evaluation and prioritisation of life threatening injuries in the primary survey followed by a detailed secondary survey in the emergency room. However, time is always valuable and limited such that some important vital signs may be delayed and ignored. This research explores delayed diagnosis problem and uses the affinity set by Topology concept to classify/focus on key attributes causing delayed diagnosis (missed injury) in order to reduce error risk. Results interestingly indicate that when a patient can breathe normally, but his (or her) blood-pressure or pulse is abnormal, a high probability of delayed diagnosis exists. This affinity work also compares the performance with the model of rough set (Rosetta), neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. And our affinity model shows its advantage by prediction accuracy and explanation power. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predictive datamining techniques are applied to a multi-year set of manufacturing data with the purpose of reducing the variation of a crystal manufacturing process, which suffers from frequent fluctuations of the average outgoing yield. Our study is focused on specific defects that are the most common causes for scraping a manufactured crystal. A set of probabilistic rules explaining the likelihood of each defect as a function of interaction between the controllable variables are induced using the single-target and the multi-target Information Network algorithms. The rules clearly define the worst and the best conditions for the manufacturing process, also providing a complete explanation of all major fluctuations in the outgoing quality observed over the recent years. In addition, we show that an early detection of nearly the same predictive model was possible almost two years before the end of the data collection period, which could save many of the flawed crystals. The paper provides a detailed description of the optimization process, including the decisions taken at various stages and their outcomes. Conclusions applicable to similar engineering tasks are also outlined.

This paper proposes a regularized multiple criteria linear program (RMCLP) for two classes of classification problems. It first adds some regularization terms in the objective function of the known multiple criteria linear program (MCLP) model for possible existence of solution. Then the paper describes the mathematical framework of the solvability. Finally, a series of experimental tests are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RMCLP with the existing methods: MCLP, multiple criteria quadratic program (MCQP), and support vector machine (SVM). The results of four publicly available datasets and a real-life credit dataset all show that RMCLP is a competitive method in classification. Furthermore, this paper explores an ordinal RMCLP (ORMCLP) model for ordinal multi-group problems.

PATTERN RECOGNITION OF LONGITUDINAL TRIAL DATA WITH NONIGNORABLE MISSINGNESS: AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Nonmissing at random; intermittent missing; growth pattern recognition; parallel mixture model; fuzzy clustering	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; MULTIVARIATE INCOMPLETE DATA; ESTIMATING EQUATION APPROACH; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; MIXTURE-MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE; ENTROPY APPROACH; ALGORITHM; VALUES; NONRESPONSE	Methods for identifying meaningful growth patterns of longitudinal trial data with both nonignorable intermittent and drop-out missingness are rare. In this study, a combined approach with statistical and data mining techniques is utilized to address the nonignorable missing data issue in growth pattern recognition. First, a parallel mixture model is proposed to model the nonignorable missing information from a real-world patient-oriented study and concurrently to estimate the growth trajectories of participants. Then, based on individual growth parameter estimates and their auxiliary feature attributes, a fuzzy clustering method is incorporated to identify the growth patterns. This case study demonstrates that the combined multi-step approach can achieve both statistical generality and computational efficiency for growth pattern recognition in longitudinal studies with nonignorable missing data.

J	Ouyang, J; Patel, N; Sethi, I				Ouyang, Jie; Patel, Nilesh; Sethi, Ishwar			Induction of multiclass multifeature split decision trees from distributed data	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Distributed data mining; Decision tree; Fisher linear discriminant	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FACE RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; LDA	The decision tree-based classification is a popular approach for pattern recognition and data mining. Most decision tree induction methods assume training data being present at one central location. Given the growth in distributed databases at geographically dispersed locations, the methods for decision tree induction in distributed settings are gaining importance. This paper describes one such method that generates compact trees using multifeature splits in place of single feature split decision trees generated by most existing methods for distributed data. Our method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant function, and is capable of dealing with multiple classes in the data. For homogeneously distributed data, the decision trees produced by our method are identical to decision trees generated using Fisher's linear discriminant function with centrally stored data. For heterogeneously distributed data, a certain approximation is involved with a small change in performance with respect to the tree generated with centrally stored data. Experimental results for several well-known datasets are presented and compared with decision trees generated using Fisher's linear discriminant function with centrally stored data.

J	Zeng, XH; Pei, J; Wang, K; Li, JY				Zeng, Xinghuo; Pei, Jian; Wang, Ke; Li, Jinyan			PADS: a simple yet effective pattern-aware dynamic search method for fast maximal frequent pattern mining	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Max-pattern mining; Frequent pattern mining; Pattern-aware search	DISCOVERY	While frequent pattern mining is fundamental for many data mining tasks, mining maximal frequent patterns efficiently is important in both theory and applications of frequent pattern mining. The fundamental challenge is how to search a large space of item combinations. Most of the existing methods search an enumeration tree of item combinations in a depth-first manner. In this paper, we develop a new technique for more efficient max-pattern mining. Our method is pattern-aware: it uses the patterns already found to schedule its future search so that many search subspaces can be pruned. We present efficient techniques to implement the new approach. As indicated by a systematic empirical study using the benchmark data sets, our new approach outperforms the currently fastest max-pattern mining algorithms FPMax* and LCM2 clearly.

Pilot work using logistic regression to predict overweight and obese children demonstrated relatively limited success. Hence we investigate the incorporation of non-linear interactions to help improve accuracy of prediction; by comparing the result of logistic regression with those of six mature data mining techniques. The contributions of this paper are as follows: a) a comparison of logistic regression with six data mining techniques: specifically, for the prediction of overweight and obese children at 3 years using data recorded at birth, 6 weeks, 8 months and 2 years respectively; b) improved accuracy of prediction: prediction at 8 months accuracy is improved very slightly, in this case by using neural networks, whereas for prediction at 2 years obtained accuracy is improved by over 10%, in this case by using Bayesian methods. It has also been shown that incorporation of non-linear interactions could be important in epidemiological prediction, and that data mining techniques are becoming sufficiently well established to offer the medical research community a valid alternative to logistic regression.

J	Yin, YF				Yin, Yunfei			A proximate dynamics model for data mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Dynamics; Stability; Clustering; Proximate model	CUSTOMER RETENTION; RULES	Many association rules with low supports and high confidence are commonly not convincing, so how to enhance the conviction of such rules is a big issue. In this paper, we explore the dynamics features of the domain dataset, and by predefining some dynamics parameters (as priori knowledge), we construct a proximate dynamics model for data mining so as to enhance the conviction of the rules With low supports. For constructing such dynamics model for data mining, we adopt three techniques: (I) a large domain dataset is classified into several sub-clusters, which we regard as proximate dynamics systems: (2) the data mining process is a solving process of differential equations, which captures the changes of the data, not only the Values themselves; and (3) a weighting method is used to synthesize the local mining results with the users' preferences. Although we "arbitrarily" apply the dynamics parameters into the sub-clusters of the given dataset, the experimental results are very well by comparing with FP-growth algorithm and CLOSET+ algorithm. Experiments conducted on the distributed network with three real life datasets show that the proposed method can discover the knowledge based on dynamics, which is potentially useful for mining the rules with low Supports and high confidence.

J	Yoo, JS; Shekhar, S				Yoo, Jin Soung; Shekhar, Shashi			Similarity-Profiled Temporal Association Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Temporal data mining; temporal association pattern; support time sequence; similarity		Given a time stamped transaction database and a user-defined reference sequence of interest over time, similarity-profiled temporal association mining discovers all associated item sets whose prevalence variations over time are similar to the reference sequence. The similar temporal association patterns can reveal interesting relationships of data items which co-occur with a particular event over time. Most works in temporal association mining have focused on capturing special temporal regulation patterns such as cyclic patterns and calendar scheme-based patterns. However, our model is flexible in representing interesting temporal patterns using a user-defined reference sequence. The dissimilarity degree of the sequence of support values of an item set to the reference sequence is used to capture how well its temporal prevalence variation matches the reference pattern. By exploiting interesting properties such as an envelope of support time sequence and a lower bounding distance for early pruning candidate item sets, we develop an algorithm for effectively mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns. We prove the algorithm is correct and complete in the mining results and provide the computational analysis. Experimental results on real data as well as synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than a sequential method using a traditional support-pruning scheme.

J	Chen, YS; Cheng, CH				Chen, You-Shyang; Cheng, Ching-Hsue			Evaluating industry performance using extracted RGR rules based on feature selection and rough sets classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Revenue growth rate (RGR); Rough sets classifier; Feature selection; Fundamental analysis; Data mining techniques	INITIAL RETURNS; MODEL	In strategy of investment, an important thing for investors is to correctly predict firm's revenue growth rate (RGR), which is an effective evaluation indicator for them to see how big the potential power of future development is and measure how about: the growth of future development for a target firm that may be selected to investment portfolios. However, conventional methods of forecasting RGR have some shortcomings such as statistical methods based on strict assumptions of linearity and/or normality limit applications in real world. Additionally, due to rapid changing of information technology (IT) today, some techniques (i.e. rough sets and data mining tools) have become important research trends to both practitioners and academicians. With these reasons above, a new procedure, using the feature selection method and rough sets classifier, is proposed to extract decision rules and improve accuracy rate for classifying RGR. In empirical study, an actual RGR dataset collected from publicly traded company of stock markets is employed to illustrate the proposed procedure. The experimental results of RGR dataset analyses indicate that the proposed procedure surpasses the listing methods in terms of both higher accuracy and fewer attributes, and the output of proposed procedure is to generate a set of easily understandable decision rules that are readily applied in knowledge-based investment systems by investors.

J	Tu, L; Chen, YX				Tu, Li; Chen, Yixin			Stream Data Clustering Based on Grid Density and Attraction	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Stream data; data mining; clustering; density-based algorithms		Clustering real-time stream data is an important and challenging problem. Existing algorithms such as CluStream are based on the k-means algorithm. These clustering algorithms have difficulties finding clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling outliers. Further, they require the knowledge of k and user-specified time window. To address these issues, this article proposes D-Stream, a framework for clustering stream data using a density-based approach. Our algorithm uses an online component that maps each input data record into a grid and an offline component that computes the grid density and clusters the grids based on the density. The algorithm adopts a density decaying technique to capture the dynamic changes of a data stream and a attraction-based mechanism to accurately generate cluster boundaries. Exploiting the intricate relationships among the decay factor, attraction, data density, and cluster structure, our algorithm can efficiently and effectively generate and adjust the clusters in real time. Further, a theoretically sound technique is developed to detect and remove sporadic grids mapped by outliers in order to dramatically improve the space and time efficiency of the system. The technique makes high-speed data stream clustering feasible without degrading the clustering quality. The experimental results show that our algorithm has superior quality and efficiency, can find clusters of arbitrary shapes, and can accurately recognize the evolving behaviors of real-time data streams.
