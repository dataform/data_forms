MINING EMERGING PATTERNS FROM TIME SERIES DATA WITH TIME GAP CONSTRAINT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Emerging patterns; Contrast sets; Time series data analysis; Symbolic aggregative approximation (SAX); Perceptually important points (PIPs)	SETS	Discovery of powerful contrasts between datasets is an important issue in data mining. To address this, the concept of emerging patterns (EPs) has thus been introduced by Dong and Li. EPs are a set of itemsets whose support changes significantly from one dataset to another. Although an increasing number of works focus on this topic with regard to relational databases, few have considered mining EPs in time series. In this paper, we thus propose a framework named PIPs-SAX for mining EPs from time series data. The framework contains two phases: the first phase is data transformation and the second is the EPs mining. The first phase transforms the time series data into a symbolic representation based on the SAX and PIPs algorithms. In the second phase, we propose an algorithm, called TSEPsMiner, to mine time series EPs with a time gap constraint. Experiments on financial data collected from the Taiwanese stock exchange were also made in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The datasets are generated at software running time. And the method compares the datasets with the static attribute feature datasets generated at software testing time. So this method can make recommendations for users in services selection time under the environment of SaaS. The measurement method is carried out in three stages: firstly, defining the concept of trust, software trustworthiness, static and dynamic feature datasets with fundamental calculating criteria; secondly, providing a group of formulas to illustrate congruence measurement approach for comparing the two types of feature datasets; lastly, giving an architecture supported by software trustworthiness measurement algorithm to evaluate conceptualized hierarchical software trustworthiness.

J	Bae, JK; Kim, J				Bae, Jae Kwon; Kim, Jinhwa			Product development with data mining techniques: A case on design of digital camera	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						New product development; Data mining based methodology; Association rule; Decision tree based models		Many enterprises have been devoting a significant portion of their budget to product development in order to distinguish their products from those of their competitors and to make them better fit the needs and wants of customers. Hence, businesses should develop product designing that could satisfy the customers' requirements since this will increase the enterprise's competitiveness and it is an essential criterion to earning higher loyalties and profits. This paper investigates the following research issues in the development of new digital camera products: (1) What exactly are the customers' "needs" and "wants" for digital camera products? (2) What features is more importance than others? (3) Can product design and planning for product lines/product collection be integrated with the knowledge of customers? (4) How can the rules help us to make a strategy during we design new digital camera? To investigate these research issues, the Apriori and C5.0 algorithms are methodologies of association rules and decision trees for data mining, which is implemented to mine customer's needs. Knowledge extracted from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules on a product map in order to propose possible suggestions and solutions for product design and marketing.

Substantively, innumerable global on-line community members share common interests with each other via the User Generated Content (UGC) platforms. Facebook is one of them and it facilitates the social networking participants to deliver the digital contents to authorized consumers or specific groups. As cybercrimes mushroom in recent years, more and more digital crime investigations have strong relations to Facebook. Unarguably, Facebook has been exploited via global perpetrators. Consequently, we spotlight on live data acquisition within the RAM of the desktop PC with emphasis on some distinct strings that could be found in order to reconstruct the previous Facebook session, which plays an extremely precious role for the associate digital forensics investigators to incubate additional thoughtful decisions concerning the discovery of breadcrumb digital evidences in this unparalleled cybercrime incidents era.

A Bayes-true data generator for evaluation of supervised and unsupervised learning methods	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Synthetic data generation; Benchmarking; Experimental proofs	CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS	Benchmarking pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining methods commonly relies on real-world data sets. However, there are some disadvantages in using real-world data. On one hand collecting real-world data can become difficult or impossible for various reasons, on the other hand real-world variables are hard to control, even in the problem domain; in the feature domain, where most statistical learning methods operate, exercising control is even more difficult and hence rarely attempted. This is at odds with the scientific experimentation guidelines mandating the use of as directly controllable and as directly observable variables as possible. Because of this, synthetic data possesses certain advantages over real-world data sets. In this paper we propose a method that produces synthetic data with guaranteed global and class-specific statistical properties. This method is based on overlapping class densities placed on the corners of a regular k-simplex. This generator can be used for algorithm testing and fair performance evaluation of statistical learning methods. Because of the strong properties of this generator researchers can reproduce each others experiments by knowing the parameters used, instead of transmitting large data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kao, WK; Chen, HM; Chou, JS				Kao, Wei-Ko; Chen, Hung-Ming; Chou, Jui-Sheng			Aseismic ability estimation of school building using predictive data mining models	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Aseismic ability; Clustering; Data mining; Prediction; School building	NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; CONCRETE; PARAMETERS	The aseismic ability of buildings is generally analyzed using a nonlinear model. Numerical models are constructed based on the structural configuration and material property of buildings by simulating their stress responses and behaviors to obtain their aseismic ability. This method is complex and time-consuming and should be conducted by professionals. Hence, the aseismic ability of buildings cannot be determined rapidly on a large scale. Additionally, rapidly sequencing and screening the aseismic ability of a large number school buildings to make maintenance and management decisions is extremely difficult. This work adopts predictive data-mining models to determine the relationship between basic design parameters of school buildings and their aseismic ability, and then proposes a best model for predicting the aseismic ability of school buildings. Only basic geometric information of school buildings is needed to estimate quickly their aseismic ability. This prediction model must be able to handle the heavy load of evaluating the aseismic ability of school buildings. The proposed model will help maintenance managers conduct detailed assessments and sequencing of reinforcement work through nonlinear analysis. The proposed model can serve as a reference for disaster prevention in disaster plans and staff rescue during rescue work. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, an autonomic network management system that operates in a volatile network environment should be able to adapt continuously its decision making mechanism through learning from the system's behavior. In this paper, a novel learning scheme based on the network wide collected experience is proposed targeting the enhancement of network elements' decision making engine. The algorithm employs a fuzzy logic inference engine in order to enable self-managed network elements to identify faults or optimization opportunities. The fuzzy logic engine is periodically updated through the use of two well known data mining techniques, namely k-Means and k-Nearest Neighbor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in the context of a load identification problem. The acquired results prove that the proposed learning mechanism improves the deduction capability, thus promoting our algorithm as an attractive approach for enhancing the autonomic capabilities of network elements.

Recursive support vector censored regression for monitoring product quality based on degradation profiles	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning and data mining; Recursive support vector censored regression; Genetic algorithm; Secondary rechargeable battery; Cycle-life evaluation; Degradation profile; Accelerated test; Nonlinear censored regression	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CYCLE LIFE; PARAMETERS; OPTIMIZATION; BATTERIES; SELECTION; MACHINES	The time-consuming evaluation of a product's lifetime or quality often prevents manufacturers from meeting market requirements within the time allotted for product development. Degradation profiles obtained from harsh testing environments have been widely used in many applications to shorten the evaluation time. In this paper, we propose a novel recursive support vector censored regression (r-SVCR) technique to make a direct prediction on the lifetime based on the degradation profiles obtained in an accelerated testing setup. The proposed approach avoids potential bias introduced in the conventional prediction models due to accumulation of computational errors and misspecification of covariate models. Compared to standard support vector regression, our r-SVCR imposes the constraints on the derivatives of the regression function to ensure that the regression function is monotone over the input data range. Also, the r-SVCR accommodates the censored observations through our developed recursive estimation procedure, leading to error reduction. The hyperparameters of the proposed method are optimized based on the genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed method represents a novel approach in that the functional form describing the degradation paths and even the relationship between input covariates and product degradation need not be specified. A real-life example of a degradation test in which both temperature and cut-off voltage stresses are employed to expedite a secondary rechargeable battery's failure during test intervals is presented to illustrate the proposed method and compare its performance with the conventional one. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in predicting the lifetimes from the degradation profiles.

J	Tan, SB; Wang, YF				Tan, Songbo; Wang, Yuefen			Weighted SCL model for adaptation of sentiment classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Opinion mining; Information retrieval; Data mining		In recent years, Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for transfer learning. The main idea behind SCL model is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features. However, SCL model treats each feature as well as each instance by an equivalent-weight strategy. From the perspective of feature, this strategy fails to overcome the adverse influence of high-frequency domain-specific (HFDS) features: they occupy a relative large portion of weight in classification model, while hardly carry corresponding sentiment information. From the other perspective, the equivalent-weight strategy of SCL model does not take into account the labels ("positive" or "negative") of labeled instance and the labels of pivot features: positive pivot features tend to occur more frequently in positive instances and vice versa. To address the two issues effectively, we proposed a weighted SCL model (W-SCL), which weights the features as well as the instances. More specifically, W-SCL assigns a smaller weight to HFDS features and assigns a larger weight to instances with the same label as the involved pivot feature. The experimental results indicate that proposed W-SCL model could overcome the adverse influence of HFDS features, and leverage knowledge from labels of instances and pivot features.

J	Teubner, J; Mueller, R; Alonso, G				Teubner, Jens; Mueller, Rene; Alonso, Gustavo			Frequent Item Computation on a Chip	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; reconfigurable hardware; parallelism and concurrency		Computing frequent items is an important problem by itself and as a subroutine in several data mining algorithms. In this paper, we explore how to accelerate the computation of frequent items using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a threefold goal: increase performance over existing solutions, reduce energy consumption over CPU-based systems, and explore the design space in detail as the constraints on FPGAs are very different from those of traditional software-based systems. We discuss three design alternatives, each one of them exploiting different FPGA features and each one providing different performance/scalability trade-offs. An important result of the paper is to demonstrate how the inherent massive parallelism of FPGAs can improve performance of existing algorithms but only after a fundamental redesign of the algorithms. Our experimental results show that, e. g., the pipelined solution we introduce can reach more than 100 million tuples per second of sustained throughput (four times the best available results to date) by making use of techniques that are not available to CPU-based solutions. Moreover, and unlike in software approaches, the high throughput is independent of the skew of the Zipf distribution of the input and at a far lower energy cost.

J	Yeh, DY; Cheng, CH; Hsiao, SC				Yeh, Duen-Yian; Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Hsiao, Shih-Chuan			Classification knowledge discovery in mold tooling test using decision tree algorithm	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Mold tooling test; Knowledge discovery; Data mining; Decision tree; Mold industry	NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; PREDICTION; QUALITY; SYSTEM; RULES; BASE	The scale of Taiwan's mold industry was ranked the sixth in the world. But, under the global competitive pressure, Taiwan has lost its competitive advantage gradually. The only chance of Taiwan's mold industry lies in improving the competitive abilities in product research, development and design. In mold manufacturing cycle, mold tooling test plays a very important role at accelerating the speed of production. An experienced engineer can minimize the error rate of mold tooling test according to his rich experiences in parameter adjustment. However, this experience is mostly implicit without theoretical basis and its knowledge is difficult to be transmitted. Benefiting from the well development of data mining technologies, this study aimed at constructing an intelligent classification knowledge discovery system for mold tooling test based on decision tree algorithm, so as to explore and accumulate the experimental knowledge for the use of Taiwan's mold industry. This study took the only high-alloy steel manufacturer in Taiwan for case study, and performed system validation with 66 record data. The results showed the accuracy rates of prediction of training data and testing data are 97.6 and 86.9%, respectively. In addition, this study explored two classification knowledge rules and proposed concrete proposals for tooling test parameter adjustment. Moreover, this study provided two ways, rule verification and effectiveness comparison of four mining algorithms, to conduct model verification. The experimental results showed the decision tree algorithm has an excellent discriminatory power of classification and is able to provide clear and simple reference rules for decisions.

Learning latent variable models from distributed and abstracted data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Distributed data mining; Data abstraction; Model-based methods; Gaussian mixture model; Generative topographic mapping	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GAUSSIAN MIXTURE-MODELS; PRIVACY PRESERVING DATA; EM ALGORITHM; PATTERNS	Discovering global knowledge from distributed data sources is challenging, where the important issues include the ever-increasing data volume at the highly distributed sources and the general concern on data privacy. Properly abstracting the distributed data with a compact representation which can retain sufficient local details for global knowledge discovery in principle can address both the scalability and the data privacy challenges. This calls for the need to develop formal methodologies to support knowledge discovery on abstracted data. In this paper, we propose to abstract distributed data as Gaussian mixture models and learn a family of generative models from the abstracted data using a modified EM algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it to learn (a) data cluster models and (b) data manifold models, and evaluated their performance using both synthetic and benchmark data sets with promising results in terms of both effectiveness and scalability. Also, we have demonstrated that the proposed approach is robust against heterogeneous data distributions over the distributed sources. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Hunt, L; Jorgensen, M				Hunt, Lynette; Jorgensen, Murray			Clustering mixed data	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							ALGORITHM; PROGRAM; MODELS	Mixture model clustering proceeds by fitting a finite mixture of multivariate distributions to data, the fitted mixture density then being used to allocate the data to one of the components. Common model formulations assume that either all the attributes are continuous or all the attributes are categorical. In this paper, we consider options for model formulation in the more practical case of mixed data: multivariate data sets that contain both continuous and categorical attributes.

J	Ke, CK; Liu, DR				Ke, Chih-Kun; Liu, Duen-Ren			CONTEXT-BASED KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING BY RULE-INFERENCE AND CASE-BASED REASONING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Case-based reasoning; Data mining; Rule inference; Context-based knowledge support; Problem-solving process	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEMS; DISCOVERY; RETRIEVAL; DESIGN; HYBRID	Problem-solving is an important process that enables corporations to create competitive business advantages. Traditionally, case-based reasoning techniques have been widely used to help workers solve problems. However, conventional approaches focus on identifying similar problems without exploring relevant context of problem situations. Situation features are generally occurred according to the context characteristics of problems. Moreover, situation features collected are usually partial or incomplete. Workers need to use knowledge inferred from relevant context information and previous problem-solving experience to clarify the causes and take appropriate action effectively. In this paper, we propose to use rule inference to infer possible situation features based on context information. Association rule mining is used to discover context-based inference rules from historical problem-solving logs. The discovered patterns identify frequent associations between context information and situation features, and therefore, can be used to infer more situation features. By considering the inferred situation features, case-based reasoning can then be employed to identify similar situations effectively. Moreover, we employ information retrieval techniques to extract context-based situation profiles to model workers' information needs when handling problem situations in certain context. Effective knowledge support can thus be facilitated by providing workers with situation-relevant information based on the profiles. We develop a prototype system to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing context-based relevant information and decision-making knowledge to help workers solve problems.

Early diagnosis, appropriate choice and immediate initiation of antibiotic therapy can greatly affect the outcome of any kind of infection. Phagocytes play a central role in the innate immune response of the organism to infection. They comprise the first-line of defense against infectious intruders in our body, being able to produce large quantities of reactive oxygen species, which can be detected by means of chemiluminescence (CL). The data preparation approach implemented in this work corresponds to a dynamic assessment of phagocytic respiratory burst localization in a luminol-enhanced whole blood CL system. We have previously applied this approach to the problem of identifying various intra-abdominal pathological processes afflicting peritoneal dialysis patients in the Nephrology department and demonstrated 84.6% predictive accuracy with the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm. In this study, we apply the CL-based approach to a larger sample of patients from two departments (Nephrology and Internal Medicine) with the aim of finding the most effective and interpretable feature sets and classification models for a fast and accurate identification of several infectious diseases. Materials and methods: Whole blood samples were collected from 78 patients (comprising 115 instances) with respiratory infections, infections associated with renal replacement therapy and patients without infections. CL kinetic parameters were calculated for each case, which was assigned into a specific clinical group according to the available clinical diagnostics. Feature selection wrapper and filter methods were applied to remove the irrelevant and redundant features and to improve the predictive performance of disease classification algorithms. Three data mining algorithms, C4.5 048) decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier were applied for inducing disease classification models and their performance in classifying three clinical groups was evaluated by 10 runs of a stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Results and conclusions: The results demonstrate that the predictive power of the best models obtained with the three evaluated algorithms after feature selection was found to be in the range of 63.38 +/- 2.18-70.68 +/- 1.43%. The highest disease classification accuracy was reached by C4.5, which also provides the most informative model in the form of a decision tree, and the lowest accuracy was obtained with naive Bayes. The feature selection method attaining the best classification performance was the wrapper method in forward direction. Moreover, the classification models exposed biological patterns specific to the clinical states and the predictive features selected were found to be characteristic of a specific disorder. Based on these encouraging results, we believe that the CL-based data pre-processing approach combined with the wrapper forward feature selection procedure and the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm has a clear potential to become a fast, informative, and sensitive tool for predictive diagnostics of infectious diseases in clinics.

Differentiation of outliers and noisy data from normal ones is a major task in data mining applications. On the other hand, elimination of noisy and outlier data from training samples of a dataset may lead to over-fitting or information loss. A fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) provides an effective means to deal with this problem. It reduces the effect of the noisy data and outliers by using a fuzzy membership functions. In this paper, a new formation for SVMs is introduced that considers importance degrees for training samples. The constraints of the SVM are converted to fuzzy inequalities. The proposed method, RSVM, shows better efficiency in the classification of data in different domains. Especially, using the proposed RSVM for multi-class classification of arrhythmia disease is presented at the end of this paper as a practical case study to show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Peculiarity factor and local peculiarity factor are important concepts employed to describe the peculiarity of a data point in the identification step. One can study the notions at both attribute and record levels. In this paper, a new record LPF called distance-based record LPF (D-record LPF) is proposed, which is defined as the sum of distances between a point and its nearest neighbors. The authors prove that D-record LPF can characterize the probability density of a continuous m-dimensional distribution accurately. This provides a theoretical basis for some existing distance-based anomaly detection techniques. More importantly, it also provides an effective method for describing the class-conditional probabilities in a Bayesian classifier. The result enables us to apply D-record LPF to solve classification problems. A novel algorithm called LPF-Bayes classifier and its kernelized implementation are proposed, which have some connection to the Bayesian classifier. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed classifiers are competitive to some excellent classifiers such as AdaBoost, support vector machines and kernel Fisher discriminant.

J	Zhai, Y; Ma, N; Ruan, D; An, B				Zhai Yun; Ma Nan; Ruan Da; An Bing			An Effective Over-sampling Method for Imbalanced Data Sets Classification	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Imbalanced data sets; Selection strategy; Distribution density; Oversample	SMOTE	Imbalanced data sets in real-world applications have a majority class with normal instances and a minority class with abnormal or important instances. Learning from such data sets usually generates biased classifiers that have a higher predictive accuracy over the majority class, but a rather poorer predictive accuracy over the minority class. The Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a novel approach for learning from imbalanced data sets, based on an improved SMOTE algorithm. The approach deals with noise data by a hierarchical filtering mechanism, employs a selection strategy of the minority instances and makes full use of dynamic distribution density of the minority followed by the SMOTE process. This empirical analysis of the approach showed quantitatively competitive with SMOTE and series of its improved algorithm in terms of the receiver operating characteristic curve when applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets.

It is believed that there are millions of petroglyphs in North America alone, and the study of this valued cultural resource has implications even beyond anthropology and history. Surprisingly, although image processing, information retrieval and data mining have had a large impact on many human endeavors, they have had essentially zero impact on the study of rock art. In this work we identify the reasons for this, and introduce a novel distance measure and algorithms which allow efficient and effective data mining of large collections of rock art.

J	Kuo, TT; Lin, SD				Kuo, Tsung-Ting; Lin, Shou-De			Learning-based concept-hierarchy refinement through exploiting topology, content and social information	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Concept hierarchy; Data mining; Machine learning; Content indexing methods; Concept learning; Recommendation	ONTOLOGY	Concept hierarchies, such as the ACM Computing Classification Scheme and Inter Pro Protein Sequence Classification, are widely used in categorization and indexing applications. In the Internet and Web 2.0 era, new concepts and terms are emerging on an almost daily basis, so it is essential that such hierarchies maintain up-to-date records of concepts. This paper proposes a mechanism to identify the most suitable position to insert new terms into an existing concept hierarchy. The problem is challenging because there are hundreds or even thousands of candidate positions for insertion. Furthermore, usually there is no training instance available for an insertion; nor is it practical to assume the availability of a detailed description of the target concept, except in the hierarchy itself. To resolve the problem, we exploit the topology, content and social information, and apply a learning approach to identify the underlying construction criteria of the concept hierarchy. We utilize three metrics (namely, accuracy, taxonomic closeness, and ranking) to evaluate the proposed learning-based approach on the ACM CCS, the DOAJ and the InterPro datasets to evaluate the proposed learning-based approach. The results demonstrate that, in all three metrics, our approach outperforms similarity-based approaches, such as the Normalized Google Distance, by a significant margin. Finally, we propose a level-based recommendation scheme as a novel application of our system.

J	Das, K; Bhaduri, K; Kargupta, H				Das, Kamalika; Bhaduri, Kanishka; Kargupta, Hillol			Multi-objective optimization based privacy preserving distributed data mining in Peer-to-Peer networks	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Privacy preserving; Data mining; Peer-to-Peer	SYSTEMS	This paper proposes a scalable, local privacy-preserving algorithm for distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) data aggregation useful for many advanced data mining/analysis tasks such as average/sum computation, decision tree induction, feature selection, and more. Unlike most multi-party privacy-preserving data mining algorithms, this approach works in an asynchronous manner through local interactions and it is highly scalable. It particularly deals with the distributed computation of the sum of a set of numbers stored at different peers in a P2P network in the context of a P2P web mining application. The proposed optimization-based privacy-preserving technique for computing the sum allows different peers to specify different privacy requirements without having to adhere to a global set of parameters for the chosen privacy model. Since distributed sum computation is a frequently used primitive, the proposed approach is likely to have significant impact on many data mining tasks such as multi-party privacy-preserving clustering, frequent itemset mining, and statistical aggregate computation.

J	Dierkes, T; Bichler, M; Krishnan, R				Dierkes, Torsten; Bichler, Martin; Krishnan, Ramayya			Estimating the effect of word of mouth on churn and cross-buying in the mobile phone market with Markov logic networks	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Marketing; Telecommunications; Social network analysis	CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE; PREDICTION; RETENTION; SELECTION; MODEL	Much has been written about word of mouth and customer behavior. Telephone call detail records provide a novel way to understand the strength of the relationship between individuals. In this paper, we predict using call detail records the impact that the behavior of one customer has on another customer's decisions. We study this in the context of churn (a decision to leave a communication service provider) and cross-buying decisions based on an anonymized data set from a telecommunications provider. Call detail records are represented as a weighted graph and a novel statistical learning technique, Markov logic networks, is used in conjunction with logit models based on lagged neighborhood variables to develop the predictive model. In addition, we propose an approach to propositionalization tailored to predictive modeling with social network data. The results show that information on the churn of network neighbors has a significant positive impact on the predictive accuracy and in particular the sensitivity of churn models.

Intrusion detection using neural based hybrid classification methods	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Ensemble; Hybrid architecture; Intrusion detection	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS; MODEL; CLASSIFIERS; INDUCTION; SELECTION; ENSEMBLE; FAILURE; SYSTEM	Data mining is the use of algorithms to extract the information and patterns derived by the knowledge discovery in databases process. Classification is a very common data mining task. Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. Due to increasing incidents of cyber attacks, building effective intrusion detection systems are essential for protecting information systems security, and yet it remains an elusive goal and a great challenge. This paper presents two classification methods involving multilayer perceptron and radial basis function and an ensemble of multilayer perceptron and radial basis function. We propose hybrid architecture involving ensemble and base classifiers for intrusion detection systems. The analysis of results shows that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of single usage of existing classification methods such as multilayer perceptron and radial basis function. Additionally it has been found that ensemble of multilayer perceptron is superior to ensemble of radial basis function classifier for normal behavior and reverse is the case for abnormal behavior. We show that the proposed method provides significant improvement of prediction accuracy in intrusion detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Govindarajan, M.; Chandrasekaran, R.

By relaxing the stringent requirement of the classical rough sets, one can obtain probabilistic approximations. The LERS can be easily applied to induce probabilistic positive and boundary rules from probabilistic positive and boundary regions. This paper discusses several fundamental issues related to probabilistic rule induction with LERS, including rule induction algorithm, quantitative measures associated with rules, and the rule conflict resolution method.

J	Gurbuz, F; Ozbakir, L; Yapici, H				Gurbuz, Feyza; Ozbakir, Lale; Yapici, Huseyin			Data mining and preprocessing application on component reports of an airline company in Turkey	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Preprocessing; Rough sets; Find laws		Risk and safety have always been important considerations in aviation. With the rapid growth in air travel, flight delays, cancellations and incidents/accidents have also dramatically increased in recent years (Nazeri & Jianping, 2002). There is a large amount of knowledge and data accumulation in aviation industry. These data could be stored in the form of pilot reports, maintenance reports, incident reports or delay reports. This paper focuses on different preprocessing and feature selection techniques applied on the 15 component reports of an airline company in Turkey to understand and clean the data set. Regression analysis, anomaly detection analysis, find dependencies and rough sets are used in this study in order to reduce the data set. Also the classification techniques of data mining are used to predict the warning level of the component as the class attribute. For this purpose Polyanalyst, SPSS Clementine, Minitab and Rosetta software tools are used. Find laws module of Polyanalyst is used to find the relations and information retrieval about the components warning level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transactions with quantitative values and items with hierarchical relationships are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy multiple-level mining algorithm for extracting knowledge implicit in transactions stored as quantitative values. In that algorithm, each attribute uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in the mining process. The number of linguistic items is thus the same as that of the original attributes in the transaction database. This constraint allows the processing time as efficient as mining of non-fuzzy association rules. However, the fuzzy association rules derived in that way are not complete, as some possible fuzzy association rules might be missing. This paper proposes a new fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting all possible fuzzy association rules from transactions stored as quantitative values. The proposed algorithm can derive a more complete set of rules but with more computation time than the previous method. Trade-off thus exists between the computation time and the completeness of rules. Choosing an appropriate mining method thus depends on the requirement of the application domains.

This study uses LRFM customer relationship model, which consists of four dimensions: relation length (L), recent transaction time (R), buying frequency (F), and monetary (M), to carry out customer clusters. We proceed with this clustering analysis to classify customers in order to set discriminative marketing strategies. In addition, this study further employed a cross analysis over three predetermined dimensions: area, sales, and new/old characteristics to enhance the clustering analysis. The results obtained from the real textile business show that the customer groups formed using the four-factor (LRFM) clustering all has statistical significant differences, and with meaningful explanations in terms of marketing strategy. Thus, this study considers useful for discriminative customer relationship management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We combine them with traditional classification instruments such as the SVM and Nave Bayes. We perform a case of real-life data mining using a dataset consisting of police reports describing a wide range of violent incidents that occurred during the year 2007 in the Amsterdam-Amstelland police region (The Netherlands). We compare the possibilities offered by the ESOM and MDS for iteratively enriching our feature set, discovering confusing situations, faulty case labelings and significantly improving the classification accuracy. The results of our research are currently operational in the Amsterdam-Amstelland police region for upgrading the employed domestic violence definition, for improving the training of police officers and for developing a highly accurate and comprehensible case triage model.

In this paper, we propose a new kind of behavioral pattern, named Target-based Association Rules (TARs). TARs aim to discover the correlation among a set of targets monitored by a wireless sensor network at a border area. The major application of the Target-based Rules is to predict the location (target) of a missed reported event. Different data preparation mechanisms for accumulating the data needed for extracting TARs have been proposed. We refer to these mechanisms as Al-Node, Schedule-Buffer, and Fused-Schedule-Buffer. Several experiment studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the three proposed data preparation mechanisms. Results show that the Fused-Schedule-Buffer scheme outperforms the selected schemes in terms of energy consumption.

J	Zhao, HM; Sinha, AP; Bansal, G				Zhao, Huimin; Sinha, Atish P.; Bansal, Gaurav			An extended tuning method for cost-sensitive regression and forecasting	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Cost-sensitive regression; Asymmetric loss; Post-hoc tuning; Loan charge-off forecasting	ASYMMETRIC LOSS FUNCTIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS; TREES	In many real-world regression and forecasting problems, over-prediction and under-prediction errors have different consequences and incur asymmetric costs. Such problems entail the use of cost-sensitive learning, which attempts to minimize the expected misprediction cost, rather than minimize a simple measure such as mean squared error. A method has been proposed recently for tuning a regular regression model post hoc so as to minimize the average misprediction cost under an asymmetric cost structure. In this paper, we build upon that method and propose an extended tuning method for cost-sensitive regression. The previous method becomes a special case of the method we propose. We apply the proposed method to loan charge-off forecasting, a cost-sensitive regression problem that has had a bearing on bank failures over the last few years. Empirical evaluation in the loan charge-off forecasting domain demonstrates that the method we have proposed can further lower the misprediction cost significantly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The basic solution of this problem is to generate all possible minimal attributes subsets (MASes) and choose one of them, with minimal size. This can be done by constructing a kind of discernibility function (DF) from the dataset and converting it to disjunctive normal form (DNF). Since this conversion is NP-hard, for attribute reduction usually heuristic algorithms are used. But these algorithms generate one or a small number of possible MASes that generally is not sufficient for optimality of dataset processing in such aspects as the simplicity of data representation and description, the speed and classification accuracy of the data mining algorithms and the required amount of memory. In this study, we propose an algorithm that finds all MASes by iteratively partitioning the DF so that the part to be converted to DNF in each of iterations has the space complexity no higher than the square root of the worst-case space complexity of the conversion of the whole DF to DNF. The number of iterations is always fewer than the number of attributes.

In this study, we develop the base of a decision support system by using rough set theory to visualize users' preferences. This study aims at utilizing and sharing of knowledge for a large amount of information maintained in databases on the Web. We investigate an application on a Web server running Apache, MySQL (DBMS) and PHP. Here, for the ease of database administration, phpMyAdmin is installed, which is an open source tool for handling the MySQL database through a Web frontend. For the above-mentioned environment, rough sets, a technique for knowledge discovery, are applied which can derive simplified decision rules. In this study, the rough set procedures are performed in RSES2, which is a graphical toolkit for the analysis of table data running under the Microsoft Windows OS, based on methods and algorithms from rough set theory. As a specific example of decision support based on the users' desires, we address the nutrition of food menu planning problem and derive the users' preference rules by incorporating rough sets in RSES2 within the Web application. To verify the performance of our developed system, this paper includes the result of a test installation for 10 examinees.

J	Kim, SB; Rattakorn, P				Kim, Seoung Bum; Rattakorn, Panaya			Unsupervised feature selection using weighted principal components	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Feature selection; Principal component analysis; Unsupervised learning	NMR-SPECTRA	Feature selection has received considerable attention in various areas as a way to select informative features and to simplify the statistical model through dimensional reduction. One of the most widely used methods for dimensional reduction includes principal component analysis (PCA). Despite its popularity. PCA suffers from a lack of interpretability of the original feature because the reduced dimensions are linear combinations of a large number of original features. Traditionally, two or three dimensional loading plots provide information to identify important original features in the first few principal component dimensions. However, the interpretation of what constitutes a loading plot is frequently subjective, particularly when large numbers of features are involved. In this study, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method that combines weighted principal components (PCs) with a thresholding algorithm. The weighted PC is obtained by the weighted sum of the first k PCs of interest. Each of the k loading values in the weighted PC reflects the contribution of each individual feature. We also propose a thresholding algorithm that identifies the significant features. Our experimental results with both the simulated and real datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised feature selection method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kiu, CC; Tsui, E				Kiu, Ching-Chieh; Tsui, Eric			TaxoFolk: A hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy structure for knowledge classification and navigation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Folksonomy; Taxonomy; Taxonomy-folksonomy integration; Web 2.0; Knowledge navigation; Knowledge classification		With the emergence of Web 2.0, user-generated metadata or so-called folksonomies facilitates management of digital content in the World Wide Web. The folksonomies have increasingly become a viable alternative for knowledge seekers to classify their knowledge (resources) and navigate the resources. Traditionally, in expert systems, taxonomy has been fulfilling these roles. However, in a taxonomy, the taxonomic structures are defined by the taxonomists or professional experts of the domain which often do not reflect user vocabulary. In addition, the terms of the taxonomy become outdated very fast which in turn compromises the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge classification and navigation. On the other hand, maintenance of the taxonomy is time consuming and exhausted. This paper presents taxonomy and folksonomy integration algorithm, namely TaxoFolk to integrate the folksonomy into a taxonomy to enhance knowledge classification and navigation. The output is a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy structure. The TaxoFolk algorithm comprises of data mining techniques, namely formal concept analysis (FCA). ID3 classification and simple matching coefficients (SMC). Three different taxonomy domains and its folksonomy are used to setup the experiments to identify and to evaluate the threshold values for filtering infrequent tags and invalid tags to automate the TaxoFolk algorithm to integrate a filtered folksonomy with a pre-defined taxonomy for enhancing knowledge navigation. The conducted experiments have ascertained the most appropriate thresholds values for effective building of TaxoFolk structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Meshkin, A; Aghaee, NG; Sadeghi, M				Meshkin, Alireza; Aghaee, Nasser Ghasem; Sadeghi, Mehdi			Modeling and implementing an agent-based system for prediction of protein relative solvent accessibility	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection methods; Physicochemical properties of amino acids; Data mining; Intelligent agents	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REAL VALUE PREDICTION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; REGRESSION; METHODOLOGY; PROFILES	In this paper, an agent-based system for prediction of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of proteins is proposed. Since, it is believed that the 3D-structure of most proteins is defined by their sequences, utilizing data mining methods to extract hidden knowledge and information from protein sequences, is unavoidable. Due to the inherent heterogeneity and distribution in data that used to predict RSA and high time costs of central data mining on large training data, the necessity of an agent-based architecture for predicting RSA, seems to be essential. The system is logically and functionally divided into four layers, solving the tasks of "data fusion", "feature selection", "model building" and "knowledge discovery and prediction", respectively. The overall architecture has been called RSAMAS, which is implemented with multi-agent systems for prediction of relative solvent accessibility of proteins. The outcomes of the system design phase under Prometheus methodology and the complete characteristics of the agents are discussed. The prediction activity results from the interaction of a set of agents that hosted on several levels. The experiment results on Manesh dataset point to the validity of the approach. The proposed system can autonomously dig out all the valuable knowledge about which physicochemical features are highly correlated with the solvent accessibility of proteins without human supervision, which is of great importance for biologist and their future researches.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, Geoffrey I.			Filtered-top-k association discovery	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS; RULES; INTERESTINGNESS; ALGORITHM	Association mining has been one of the most intensively researched areas of data mining. However, direct uptake of the resulting technologies has been relatively low. This paper examines some of the reasons why the dominant paradigms in association mining have not lived up to their promise, and argues that a powerful alternative is provided by top-k techniques coupled with appropriate statistical and other filtering.

J	Wu, RS; Chou, PH				Wu, Roung-Shiunn; Chou, Po-Hsuan			Customer segmentation of multiple category data in e-commerce using a soft-clustering approach	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customer segmentation; Clustering; Customer relationship management; Data mining; Expectation-maximization (EM) procedure; Latent class	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; MODELS; FRAMEWORK; RFM	The segmentation of online consumers into multiple categories can contribute to a better understanding and characterization of purchasing behavior in the electronic commerce market. Online shopping databases consist of multiple kinds of data on customer purchasing activity and demographic characteristics, as well as consumption attributes such as Internet usage and satisfaction with services. Information about customers uncovered by segmentation enables company administrators to establish good customer relations and refine their marketing strategies to match customer expectations. To achieve optimal segmentation, we developed a soft clustering method that uses a latent mixed-class membership clustering approach to classify online customers based on their purchasing data across categories. A technique derived from the latent Dirichlet allocation model is used to create the customer segments. Variational approximation is leveraged to generate estimates from the segmentation in a computationally-efficient manner. The proposed soft clustering method yields more promising results than hard clustering and greater within-segment clustering quality than the finite mixture model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

J	Yeh, WC; Chang, WW; Chiu, CW				Yeh, Wei-Chang; Chang, Wei-Wen; Chiu, Chuan-Wei			A SIMPLIFIED SWARM OPTIMIZATION FOR DISCOVERING THE CLASSIFICATION RULE USING MICROARRAY DATA OF BREAST CANCER	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Microarray data; Simplified swarm optimization; Pattern recognition	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; FEATURE-SELECTION; ALGORITHMS; EXTRACTION; REGRESSION; DESIGN; MODEL	Microarray data analysis is a major line of research in bioinformatics. A significant trend in bioinformatics is identifying genes or gene groups that differentiate diseased tissues. Classification is necessary to make microarray data useful for application in medicine, and in related research such as disease diagnosis. Classification models have been developed using statistical methods such as logistic and multi-normal regression for data mining. However, the complexities of real-world classification problems, such as those in the medical domain, are highly dimensional. General statistical methods are inadequate for these complex problems. This study proposes simplified swarm optimization (SSO), an efficient methodology for discovering breast cancer classification rules. The data set was derived from, the Stanford microarray database. The proposed approach enables simultaneous feature selection and pattern recognition. Experimental results indicate that SSO outperforms general data mining methods such as decision tree, neural network, support vector machine, etc. The proposed approach has potential applications in hospital decision-making and research such as predictive medicine.

In this paper, we present three patterns to predict the behaviors of fighters that are the ActionStreams pattern, the Owner_Actions pattern and the Time_Owner_Actions pattern, where: (1) ActionStreams pattern is a coarse granular for describing the fighter's behaviors with action identifier whereas without distinguishing the time and the executor/owner; (2) Owner_Actions pattern is a finer granular for describing the fighter's behaviors with the action identifier and the executor whereas without distinguishing the time; and (3) Time_Owner_Actions pattern encapsulates the action identifier, the time, and also the executor. Based on such fighters' behaviors patterns, we explore the data structures used to store and the satisfied properties used to mine; and further, by designing and implementing the relevant mining/processing algorithms and systems, we have discovered some experience patterns of the fighters' behaviors and have conducted certain valid predictions for the fighters' behaviors. We also present the experimental results conducted on the simulation platform of the air to air combats. The results show that our method is effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim is to examine the benefits of these techniques in assisting designers' decision making and improving scalability and applicability of indoor daylight methods. Techniques were verified using lowest annual daylight factor values, resulting from the worst case scenario in Ecotect, for rooms in the Environmental Research Institute building, Ireland. These values were used, along with real time hourly environmental conditions, sampled at 15 min intervals, during working hours, over 3 years, for the development of several prediction models. Results show that techniques perform better than individual analytical tools. Attribute importance models bring out essential building characteristics required to estimate performance for optimized room and building design. The number of simulation prototypes is reduced and need for sensing equipment is eliminated to determine indoor daylight levels by regression analysis. Acceleration of the assessment of building performance using different daylight design criteria can be observed by the use of classification modeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, in a data stream environment the previous approaches are unable to find the result of the new-incoming data and the original database without re-computing the whole database. In this paper, we propose an incremental mining algorithm, called DSM-CITI (Data Stream Mining for Closed Inter-Transaction Itemsets), for discovering the set of all frequent inter-transaction itemsets from data streams. In the framework of DSM-CITI, a new in-memory summary data structure, ITP-tree, is developed to maintain frequent inter-transaction itemsets. Moreover, algorithm DSM-CITI is able to construct ITP-tree incrementally and uses the property to avoid unnecessary updates. Experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable for mining frequent inter-transaction itemsets over stream sliding windows.

The production rate, surface finish of machined component and the machine condition are directly related to the tool condition. This work on tool condition monitoring delves into data mining approach to discover the hidden information available in the tool vibration signals. The use of statistical features derived from the vibration data is used as the primary feature and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) transformed statistical features are evaluated as an alternative. In order to increase the robustness of the classifier and to reduce the data processing load, feature reduction is necessary. The feature reduction using (a) decision tree and (b) feature transformation and reduction using PCA are evaluated independently and the results are compared. The effective combination of feature reducer and classifier for designing the expert system is studied and reported. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Elangovan, M.; Devasenapati, S.

Supporting the linear detrending in subsequence matching is a challenging problem due to the huge number of all possible subsequences. In this paper we define this problem as the linear detrending subsequence matching and propose its efficient index-based solution. To this end, we first present a notion of LD-windows (LD means linear detrending). Using the LD-windows we then present a lower bounding theorem for the index-based matching solution and show its correctness. We next propose the index building and subsequence matching algorithms: We finally show the superiority of the index-based solution.

J	Guh, RS; Wu, TCJ; Weng, SP				Guh, Ruey-Shiang; Wu, Tsung-Chieh Jackson; Weng, Shao-Ping			Integrating genetic algorithm and decision tree learning for assistance in predicting in vitro fertilization outcomes	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Decision tree learning; In vitro fertilization; Prediction; Data mining	MEDICAL DATA; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; PREGNANCY; ISSUES; MODELS	Accurate and early prediction of the outcome of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is important for both patients and physicians. The most common question asked by IVF patients is "What are my chances of conceiving?" The answer to this difficult question typically considers patient age, day 3 serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and infertility diagnosis. However, many more parameters are known to affect IVF outcome. It is difficult for the clinician to recognize trends and intuitively decide how to optimize success rates for each infertile couple. This paper presents a hybrid intelligence method which integrating genetic algorithm and decision learning techniques for knowledge mining of an IVF medical database. The proposed method can not only assist the IVF physician in predicting the IVF outcome, but also find useful knowledge that can help the IVF physician tailor the IVF treatment to the individual patient with I he aim of improving the pregnancy success rate. The twenty-eight most significant attributes for determining the pregnancy rate (e.g., patient's age, number of embryo transferred, number of frozen embryos, and culture days of embryo) and their combinative relationships (represented by if-then rules) were identified through the proposed method. The knowledge discovered in this study is currently accepted as an interesting discovery from the viewpoint of domain experts. For the results from this study to be conveniently accessed by IVF physicians and patients, an expert system tool equipped with the proposed IVF outcome prediction model was built.

J	Hewett, R				Hewett, Rattikorn			Mining software defect data to support software testing management	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Quality assurance; Software testing management; Defect report; Data mining		Achieving high quality software would be easier if effective software development practices were known and deployed in appropriate contexts. Because our theoretical knowledge of the underlying principles of software development is far from complete, empirical analysis of past experience in software projects is essential for acquiring useful software practices. As advances in software technology continue to facilitate automated tracking and data collection, more software data become available. Our research aims to develop methods to exploit such data for improving software development practices. This paper proposes an empirical approach, based on the analysis of defect data, that provides support for software testing management in two ways: (1) construction of a predictive model for defect repair times, and (2) a method for assessing testing quality across multiple releases. The approach employs data mining techniques including statistical methods and machine learning. To illustrate the proposed approach, we present a case study using the defect reports created during the development of three releases of a large medical software system, produced by a large well-established software company. We validate our proposed testing quality assessment using a statistical test at a significance level of 0.1. Despite the limitations of the available data, our predictive models give accuracies as high as 93%.

Existing data mining techniques, eg. Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods, deal with individual molecules only. In this article, we propose to use a Condensed Graph of Reaction (CGR) to merge all molecules involved in a reaction into one molecular graph. This allows one to consider reactions as pseudo-molecules and to develop QSAR models based on fragment descriptors. Then ISIDA (In SIlico Design and Analysis) fragment descriptors built from CGRs are used to generate models for the rate constant of S(N)2 reactions in water, using three usual attribute-value regression algorithms (linear regression, support vector machine, and regression trees). This approach is compared favorably to two state-of-the-art relational data mining techniques.

J	Liao, SH; Chu, PH; You, YL				Liao, Shu-hsien; Chu, Pei-hui; You, Ying-lu			Mining the co-movement between foreign exchange rates and category stock indexes in the Taiwan financial capital market	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Foreign exchange rate; Category stock indexes; Co-movement; Portfolio; Data mining; Association rules	ASSOCIATION	The foreign exchange market is one of the biggest markets in the global financial capital market. With current trends toward financial capital globalization, it is becoming more important to understand the co-movement of foreign exchange. Investors always want to get all kinds of messages to make decisions about investing. Moreover, they always look forward to making a profit. This study investigates financial investment issues related to Taiwan's financial capital. Thus, this study implements the association rules as a data mining approach to explore the co-movement between foreign exchange rates and category stock indexes in Taiwan. Transaction data, such as foreign exchange rates and stock indexes, were collected to construct a database; the Apriori algorithm was then used to generate the association rules. By doing so, this study proposes several possible portfolio alternatives in the Taiwan financial capital market including foreign exchange currencies and stock investment under different circumstances.

Screening web breaks in a pressroom by soft computing	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; GA; Curvilinear component analysis; SVM; Variable selection; Printing press; Paper web break	NEURAL-NETWORK; FEATURES; MACHINE; RUNNABILITY; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS	The objective of this work is to identify the main parameters of the printing press, the printing process, and the paper affecting the occurrence of web breaks in a pressroom. Two approaches are explored. The first one treats the problem as a task of data classification into "break" and "non-break" classes. The procedures of classifier design and selection of relevant input variables are integrated into one process based on genetic search. The second approach, targeted for data visualization and also based on genetic search, combines procedures of input variable selection and data mapping into a two-dimensional space. The genetic search-based analysis has shown that the web tension parameters are amongst the most important ones. It was also found that the group of paper related parameters recorded online contain more information for predicting the occurrence of web breaks than the group of traditional parameters recorded off-line at a paper lab. Using the selected set of parameters, on average, 93.7% of the test set data were classified correctly. The average classification accuracy of web break cases was equal to 76.7%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

An agent model for rough classifiers	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Agent models; Reduction; Agent's interaction; Default rules		This paper proposes a new agent-based approach in rough set classification theory. In data mining, the rough set technique is one classification technique. It generates rules from a large database and has mechanisms to handle noise and uncertainty in data. However, producing a rough classification model or rough classifier is computationally expensive, especially in its reduct computation phase: this is an NP-hard problem. These problems have brought about the generation of large amount of rules and high processing time. We solve these problems by embedding an agent-based algorithm within the rough modelling framework. In this study, the classifiers are based on creating agents within the main modelling processes such as reduct computation, rules generation and attribute projections. Four main agents are introduced: the interaction agent, weighted agent, reduction agent and default agent. We propose a heuristic for the default agent to control its searching activity. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly reduces the running time and the number of rules while maintaining the same classification accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers from various domains such as pattern recognization, data mining, statistics and machine learning are implementing decision trees for real time datasets. There is still a requirement for further efficiency and optimization. The problem of constructing decision tree with high generalization accuracy is still an active research area. Generating an efficient and optimized decision tree with multi-attribute data source is considered as one of the shortcomings. This paper emphasizes to propose a multivariate statistical method Discrete Wavelet Transform on multi-attribute data for reducing dimensionality and to transform traditional decision tree algorithm to form a new algorithmic model. The experimental results described that this method can not only increase generalization accuracy of the decision tree, but also improves the problems existing in pruning and to mine the better rule set without effecting the purpose of prediction accuracy altogether.

The prediction of the electric field level in the reverberation chamber depending on position of stirrer	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electric field; Reverberation chamber; Data mining	NEURAL-NETWORK	This study presents nine modeling techniques within data mining process for the prediction of electric field level which depends on the positions of stirrer in the mode stirred reverberation chamber. These are Linear Regression (LR), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Pace Regression (PR), KStar, Regression by discretization (RD), Random SubSpace (RS), M5P, RepTree and Decision Table models. Relations depending on frequency and position of stirrer have been carried out for the determination of electric field in the reverberation chamber. Obtained model results for each stirrer steps have been compared and the best model has been investigated. Results indicate that the use of derived formulation from these techniques will facilitate design and optimize of location of maxima (mode) and minima (null) of electric field in the reverberation chamber which a component of especially mode stirrer reverberation chamber test method.

J	Romei, A; Turini, F				Romei, Andrea; Turini, Franco			Inductive database languages: requirements and examples	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Inductive database; Data Mining; Knowledge discovery; Query language; Association rules	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; SQL; ALGORITHMS; EXTENSION; QUERIES; SYSTEM; KDDML	Inductive databases (IDBs) represent a database perspective on Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). In an IDB, the KDD application can express both queries capable of accessing and manipulating data, and queries capable of generating, manipulating, and applying patterns allowing to formalize the notion of mining process. The feature that makes them different from other data mining applications is exactly the idea of looking at the support for knowledge discovery as an extension of the query process. This paper draws a list of desirable properties to be taken into account in the definition of an IDB framework. They involve several dimensions, such as the expressiveness of the language in representing data and models, the closure principle, the capability to provide a support for an efficient algorithm programming. These requirements are a basis for a comparative study that highlights strengths and weaknesses of existing IDB approaches. The paper focuses on the SQL-based ATLaS language/system, on the logic-based LDL++ language/system, and on the XML-based KDDML language/system.

Pavement layers are characterized by their elastic moduli estimated from surface deflections through backcalculation. Using backcalculation analysis, flexible pavement layer in situ material properties can be backcalculated from the measured field data through appropriate analysis techniques. This study focuses on the use of data mining (DM)-based pavement backcalculation tools for determining the in situ elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio of asphalt pavement from synthetically derived Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) deflections at seven equidistant points. In estimation of the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, data mining (DM) method has not been used as a backcalculation tool before. Experimental deflection data groups from NDT are used to show the capability of the DM approaches in backcalculating the pavement layer thickness and compared each other. By looking at the results of the study. Kstar method gives fine results with respect to other DM methods. Backcalculation of pavement layer elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio with DM has been carried out for the first time. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reliable predictive models for customer churn could be useful in devising customer retention plans. We survey and compare some major machine learning techniques that have been used to build predictive customer churn models. Employee churn (or attrition) closely related but not identical to customer churn is similarly painful for an organization, leading to disruptions, customer dissatisfaction and time and efforts lost in finding and training replacement. We present a case study that we carried out for building and comparing predictive employee churn models. We also propose a simple value model for employees that can be used to identify how many of the churned employees were "valuable". This work has the potential for designing better employee retention plans and improving employee satisfaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Saradhi, V.

J	Wang, T; Liu, L				Wang, Ting; Liu, Ling			Output Privacy in Data Mining	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Security; Algorithm; Experimentation; Output privacy; stream mining; data perturbation	STATISTICAL DATABASE; DISCLOSURE CONTROL; ANONYMITY; SECURITY	Privacy has been identified as a vital requirement in designing and implementing data mining systems. In general, privacy preservation demands protecting both input and output privacy: the former refers to sanitizing the raw data itself before performing mining; while the latter refers to preventing the mining output (models or patterns) from malicious inference attacks. This article presents a systematic study on the problem of protecting output privacy in data mining, and particularly, stream mining: (i) we highlight the importance of this problem by showing that even sufficient protection of input privacy does not guarantee that of output privacy; (ii) we present a general inferencing and disclosure model that exploits the intrawindow and interwindow privacy breaches in stream mining output; (iii) we propose a light-weighted countermeasure that effectively eliminates these breaches without explicitly detecting them, while minimizing the loss of output accuracy; (iv) we further optimize the basic scheme by taking account of two types of semantic constraints, aiming at maximally preserving utility-related semantics while maintaining hard privacy guarantee; (v) finally, we conduct extensive experimental evaluation over both synthetic and real data to validate the efficacy of our approach.

A feature selection algorithm is proposed at first based on rough set and the domain oriented data driven data mining theory, which can get multiple reducts and candidate classifiers. Then the nearest neighborhood of each unseen sample is found in a validation subset and the most accurate classifier is extracted from the candidate classifiers. Finally, the selected classifier is used to recognize unseen samples. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and suitable for emotion recognition.

The training algorithm itself consists only of computing several scalars, per each training vector, using a single global user parameter and then solving a linear system of equations. Construction of the system matrix is driven by our model and based on kernel functions. The model allows an interesting point of view of kernels' role in the inductive learning process. We describe the model through axiomatic postulates. Finally, we present the results of the preliminary validation experiments.

J	Kabir, ME; Wang, H; Bertino, E				Kabir, Md. Enamul; Wang, Hua; Bertino, Elisa			Efficient systematic clustering method for k-anonymization	ACTA INFORMATICA			English	Article							PRIVACY; ANONYMITY	This paper presents a clustering (Clustering partitions record into clusters such that records within a cluster are similar to each other, while records in different clusters are most distinct from one another.) based k-anonymization technique to minimize the information loss while at the same time assuring data quality. Privacy preservation of individuals has drawn considerable interests in data mining research. The k-anonymity model proposed by Samarati and Sweeney is a practical approach for data privacy preservation and has been studied extensively for the last few years. Anonymization methods via generalization or suppression are able to protect private information, but lose valued information. The challenge is how to minimize the information loss during the anonymization process. We refer to the challenge as a systematic clustering problem for k-anonymization which is analysed in this paper. The proposed technique adopts group-similar data together and then anonymizes each group individually. The structure of systematic clustering problem is defined and investigated through paradigm and properties. An algorithm of the proposed problem is developed and shown that the time complexity is in O(n(2)/k), where n is the total number of records containing individuals concerning their privacy. Experimental results show that our method attains a reasonable dominance with respect to both information loss and execution time. Finally the algorithm illustrates the usability for incremental datasets.

Based on this idea, we will present a method for inducing logical rules from empirical data-Reverse Analysis. When the values of the connections of a neural network resulting from Hebbian learning for the data are given, we hope to know what logical rules are entrenched in it.

J	Zhou, W; Kapoor, G				Zhou, Wei; Kapoor, Gaurav			Detecting evolutionary financial statement fraud	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financial statement fraud; Data mining technique; Neural networks	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; MANAGEMENT FRAUD; MODEL	A fraudulent financial statement involves the intentional furnishing and/or publishing of false information in it and this has become a severe economic and social problem. We consider Data Mining (DM) based financial fraud detection techniques (such as regression, decision tree, neural networks and Bayesian networks) that help identify fraud. The effectiveness of these DM methods (and their limitations) is examined, especially when new schemes of financial statement fraud adapt to the detection techniques. We then explore a self-adaptive framework (based on a response surface model) with domain knowledge to detect financial statement fraud. We conclude by suggesting that, in an era with evolutionary financial frauds, computer assisted automated fraud detection mechanisms will be more effective and efficient with specialized domain knowledge.

Link prediction has recently attracted the attention of many researchers as an effective technique to be used in social network analysis to understand the associations between nodes in social communities. It has been shown in the literature that the link prediction technique is limited to predict the existence of the links in the future. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works in this area has explored the prediction of the links that could disappear in the future. In this paper, we propose a link prediction model that is capable of predicting link that might exist and links that may disappear in the future. The model has been successfully applied in two different domains, namely health care and stock market. We have tested our model using different classifiers and the reported results are encouraging.

Through the analysis of electrical variables, power could be saved and, therefore, better energy efficiency could be reached in buildings. The application of advanced data analysis helps to provide a better understanding, especially if it enables a joint and comparative analysis of different buildings which are influenced by common environmental conditions. In this paper, we present an approach to monitor and compare electrical consumption profiles of several buildings from the Campus of the University of Leon. The envSOM algorithm, a modification of the self-organizing map (SOM), is used to reduce the dimension of data and capture their electrical behaviors conditioned on the environment. After that, a Sammon's mapping is used to visualize global, component-wise or environmentally conditioned similarities among the buildings. Finally, a clustering step based on k-means algorithm is performed to discover groups of buildings with similar electrical behavior.

The proposed model is based on cooperative agents and is compliant to the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents standard. This model combines different types of technologies, namely the association rules as a data mining technique and the multi-agent systems to build a model that can operate on distributed databases rather than working on a centralized database only. The autonomous and the social abilities of the model agents provided the ability to operate cooperatively with each other and with other different external agents, thus offering a generic platform and a basic infrastructure that can deal with other data mining techniques. The platform has been compared with the traditional association rules algorithms and has proved to be more efficient and more scalable.	[Atteya, Walid Adly; Dahal, Keshav; Hossain, M.

The management of air traffic at the airports was the main reason to design effective mechanisms for timely prediction of these phenomena. In both these cases meteorologists already use some physical models based on differential equations as simulations. Our goal was to design, implement and evaluate a different approach based on suitable techniques and methods from data mining domain. The selected algorithms were applied on obtained historical data from meteorological observations at several airports in United Arab Emirates and Slovakia. In the first case, the fog occurrence was predicted based on data from METAR messages with algorithms based on neural networks and decision trees.

Six weak learners including conjunctive rules, decision stump, decision table, pruned model trees, rule model trees, and multilayer perceptron, implemented in the data mining system WEKA, were applied. All algorithms were employed to real-world datasets derived from the cadastral system and the registry of real estate transactions, and cleansed by property valuation experts. The analysis of the results was performed using recently proposed statistical methodology including nonparametric tests followed by post-hoc procedures designed especially for multiple nxn comparisons. The results showed the lowest prediction error with base test set only in the case of model trees and a neural network.

However, the same characteristics that make the social media environment challenging provide unique and untapped opportunities for solving the information provenance problem for social media. Current approaches for tracking provenance information do not scale for social media and consequently there is a gap in provenance methodologies and technologies providing exciting research opportunities for computer scientists and sociologists. This paper introduces a theoretical approach aimed guiding future efforts to realize a provenance capability for social media that is not available today. The guiding vision is the use of social media information itself to realize a useful amount provenance data for information in social media.

This process will result in a single tree that can be use both for classification of new examples and for description the partitioning of the training set. In the paper we propose an alternative approach that is related to the idea of finding all interesting relations (usually association rules, but in our case all interesting trees) in given data. When building the so called exploration trees, we consider not a single best attribute for branching but more "good" attributes for each split. The proposed method will be compared with the "standard" C4.5 algorithm on several data sets from the loan application domain. We propose this algorithm in the framework of the GUHA method, a genuine exploratory analysis method that aims at finding all patterns, that are true in the analyzed data.

There is consequently a strong need for highly efficient search tools for EO image databases and for search methods to automatically identify and recognize structures within EO images. In this paper, we present a concept for an earth observation image data mining system mixing an auto-annotation component with a category search engine which combines a generic image class search and an object detection feature. The proposed concept relies thus on three distinct components which are detailed successively: in the first part, we describe the auto-annotation component, in the second part, the generic category search engine and in the third part, the object detection tool. In the concluding part of the paper, we provide an insight into how these three components can be related to each other and used in a complementary way to arrive at a system which combines the advantages of both the auto-annotation systems and the category search engines.

In the case of training on continuous-valued data, the associated attributes must be discretized in advance or during the learning process. The commonly used method is to partition the attribute range into two or several intervals using single or a set of cut points. One inherent disadvantage in these methods is that the use of sharp cut points makes the induced decision trees sensitive to noise. To overcome this problem this paper presents an alternative method called adaptive discretization based on Ant Colony Decision Tree (ACDT) approach. Experimental results showed that, by using that methodology, better classification accuracy has been obtained in both training and testing data sets in majority of cases concerning the classical decision tree constructed by ants. It suggests that the robustness of decision trees could be improved by means of this approach.

NCD uses existing compression programs such as gzip to compute similarity between objects. NCD has unique features: It does not require any prior knowledge, data preprocessing, feature extraction, domain adaptation or any parameter settings. Further, the NCD can be applied to symbolic data and raw signals alike. In this paper we decompose the NCD and introduce a method to measure compression-based similarity without the need to use compression. The Length Delimiting Dictionary Distance (LD3) takes the one component essential in compression methods, the dictionary generation, and strips the NCD of all dispensable components. The LD3 performs "compression based pattern recognition without compression", keeping all of the above benefits of the NCD while achieving better speed and recognition rates. We first review the NCD, introduce LD3 as the "essence" of NCD, and evaluate the LD3 based on language tree experiments, authorship recognition, and genome phylogeny data.

Recent research in this domain has shown that the simple nearest-neighbor classifier using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as distance measure performs exceptionally well, in most cases outperforming more advanced classification algorithms. Instance selection is a commonly applied approach for improving efficiency of nearest-neighbor classifier with respect to classification time. This approach reduces the size of the training set by selecting the best representative instances and use only them during classification of new instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel instance selection method that exploits the hubness phenomenon in time-series data, which states that some few instances tend to be much more frequently nearest neighbors compared to the remaining instances. Based on hubness, we propose a framework for score-based instance selection, which is combined with a principled approach of selecting instances that optimize the coverage of training data. We discuss the theoretical considerations of casting the instance selection problem as a graph-coverage problem and analyze the resulting complexity. We experimentally compare the proposed method, denoted as INSIGHT, against FastAWARD, a state-of-the-art instance selection method for time series.

In this paper we propose a method of structural analysis and characterise in details developed toolkit as a Protege extension. The aim of method itself is to identify hidden relationships using structural weighted graph analysis, applied for both terminology and instance base. In order to evaluate new relationships between instances, we have chosen a set of measures that consider the analysis of both vertices and links, thus providing new semantic information for identified associations. Developed environment concludes both approaches (logic based and graph based) in order to apply reasoning techniques, graph based algorithms and measures for inferring important analytical information. The scope of paper provides also application areas of such method in terms of data mining techniques for crisis identification and multi-criteria data analysis.

Distributed learning from data is considered to be an important challenge faced by researchers and practice in the domain of the distributed data mining and distributed knowledge discovery from databases. An effective approach to learning from a geographically distributed data is to select, from the local databases, relevant local patterns, called also prototypes. Such a selection can be based on results of the data reduction process. The paper proposes to carry-out prototype selection at local sites in parallel, independently at each site, employing specialized software agents. To assure obtaining homogenous prototypes at a global level the consensus-based method is proposed and applied. The paper includes a detailed description of the proposed approach and a discussion of the computational experiment results.

Surveying craters requires counting a large amount of small subkilometer craters, which calls for highly efficient automatic crater detection. In this article, we present an integrated framework on autodetection of subkilometer craters with boosting and transfer learning. The framework contains three key components. First, we utilize mathematical morphology to efficiently identify crater candidates, the regions of an image that can potentially contain craters. Only those regions occupying relatively small portions of the original image are the subjects of further processing. Second, we extract and select image texture features, in combination with supervised boosting ensemble learning algorithms, to accurately classify crater candidates into craters and noncraters. Third, we integrate transfer learning into boosting, to enhance detection performance in the regions where surface morphology differs from what is characterized by the training set. Our framework is evaluated on a large test image of 37, 500 x 56, 250 m(2) on Mars, which exhibits a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by nonuniform surface morphology. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed crater detection framework can achieve an F1 score above 0.85, a significant improvement over the other crater detection algorithms.

Furthermore, when using traditional association rule mining, regional patterns frequently fail to be discovered due to insufficient global confidence and/or support. In this paper, we systematically study this problem and address the unique challenges of regional association mining and scoping: (1) region discovery: how to identify interesting regions from which novel and useful regional association rules can be extracted; (2) regional association rule scoping: how to determine the scope of regional association rules. We investigate the duality between regional association rules and regions where the associations are valid: interesting regions are identified to seek novel regional patterns, and a regional pattern has a scope of a set of regions in which the pattern is valid. In particular, we present a reward-based region discovery framework that employs a divisive grid-based supervised clustering for region discovery. We evaluate our approach in a real-world case study to identify spatial risk patterns from arsenic in the Texas water supply. Our experimental results confirm and validate research results in the study of arsenic contamination, and our work leads to the discovery of novel findings to be further explored by domain scientists.

Therefore, preprocessing data is required for dealing with data quality criteria. However, preprocessing data has been traditionally seen as a time-consuming and non-trivial task since data quality criteria have to be considered without any guide about how they affect the data mining process. To overcome this situation, in this paper, we propose to analyze the data mining techniques to know the behavior of different data quality criteria on the sources and how they affects the results of the algorithms. To this aim, we have conducted a set of experiments to assess three data quality criteria: completeness, correlation and balance of data. This work is a first step towards considering, in a systematic and structured manner, data quality criteria for supporting and guiding data miners in obtaining reliable knowledge.

Due to the electrical power distribution network limitation and absence of smart meter devices, Electric Vehicles charging should be performed in a balanced way, taking into account past experience, weather information based on data mining, and simulation approaches. In order to allow information exchange and to help user mobility, it was also created a mobile application to assist the EV driver on these processes. This proposed Smart Electric Vehicle Charging System uses Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, in order to connect Electric Vehicles and also renewable energy sources to Smart Grids (SG). This system also explores the new paradigm of Electrical Markets (EM), with deregulation of electricity production and use, in order to obtain the best conditions for commercializing electrical energy.

It is based on the following two characteristics of contact center conversations; 1) customers state their requests at the beginning of the calls, 2) agents tend to use typical phrases at the end of the call-reason segments. Our proposal acquires these typical phrases from stored speech data automatically and extracts the call-reason segment precisely by detecting the typical phrases. Experiments show that it significantly improves the performance of call-reason information retrieval since it allows the search scope to be limited to the call-reason segments of calls.

The datasets that can be analysed with these techniques are gathered from a variety of domains, from business related fields to HPC and supercomputers. The datasets continue to increase at an exponential rate, so research has been focusing on parallelizing different data mining techniques. Recently, GPU hybrid architectures are starting to be used for this task. However the data transfer rate between CPU and GPU is a bottleneck for the applications dealing with large data entries exhibiting numerous dependencies. In this paper we analyse how efficient data mining algorithms can be mapped on these architectures by extracting the common characteristics of these methods and by looking at the communication patterns between the main memory and the GPU's shared memory. We propose an experimental study for the performance of memory systems on GPU architectures when dealing with data mining algorithms and we also advance performance model guidelines based on the observations.

According to the large number of output of simulations, interpreting them seems impossible. In this paper we use an innovative methodology that combines simulation and data mining techniques to discover knowledge that can be derived from results of simulations. Data used in simulation process, are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution, but the output data from simulations are often not i.i.d. normal. Therefore by finding associations between output data mining techniques can operate well. Analyzers change the sequences and values of input data according to the importance they have. These operations optimize the simulation output analysis. The methods presented here will of most interest to those analysts wishing to extract much information from their simulation models. The proposed approach has been implemented and run on a supply chain system simulation. The results show optimizations on analysis of simulation output of the mentioned system. Simulation results show high improvement in proposed approach.

This is the case of leukemia identification from bone marrow smears in which cells morphology is studied in order to classify the disease into its main family and subtype, so that a proper treatment can be indicated to the patient. In this paper we present a method to identify leukemia from bone marrow cells images using a combined machine vision and data mining strategy. Our process starts with a segmentation method to obtain leukemia cells and extract from them descriptive characteristics (geometrical, texture, statistical) and eigenvalues. We use these attributes to feed machine learning algorithms that learn to classify acute leukemia families and subtypes according to the FAB system. We show how the combination of descriptive features and eigenvalues helps to improve classification accuracy. Our method achieved accuracy above 95.5% to distinguish between the acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemia families and accuracy of 90% (and above) among five leukemia subtypes (after the acute leukemia families classification).

This pattern model can be used to express both uncertainty and temporal inaccuracy of temporal events expressed as Symbolic Time Sequences. Among other things, TTA rules can express the usual time point operators, synchronicity, order, chaining, as well as temporal negation. TTA rules is designed to allows predictions with optimum temporal precision. Using this representation, we present an algorithm that can be used to extract Temporal Tree Associative rules from large data sets of symbolic time sequences. This algorithm is a mining heuristic based on entropy maximisation and statistical independence analysis. We discuss the evaluation of probabilistic temporal rules, evaluate our technique with an experiment and discuss the results.

The basic ideas, prediction models and steps of clock bias prediction based on wavelet analysis and FONN are discussed respectively. And then, to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method, make a careful precision analysis for satellite clock bias prediction with the performance parameters of GPS satellite clock, and make comparison and analysis with Grey system model and neural network model. The results of simulation shows that the prediction precision of the novel four-stage model based on wavelet analysis and FONN is more better, can afford high precise satellite clock bias prediction for real-time GPS precise point positioning.

The goal of this year's challenge was to learn good data representations that can be re-used across tasks by building models that capture regularities of the input space. The representations provided by the participants were evaluated by the organizers on supervised learning "target tasks", which were unknown to the participants. In a first phase of the challenge, the competitors were given only unlabeled data to learn their data representation. In a second phase of the challenge, the competitors were also provided with a limited amount of labeled data from "source tasks", distinct from the "target tasks". We made available large datasets from various application domains: handwriting recognition, image recognition, video processing, text processing, and ecology. The results indicate that learned data representation yield results significantly better than what can be achieved with raw data or data preprocessed with standard normalizations and functional transforms. The UTL challenge is part of the IJCNN 2011 competition program(1). The website of the challenge remains open for submission of new methods beyond the termination of the challenge as a resource for students and researchers(2).

Due to these issues, data owners may prevent to share their sensitive information with data miners. On the other hand, in distributed environments, other issues related to the distribution of data will raise, which will make the preservation of privacy more challengeable. To solve these problems, different privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) techniques have been introduced. In this paper, a new privacy preserving clustering (PPC) technique for horizontally and vertically distributed datasets is proposed. The proposed technique uses Haar wavelet transforms (HWT) and scaling data perturbation (SDP) to achieve both data hiding and data reduction for protecting private numerical attribute values in distributed datasets. The results of our evaluations demonstrated that the proposed technique provides a proper degree of privacy and quality of clustering for distributed datasets and also runs fast. Our experiments have also shown that the proposed technique provides better privacy and clustering results comparing to the other existing privacy preserving clustering techniques applicable to distributed datasets. The proposed algorithms and the results of their experimental evaluations using different datasets are presented in this paper.

The aim of this paper is to develop a self-organizing map for interval data. Due to the increasing use of such data in Data Mining, many clustering methods for interval data have been proposed this last decade. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to train the self-organizing map for interval data. We use the Hausdorff distance to compare two vectors of intervals. In order to show the usefulness of our approach, we apply the self-organizing map on real interval data issued from meteorological stations in China.

Finding dependency structures among variables in the data is one possible approach for the purpose, and is an important task in data mining. In this paper, we focus on learning dependency substructures shared by multiple datasets. In many scenarios, the nature of data varies due to a change in the surrounding conditions or non-stationary mechanisms over the multiple datasets. However, we can also assume that the change occurs only partially and some relations between variables remain unchanged. Moreover, we can expect that such commonness over the multiple datasets is closely related to the invariance of the underlying mechanism. For example, errors in engineering systems are usually caused by faults in the sub-systems with the other parts remaining healthy. In such situations, though anomalies are observed in sensor values, the underlying invariance of the healthy sub-systems is still captured by some steady dependency structures before and after the onset of the error. We propose a structure learning algorithm to find such invariances in the case of Graphical Gaussian Models (GGM). The proposed method is based on a block coordinate descent optimization, where subproblems can be solved efficiently by existing algorithms for Lasso and the continuous quadratic knapsack problem. We confirm the validity of our approach through numerical simulations and also in applications with real world datasets extracted from the analysis of city-cycle fuel consumption and anomaly detection in car sensors.

For example, in 2009, the super-flu virus spawned significant effects on various product marketing domains around the globe. In buzz marketing sites, there had been a lot of word of mouth about the "flu." We could easily expect an "air purifier" to be correlated to the "flu" and air purifiers' shipments had grown according to the epidemic of flu. On the other hand, the relatedness between the "flu" and a "camera" could not be easily expected. However, in Japan, consumers' unforeseen behavior like the reluctance to buy digital cameras because of cancellations of a trip, a PE festival or other events caused by the epidemic of flu had appeared, and a strong correlation between the "flu" and "camera" had been found. Detecting these unforeseen consumers' behavior is significant for today's marketing analysis. In order to detect such unexpected relations, this paper applies the dynamic time warping techniques. Our proposed method computes time series correlations between a current topic and unspecified products from word of mouth of buzz marketing sites, and finds product candidates which have unexpected correlation with a current topic. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, the experimental results for the current topic ("flu") and products ("air purifier", "camera", "car", etc.) are shown as well. By detecting unexpected relatedness from buzz marketing sites, unforeseen consumer behaviors can be further analyzed.

A data clustering algorithm based on the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is proposed in this research. In this algorithm, some candidate solutions for clustering problem are created randomly and then interact with one another via Newton's gravity law to search the problem space. The performance of the presented algorithm is compared with three other well-known clustering algorithms, including k-means, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) on four real and standard. datasets. Experimental results confirm that the GSA is a robust and viable method for data clustering.

There has therefore been increasing interest both in active discovery: to identify new classes quickly, and active learning: to train classifiers with minimal supervision. Very few studies have attempted to jointly solve these two inter-related tasks which occur together in practice. Optimizing both rare class discovery and classification simultaneously with active learning is challenging because discovery and classification have conflicting requirements in query criteria. In this paper we address these issues with two contributions: a unified active learning model to jointly discover new categories and learn to classify them; and a classifier combination algorithm that switches generative and discriminative classifiers as learning progresses. Extensive evaluation on several standard datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods.

Drawing on a more pragmatic and practical level, aspects of privacy management are presented as well. Design/methodology/approach - Based on individual privacy concerns and also publicly communicated threats, information privacy has become an important topic of public and scholarly discussion. Beside diverse positive aspects of OSN sites for users, their information is for example also being used for data mining and profiling, pre-recruiting information as well as economic espionage. This review highlights information privacy mainly from an individual point-of-view, focusing on the usage of OSN sites (OSNs). Findings - This analysis of scholarly work shows the following findings: first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short. Hence, findings of this paper further highlight the necessity to focus on multidimensional and multidisciplinary frameworks of privacy, for example considering a so-called "privacy calculus paradigm" and rethinking "fair information practices" from a more and more ubiquitous environment of OSNs. Originality/value - The results of the work presented in this paper give new opportunities for research as well as suggestions for privacy management issues for OSN providers and users.

Tricluster is defined in terms of Triadic Formal Concept Analysis as a dense triset of a binary relation Y, describing relationship between objects, attributes and conditions. This definition is a relaxation of a triconcept notion and makes it possible to find all triclusters and triconcepts contained in triclusters of large datasets. This approach generalizes the similar study of concept-based biclustering.

Unfortunately, these aspects are mostly analysed separately. We propose how to put together vectors of features for segmented objects and a spatial relationship of the objects. To achieve this goal we have constructed a search engine taking into account multi-set data mining and object spatial relationship. Additionally, we have constructed a graphical user interface (GUI) to enable the user to build a query by image. The efficiency of our system will be evaluated in the near future. In this paper we present the search engine for our CBIR.

It relies on pixel-based evolution and sub-evolution extraction. These evolutions, namely the {frequent grouped sequential patterns}, are required to cover a minimum surface and to affect pixels that are sufficiently connected. These spatial constraints are actively used to face large data volumes and to select evolutions making sense for end-users. In this paper, a specific application to fully polarimetric SAR image time series is presented. Experiments performed on a RADARSAT-2 SITS covering the Chamonix Mont-Blanc test-site are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

J	Kantarcioglu, M; Xi, BW; Clifton, C				Kantarcioglu, Murat; Xi, Bowei; Clifton, Chris			Classifier evaluation and attribute selection against active adversaries	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Adversarial classification; Game theory; Attribute selection; Simulated annealing		Many data mining applications, such as spam filtering and intrusion detection, are faced with active adversaries. In all these applications, the future data sets and the training data set are no longer from the same population, due to the transformations employed by the adversaries. Hence a main assumption for the existing classification techniques no longer holds and initially successful classifiers degrade easily. This becomes a game between the adversary and the data miner: The adversary modifies its strategy to avoid being detected by the current classifier; the data miner then updates its classifier based on the new threats. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of an equilibrium in this seemingly never ending game, where neither party has an incentive to change. Modifying the classifier causes too many false positives with too little increase in true positives; changes by the adversary decrease the utility of the false negative items that are not detected. We develop a game theoretic framework where equilibrium behavior of adversarial classification applications can be analyzed, and provide solutions for finding an equilibrium point. A classifier's equilibrium performance indicates its eventual success or failure. The data miner could then select attributes based on their equilibrium performance, and construct an effective classifier. A case study on online lending data demonstrates how to apply the proposed game theoretic framework to a real application.

J	Kass, S; Notarnicola, C; Zebisch, M				Kass, Steve; Notarnicola, Claudia; Zebisch, Marc			Identification of orchards and vineyards with different texture-based measurements by using an object-oriented classification approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						object oriented; textures; data mining; land-use	SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; IMAGERY; INFORMATION; CANOPY; AREA; LEAF	This article presents an object-oriented classification approach to identifying orchards, vineyards and agricultural fields. This approach uses texture-related parameters obtained from very high spatial resolution data, in particular Quickbird images and orthophotos. A multi-resolution segmentation procedure was applied to delimit individual agricultural plots as segments. Textural information of the generated segments was then used to classify orchards, agricultural fields (grassland) and two wine cultivation systems (trellis and pergola). In this article three different texture-based approaches are compared to correctly classify the given plots: (1) a 'zonal mean maximum' of texture measurements, which consider the maximum value of four directions of texture measurements related to plots; (2) a relational sub-object approach based on a thematic derived texture filter technique that reflects individual row structures; and (3) a hybrid approach combining the two previous ones. In order to identify relevant parameters for each approach, the data mining software See5 is used. The hybrid approach increased overall accuracy by 8% and 6% for Quickbird (92% accuracy) and orthophotos (88% accuracy), respectively. The application of the same methodology to the orthophotos alone results in a lower accuracy but still one that is acceptable. This offers the possibility of also considering orthophotos for this kind of detection, especially when Quickbird data are not available. In this sense, the developed methodology can be considered as a new object-based landscape analysis technique suitable for the provision of accurate maps able to fulfil the requirements of scientists, planners and other end-users.

The wide range of data mining applications has made it an important field of research. Criminology is one of the most important fields for applying data mining. Criminology is a process that aims to identify crime characteristics. Actually crime analysis includes exploring and detecting crimes and their relationships with criminals. The high volume of crime datasets and also the complexity of relationships between these kinds of data have made criminology an appropriate field for applying data mining techniques. Identifying crime characteristics is the first step for developing further analysis. The knowledge that is gained from data mining approaches is a very useful tool which can help and support police forces. An approach based on data mining techniques is discussed in this paper to extract important entities from police narrative reports which are written in plain text. By using this approach, crime data can be automatically entered into a database, in law enforcement agencies. We have also applied a SOM clustering method in the scope of crime analysis and finally we will use the clustering results in order to perform crime matching process.

Customer need-based segmentation was common in past years, but recently customer value as a quantifiable parameter could be used for customer segmentation. In this regard, customer segmentation based on customer lifetime value (CLV) and estimating the value of each segment would be useful for making decision in marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) program which can be adapted with the characteristics of each segment. Customer future value as a part of customer lifetime value can be estimated based on customer segmentation. In this regard, this study provide a framework for estimating customer future value based on adapted weighted RFM analysis which is a CLV calculating model, for each segment of customer in retail banking scope.

We propose first segmenting each image of the series, and then using these segmentations in order to characterize each pixel of the data with a spatial dimension (i.e. with contextual information). Providing spatially characterized pixels, pixel-based temporal analysis can be performed.

All tests were carried out in the WEKA data mining system within the framework of 10-fold cross-validation and repeated holdout splits. A comprehensive real-world cadastral dataset including over 5200 samples and recorded during 11 years served as basis for benchmarking the methods. The overall results of our investigation were as follows. The random forest turned out to be superior to other tested methods, the bagging approach outperformed the random subspace method, single models provided worse prediction accuracy than any other ensemble technique.

The data mining community is faced with a paradigm shift: instead of mining the abundance of empirical data supported by the background knowledge, the new challenge is to mine the abundance of knowledge encoded in domain ontologies, constrained by the heuristics computed from the empirical data collection. We address this challenge by an approach, named semantic data mining, where domain ontologies define the hypothesis search space, and the data is used as means of constraining and guiding the process of hypothesis search and evaluation. The use of prototype semantic data mining systems SEGS and g-SEGS is demonstrated in a simple semantic data mining scenario and in two real-life functional genomics scenarios of mining biological ontologies with the support of experimental microarray data.

A common and simple form of filter to reduce the noise originated in signal processing, the finite impulse response (FIR) filter. There are several of these noise reduction methods used throughout the financial instrument trading community. The major issue with these filters is the delay between the filtered data and the noisy data. This delay only increases as more noise reduction is desired. In the present marketplace, where investors are competing for quality and timely information, this delay can be a hindrance. This paper proposes a new FIR filter derived with the aim of maximizing the level of noise reduction and minimizing the delay. The model is modified from the old problem of time series graduation by penalized least squares. Comparison between five different methods has been clone and experiment results have shown that our method is significantly superior to the alternatives in both delay and smoothness over short and middle range delay periods.

Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications, such as, ecological study, traffic control, mobile communication management, and climatological forecast. In this article, we focus our study on animal movement data analysis and examine advanced data mining methods for discovery of various animal movement patterns. In particular, we introduce a moving object data mining system, MoveMine, which integrates multiple data mining functions, including sophisticated pattern mining and trajectory analysis. In this system, two interesting moving object pattern mining functions are newly developed: (1)periodic behavior mining and (2) swarm pattern mining. For mining periodic behaviors, a reference location-based method is developed, which first detects the reference locations, discovers the periods in complex movements, and then finds periodic patterns by hierarchical clustering. For mining swarm patterns, an efficient method is developed to uncover flexible moving object clusters by relaxing the popularly-enforced collective movement constraints. In the MoveMine system, a set of commonly used moving object mining functions are built and a user-friendly interface is provided to facilitate interactive exploration of moving object data mining and flexible tuning of the mining constraints and parameters. MoveMine has been tested on multiple kinds of real datasets, especially for MoveBank applications and other moving object data analysis. The system will benefit scientists and other users to carry out versatile analysis tasks to analyze object movement regularities and anomalies. Moreover, it will benefit researchers to realize the importance and limitations of current techniques and promote future studies on moving object data mining. As expected, a mastery of animal movement patterns and trends will improve our understanding of the interactions between and the changes of the animal world and the ecosystem and therefore help ensure the sustainability of our ecosystem.

Depending on the level of granularity, data mining techniques can produce different results. Correlating results from different levels of granularity can improve the quality of analysis. This paper proposes a process and measures for comparing clustering results from two levels of granularity for a mobile call dataset. The clustering is applied to the phone calls as well as phone numbers, where phone calls are finer granules while phone numbers are coarser granules. The coarse granular clustering is then expanded to a finer level and finer granular clustering is contracted to the coarser granularity for additional qualitative analysis. The paper uses a popular cluster quality measure called Davies-Bouldin index as well as a proposal for transforming clustering schemes between different levels of granularity.

The predicting travel time is based on the historical travel time and the current travel time. The historical travel time is calculated by speeds. The traffic pattern similar to the current traffic are searched among the historical patterns and closest matched patterns are used to extrapolate the present traffic condition. The method is combined the historical traffic patterns with real-time traffic data as a linear. A router is chosen from a few candidate routers based on the prediction technique. The resulting model is tested with realistic traffic data, and is found to perform well.

They decompose input matrix and tensor data into matrix factors by optimizing a least square objective function using iterative updating algorithms, e. g. HOSVD (High Order Singular Value Decomposition) and ParaFac (Parallel Factors). One fundamental problem of these algorithms remains unsolved: are the solutions found by these algorithms global optimal? Surprisingly, we provide a positive answer for HSOVD and negative answer for ParaFac by combining theoretical analysis and experimental evidence. Our discoveries of this intrinsic property of HOSVD assure us that in real world applications HOSVD provides repeatable and reliable results.

From these discovered sequential patterns, we can discover the order of the patterns; however, they cannot tell us the time intervals between successive patterns. Accordingly. Chen et al. have proposed a fuzzy time-interval (FTI) sequential pattern mining algorithms, which reveals the time intervals between successive patterns [12][13]. In this paper, we contributed to the ongoing research on FTI sequential pattern mining by proposing a multi objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method. Fuzzy solves the sharp boundary problem and the refinement ability of GA helps to find the global optimum FTI sequential patterns. Our approach uses two measures as objectives. namely: Confidence and Coverage to prune the traditional Apriori algorithm. The main objective is to achieve maximum confidence and maximum coverage in the FTI sequential patterns. The paper defines the confidence of the FTI sequences, which is not yet defined in the previous researches. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is the use of fuzzy genetic approach to discover optimized sequences in the network traffic data to classify and detect intrusion.

The micro-economic framework for data mining addresses maximising the overall utility of an enterprise where transaction of a customer is a function of the data available on that customer. In this paper, we investigate an alternative problem formulation for the catalog segmentation problem. Moreover, a self-adaptive genetic algorithm has been developed to solve the problem. It includes clever features to avoid getting trapped in a local optimum. The results of an extensive computational study using real and synthetic data sets show the performance of the algorithm. In comparison with classical catalog segmentation algorithms, the proposed approach achieves better performance in Fitness and CPU-time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This problem arises naturally in applications including databases (e. g., histogram construction), speech recognition, computational biology (e. g., denoising aCGH data) and many more. Specifically, let P = (P(1), P(2), ... , P(n)), P(i) is an element of R for all i, be a signal and let C be a constant. Our goal is to find a function F : [n] -> R which optimizes the following objective function: (0.1) min(F) Sigma(n)(i=1)(P(i) - F(i))(2) + C x vertical bar{i : F(i) not equal F(i+1)}vertical bar The above optimization problem reduces to solving the following recurrence, which can be done using dynamic programming in O(n(2)) time: OPT(i) = min(0 <= j <= i-1) [OPT(j) + Sigma(i)(k-j+1) (P(k)-Sigma(i)(m=j+1) P(m)/i - j)(2)] + C This recurrence arises naturally in several applications where one wants to approximate a given signal P with a signal F which ideally consists of few piecewise constant segments. Such applications include histogram construction in databases, determining DNA copy numbers in cancer cells from micro-array data, speech recognition, data mining and many others. In this work we present two new techniques for optimizing dynamic programming that can handle cost functions not treated by other standard methods. The basis of our first algorithm is the definition of a constant-shifted variant of the objective function that can be efficiently approximated using state of the art methods for range searching. Our technique approximates the optimal value of our objective function within additive epsilon error and runs in (O) over tilde (n(4/3+delta) log (U/epsilon)) time, where delta is an arbitrarily small positive constant and U = max{root C, (vertical bar P(i)vertical bar)(i=1,) (...) (, n)}. The second algorithm we provide solves a similar recurrence that's within a multiplicative factor of (1+epsilon) and runs in O(n log n/epsilon). The new technique introduced by our algorithm is the decomposition of the initial problem into a small (logarithmic) number of Monge optimization subproblems which we can speed up using existing techniques.

Contrastingly. non-profit organizations like libraries have not been considered it very useful. However, due to the progress of the information society, our society becomes too complex to capture the patrons's needs for them in the way they have been using so far. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance and usefulness of marketing by presenting some analysis methods of circulation data of a university library and showing what can get about the patrons' behavior. The analysis methods presented in this paper are not only some statistical ones but also non-statistical ones, such as the one for analyzing patron's borrow-return behavior pattern: in other words patron profile.

Along with this, people's requirements to information are not only changing vigorously but also have a huge variety in their forms. As a result it becomes more and more difficult for the libraries to provide their patrons with appropriate information services. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of library marketing through some examples; especially with some analysis methods for seat-usage, or seat-occupation, data in library. We investigate what seats are more preferred than others and try to deduce tips for better seat arrangement, combination of different types of seats, etc. Even though our research is in a very early stage so that we could not infer that good suggestions to better seat arrangements, we believe in its importance and it would propose the best solution in seat design in the future.

Unfortunately, there has been significant degradation in forest cover over recent decades as a result of logging, conversion to crop, plantation, and pasture land, or disasters (natural or man made) such as forest fires, floods, and hurricanes. As a result, significant attention is being given to the sustainable use of forests. A key to effective forest management is quantifiable knowledge about changes in forest cover. This requires identification and characterization of changes and the discovery of the relationship between these changes and natural and anthropogenic variables. In this article, we present our preliminary efforts and achievements in addressing some of these tasks along with the challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed in the future. At a higher level, our goal is to provide an overview of the exciting opportunities and challenges in developing and applying data mining approaches to provide critical information for forest and land use management.

In recent years, the uncertainties increase due to the competitive power markets and the emergence of renewable energy such as PV and wind power generation. The prediction of one-step ahead daily maximum temperature plays a key role to deal with Demand Response (DR) and PV under smart grid environment as well as load forecasting and electricity price forecasting. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent system is proposed for daily maximum temperature forecasting. As a precondition technique for a predictor, Regression Tree (RT) of data mining is used to classify input data into clusters where GP (Gaussian Process) of the kernel machine is constructed to predict temperature precisely. GP has advantage to evaluate the upper and the lower bounds of the predicted value as well as the expected value of the predicted one. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of the daily maximum temperature. A comparison is made between the proposed and the conventional intelligent methods such as MLP of artificial neural network (ANN) and GP.

With the emergence of more, low-cost photovoltaic (PV) systems and consumer self-generation programs, such as net energy metering and feed-in-tariffs, today's utilities are facing a fundamental shift towards a need to get more visibility to customer-sited, distributed generating resources (DG). The Hawaiian utilities are among an emerging set of utilities around the world leading the nation in contending with high levels of renewable penetration on their distribution systems. Hawaiian Electric Utilities are pursuing efforts to gather, evaluate and target (GET) relevant resource datasets in conjunction with time synchronized system data to enable planning, forecasting and operations with high penetration of variable, distributed renewable resources.

The automation of these activities hence holds the promise of significant cost and time savings, however, only if the decision quality does not suffer. To achieve this, it is required to consider data from diverse sources that go beyond the process audit log, which is why approaches relying solely on it are likely to yield sub-optimal results. We therefore present in this paper an approach to process decision automation that incorporates data integration techniques, enabling significant improvements in decision quality.

It permits to classify several types of data without an explicit information about it. In many cases researchers use analysis methodologies such as clustering to classify data with respect to the patterns and conditions together. But in the last few years new analysis tool such as a biclustering were proposed and applied to the many specific problems. Biclustering algorithms permit not only to classify data with respect to selected conditions, but also to find the conditions that permit to classify data with a better precision. Recently we proposed a biclustering technique based on the Possibilistic Clustering paradigm (PBC algorithm) [1] that is able to find one bicluster at a time. In this paper we propose an improvement to the Possibilistic Biclustering algorithm (PBC Bagging) that permits to find find several biclusters by using the statistical method of Bootstrap aggregation. We applied the algorithm to a synthetic data and to the Yeast dataset, obtaining fast convergence and good quality solutions. A comparison with original PBC method is also presented.

This article presents a summary of our experience and recommendations to compute data set preprocessing and transformation inside a database system (i.e. data cleaning, record selection, summarization, denormalization, variable creation, coding), which is the most time-consuming task in data mining projects. This aspect is largely ignored in the literature. We present practical issues, common solutions and lessons learned when preparing and transforming data sets with the SQL language, based on experience from real-life projects. We then provide specific guidelines to translate programs written in a traditional programming language into SQL statements. Based on successful real-life projects, we present time performance comparisons between SQL code running inside the database system and external data mining programs. We highlight which steps in data mining projects become faster when processed by the database system. More importantly, we identify advantages and disadvantages from a practical standpoint based on data mining users feedback.

The objective of mining sequential patterns is to find out frequent sequences based on the user-specified minimum support threshold, which implicitly assumes that all items in the data have similar probability distribution. This is often not the case in real-life applications. If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will suffer the dilemma called the rare item problem. In order to resolve the dilemma, an algorithm to discover sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports model is proposed, which can specify a different minimum item support for different item. The algorithm can not only discover sequential patterns formed between frequent sequences, but also discover sequential patterns formed either between frequent sequence and rare sequence or among rare sequences only. Moreover, an algorithm for mining direct and indirect sequential patterns with multiple minimum supports is designed simultaneously.

This algorithm can work with both discrete and continuous attributes without the need for a previous discretization. An experimental study was carried out to verify the performance of the method. GAR-SD was compared with other subgroup discovery methods by evaluating certain measures (such as number of rules, number of attributes, significance, support and confidence). For Subgroup Discovery tasks, GAR-SD obtained good results compared with existing algorithms.

Lessons Learned from Data Mining of WHO Mortality Database	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Mortality statistics; data mining; classification; clustering; association analysis	CONVERGENCE; DIVERGENCE; SET	Objectives: The objectives of this research were to test the ability of classification algorithms to predict the cause of death in the mortality data with unknown causes, to find association between common causes of death, to identify groups of countries based on their common causes of death, and to extract knowledge gained from data mining of the World Health Organization mortality database. Methods: The WEKA software version 3.5.3 was used for classification, clustering and association analysis of the World Health Organization mortality database which contained 1,109,537 records. Three major steps were performed: Step 1 - preprocessing of data to convert all records into suitable formats for each type of analysis algorithm; Step 2 - analyzing data using the C4.5 decision tree and Naive Bayes classification algorithm, K-means clustering algorithm and Apriori association analysis algorithm; Step 3 - interpretation of results and hypothesis testing after clustering analysis. Results: Using a C4.5 decision tree classifier to predict cause of death, we obtained 440 leaf nodes that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 40.06%. Naive Bayes classification algorithm calculated probability of death from each disease that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 28.13%. K means clustering divided the data into four clusters with 189, 59, 65, 144 country-years in each cluster. A Chi-square was used to test discriminate disease differences found in each cluster which had different diseases as predominant causes of death. Apriori association analysis produced association rules of linkage among cancer of the lung, hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases. These were found in the top five leading causes of death with 99-100% confidence level. Conclusion: Classification tools produced the poorest results in predicting cause of death. Given the inadequacy of variables in the WHO database, creation of a classification model to predict specific cause of death was impossible. Clustering and association tools yielded interesting results that could be used to identify new areas of interest in mortality data analysis. This can be used in data mining analysis to help solve some quality problems in mortality data.

The exploitation of historical logging data holds promise to provide a great deal of information about group activities without requiring additional efforts for recording of events by the users. Building on the Trialogical Learning Approach as well as related work in the fields of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, and Information Visualization, this paper suggests high-level requirements for mirroring tools in support of practice transformation and introduces a software tool called Timeline-Based Analyzer (TLBA) that was designed and developed in response to these requirements. One of the main TLBA features is the possibility to define patterns as sequences of relevant actions that resulted into critical moments in investigated practices. Such kind of patterns might also represent conceptually interesting practices that emerged within a particular context - either being positive (a sort of good practices), or negative (bad practices). The usability of the whole analytical solution has been tested through the first iteration of several practical experiments and case studies. One of them is described in this paper and illustrates how TLBA can be used to support collaborative analysis and mirroring. The results of these evaluations have been used for continued improvement of the TLBA in order to provide a stable and intuitive tool not only for researchers, but for daily use of teachers or other users.

However, despite the positive results of models that take difficulty in to account, knowledge tracing is still used in its basic form due to its skill level diagnostic abilities that are very useful to teachers. This leads to the research question we address in this work: Can KT be effectively extended to capture item difficulty and improve prediction accuracy? There have been a variety of extensions to KT in recent years. One such extension was Baker's contextual guess and slip model. While this model has shown positive gains over KT in internal validation testing, it has not performed well relative to KT on unseen in-tutor data or post-test data, however, it has proven a valuable model to use alongside other models. The contextual guess and slip model increases the complexity of KT by adding regression steps and feature generation. The added complexity of feature generation across datasets may have hindered the performance of this model. Therefore, one of the aims of our work here is to make the most minimal of modifications to the KT model in order to add item difficulty and keep the modification limited to changing the topology of the model. We analyze datasets from two intelligent tutoring systems with KT and a model we have called KT-IDEM (Item Difficulty Effect Model) and show that substantial performance gains can be achieved with this minor modification that incorporates item difficulty.

J	Pei, T; Wan, Y; Jiang, Y; Qu, CX; Zhou, CH; Qiao, YL				Pei, Tao; Wan, You; Jiang, Yong; Qu, Chenxu; Zhou, Chenghu; Qiao, Youlin			Detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters using ant colony optimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						spatial data mining; spatial analysis	STATISTICS; ALGORITHM	In the map of geo-referenced population and cases, the detection of the most likely cluster (MLC), which is made up of many connected polygons (e. g., the boundaries of census tracts), may face two difficulties. One is the irregularity of the shape of the cluster and the other is the heterogeneity of the cluster. A heterogeneous cluster is referred to as the cluster containing depression links (a polygon is a depression link if it satisfies two conditions: (1) the ratio between the case number and the population in the polygon is below the average ratio of the whole map; (2) the removal of the polygon will disconnect the cluster). Previous studies have successfully solved the problem of detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters not containing depression links. However, for a heterogeneous cluster, existing methods may generate mistakes, for example, missing some parts of the cluster. In this article, a spatial scanning method based on the ant colony optimization (AntScan) is proposed to improve the detection power. If a polygon can be simplified as a node, the research area consisting of many polygons then can be seen as a graph. So the detection of the MLC can be seen as the search of the best subgraph (with the largest likelihood value) in the graph. The comparison between AntScan, GAScan (the spatial scan method based on the genetic optimization), and SAScan (the spatial scan method based on the simulated annealing optimization) indicates that (1) the performance of GAScan and SAScan is significantly influenced by the parameter of the fraction value (the maximum allowed size of the detected cluster), which can only be estimated by multiple trials, while no such parameter is needed in AntScan; (2) AntScan shows superior power over GAScan and SAScan in detecting heterogeneous clusters. The case study on esophageal cancer in North China demonstrates that the cluster identified by AntScan has the larger likelihood value than that detected by SAScan and covers all high-risk regions of esophageal cancer whereas SAScan misses some high-risk regions (the region in the southwest of Shandong province, eastern China) due to the existence of a depression link.

SCENE CLASS RECOGNITION USING HIGH RESOLUTION SAR/INSAR SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION METHODS	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 24-29, 2011	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geosci & Remote Sensing Soc (IEEE GRSS)		High resolution SAR; scene categories; spectral analysis; spectrum estimation		This paper presents a methodology for feature extraction from high resolution SAR image classification, using descriptors constructed from the complex SAR signal. The proposed data mining scheme aims at determining regions in the imaged scene which have similar content. Two complementary approaches are proposed, one making use of the single look complex data for feature extraction and the other based on the interferometric information available about the imaged scene. The features are derived from the estimated signal spectrum, in two stages. For the second stage, the model order is given by minimum number of components needed for classification and is estimated through the Akaike information criterion. Tests show that the proposed features allow for a robust recognition of 25 scene classes.

J	Reischl, M; Groll, L; Mikut, R				Reischl, Markus; Groell, Lutz; Mikut, Ralf			Evaluation of data mining approaches for the control of multifunctional arm prostheses	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article							MYOELECTRIC CONTROL; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; SELECTION; HAND	Commercially available hand prostheses are controlled by myoelectric signals, biosignals that must be accurately interpreted if a prosthesis is to work effectively. We propose the use of standardized muscle contractions to select grasp types; these are taught to the prosthesis using data mining methods and parameters individually adapted from the patient. Embedded systems in medical devices often restrict the application of classification algorithms due to a lack of computational power and memory; therefore, important issues for the design of medical devices are not only classification accuracy, but also computational complexity and low assignment of memory. This paper introduces a new method for feature selection and examines techniques for feature dimension reduction, namely feature selection and aggregation. Wrapper approaches with modified measures were introduced to improve classification results; the effects of this approach are discussed using a synthetic benchmark. Our analysis of measured biosignals, obtained from the control of hand prosthesis by seven different subjects, demonstrates that the proposed approach works for real-world problems.

With many typical incremental learning situations in the real world where a fast response to changing data is necessary, developing a parallel implementation (in fast processing units) will give great impact to many applications. Current research on incremental learning methods employs a modified version of a resource allocating network (RAN) which is one variation of a radial basis function network (RBFN). This paper evaluates the impact of a Graphics Processing Units (GPU) based implementation of a RAN network incorporating Long Term Memory (LTM) [4]. The incremental learning algorithm is compared with the batch RBF approach in terms of accuracy and computational cost, both in sequential and GPU implementations. The UCI machine learning benchmark datasets and a real world problem of multimedia forgery detection were considered in the experiments. The preliminary evaluation shows that although the creation of the model is faster with the RBF algorithm, the RAN-LTM can be useful in environments with the need of fast changing models and high-dimensional data.

The approaches explored here are based on k-means cluster analysis of this massive data set, which provides a basis for defining the bounds of the expected or "normal" phenological patterns that indicate healthy vegetation at a given geographic location. We briefly describe the computational approaches we have used to make cluster analysis of such massive data sets feasible, describe approaches we have explored for distinguishing between normal and abnormal phenology, and present some examples in which we have applied these approaches to identify various forest disturbances in the CONUS.

The main advantage of the nonnegativity constraint is that the approximation problem becomes well posed. To tackle this problem, we suggest the use of a cost function including penalty terms built with matrix exponentials. Gradient components are then derived, allowing to efficiently implement the decomposition using classical optimization algorithms. In our case ALS and conjugate gradient algorithms are studied and compared with another existing algorithm, thanks to computer simulations performed in the context of data analysis.

It finds major importance in classification and regression scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid approach that combines branch-and-bound (BB) search with Bhattacharya distance based feature selection is presented for classifying hyperspectral data using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The performance of this hybrid approach is compared to another hybrid approach that uses genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection in place of BB. It is also compared to baseline SVMs with no feature reduction. Experimental results using hyperspectral data show that under small sample size situations, BB approach performs better than GA and SVM with no feature selection.

In this paper, educational data mining techniques are used to analyze log files produced by a cognitive tutor for Scatterplots to derive a model and detector for carelessness.

The study examines as well the robustness of this detector to a major difference in the tutor's interface, namely the presence or absence of an embodied conversational agent, as well as robustness to data from a different school setting (USA versus Philippines).

In this paper, we present methods for performing such pairwise computations efficiently in parallel on Cell processors. This problem is particularly challenging on the Cell processor due to the small sized Local Stores of the Synergistic Processing Elements, the main computational cores of the processor. We present techniques for different variants of this problem including those with large number of entities or when the dimensionality of the information per entity is large. We demonstrate our methods in the context of multiple applications drawn from fluid dynamics, materials science and systems biology, and present detailed experimental results. Our software library is an open source and can be readily used by application scientists to accelerate pairwise computations using Cell accelerators.

Ontology learning looks for identifying ontology elements like non-taxonomic relationships from information sources. These relationships correspond to slots in a frame-based ontology. This article proposes an initial process for semi-automatic extraction of non-taxonomic relationships of ontologies from textual sources. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify good candidates of non-taxonomic relationships and a data mining technique to suggest their possible best level in the ontology hierarchy. Once the extraction of these relationships is essentially a retrieval task, the metrics of this field like recall, precision and f-measure are used to perform evaluation.

In this paper we examine how noise and outliers are handled by learning algorithms. We introduce a filtering method called PRISM that identifies and removes instances that should be misclassified. We refer to the set of removed instances as ISMs (instances that should be misclassified). We examine PRISM and compare it against 3 existing outlier detection methods and 1 noise reduction technique on 48 data sets using 9 learning algorithms. Using PRISM, the classification accuracy increases from 78.5% to 79.8% on a set of 53 data sets and is statistically significant. In addition, the accuracy on the non-outlier instances increases from 82.8% to 84.7%. PRISM achieves a higher classification accuracy than the outlier detection methods and compares favorably with the noise reduction method.

Distributed Classification for Pocket Data Mining	FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	JUN 28-30, 2011	Warsaw, POLAND		Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci			Distributed and collaborative data stream mining in a mobile computing environment is referred to as Pocket Data Mining PDM. Large amounts of available data streams to which smart phones can subscribe to or sense, coupled with the increasing computational power of handheld devices motivates the development of PDM as a decision making system. This emerging area of study has shown to be feasible in an earlier study using technological enablers of mobile software agents and stream mining techniques [1]. A typical PDM process would start by having mobile agents roam the network to discover relevant data streams and resources. Then other (mobile) agents encapsulating stream mining techniques visit the relevant nodes in the network in order to build evolving data mining models. Finally, a third type of mobile agents roam the network consulting the mining agents for a final collaborative decision, when required by one or more users. In this paper, we propose the use of distributed Hoeffding trees and Naive Bayes classifiers in the PDM framework over vertically partitioned data streams. Mobile policing, health monitoring and stock market analysis are among the possible applications of PDM.

Here we investigate the impact of automatically generated hints on educational outcomes in a robust experiment that shows that hints help students persist in deductive logic courses. Three instructors taught two semester-long courses, each teaching one semester using a logic tutor with hints, and one semester using the tutor without hints, controlling for the impact of different instructors on course outcomes. Our results show that students in the courses using a logic tutor augmented with automatically generated hints attempted and completed significantly more logic proof problems, were less likely to abandon the tutor, and performed significantly better on a post-test implemented within the tutor.

We present strategies for discovering potential flaws in existing student models and use them to identify improvements in a Geometry model. A key discovery was that the student model should distinguish problem steps requiring problem decomposition planning and execution from problem steps requiring just execution of problem decomposition plans. This change to the student model better fits student data not only in the original data set, but also in two other data sets from different sets of students. We also show how such student model changes can be used to modify a tutoring system, not only in terms of the usual student model effects on the tutor's problem selection, but also in driving the creation of new problems and hint messages.

In the first experiment we evaluate the new features on the classification of known well-behaved web crawlers and human visitors. In the second experiment we evaluate the new features on the classification of malicious web crawlers, unknown visitors, well-behaved crawlers and human visitors. The classification performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and F-1 score. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the two new features to improve the accuracy of data mining classifiers in identifying malicious and well-behaved web crawler sessions.

Although these structures are often complex, analyzing them enables us to detect several inter and intra connections amongst people in and outside their organizations. In this context, we present an approach using data mining techniques in order to identify intra and inter organizational linkages amongst groups of people with similar profiles. Using clustering techniques, we identify groups of people in a way that allows us to evaluate how researchers collaborate in the Brazilian scientific scenario of Computing Science. Besides this, we are able to understand how research flows amongst the best universities and research centres in Brazil. Understanding the Scientific Brazilian scenario can help the development of research in other scenario or even in other Social Network Types.

Pattern classification driven enhancements for human-in-the-loop decision support systems	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision support systems; Human expert; Pattern classification; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Confusion matrix	PRODUCT WARRANTY; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFIERS	Data mining has been a key technology in the warranty sector for mass manufacturers to understand and improve product quality, reliability and durability. Cost savings is an important aspect of business which calls for processes that are error proof. Pattern classification methods applied to the diagnostic data could help build error proof processes by improving the diagnostic technology. In this paper we present a case study from the automotive warranty and service domain involving a human-in-the-loop decision support system (HIL-DSS). The automotive manufacturers offer warranties on products, made of parts from different suppliers, and rely on a dealer network to assess warranty claims. The dealers use diagnostic equipment manufactured by third parties and also draw on their own expertise. In addition, a subject matter expert (SME) assesses these collective decisions to distinguish between inaccurate diagnoses by the dealers or an inadequate decision algorithm in the diagnostic equipment. Altogether this makes a comprehensive HIL-DSS. The proposed methodology continuously learns from collective decision making systems, enhances the diagnostic equipment, adds to the knowledge of dealers and minimizes the SME involvement in the review process of the overall system. Improving the diagnostic equipment helps in better warranty servicing, whereas improvements in the human expert knowledge help prevent field error and avoid customer dissatisfaction due to improper fault diagnosis.

It is a temporary storage of Web objects (such as HTML documents) for later retrieval. There are three significant advantages to Web caching; reduced bandwidth consumption, reduced server load, and reduced latency. These rewards have made the Web less expensive with better performance. The aim of this research is to introduce advanced machine learning approaches for Web caching to decide either to cache or not to the cache server, which could be modelled as a classification problem. The challenges include identifying attributes ranking and significant improvements in the classification accuracy. Four methods are employed in this research; Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF) and TreeNet (TN) are used for classification on Web caching.

Statistical Data Mining of Streaming Motion Data for Fall Detection in Assistive Environments	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)			English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				The analysis of human motion data is interesting for the purpose of activity recognition or emergency event detection, especially in the case of elderly or disabled people living independently in their homes. Several techniques have been proposed for identifying such distress situations using either motion, audio or video sensors on the monitored subject (wearable sensors) or the surrounding environment. The output of such sensors is data streams that require real time recognition, especially in emergency situations, thus traditional classification approaches may not be applicable for immediate alarm triggering or fall prevention. This paper presents a statistical mining methodology that may be used for the specific problem of real time fall detection. Visual data captured from the user's environment, using overhead cameras along with motion data are collected from accelerometers on the subject's body and are fed to the fall detection system. The paper includes the details of the stream data mining methodology incorporated in the system along with an initial evaluation of the achieved accuracy in detecting falls.	[Tasoulis, S.

In these cases there is need to improve its mechanical and physical properties. For this purpose, there are several geotechnical techniques where Jet Grouting (JG) is highlighted. In many geotechnical structures, advance design incorporates the ultimate limit state (ULS) and the serviceability limit state (SLS) design criteria, for which uniaxial compressive strength and deformability properties of the improved soils are needed. In this paper, three Data Mining models, i.e. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Functional Networks (FN), were used to estimate the tangent elastic Young modulus at 50% of the maximum stress applied (E(tg50%)) of JG laboratory formulations over time. A sensitivity analysis procedure was also applied in order to understand the influence of each parameter in E(tg50%) estimation. It is shown that the data driven model is able to learn the complex relationship between E(tg50%) and its contributing factors. The obtained results, namely the relative importance of each parameter, were compared with the predictive models of elastic Young modulus at very small strain (E(0)) as well as the uniaxial compressive strength (Q(u)). The obtained results can help to understand the behavior of soil-cement mixtures over time and reduce the costs with laboratory formulations.

Clustering becomes difficult due to the increasing sparsity of such data, as well as the increasing difficulty in distinguishing distances between data points. In this paper we take a novel perspective on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data. Instead of attempting to avoid the curse of dimensionality by observing a lower-dimensional feature subspace, we embrace dimensionality by taking advantage of some inherently high-dimensional phenomena. More specifically, we show that hubness, i.e., the tendency of high-dimensional data to contain points (hubs) that frequently occur in k-nearest neighbor lists of other points, can be successfully exploited in clustering. We validate our hypothesis by proposing several hubness-based clustering algorithms and testing them on high-dimensional data. Experimental results demonstrate good performance of our algorithms in multiple settings, particularly in the presence of large quantities of noise.

The result of this test is obtained after a time period of about 45 days. The purpose of this study is to develop a data mining(DM) solution which makes diagnosis of tuberculosis as accurate as possible and helps deciding if it is reasonable to start tuberculosis treatment on suspected patients without waiting the exact medical test results or not. In this research, we proposed the use of Sugeno-type "adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system" (ANFIS) to predict the existence of mycobacterium tuberculosis. 667 different patient records which are obtained from a clinic are used in the entire process of this research. Each of the patient records consist of 30 separate input parameters. ANFIS model is generated by using 500 of those records. We also implemented a multilayer perceptron and PART model using the same data set. The ANFIS model classifies the instances with an RMSE of 18% whereas Multilayer Perceptron does the same classification with an RMSE of % 19 and PART algorithm with an RMSE of % 20. ANFIS is an accurate and reliable method when compared with Multilayer Perceptron and PART algorithms for classification of tuberculosis patients. This study has contribution on forecasting patients before the medical tests. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of the Guest Editor.

This technology has recently received vast attentions in the area of data mining since it can be applied to a wide variety of important risk management issues such as the detection of failures of computer devices from computer performance data, the detection of masqueraders/malicious executables from computer access logs, etc. In this paper we propose a new method of real-time change point detection employing the sequentially discounting normalized maximum likelihood coding (SDNML). Here the SDNML is a method for sequential data compression of a sequence, which we newly develop in this paper. It attains the least code length for the sequence and the effect of past data is gradually discounted as time goes on, hence the data compression can be done adaptively to nonstationary data sources. In our method, the SDNML is used to learn the mechanism of a time series, then a change-point score at each time is measured in terms of the SDNML code-length. We empirically demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over existing methods, such as the predictive-coding method and the hypothesis testing-method, in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency for artificial data sets. We further apply our method into real security issues called malware detection. We empirically demonstrate that our method is able to detect unseen security incidents at significantly early stages.

Yet, they have developed largely separate from each other resulting in different techniques being used in each discipline. It has been recognized that mining techniques developed for pattern recognition such as Clustering and Visualization can assist in designing data warehouse schema. However, a suitable methodology is required for the seamless integration of mining methods in the design of warehouse schema. In previous work, we presented a methodology that employs hierarchical clustering to derive a tree structure that can be used by a data warehouse designer to build a schema. We believe that, in order to strengthen the decision making process, there is a strong need for a method that automatically extracts knowledge present at different levels of abstraction from a warehouse. We demonstrate with examples how mining at different levels of a hierarchical warehouse schema can give new insights about the underlying data cluster which not only helps in building more meaningful dimensions and facts for data warehouse design but can also improve the decision making process.

Reducing the number of features in the dataset can have numerous positive implications, such as eliminating redundant or irrelevant features, decreasing development time and improving the performance of classification models. In this work, four filter-based feature selection techniques are compared using a wide variety of bioinformatics datasets. The first three filters, chi(2), Relief-F and Information Gain, are widely used techniques that are well known to many researchers and practitioners. The fourth filter, recently proposed by our research group and denoted TBFS-AUC (i.e., Threshold-Based Feature Selection technique with the AUC metric), is compared to these three commonly-used techniques using three different classification performance metrics. The empirical results demonstrate the strong performance of our technique.

In this paper we present a computationally efficient model-based split and merge clustering algorithm that incrementally finds model parameters and the number of clusters. Additionally, we attempt to provide insights into this problem and other data mining challenges that are encountered when clustering geospatial data. The basic algorithm we present is similar to the G-means and X-means algorithms; however, our proposed approach avoids certain limitations of these well-known clustering algorithms that are pertinent when dealing with geospatial data. We compare the performance of our approach with the G-means and X-means algorithms. Experimental evaluation on simulated data and on multispectral and hyperspectral remotely sensed image data demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Resource Provisioning Framework for MapReduce Jobs with Performance Goals	MIDDLEWARE 2011	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	12th ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Middleware Conference	DEC 12-16, 2011	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Int Federat Informat Process, Assoc Comp Machinery, Adv Comp Syst Assoc, Inst Superior Tecnico, INESC ID Lisboa, BBN Technol, Hewlett Packard Co, Innovat Makers				Many companies are increasingly using MapReduce for efficient large scale data processing such as personalized advertising, spam detection, and different data mining tasks. Cloud computing offers an attractive option for businesses to rent a suitable size Hadoop cluster, consume resources as a service, and pay only for resources that were utilized. One of the open questions in such environments is the amount of resources that a user should lease from the service provider. Often, a user targets specific performance goals and the application needs to complete data processing by a certain time deadline. However, currently, the task of estimating required resources to meet application performance goals is solely the users' responsibility. In this work, we introduce a novel framework and technique to address this problem and to offer a new resource sizing and provisioning service in MapReduce environments. For a MapReduce job that needs to be completed within a certain time, the job profile is built from the job past executions or by executing the application on a smaller data set using an automated profiling tool. Then, by applying scaling rules combined with a fast and efficient capacity planning model, we generate a set of resource provisioning options. Moreover, we design a model for estimating the impact of node failures on a job completion time to evaluate worst case scenarios. We validate the accuracy of our models using a set of realistic applications. The predicted completion times of generated resource provisioning options are within 10% of the measured times in our 66-node Hadoop cluster.

However, except for network visualization, terrorist network analysis remains primarily a manual process. Existing tools do not provide advanced structural analysis techniques that allow for the extraction of network knowledge from terrorist information. This paper presents the latest work on the CrimeFighter toolbox for counterterrorism. The toolbox is designed based on past experiences working with investigative data mining, mathematical modeling, social network analysis, graph theory, link analysis, knowledge management, and hypertext. CrimeFighter consists of a knowledge base and a set of tools that each support different activities in criminal investigation work: data acquisition tools supporting web harvesting, knowledge structuring tools supporting information analysis, explorer tools for searching and exploring the knowledge base, algorithms for data mining, algorithms for visualization, algorithms for social network analysis, etc.	[Wiil, Uffe Kock; Memon, Nasrullah; Gniadek, Jolanta] Univ So Denmark, Counterterrorism Res Lab, Maersk Mc Kinney Moller Inst, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark	Wiil, UK (reprint author), Univ So Denmark, Counterterrorism Res Lab, Maersk Mc Kinney Moller Inst, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.	ukwiil@mmmi.sdu.dk; memon@mmmi.sdu.dk; jogni07@student.sdu.dk					Alam M.

Visual data mining techniques attempt to include a human observer in the loop and leverage human perception for knowledge extraction. This is commonly allowed by performing a dimensionality reduction into a visually easy-to-perceive 2D space, which might result in significant loss of important spatial and topological information. To address this issue, this paper presents the design and implementation of a unique 3D visual data mining framework - CAVE-SOM. The CAVE-SOM system couples the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm with the immersive Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE). The main advantages of the CAVE-SOM system are: i) utilizing a 3D SOM to perform dimensionality reduction of large multi-dimensional datasets, ii) immersive visualization of the trained 3D SOM, iii) ability to explore and interact with the multi-dimensional data in an intuitive and natural way. The CAVE-SOM system uses multiple visualization modes to guide the visual data mining process, for instance the data histograms, U-matrix, connections, separations, uniqueness and the input space view. The implemented CAVE-SOM framework was validated on several benchmark problems and then successfully applied to analysis of wind-power generation data. The knowledge extracted using the CAVE-SOM system can be used for further informed decision making and machine learning.

This article introduces a new hypercube division-based (HDD) algorithm for supervised discretisation. The algorithm considers the distribution of both class and continuous attributes and the underlying correlation structure in the data set. It tries to find a minimal set of cut points, which divides the continuous attribute space into a finite number of hypercubes, and the objects within each hypercube belong to the same decision class. Finally, tests are performed on seven mix-mode data sets, and the C5.0 algorithm is used to generate classification rules from the discretised data. Compared with the other three well-known discretisation algorithms, the HDD algorithm can generate a better discretisation scheme, which improves the accuracy of classification and reduces the number of classification rules.

Many approaches have been proposed for mining frequent itemsets from a large database, but a large number of frequent itemsets may be discovered. In order to present users fewer but more important patterns, researchers are interested in discovering frequent closed itemsets which is a well-known complete and condensed representation of frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering frequent closed itemsets over a data stream. The previous approaches need to do a large number of searching operations and computations to maintain the closed itemsets when a transaction is added or deleted. Our approach only performs few intersection operations on the transaction and the closed itemsets related to the transaction without doing any searching operation on the previous closed itemsets. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the previous approaches.

It addresses potential problems with user model selection and evaluation, that are often clear to expert modelers, but are not obvious for others. These problems are frequently a result of a falsely straightforward application of statistics to user modeling (e.g. over-reliance on model fit metrics). In such cases, absolute trust in arguably shallow model accuracy measures could lead to selecting models that are hard-to-interpret, less meaningful, over-fit, and less generalizable. We offer a list of questions to consider in order to avoid these modeling pitfalls. Each of the listed questions is backed by an illustrative example based on the user modeling approach called Performance Factors Analysis (PFA) [9].

More extensions with weight constraints have been proposed such as mining weighted association rules, weighted sequential patterns, weighted closed patterns, frequent patterns with dynamic weights, weighted graphs, weighted sub-trees or sub structures, and so on. In previous approach of weighted frequent sequential pattern mining, weighted supports of sequential patterns are exactly matched to prune weighted infrequent sequential patterns. However, in the noisy environment, the small change in weights or supports of items affects the result sets seriously. This may make the weighted sequential patterns less useful in the noisy environment. In this paper, we propose the robust concept of mining weighted approximate sequential patterns. Based on the framework of weight based sequential pattern mining, an approximate factor is defined to relax the requirement for exact equality between weighted supports of sequential patterns and a minimum threshold. After then, we address the concept of mining weighted approximate sequential frequent patterns to find important sequential patterns with/without the noisy data. We analyze the characteristics of weighted approximate sequential patterns and run extensive performance tests.

The approach we propose is based on two systems development methods-the Unified Process (UP) from Software Engineering and the U model from HCI.

First, the concept of k-density of an object is presented and the similar density series (SDS) of the object is established based on the changes of the k-density and the neighbors k-densities of the object. Second, the average series cost (ASC) of the object is obtained based on the weighted sum of the distance between the two adjacent objects in SDS of the object. Finally, the density-similarity-neighbor-based outlier factor (DSNOF) of the object is calculated by using both the ASC of the object and the ASC of k-distance neighbors of the object, and the degree of the object being an outlier is indicated by the DSNOF. The experiments are performed on synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experiments results verify that the proposed algorithm has higher quality of outlier mining and do not increase the algorithm complexity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Advanced Information Technology - Support of Improved Personalized Therapy of Speech Disorders	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						personalized therapy; data mining; classification; clustering; associations rules		One of the key challenges of the Sustainable Development Strategy adopted by the European Council in 2006 is related to public health whose general objective envisages a good level of public health. One of the specific targets includes better treatments of diseases. It is true that there are affections which by their nature do not endanger the life of a person, however they may have a negative impact on her/his life standard. Various language or speech disorders are part of this category, but if they are discovered and treated in due time, they can be often corrected. The difficulty for researchers and therapists is to identify those children who have disorders that show a wide range of issues that cannot be solved spontaneously or which may lead to further significant deficiencies. Information technology in the latest years was used by specialists in order to assist and supervise speech disorder therapy. Consequently they have collected a considerable volume of data about the personal or familial anamnesis, regarding various disorders or regarding the process of personalized therapies. These data can be used in data mining processes that aim to discover interesting patterns which can help the design and adaptation of different therapies in order to obtain the best results in conditions of maximum efficiency. The aim of this paper is to present the Logo-DM system. This is a data mining system that can be associated with TERAPERS system in order to use the data from its database as a source for analysis and to provide new information based on an improved system of therapy. Through the use of appropriate techniques of data mining Logo-DM realizes predictions on the evolution and the final status of patients undergoing therapy and enriches the knowledge data of expert system embedded in TERAPERS.

J	Li, DC; Fang, YH; Fang, YMF				Li, Der-Chiang; Fang, Yao-Hwei; Fang, Y. M. Frank			The data complexity index to construct an efficient cross-validation method	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Binary classification problem; Cross-validation; Data complexity	NEURAL-NETWORKS; NOISY DATA; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Cross-validation is a widely used model evaluation method in data mining applications. However, it usually takes a lot of effort to determine the appropriate parameter values, such as training data size and the number of experiment runs, to implement a validated evaluation. This study develops an efficient cross-validation method called Complexity-based Efficient (CBE) cross-validation for binary classification problems. CBE cross-validation establishes a complexity index, called the CBE index, by exploring the geometric structure and noise of data. The CBE index is used to calculate the optimal training data size and the number of experiment runs to reduce model evaluation time when dealing with computationally expensive classification data sets. A simulated and three real data sets are employed to validate the performance of the proposed method in the study, while the validation methods compared are repeated random sub-sampling validation and K-fold cross-validation. The results show that CBE cross-validation, repeated random sub-sampling validation and K-fold cross-validation have similar validation performance, except that the training time required for CBE cross-validation is indeed lower than that for the other two methods.

J	Liu, HY; Lin, FZ; He, J; Cai, YJ				Liu, Hongyan; Lin, Fangzhou; He, Jun; Cai, Yunjue			New approach for the sequential pattern mining of high-dimensional sequence databases	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sequential pattern mining; High-dimensional database; Data mining		In this paper a new algorithm, the Top-Down mining of Sequential patterns (TD-Seq), for mining sequential patterns from high-dimensional stock sequence databases is presented. Existing algorithms are limited by efficiency problems in dealing with high-dimensional sequence databases. To address this problem, a two-phase mining method is proposed, in which a top-down transposition-based searching strategy as well as a new support counting method are exploited.

In this study we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for the prediction of a Type-2 Diabetic Patient. We aim to investigate how the diabetes incidents are affected by patients' characteristics and measurements. Efficient predictive modeling is required for medical researchers and practitioners. This study proposes Hybrid Prediction Model (HPM) which uses Simple K-means clustering algorithm aimed at validating chosen class label of given data (incorrectly classified instances are removed, i.e. pattern extracted from original data) and subsequently applying the classification algorithm to the result set. C4.5 algorithm is used to build the final classifier model by using the k-fold cross-validation method. The Pima Indians diabetes data was obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository datasets. A wide range of different classification methods have been applied previously by various researchers in order to find the best performing algorithm on this dataset. The accuracies achieved have been in the range of 59.4-84.05%. However the proposed HPM obtained a classification accuracy of 92.38%. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, sensitivity and specificity performance measures that are used commonly in medical classification studies were used.

Efficient Mining of Large Maximal Bicliques from 3D Symmetric Adjacency Matrix	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; maximal bicliques; algorithms; mining methods	CLOSED ITEMSETS; ALGORITHMS; GENERATION; PATTERNS	In this paper, we address the problem of mining large maximal bicliques from a three-dimensional Boolean symmetric adjacency matrix. We propose CubeMiner-MBC algorithm which enumerates all the maximal bicliques satisfying the user-specified size constraints. Our algorithm enumerates all bicliques with less memory in depth first manner and does not store the previously computed patterns in the main memory for duplicate detection. To efficiently prune duplicate patterns, we have proposed a subtree pruning technique which reduces the total number of nodes that are processed and also reduces the total number of duplicate patterns that are generated. We have also incorporated several optimizations for efficient cutter generation and closure checking. Experiments involving several synthetic data sets show that our algorithm takes less running time than CubeMiner algorithm.

As an essential and significant constituent of data mining, classification has also become vital and a sought-after-option for research. Over the years, as various soft computing tools have been proven to be more complimentary than competitive, many hybrid approaches have evolved for pattern classification. A major thrust has always been there to apply hybrid approaches involving artificial neural network as the main tool for pattern classification. Here, one such hybrid approach is presented with application of Rough set philosophy to unsupervised artificial neural network (UANN) based pattern classifier. This enhances the performance of the classifier and makes it more suitable for real time classification applications dealing with large and unlabeled data. The idea presented here discusses with possibility and application of various Rough set based approaches at different levels of implementation of such classifier. The concluding section presents the results achieved for data of two case studies related to face recognition and mobile handoff prediction.

EXAMPLE FEATURING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE TIME VARIABLES IN CAR DRIVING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Data analysis; data mining; multivariate statistics; multiple correspondence analysis; fuzzy coding; car driving	FUZZY-SETS; METHODOLOGY; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS	This paper explains the pivotal part played by space windowing within Preliminary Data Analysis originating from MultiFactor and MultiVariate databases (PDA-MFMV). The explanation is based on the general case of a database featuring a hyperparallelepipedic structure in which the directions correspond to the factors and where the measurement variables may be either quantitative or qualitative, temporal or non-temporal, and objective or subjective. The space windowing (SW) approach hereby described in this article is less information reducing than most basic summarizing procedures without windowing using usual statistical indicators. First, the data in each cell of the hyperparallelepiped is transformed into membership values to be averaged over factors, such as time or individuals. Then, several graphic techniques can be made use of in order to investigate membership values. In this paper, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) has been chosen. A didactic example concerning car driving with four factors and 11 time variables (one being qualitative) is used in order to illustrate the widespread use of the "SW/MCA" pair, fuzzy time windowing being also considered. From the results yielded by this pair, some suggestions about statistical tests are made aiming at a more explanatory analysis. The discussion then weighs out the pros and cons of resorting to space windowing to perform a PDA-MFMV.

A Taxonomy of Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithms	ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS			English	Article						Algorithms; Management; Performance; Data mining; Web usage mining; sequential patterns; frequent patterns; web log; pattern growth; apriori property; prediction; early pruning; sequence mining; lattice theory; lexicographic order; tree projection; recommender systems; association rules	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FREQUENT SEQUENCES	Owing to important applications such as mining web page traversal sequences, many algorithms have been introduced in the area of sequential pattern mining over the last decade, most of which have also been modified to support concise representations like closed, maximal, incremental or hierarchical sequences. This article presents a taxonomy of sequential pattern-mining techniques in the literature with web usage mining as an application. This article investigates these algorithms by introducing a taxonomy for classifying sequential pattern-mining algorithms based on important key features supported by the techniques. This classification aims at enhancing understanding of sequential pattern-mining problems, current status of provided solutions, and direction of research in this area. This article also attempts to provide a comparative performance analysis of many of the key techniques and discusses theoretical aspects of the categories in the taxonomy.

The tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR)-like superfamily of proteins in Leishmania spp., as revealed by multi-relational data mining	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Multi-relational data mining; Hidden Markov models; Viterbi algorithm; Tetratricopeptide repeat motif; Leishmania proteins	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SEQUENCES; TOOL; ALIGNMENT; FAMILY; DOMAIN; MOTIF; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; DATABASES	Protein sequence analysis tasks are multi-relational problems suitable for multi-relational data mining (MRDM). Proteins containing tetratricopeptide (TPR), pentatricopeptide (PPR) and half-a-TPR (HAT) repeats comprise the TPR-like superfamily in which we have applied MRDM methods (relational association rule discovery and probabilistic relational models) with hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Viterbi algorithm (VA) in genome databases of pathogenic protozoa Leishmania. Such integrated MRDM/HMM/VA approach seeks to capture as much model information as possible in the pattern matching heuristic, without resorting to more standard motif discovery methods (Pfam, SMART, SUPERFAMILY) and it has the advantage of incorporation of optimized profiles, score offsets and distribution to compute probability, as a more recently reported tool (TPRpred) in order to take in account the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem and to be widely distributed along the sequences. Here we compare such currently available resources with our approach (MRDM/HMM/VA) to highlight that the latter performs best into the TPR-like superfamily assignment and it might be applied to other sequence analysis problems in such a way that it contributes to tight-fit motif discoveries and a better probability that a given target sequence is, indeed, a target motif-containing protein.

J	Ha, SH				Ha, Sung Ho			Behavioral assessment of recoverable credit of retailer's customers	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Credit recovery; Credit prediction; Delinquency management; Kohonen network; Survival analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DATA MINING APPROACH; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SCORING MODELS; SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; RISK; LOANS	The increasing rate of late payments by credit card customers, which are caused by the recent economic downturn, is causing not only reduced profit margins but also significant sales losses for retail companies. Under pressure to increase revenues, credit prediction should be a part of customer delinquency management. In this study, a credit prediction model has been developed to manage delinquents holding retail credit cards. The hybrid model combines a Kohonen network and a Cox's proportional hazard model. A Kohonen network is used to cluster credit delinquents into homogeneous groups. A Cox's hazard model is used to analyze repayment patterns of delinquents in each group. The model estimates the expected time of credit recovery from delinquents. This model's prediction accuracy scored above 93%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Then k-nearest neighbor classifier (kNN) and Gaussian mixture model are used to classify the any ran species based on another chosen feature set A series of experiments woe conducted to measure the outcome performance of the pin posed work. Experimental insults exhibit. that the recognition rate of k-nearest neighbor classifier using GMM non-anuran detection method with two different feature sets can achieve up to 80 42%. The effectiveness of the proposed identification system for anuran vocalizations that uses the combination with anuran detection and classification is thus verified.

A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR MINING FUZZY HIGH UTILITY ITEMSETS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Utility mining; High utility itemset; Fuzzy sets theory; Fuzzy data mining	MODEL; SETS	Utility mining is to find the itemsets in a transaction database with high. utility values like profits Although a number of algorithms on high utility Mining have been proposed, they did not reflect the fuzzy degree of quantity and profit level for mined high utility itemsets, which are essential for decision making in various applications like stock control and sales analysis. In this paper, we explore to apply fuzzy sets theory to the utility 7117711119 problem and propose a novel method, namely FHUI (Fuzzy h Utility Itemsets)-Mine, for mining fuzzy high utility itemsets In addition to reflecting the fuzzy degree for quantity and profit regions of high utility itemsets, FHUI-Mine also provides a fuzzy threshold range that may include itemsets with profits slightly less than the designated threshold value To prove the feasibility of HMI-Aline, it was compared with the well-known Two-Phase algorithm through experimental evaluation The results show that FHUI-Mine delivers higher mining capability since it can not, only 1111,71,C all high utility itemsets found by Two-Phase algorithm but, also discover additional itemsets that are potentially high utility ones	[Lai, Cheng-Ping; Chung, Pau-Choo] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Inst Comp & Commun Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Tseng, Vincent S.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Lai, Cheng-Ping] Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Med Informat, Tainan 704, Taiwan	Lai, CP (reprint author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Inst Comp & Commun Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

J	Li, ST; Kuo, SC; Tsai, FC				Li, Sheng-Tun; Kuo, Shu-Ching; Tsai, Fu-Ching			An intelligent decision-support model using FSOM and rule extraction for crime prevention	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intelligent decision support; Crime prevention; Fuzzy self-organizing map network; Temporal rule extraction	NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUZZY; SOFTWARE; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; TIME; TRENDS; RATES; MAPS	In the recent era of increasing volume crimes, crime prevention is now one of the most important global issues, along with the great concern of strengthening public security. Government and community officials are making an all-out effort to improve the effectiveness of crime prevention. Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed disciplines of behavior science and statistics. Recently, the data mining approach has been shown to be a proactive decision-support tool in predicting and preventing crime. However its effectiveness is often limited due to different natures of crime data, such as linguistic crime data evolving over time. In this paper, we propose a framework of intelligent decision-support model based on a fuzzy self-organizing map (FSOM) network to detect and analyze crime trend patterns from temporal crime activity data. In addition, a rule extraction algorithm is employed to uncover hidden causal-effect knowledge and reveal the shift around effect. In contrast to most present crime related studies, we target a non-Western real-world case, i.e. the National Police Agency (NPA) in Taiwan. The resultant model can support police managers in assessing more appropriate law enforcement strategies, as well as improving the use of police duty deployment for crime prevention.

J	Luo, DJ; Huang, H; Ding, C; Nie, FP				Luo, Dijun; Huang, Heng; Ding, Chris; Nie, Feiping			On the eigenvectors of p-Laplacian	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery from Database	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN			p-Laplacian; Graph Laplacian; Clustering; Cheeger cut; Normalized cut	GRAPHS; MODELS	Spectral analysis approaches have been actively studied in machine learning and data mining areas, due to their generality, efficiency, and rich theoretical foundations. As a natural non-linear generalization of Graph Laplacian, p-Laplacian has recently been proposed, which interpolates between a relaxation of normalized cut and the Cheeger cut. However, the relaxation can only be applied to two-class cases. In this paper, we propose full eigenvector analysis of p-Laplacian and obtain a natural global embedding for multi-class clustering problems, instead of using greedy search strategy implemented by previous researchers. An efficient gradient descend optimization approach is introduced to obtain the p-Laplacian embedding space, which is guaranteed to converge to feasible local solutions. Empirical results suggest that the greedy search method often fails in many real-world applications with non-trivial data structures, but our approach consistently gets robust clustering results. Visualizations of experimental results also indicate our embedding space preserves the local smooth manifold structures existing in real-world data.

The changes are made to the network in the form of upgrades such as software or hardware upgrades, new network or service features and network configuration changes. It is crucial to monitor the network when upgrades are made because they can have a significant impact on network performance and if not monitored may lead to unexpected consequences in operational networks. This can be achieved manually for a small number of devices, but does not scale to large networks with hundreds or thousands of routers and extremely large number of different upgrades made on a regular basis. In this paper, we design and implement a novel infrastructure MERCURY for detecting the impact of network upgrades (or triggers) on performance. MERCURY extracts interesting triggers from a large number of network maintenance activities. It then identifies behavior changes in network performance caused by the triggers. It uses statistical rule mining and network configuration to identify commonality across the behavior changes. We systematically evaluate MERCURY using data collected at a large tier-1 ISP network. By comparing to operational practice, we show that MERCURY is able to capture the interesting triggers and behavior changes induced by the triggers. In some cases, MERCURY also discovers previously unknown network behaviors demonstrating the effectiveness in identifying network conditions flying under the radar.

Hence, Anti-corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) in the Republic of Korea has constructed the online petition portal system named e-People. In addition, the nation's Open Innovation through e-People has gained increasing attention. That is because e-People can be applied for the virtual space where citizens participate in improving the national law and policy by simply filing petitions to e-People as the voice of the nation. However, currently there are problems and challenging issues to be solved until e-People can function as the virtual space for the nation's Open Innovation based on petitions collected from citizens. First, there is no objective and systematic method for analyzing a large number of petitions filed to e-People without a lot of manual works of petition inspectors. Second, e-People is required to forecast the trend of petitions filed to e-People more accurately and quickly than petition inspectors for making a better decision on the national law and policy strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the framework of applying text and data mining techniques not only to analyze a large number of petitions filed to e-People but also to predict the trend of petitions. In detail, we apply text mining techniques to unstructured data of petitions to elicit keywords from petitions and identify groups of petitions with the elicited keywords. Moreover, we apply data mining techniques to structured data of the identified petition groups on purpose to forecast the trend of petitions. Our approach based on applying text and data mining techniques decreases time-consuming manual works on reading and classifying a large number of petitions, and contributes to increasing accuracy in evaluating the trend of petitions. Eventually, it helps petition inspectors to give more attention on detecting and tracking important groups of petitions that possibly grow as nationwide problems. Further, the petitions ordered by their petition groups' trend values can be used as the baseline for making a better decision on the national law and policy strategy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ARNN is modified from multi-layered perceptron and back-propagation algorithm. The number of association rules is controlled by the rule threshold and the number of hidden units. To explore the possibility of producing useful and meaningful association rules using ARNN, our study uses the practical cosmetics transaction data. The results show (1) the predicted output values of ARNN are close to their desired confidence values, (2) reducing the number of hidden units of ARNN can inhibit the generation of association rules with low support, and (3) ARNN has the ability of discovering the cohesion and expansion commodities and this information could be used to make pricing strategy. Therefore, ARNN could be a promising alternative approach for association analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper shows how aspect-oriented programming techniques support some tasks whose implementation using conventional object-oriented programming would be extremely time-consuming and error-prone. In particular, we have successfully employed aspects in TMiner to evaluate and monitor the I/O performance of alternative data mining techniques. Without having to modify the source code of the system under analysis, aspects provide an unintrusive mechanism to perform this kind of performance analysis. In fact, aspects let us probe a system implementation so that we can identify potential bottlenecks, detect redundant computations, and characterize system behavior + lessons learned during the development of TMiner.

Currently, SOM (self-organizing maps) is known as one of the most popular neural networks applied for gene clustering. However, SOM is sensitive to the initialization of neurons' weights. In this case, biologists may need to spend a lot of time in repeating experiments until they obtain a satisfactory clustering result. In this paper, we apply QBSOM (query-based SUM) to tackle the drawbacks of SOM. We have tested the proposed method by several kinds of real gene expression data. Experimental results show that QBSOM is superior to SOM in not only the time consumed but also the result obtained. Considering the gene clustering result of YF (yeast full) dataset, QBSOM yields 17% less in MSE (mean-square-error) and 68% less in computation cost compared with SOM. Our experiments also indicate that QBSOM is particularly adaptive for clustering high dimensional data such as the gene expression data. It is better than SUM for system convergence.

The model defines the four components of unstructured data including: basic attributes, semantic characteristics, low-level features and raw data on its four facets, and the relations between these components. The internal implementation structure of the model and the data query language are designed and briefly introduced. This model provides a unified, integrated and associated description for different kinds of unstructured data, and supports intelligent data services such as associated retrieval and data mining. An example is given to demonstrate how to use the model for describing and manipulating data from a sample video base.

AN EFFICIENT MODEL FOR ENHANCING TEXT CATEGORIZATION USING SENTENCE SEMANTICS	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; text categorization; concept-based model		Most of text categorization techniques are based on word and/or phrase analysis of the text. Statistical analysis of a term frequency captures the importance of the term within a document only. However, two terms can have the same frequency in there documents, but one term contributes more to the meaning of its sentences than the other term. Thus, the underlying model should identify terms that capture the semantics of text. In this case, the model can capture terms that present the concepts of the sentence, which leads to discovering the topic of the document. A new concept-based model that analyzes terms on the sentence, document, and corpus levels rather than the traditional analysis of document only is introduced. The concept-based model can effectively discriminate between nonimportant terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the concepts that represent the sentence meaning. A set of experiments using the proposed concept-based model on different datasets in text categorization is conducted in comparison with the traditional models. The results demonstrate the substantial enhancement of the categorization quality using the sentence-based, document-based and corpus-based concept analysis.

Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, as the name implies, makes use of both unlabeled data and such domain knowledge as pairwise constraints which are easily available in, many practical applications. Pairwise constraints specify whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class (must-link constraints) or different classes (cannot-link constraints). In, this paper, an instance-level based discriminative semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method with chunklets named IDSDRC is proposed, which aims to simultaneously use both instance-level and chunklet-level pairwise constraints together with unlabeled data for dimensionality reduction. The instance-level pairwise constraints intend to exploit discrimination information, while the chunklets manage to discover clustering information. Meanwhile, unlabeled data are utilized to preserve the inherent geometrical structure of high-dimensional sample data. The proposed IDSDRC algorithm has a closed form solution. Experimental results on two standard face databases for face recognition and face clustering show that IDSDRC is efficient and superior to several established semi-supervised dimensionality reduction methods.

A clustering based hybrid system for biomarker selection and sample classification of mass spectrometry data	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Clustering; Mass spectrometry; Hybrid algorithm; Feature selection; Classification	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; PROTEOMIC PATTERNS; ENSEMBLE METHODS; GA/KNN METHOD; CANCER; SERUM; MICROARRAY; DISCOVERY; SPECTRA	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has been established as a standard way for biomarker discovery and early detection of disease from the proteome level. However, the data generated by MS technology are noisy, have a lot of redundancy, and most importantly have low sample-to-dimension ratio. Therefore, successful analysis of MS data heavily relies on the algorithmic and data mining techniques used to extract information. In this paper, we briefly discuss some of the commonly used algorithms applied to mass-to-charge (m/z) feature selection, and propose a k-means clustering based hybrid algorithm to address the high-dimension and high-correlation issues associated with this task. Our k-means clustering based hybrid algorithm incorporates the advantages of both filter- and wrapper-based feature selection algorithms. A special iterative procedure is introduced to overcome the instability of k-means clustering and genetic algorithm. By comparing the proposed hybrid system with several popular m/z feature selection algorithms using 10 different classifiers, we show that the proposed algorithm is able to select m/z features with lower correlation while achieving higher sample classification accuracies. The m/z feature selection results also indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm is very stable despite its stochastic nature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the characteristics of the CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) data, a framework for data preparation is developed based on object-oriented programming concepts. Training sets are built from data recorded in 98 crash simulations that adhere to FMVSS208, the America occupant crash protection testing standard. Relationship between design parameters and system effectiveness is implied in these data sets. Decision tree using C4.5 algorithm and attribute selection method based on attribute's estimated importance are introduced to perform data mining on the building of training sets. The result yielded by data mining endows us with a deeper insight into the interrelations between the key design parameters and the performance of the occupant restraint system in crash simulations. Finally, the learned rules are tested on the real crash simulation data sets. The result of the testing shows that these rules are proper, and can been used as a guidance for the design of the occupant restraint system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PPDM algorithms are challenging to develop and computationally intensive to execute. Developers need convenient abstractions to simplify the engineering of PPDM applications. The individual parties involved in the data mining process need a way to bring high-performance, parallel computers to bear on the computationally intensive parts of the PPDM tasks. This paper discusses APHID (Architecture for Private and High-performance Integrated Data mining), a practical architecture and software framework for developing and executing large scale PPDM applications. At one tier, the system supports simplified use of cluster and grid resources, and at another tier, the system abstracts communication for easy PPDM algorithm development. This paper offers a detailed analysis of the challenges in developing PPDM algorithms with existing frameworks, and motivates the design of a new infrastructure based on these challenges.

J	Horvath, T; Ramon, J				Horvath, Tamas; Ramon, Jan			Efficient frequent connected subgraph mining in graphs of bounded tree-width	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Listing algorithms; Frequent patterns; Tree-width; Graph mining; Data mining	PARTIAL K-TREES; ISOMORPHISM; TREEWIDTH; ALGORITHMS; COMPLEXITY; 3-TREES	The frequent connected subgraph mining problem, i.e., the problem of listing all connected graphs that are subgraph isomorphic to at least a certain number of transaction graphs of a database, cannot be solved in output polynomial time in the general case. If, however, the transaction graphs are restricted to forests then the problem becomes tractable. In this paper we generalize the positive result on forests to graphs of bounded tree-width. In particular, we show that for this class of transaction graphs, frequent connected subgraphs can be listed in incremental polynomial time. Since subgraph isomorphism remains NP-complete for bounded tree-width graphs, the positive complexity result of this paper shows that efficient frequent pattern mining is possible even for computationally hard pattern matching operators.

The algorithm is based on genetic programming (GP) extended with the ensemble paradigm. GP ensemble is particularly suitable for distributed intrusion detection because it allows to build a network profile by combining different classifiers that together provide complementary information. The main novelty of the algorithm is that data is distributed across multiple autonomous sites and the learner component acquires useful knowledge from this data in a cooperative way. The network profile is then used to predict abnormal behavior. Experiments on the KDD Cup 1999 Data show the capability of genetic programming in successfully dealing with the problem of intrusion detection on distributed data.

Extraction of execution patterns In Multi-Agent Systems	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						agent oriented software engineering; data mining; patterns; multi-agent systems; traces		Multi-agent executions become a difficult to follow task when there are lots of agents working concurrently. Programmers need to know if the system is working according to their expectations. In such situations, debugging tools are useful to follow the execution traces, but are not enough for such complex systems. An alternative solution is to save the execution traces (logs) in data warehouses, where they will be analysed through data mining techniques and queries. These techniques offer the programmer a summary of the execution parameters and even the discovery of unexpected patterns.

By aggregating the weights of events relating two individuals, we can determine the strength of association between them. We conduct extensive experimentation to investigate both the efficacy of the proposed model as well as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results on three real-life spatio-temporal datasets cross-validate each other, lending greater confidence on the reliability of our proposed model.

In this article, we present an extension of classical clustering schemes by local matrix adaptation, which allows a better representation of data by means of clusters with an arbitrary spherical shape. Unlike previous proposals, the method is derived from a global cost function. The focus of this article is to demonstrate the applicability of this matrix clustering scheme to low-dimensional data embedding for data inspection. The proposed method is based on matrix learning for neural gas and manifold charting. This provides an explicit mapping of a given high-dimensional data space to low dimensionality. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method for data inspection and manifold visualization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Baralis, E; Cerquitelli, T; Chiusano, S				Baralis, Elena; Cerquitelli, Tania; Chiusano, Silvia			Constrained Itemset Mining on a Sequence of Incoming Data Blocks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							PERSPECTIVE	Many real-life databases are updated by means of incoming business information. In these databases (e.g., transactional data from large retail chains, call-detail records), the content evolves through periodical insertions (or deletions) of data blocks. Since data evolve over time, algorithms have to be devised to incrementally update data mining models. This paper presents a novel index, called I-Forest, to support itemset mining on incoming data blocks, where new blocks are inserted periodically, or old blocks are discarded. The I-Forest structure provides a complete data representation and allows different kind of analyses (e.g., investigate quarterly data), besides supporting user-defined time and support constraints. The I-Forest index has been implemented into the PostgreSQL open source DBMS and exploits its physical level access methods. Experiments, run for both sparse and dense data distributions, show the effectiveness of the I-Forest-based approach to perform itemset mining with both time and support constraints. The execution time of the I-Forest-based itemset mining technique is often faster than the Prefix-Tree algorithm accessing static data on flat files. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Cheng, H; Hua, KA; Yu, N				Cheng, Hao; Hua, Kien A.; Yu, Ning			An automatic feature generation approach to multiple instance learning and its applications to image databases	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Image categorization; Multiple-instance learning; Instance-level clustering; Category pattern mining; Pattern feature generation; Bag-pattern distance; Multi-class classification		Automatic content-based image categorization is a challenging research topic and has many practical applications. Images are usually represented as bags of feature vectors, and the categorization problem is studied in the Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) framework. In this paper, we propose a novel learning technique which transforms the MIL problem into a standard supervised learning problem by defining a feature vector for each image bag. Specifically, the feature vectors of the image bags are grouped into clusters and each cluster is given a label. Using these labels, each instance of an image bag can be replaced by a corresponding label to obtain a bag of cluster labels. Data mining can then be employed to uncover common label patterns for each image category. These label patterns are converted into bags of feature vectors; and they are used to transform each image bag in the data set into a feature vector such that each vector element is the distance of the image bag to a distinct pattern bag. With this new image representation, standard supervised learning algorithms can be applied to classify the images into the pre-defined categories. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique in categorization accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

An MPEG-2 to H.264 Video Transcoder in the Baseline Profile	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; H.264; inter prediction; MPEG-2; video transcoding		Based on our previous efforts, we introduce in this letter a high-efficient MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoder for the baseline profile in the spatial domain. Machine learning tools are used to exploit the correlation between the macroblock (MB) decision of the H.264 video format and the distribution of the motion compensated residual in MPEG-2. Moreover, a dynamic motion estimation technique is also proposed to further speed-up the decision process. Finally, we go a step further on our previous research efforts by combining the two aforementioned speed-up approaches. Our simulation results over more than 40 sequences at common intermediate format and quarter common intermediate format resolutions show that our proposal outperforms the MB mode selection of the rate-distortion optimization option of the H.264 encoder process by reducing the computational requirements by up to 90%, while maintaining the same coding efficiency. Finally, we conduct a comparative study of our approach with the most relevant fast inter-prediction methods for MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoder recently reported in the literature.

In this paper, we describe a linear programming formulation for the data distribution problem on grids. Furthermore, a heuristic method, named Heuristic Data Distribution Scheme (HDDS), is proposed to solve this problem. We implement two types of data mining applications, Association Rule Mining and Decision Tree Construction, and conduct experiments on grid testbeds. Experimental results show that data mining programs using the proposed HDDS to distribute data could execute more efficiently than traditional schemes could.

Mining@home: toward a public-resource computing framework for distributed data mining	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						public-resource computing; desktop grids; data mining; closed frequent itemsets; peer-to-peer computing	NETWORKS	Several classes of scientific and commercial applications require the execution of a large number of independent tasks. One highly successful and low-cost mechanism for acquiring the necessary computing power for these applications is the 'public-resource computing', or 'desktop Grid' paradigm, which exploits the computational power of private computers. So far, this paradigm has not been applied to data mining applications for two main reasons. First, it is not straightforward to decompose a data mining algorithm into truly independent sub-tasks. Second, the large volume of the involved data makes it difficult to handle the communication costs of a parallel paradigm. This paper introduces a general framework for distributed data mining applications called Mining@home. In particular, we focus on one of the main data mining problems: the extraction of closed frequent itemsets from transactional databases. We show that it is possible to decompose this problem into independent tasks, which however need to share a large volume of the data. We thus introduce a data-intensive computing network, which adopts a P2P topology based on super peers with caching capabilities, aiming to support the dissemination of large amounts of information. Finally, we evaluate the execution of a pattern extraction task on such network. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Semantic-based pruning of redundant and uninteresting frequent geographic patterns	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Semantic data mining; Spatial association rules; Closed sets	SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES; COLOCATION PATTERNS; KNOWLEDGE	In geographic association rule mining many patterns are either redundant or contain well known geographic domain associations explicitly represented in knowledge resources such as geographic database schemas and geo-ontologies. Existing spatial association rule mining algorithms are Apriori-like, and therefore generate a large amount of redundant patterns. For non-spatial data, the closed frequent pattern mining technique has been introduced to remove redundant patterns. This approach, however, does not warrant the elimination of both redundant and well known geographic dependences when mining geographic databases. This paper presents a novel method for pruning both redundant and well known geographic dependences, by pushing semantics into the pattern mining task. Experiments with real geographic databases have demonstrated a significant reduction of the total amount of patterns and the efficiency of the method.

What is more important is that accuracy in carrying out triage matters greatly in terms of medical quality. patient satisfaction and life security. As the numbers of patients in emergency departments increase, learning from the examples of abnormal diagnosis of triage in order to make modifications, constitutes a significant issue. The researcher worked with the Emergency Department of a Taiwan Medical Center to build a model to view abnormal diagnoses in the database from the establishment of a now path and the selection of parameters for sampling. Data on patients were derived from the database. Two-stage cluster analysis (Ward's method and K-means) and decision tree analysis were made on 501 abnormal diagnoses in an emergency department. It was found that nursing personnel make more frequent triage diagnoses than physicians do. Most of abnormal diagnoses stems from patients rather than the diagnosis on the day. Pulse and temperature have greater distinction. The researcher proposes seven correlation laws based on confidence and support proportions, derived from sample point conforming to correlation law that abnormal diagnosis is most likely in diseases of pneumonia and cirrhosis, etc. Through data mining technology, the researcher's triage expert system is written in simulation. After periodic updates, it can improve the system and education training without the influence of the subjective factor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, Q; Yan, Q; Deng, HJ; Wang, JL				Wu, Qiong; Yan, Qin; Deng, Haojiang; Wang, Jinlin			A combination of data mining method with decision trees building for Speech/Music discrimination	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Real-time discrimination; Optimal feature subset; Hierarchical oblique decision tree; State transform strategy	CLASSIFICATION	Nowadays the applications in multimedia domain require that the Speech/Music classifier has many other merits in addition to the accuracy, such as short-time delay and low complexity. Here, we endeavor to form a Speech/Music classifier by using different data mining methods. The main contributions of this paper are to obtain a system by analyzing the inherent validity of diverse features extracted from the audio, building a hierarchical structure of oblique decision trees (HODT) to maintain optimal performances, and applying a novel context-based state transform (ST) strategy to refine the classification results. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by a set of 5-11 min 702 audio files, which are made from 54 speech or music files according to different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels and diverse noise types. The experiment results show that our proposed classifier outperforms AMR-WB+ by achieving 97.9% and 95.9% in classification rate at the 10 ms frame level in pure and high SNR (> = 20 dB) environment, respectively. The post-processing ST strategy further enhances the system performance, particularly at low SNR circumstances (10 dB), with 5.6% tip in the accuracy rate. In addition, the complexity of the proposed system is lower than IWMOPS which make it easily adaptable to many scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kaya, M				Kaya, Mehmet			Automated extraction of extended structured motifs using multi-objective genetic algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Motif discovery; Data mining; Multi-objective genetic algorithm	FACTOR-BINDING SITES; NONCODING SEQUENCES; DISCOVERY; DNA	A structured motif is defined as a collection of highly conserved simple motifs with pre-specified sizes and gaps between them. In structured motif extraction, while all simple motifs are unknown, all gap ranges are known earlier. In this paper, we propose a novel method using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to extract automatically extended structured motifs in which all simple motifs and gap ranges are unknown. The method employs three conflicting objectives; similarity and support maximization and total gap range minimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in this direction. The proposed method can be applied to any data set with a sequential character. Furthermore, it allows any choice of similarity measures for finding motifs. We compare our method with the two well-known structured motif extraction methods, EXMOTIF and RISOTTO.

Mining closed flexible patterns in time-series databases	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Closed flexible pattern; Time-series database	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; DATA STREAMS; EFFICIENT; ITEMSETS; SEQUENCES	In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, called CFP, for mining closed flexible patterns in time-series databases, where flexible gaps are allowed in a pattern. Our proposed algorithm involves three stages: transforming a time-series database into a symbolic database, generating all frequent patterns of length one from the transformed database, and mining closed flexible patterns in a depth-first search manner. In the proposed method, we design two pruning strategies and a closure checking scheme to reduce the search space and thus speed up the algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the modified Apriori algorithm by an order of magnitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Wu, Huei-Wen; Lee, Anthony J.

J	Wu, LC; Huang, JL; Horng, JT; Huang, HD				Wu, Li-Ching; Huang, Jhih-Long; Horng, Jorng-Tzong; Huang, Hsien-Da			An expert system to identify co-regulated gene groups from time-lagged gene clusters using cell cycle expression data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Expert system; Data mining; Gene expression; Bioinformatics	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; IDENTIFICATION	Motivation: The analysis of time series gene expression data can provide us with the opportunity to find co-regulated genes that show a similar expression patterns under a contiguous subset of experimental conditions. However, these co-regulated genes may behave almost independently under other conditions. Furthermore, the similarity in the expression pattern might be time-shifted. In that case, we need to be concerned with grouping genes that share similar expression patterns under a contiguous subset of conditions and where the similarity in expression pattern might have time lags. in addition, to be considered a time-shifted similar pattern, because co-regulated genes in a biological process may show a periodic pattern in their cell cycle expression, we also should group genes with periodic similar patterns over multiple cell cycles. If this is carried out, we can regard such grouped genes as cell-cycle regulated genes. Results: We propose a method that follows the q-cluster concept [Ji, L., & Tan, K. L. (2005). Identifying time-lagged gene clusters using gene expression data. Bioinformatics, 21(4), 509-516] and further advances this approach towards the identification of cell-cycle regulated genes using cell cycle microarray data. We used our method to Cluster a microarray time series of yeast genes to assess the statistically biological significance of the obtained clusters we used the p-value obtained from the hypergeometric distribution. We found that several clusters provided findings suggesting a TF-target relationship. In order to test whether our method could group related genes that other methods have found difficult to group, we compared our method with other measures such as Spearman Rank Correlation and Pearson Correlation. The results of the comparison demonstrate that our method indeed could group known related genes that these measures regard as having only a weak association. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bhandari, A; Marziliano, P				Bhandari, Ayush; Marziliano, Pina			Fractional Delay Filters Based on Generalized Cardinal Exponential Splines	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Spline; Delay; Interpolation; Data mining; Permission; Probability density function; Finite impulse response filter	DESIGN; RECONSTRUCTION; INTERPOLATION; SIGNALS	Fractional delay filters (FDFs) play an important role in certain areas of digital signal processing and communication engineering, where it is desirable to generate delays that are of the order of a fraction of the sampling period. In this paper, we advocate the use of generalized cardinal exponential splines-a class of compactly supported functions that is much richer than the existing B-spline family-for designing precision FDFs. One advantage of using generalized cardinal exponential splines is that it provides ready access to several spline families and other kernels which could be used for FDF design. The B-spline and Lagrange interpolator based FDFs are a special case of our proposition. We also discuss a design example and show that it is possible to design filters that have lower interpolation errors as compared to its B-spline counterparts.

To implement this system, we also propose a data distribution approximation model, Polygon descriptor, and a shape difference measurement. called Deforming distance method The Polygon descriptor can model a data distribution by characterizing the data dependency relationship among the data variables, and the Deforming distance is designed to be translation, scale, and rotation Invariant. The Polygon descriptor and Deforming distance method are combined to measure the similarity between data sets based on the shape of data distribution. Stock price and EPS (earn per share) data during different time periods were selected to verify the modeling and measuring power of the proposed model and method. The Polygon descriptor is used to model the collected Stock price and EPS data for their dependency relationship Then, difference between Polygon descriptors can be measured by using the Deforming distance Measurement method for their Deforming distance Values Based oil the Deforming difference Values. the similarity of stock market behaviors in two time periods can be assessed, and the similar stock market behavior of different time periods can be identified To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method and system. real-world data of Taiwan stock market during the period from 1986 to 2006 were collected and used. Experimental results show that the Polygon descriptor successfully captures the data dependencies between stock price and EPS, and the Deforming difference based similarity measurement estimates the changes of market behavior better than some commonly used methods.

J	Mahdi, AE; Picovici, D				Mahdi, Abdulhussain E.; Picovici, Dorel			New single-ended objective measure for non-intrusive speech quality evaluation	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Speech quality assessment; Speech processing; Data mining; Quality of experience (QoE); Quality of service (QoS)	PSYCHOACOUSTIC SOUND REPRESENTATION; AUDIO QUALITY; CODERS	This article proposes a new output-based method for non-intrusive assessment of speech quality of voice communication systems and evaluates its performance. The method requires access to the processed (degraded) speech only, and is based on measuring perception-motivated objective auditory distances between the voiced parts of the output speech to appropriately matching references extracted from a pre-formulated codebook. The codebook is formed by optimally clustering a large number of parametric speech vectors extracted from a database of clean speech records. The auditory distances are then mapped into objective Mean Opinion listening quality scores. An efficient data-mining tool known as the self-organizing map (SOM) achieves the required clustering and mapping/reference matching processes. In order to obtain a perception-based, speaker-independent parametric representation of the speech, three domain transformation techniques have been investigated. The first technique is based on a perceptual linear prediction (PLP) model, the second utilises a bark spectrum (BS) analysis and the third utilises mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). Reported evaluation results show that the proposed method provides high correlation with subjective listening quality scores, yielding accuracy similar to that of the ITU-T P.563 while maintaining a relatively low computational complexity. Results also demonstrate that the method outperforms the PESQ in a number of distortion conditions, such as those of speech degraded by channel impairments.

Focusing on this aspect, this paper presents a data mining analysis of the effect of observation time period on user identification based on online user behavior. We show that online identification accuracies improve with pooling user data over sessions and present results that quantify the number of sessions needed to identify users at desired accuracy thresholds. We discuss potential applications of this for verification of online user identity, particularly as part of multi-factor authentication methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, up-to-date data is usually in small sample sets, and it is risky to assume that the derived distribution; such as the normal distribution, from a few collected samples is an unbiased estimation of the underlying population Based on this fact, the sample statistic (X) over bar may simply not be the proper measurement to estimate the mean of a population when confronting small data sets This research proposes the Central Location Tracking Method (CLTM), with the novel concept of a "trend center", that is the center of probability (CP) determined by a variety of derived data properties which is employed to estimate the probable location of the population center mu. This approach aims at obtaining better predictability and fewer estimation errors for small sample sets. The comparison results between the method presented and (X) over bar, regression, neural networks. and ARIMA methods validate the superiority of this method for both random data and dependent data.

J	Camci, F				Camci, Fatih			CHANGE POINT DETECTION IN TIME SERIES DATA USING SUPPORT VECTORS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Change point detection; data mining; time series; support vector machine; variance change detection	DOMAIN DESCRIPTION; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; FEATURES; MACHINE; IMAGES; FACES	Change Point Detection in time series data is of interest in various research areas including data mining, pattern recognition, statistics, etc. Even though there are several effective methods in the literature for detecting changes in mean, and an increase in variance, there are none for decrease in variance. Effective detection of decreased variance has been reported as future work in earlier papers. In addition, most, if not all, methods require some model like AR to fit into the time series data in order to extract noise information, which is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and follow standard normal distribution (white noise). Thus, effectiveness of the methods is tied to the fitness degree of the AR model to the time series data. This paper presents a change point detection method based on support vectors that targets changes in mean and variance (including variance decrease) without any assumption of model fitting or data distribution. The data is represented by a hyper-sphere in a higher dimensional space using kernel trick. The change is identified by the change in the radius of the hyper-sphere. A comparison of this method with other methods is presented in the paper.

Intelligent security and access control framework for service-oriented architecture	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						SOA; Web Services; Intelligent security; Web 2.0; Data mining		One of the most significant difficulties with developing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) involves meeting its security challenges, since the responsibilities of SOA security are based on both the service providers and the consumers. In recent years, many solutions to these challenges have been implemented, such as the Web Services Security Standards, including WS-Security and WS-Policy. However, those standards are insufficient for the new generation of Web technologies, including Web 2.0 applications. In this research, we propose an intelligent SOA security framework by introducing its two most promising services: the Authentication and Security Service (NSS), and the Authorization Service (AS). The suggested autonomic and reusable services are constructed as an extension of WS- security standards, with the addition of intelligent mining techniques, in order to improve performance and effectiveness. In this research, we apply three different mining techniques: the Association Rules, which helps to predict attacks, the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Cube, for authorization, and clustering mining algorithms, which facilitate access control rights representation and automation. Furthermore, a case study is explored to depict the behavior of the proposed services inside an SOA business environment. We believe that this work is a significant step towards achieving dynamic SOA security that automatically controls the access to new versions of Web applications, including analyzing and dropping suspicious SOAP messages and automatically managing authorization roles.

OWA was originally introduced by Yager (IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern 18(1):183-190, 1988) has gained much interest among researchers, hence many applications such as in the areas of decision making, expert systems, data mining, approximate reasoning, fuzzy system and control have been proposed. On the other hand, the SAS is powerful software and it is capable of running various optimization tools such as linear and non-linear programming with all type of constraints.

J	Flouvat, F; De Marchi, F; Petit, JM				Flouvat, Frederic; De Marchi, Fabien; Petit, Jean-Marc			A new classification of datasets for frequent itemsets	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pattern mining; Classification of datasets; Experimental study	INCLUSION DEPENDENCIES; DATABASES; PATTERNS	The discovery of frequent patterns is a famous problem in data mining. While plenty of algorithms have been proposed during the last decade, only a few contributions have tried to understand the influence of datasets on the algorithms behavior. Being able to explain why certain algorithms are likely to perform very well or very poorly on some datasets is still an open question. In this setting, we describe a thorough experimental study of datasets with respect to frequent itemsets. We study the distribution of frequent itemsets with respect to itemsets size together with the distribution of three concise representations: frequent closed, frequent free and frequent essential itemsets. For each of them, we also study the distribution of their positive and negative borders whenever possible. The main outcome of these experiments is a new classification of datasets invariant w.r.t. minsup variations and robust to explain efficiency of several implementations.

However, accurate class probability prediction is more desirable than classification accuracy in many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis. Although it is known that decision trees can be adapted to be class probability estimators in a variety of approaches, and the resulting models are uniformly called Probability Estimation Trees (PETs), the performances of these PETs in class probability estimation, have not yet been investigated. We begin our research by empirically studying PETs in terms of class probability estimation, measured by Log Conditional Likelihood (LCL). We also compare a PET called C4.4 with other representative models, including Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, Bayesian Network, KNN and SVM, in LCL. From our experiments, we draw several valuable conclusions. First, among various tree-based models, C4.4 is the best in yielding precise class probability prediction measured by LCL. We provide an explanation for this and reveal the nature of LCL. Second, compared with non tree-based models, C4.4 also performs best. Finally, LCL does not dominate another well-established relevant metric-AUC, which suggests that different decision-tree learning models should be used for different objectives. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI sample sets. We run all the models within a machine learning platform-Weka. We also explore an approach to improve the class probability estimation of Naive Bayes Tree. We propose a greedy and recursive learning algorithm, where at each step, LCL is used as the scoring function to expand the decision tree. The algorithm uses Naive Bayes created at leaves to estimate class probabilities of test samples. The whole tree encodes the posterior class probability in its structure. One benefit of improving class probability estimation is that both classification accuracy and AUC can be possibly scaled up. We call the new model LCL Tree (LCLT). Our experiments on 33 UCI sample sets show that LCLT outperforms all state-of-the-art learning models, such as Naive Bayes Tree, significantly in accurate class probability prediction measured by LCL, as well as in classification accuracy and AUC.

J	Straszecka, E				Straszecka, Ewa			Combining knowledge from different sources	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dempster-Shafer theory; fuzzy sets; medical diagnosis support	BELIEF FUNCTIONS; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; COMBINATION; SYSTEM	The present paper deals with the problem of an assessment of symptoms in medical diagnosis. A unified interpretation of symptoms is necessary to estimate their significance in a diagnosis. Yet, even if they are properly defined, different evaluations of them based on experts' knowledge or statistical estimation are possible. The present study aims at combining evaluations that may originate from an expert or can be found from statistical features of the data, as well as those determined for 'easy' and 'difficult' diagnostic cases. A model of diagnostic inference is proposed in the framework of the Dempster-Shafer theory extended for fuzzy focal elements. The basic probability assignment defined in this theory estimates weights of symptoms. Two basic probability assignments can be created and then combined. In this way weights of symptoms represent knowledge common for two kinds of data or obtained from an expert and from data. Thus, a combination of heuristics and data mining results becomes possible. An algorithm of the basic probability assignment calculation is suggested and tested for medical data: a database from the internet and individually gathered data.

In text mining framework, data-driven indices are used as importance indices of words and phrases. Although the values of these indices are influenced by usages of terms, conventional emergent term detection methods did not treat these indices explicitly. Our method consists of an automatic term extraction method in given documents, three importance indices from text mining studies, and temporal patterns based on results of temporal clustering. Then, we assign abstracted sense of the temporal patterns of the terms based on their linear trends of centroids. Empirical studies show that an importance index is applied to the titles of four annual conferences about data mining field as sets of documents.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a powerful tool to understand the communities' members, however, our theses is that state-of-the-art in SNA it is not sufficient to obtain useful knowledge from a VCoP. Moreover, we think that traditional SNA may lead to discover wrong results. We propose to combine traditional SNA with data mining techniques in order to produce results closer to reality and gather useful knowledge for VCops' enhancement, in this work, we focused in discovering key members on a VCoP combining SNA with concept-based text mining. We successfully tested our approach on a real VCoP with more than 2500 members and we validate our results asking the community administrators.

As the musicians in improvisation process try to find the best harmony in terms of aesthetics, the decision variables in optimization process try to be the best vector in terms of objective function. Cluster analysis is one of attractive data mining technique that use in many fields. One popular class of data clustering algorithms is the center based clustering algorithm. K-means used as a popular clustering method due to its simplicity and high speed in clustering large datasets. However, k-means has two shortcomings: dependency on the initial state and convergence to local optima and global solutions of large problems cannot found with reasonable amount of computation effort. In order to overcome local optima problem lots of studies done in clustering. This paper describes a new clustering method based on the harmony search (HS) meta-heuristic algorithm, which was conceptualized using the musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony. The HS algorithm does not require initial values and uses a random search instead of a gradient search, so derivative information is unnecessary. We compared proposed algorithm with other heuristics algorithms in clustering, such as GA, SA, TS, and ACO, by implementing them on several simulation and real datasets. The results indicate that the proposed clustering is a powerful clustering method suggesting higher degree of precision and robustness than the existing algorithms.

We investigate how data mining techniques can be incorporated in the quality assurance decision making process. As prior expert decisions are available, we demonstrate that expert knowledge can be effectively extracted and reused for reproducing human experts decisions on new data. The framework is demonstrated for the Saudi Aramco air quality monitoring network and yields trustworthy behavior on historical data. A variety of data-mining algorithms was evaluated, resulting to an average predictive accuracy of over 80%, while best models reached 90% of correct decisions.

Several approaches have been recently proposed. Unfortunately, in all surveyed approaches, reducing the quantity of mined patterns (and, consequently, the quantity of extracted rules) was not the main concern. To palliate such a drawback, a possible solution consists in using results of Formal Concept Analysis to generate a lossless reduced size nucleus of gradual patterns. To do so, we introduce in this paper a novel closure operator acting on gradual itemsets. Results of the experiments carried out on synthetic datasets showed important profits in terms of compactness of the generated gradual patterns set.

J	Balcazar, JL				Balcazar, Jose L.			REDUNDANCY, DEDUCTION SCHEMES, AND MINIMUM-SIZE BASES FOR ASSOCIATION RULES	LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Data mining; association rules; implications; redundancy; deductive calculus; optimum bases		Association rules are among the most widely employed data analysis methods in the field of Data Mining. An association rule is a form of partial implication between two sets of binary variables. In the most common approach, association rules are parametrized by a lower bound on their confidence, which is the empirical conditional probability of their consequent given the antecedent, and/or by some other parameter bounds such as "support" or deviation from independence. We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from a fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an interpretation (or model) in the porpositional logic sense, and consider existing notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among association rules, of the form "any dataset in which this first rule holds must obey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant". We discuss several existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association rules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show that the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants, which differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of these two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction calculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is, axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules. We explore finally an approach to redundancy with respect to several association rules, and fully characterize its simplest case of two partial premises.

A large number of document processing applications directly depend on the quality and speed of keyword extraction algorithms. In this article, a novel approach to rapid change detection in data streams and documents is developed. It is based on ideas from image processing and especially on the Helmholtz Principle from the Gestalt Theory of human perception. Applied to the problem of keywords extraction, it delivers fast and effective tools to identify meaningful keywords using parameter-free methods. We also define a level of meaningfulness of the keywords which can be used to modify the set of keywords depending on application needs.

Dependency discovery consists in recovering the dependency structure for a set of data quality dimensions measured on attributes of a database. This task is accomplished through the data mining methodology, by learning a Bayesian Network from a database. The Bayesian Network is used to analyze dependency between data quality dimensions associated with different attributes. The proposed framework is instantiated on a real world database. The task of dependency discovery is presented in the case when the following data quality dimensions are considered; accuracy, completeness, and consistency. The Bayesian Network model shows how data quality can be improved while satisfying budget constraints.

The project is expected to cover methods for integration of distributed meteorological data necessary for running the prediction models, training models and then mining the data in order to be able to efficiently and quickly predict even randomly occurring phenomena. We present the methods and technologies we will use for integration of the input data, distributed on different vendors' servers. The meteorological detection and prediction methods are based on statistical and climatological methods combined with knowledge discovery - data mining of meteorological data (SYNOP, METAR messages, weather radar imagery, "raw" meteorological data from stations, satellite imagery and results of common meteorological prediction models).

Estimating the Number of Buildings in Germany	ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS, DATA HANDLING AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE	Studies in Classification Data Analysis and Knowledge Organization		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the German-Classification-Society	JUL 16-18, 2008	Hamburg, GERMANY	Helmut Schmidt Univ, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Gesellschaft Klassifikat, Gesellschaft Konsumforschung, Hamburg Mannheimer Versicherungen, Hamburger Sparkasse, Statsoft GmbH, Vattenfall, Volksfursorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG	Helmut Schmidt Univ	Building stock; Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Spatial planning		The debate on sustainable development has lead to the view of buildings as flows (mass, energy, money and information) or capitals. In this context buildings are considered as the largest physical, economical, social and cultural capital of a society. In Germany many institutions record different kind of data about buildings. Unfortunately there are just a few basic statistics about the amount of buildings. Collection of data is very complicated, often expensive and the handling of missing data is one of the biggest handicaps. With the exception of data about residential buildings and particularly monuments, it is an unsolved problem to determine the total number of buildings. Thus the main issue of this article is the description of an appropriate estimation procedure. This procedure relies on 12,430 communes and refers to data from the Cadaster of Real Estates and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR). The estimation is based on statistical data from well-known and easily accessible institutions. The number of buildings is estimated for communes with missing data. Using methods from the, so called, Urban Data Mining approach, unsuspected relationships are found in the urban data. These relationships are valuable for the estimation. The quality of the estimation is analyzed by training and test data sets. Information optimization leads to the conclusion that 20% of the communes hold 80% of all buildings. For an improvement of the estimation it is essential to refine the amount and quality of data in the larger communes.

However, existing proposals often neglect a fundamental aspect of learning: that understanding and learning require an active and constructive exploration of a domain. In this paper, we describe a new method and a tool that use data mining and interactivity to turn the typical search and retrieve dialogue, in which the user asks questions and a system gives answers, into a dialogue that also involves sense-making, in which the user has to become active by constructing a bibliography and a domain model of the search term(s). This model starts from an automatically generated and annotated clustering solution that is iteratively modified by users. The tool is part of an integrated authoring system covering all phases from search through reading and sense-making to writing. Two evaluation studies demonstrate the usability of this interactive and constructive approach, and they show that clusters and groups represent identifiable sub-topics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, frequently these assumptions hold only partly and are defined also partially. Therefore one must be capable to compare the a priori assumptions with the actual user behavior in order to decide how the system could be improved. To tackle this problem, we consider a promising approach to employ the same formalism to express the intended usage, the web portal model and the frequent real usage patterns, extracted from the experimental data by data mining algorithms. This allows to automate the verification whether the frequent real usage patterns satisfy the intended usage in the web portal model. We propose to use temporal logic and Kripke structure as such a common formalism.

Twitter is a micro-blogging service built to discover what is happening at any moment in time, anywhere in the world. Twitter messages are short, and generated constantly, and well suited for knowledge discovery using data stream mining. We briefly discuss the challenges that Twitter data streams pose, focusing on classification problems, and then consider these streams for opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

A large group of such methods is based on instance selection and optimization, with Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm being a prominent example. Accuracy of LVQ highly depends on proper initialization of prototypes and the optimization mechanism. Prototype initialization based on context dependent clustering is introduced, and modification of the LVQ cost function that utilizes additional information about class-dependent distribution of training vectors. The new method is illustrated on 6 benchmark datasets, finding simple and accurate models of data in form of prototype-based rules.

We address the problem of integrative clustering of data with mixed type attributes. Most existing solutions suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: Either they require input parameters which are difficult to estimate, or/and they do not adequately support mixed type attributes. Our technique INTEGRATE is a novel clustering approach that truly integrates the information provided by heterogeneous numerical and categorical attributes. Originating from information theory, the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle allows a unified view on numerical and categorical information and thus naturally balances the influence of both sources of information in clustering. Moreover, supported by the MDL principle, parameter-free clustering can be performed which enhances the usability of INTEGRATE on real world data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of INTEGRATE in exploiting numerical and categorical information for clustering. As an efficient iterative algorithm INTEGRATE is scalable to large data sets.

For this reason, extraction of these rules is becoming a more-and-more important part of the Data Mining stage in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases Process. In this paper, a direct algorithm for extracting fuzzy IF-THEN rules on the basis of linguistic variable elimination is described. The algorithm is implemented within a designed object-oriented software library Fuzzy Rule Miner. Besides the introduced algorithm, it implements two algorithms for fuzzy rule extraction based on using fuzzy decision trees of ID3 kind. An essential precondition for comparing the implemented algorithms and for verifying the legitimacy of the introduced algorithm is performance of experiments. The goal of experiments is to take in the behavior of algorithms on testing databases from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases and to make comparisons of algorithms with one another. According to the conducted experiments, the introduced algorithm achieves high accuracy levels of discovered knowledge. The paper also contains a classification of rules and a specification of the Fuzzy Rule Discovery in Databases Process.

As of November 2009, Facebook was the most popular and well known social network throughout the world with over 316 million users. Among the countries, Turkey is in third place in terms of Facebook users and half of them are younger than 25 years old (students). Turkey has 14 million Facebook members. The success of Facebook and the rich opportunities offered by social media sites lead to the creation of new web based applications for social networks and open up new frontiers. Thus, discovering the usage patterns of social media sites might be useful in taking decisions about the design and implementation of those applications as well as educational tools. Therefore, in this study, the factors affecting "Facebook usage time" and "Facebook access frequency" are revealed via various predictive data mining techniques, based on a questionnaire applied on 570 Facebook users. At the same time, the associations of the students' opinions on the contribution of Facebook in an educational aspect are investigated by employing the association rules method.	[Bozkir, A.

The process use a collection of agents, running several different clustering algorithms, to determine a "best" cluster configuration. The issue of determining the most appropriate configuration is a challenging one, and is addressed in this paper by considering two metrics, total Within Group Average Distance (WGAD) to determine cluster cohesion, and total Between Group Distance (BGD) to determine separation. The proposed process is implemented using the MASminer MADM framework which is also introduced in this paper. Both the clustering technique and MASminer are evaluated.

One scenario is that a patient's digital health record can easily be shared among hospitals and medical centers via intemet, enabling the examination performed in one location while clinical diagnosis be done by physicians in another. In this paper, we propose a Medicare-Grid - a novel grid-based E-health system proposed to ease the process of retrieving and exchanging personal health data among hospitals and medical centers. Grid and peer-to-peer technologies have been used to integrate computing and storage resources provided by hospitals, as also to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) center to store and share EHRs among these locations. We have also developed a system prototype using ultimate hardware resources and open source software systems to simulate a real scenario as described above. We demonstrate that the idea proposed in the project is feasible, possible to be implemented and applicable to real world.

Romania has a huge tourist's potential, but currently it is too little valued and exploited. As a result, one of the strategic developments of the economy aimed the tourism industry. The strategic decisions are based on different trends obtained from sophisticated analysis of data. Data mining helps businesses sift through layers of seemingly unrelated data for meaningful relationships, where they can anticipate, rather than simply react to, environment challenges. Two types of data mining systems are presented, considering that data are processed from distributed databases. III. 4, bibl. 9 (in English; summaries in English, Russian and Lithuanian).

Predicting air quality in smart environments	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Data mining; machine learning; smart environments; activity recognition; air quality	INDOOR AIR; HEALTH	The pervasive sensing technologies found in smart environments offer unprecedented opportunities for monitoring and assisting the individuals who live and work in these spaces. As aspect of daily life that is often overlooked in maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the air quality of the environment. In this paper we investigate the use of machine learning technologies to predict CO(2) levels as an indicator of air quality in smart environments. We introduce techniques for collecting and analyzing sensor information in smart environments and analyze the correlation between resident activities and air quality levels. The effectiveness of our techniques is evaluated using three physical smart environment testbeds.

Efficient algorithms exist to find both types of association, separately or simultaneously. Association mining is performed by operating on the transaction data. Despite being an integral part of the transaction data, the p::icing and time information has not been incorporated into market basket analysis so far, and additional attributes have been handled using quantitative association mining. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to incorporate price, time and domain related attributes into data mining by re-mining the association mining results. The underlying factors behind positive and negative relationships, as indicated by the association rules, are characterized and described through the second data ruining stage re-mining. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by analyzing data coming from apparel retailing industry, where price markdown is an essential tool for promoting sales and generating increased revenue.

In this paper, a relational expression of this kind is defined as a contrast inequality. Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is powerful to discover relations from data and express them in mathematical level. Hence, it is desirable to apply GEP to such mining task. The main contributions of this paper include: (I) introducing the concept of contrast inequality mining, (2) designing a two-genome chromosome structure to guarantee that each individual in GEP is a valid inequality, (3) proposing a new genetic mutation to improve the efficiency of evolving contrast inequalities, (4) presenting a GEP-based method to discover contrast inequalities, (5) giving an extensive performance study on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are effective. Contrast inequalities with high discriminative power are discovered from the real-world datasets. Some potential works on contrast inequality mining are discussed.

This paper presents a bootstrap feature selection for ensemble classifiers to deal with this problem and compares with traditional feature selection for ensemble (select optimal features from whole dataset before bootstrap selected data). Four base classifiers: Multi layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are used to evaluate the performance of UCT machine learning repository and causal discovery datasets. Bootstrap feature selection algorithm provides slightly better accuracy than traditional feature selection for ensemble classifiers.

Considering the importance of data mining services to provide intelligence locally on devices on mobile environments, we propose a data mining service that adopts the embedded data mining algorithm according to situation. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining algorithm named J2ME-based Mobile Progressive Pattern Mine (J2MPP-Mine) for effective mobile computing. In J2MPP-Mine, we first propose a subset finder strategy named Subset-Finder (S-Finder) to find the possible subsets for prune. Then, we propose a Subset pruner algorithm (SB-Pruner) for determining the frequent pattern. Furthermore, we proposed the novel prediction strategy to determine the superset and remove the subset which generates a less number of sets due to different filtering pruning strategy. Finally, through the simulation our proposed methods were shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and applicability under various system conditions.

Existing approaches typically approximate all pairwise relationships simultaneously. In this paper, we are interested in computing: the score for a single pair of nodes, and the top-k nodes with the best scores from a given source node. For the pairwise problem, we apply an iterative algorithm that computes upper and lower bounds for the measures we seek. This algorithm exploits a relationship between the Lanczos process and a quadrature rule. For the top-k problem, we propose an algorithm that only accesses a small portion of the graph and is related to techniques used in personalized Page Rank computing. To test the scalability and accuracy of our algorithms we experiment with three real-world networks and find that these algorithms run in milliseconds to seconds without any preprocessing.

However, feature selection techniques that consider solely on gene expression values might not be able to identify biologically meaningful genes. Thus, this paper presents an integrative feature selection method that is able to incorporate gene expression data with additional biological data for finding informative genes. The proposed approach is a two-stage method that combined the strength of both filter method and association analysis. The experimental results show that the selected gene subsets are able to improve classification accuracy.	[Fang, Ong Huey; Mustapha, Norwati; Sulaiman, Md.

However, most existing studies focus only on either itemset mining or graph mining, and only a few studies have addressed combination of both. In this paper, we introduce a new problem which we call itemset-sharing subgraph. (ISS) set enumeration, where the task is to find sets of subgraphs with common itemsets in a large graph in which each vertex has an associated itemset. The problem has various interesting potential applications such as in side-effect analysis in drug discovery and the analysis of the influence of word-of-mouth communication in marketing in social networks. We propose an efficient algorithm ROBIN for finding ISS sets in such graph; this algorithm enumerates connected subgraphs having common itemsets and finds their combinations. Experiments using a synthetic network verify that our method can efficiently process networks with more than one million edges. Experiments using a real biological network show that our algorithm can find biologically interesting patterns.

CF tests have high computational complexity, which affects the efficiency of graph miners. In this paper, we introduce novel properties of the canonical adjacency matrices for reducing the number of CF tests in FCSM. Based on these properties, a new algorithm for frequent connected subgraph mining called grCAM is proposed. The experiments on real world datasets show the impact of the proposed properties in FCSM. Besides, the performance of our algorithm is compared against some other reported algorithms.

Data mining is an inter-disciplinary field, whose core is at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and databases. A major objective of this work is to evaluate data mining tools in medical and health care applications to develop a tool that can help make timely and accurate decisions. One technique used in data mining is Classification where the desired output is a set of Rules or Statements that characterize the data. Within the rule induction paradigm, the algorithm used is Particle Swarm Optimization. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a heuristic technique suited for search of optimal solutions and based on the concept of swarm which were inspired in group dynamics and its synergy were originated from computer simulations of the coordinated motion. This proposed work is intended to develop Classification rules to extract data from historical or training data of patients which is developed into patterns relevant for diagnosis and suitable for quicker analysis, automated processing, thus reducing cost and helping to provide enhanced care and better cure.

The aim is to maximize the accuracy of the classifier and/or to minimize the errors produced while minimizing the number of features necessary. A Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was adopted. Simultaneously, the parameters required by the classifier were also optimized. The validity of the methodology proposed was tested in the problem of bankruptcy prediction using a database containing financial statements of 1200 medium sized private French companies. The results produced shown that MOEA is an efficient feature selection approach and the best results were obtained when the accuracy, the errors and the classifiers parameters are optimized.

Uncertainty is widely spread in real-world data. Numerous factors lead to data uncertainty including data acquisition device error, approximate measurement, sampling fault, transmission latency, data integration error and so on. In many cases, estimating and modeling the uncertainty for underlying data is available and many classical data mining algorithms have been redesigned or extended to process uncertain data. It is extremely important to consider data uncertainty in the discretization methods as well. In this paper, we propose a new discretization algorithm called UCAIM (Uncertain Class-Attribute Interdependency Maximization). Uncertainty can be modeled as either a formula based or sample based probability distribution function (pdf). We use probability cardinality to build the quanta matrix of these uncertain attributes, which is then used to evaluate class-attribute interdependency by adopting the redesigned ucaan criterion. The algorithm selects the optimal discretization scheme with the highest ucaim value. Experiments show that the usage of uncertain information helps UCAIM perform well on uncertain data. It significantly outperforms the traditional CAIM algorithm, especially when the uncertainty is high.

To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by identifying other users with similar taste and use their opinions for recommendation; whereas content-based recommender systems recommend items based on the content information of the items. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialization, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed a unique switching hybrid recommendation approach by combining a Naive Bayes classification approach with the collaborative filtering. Experimental results on two different data sets, show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and provide better performance in terms of accuracy and coverage than other algorithms while at the same time eliminates some recorded problems with the recommender systems.

The K-means algorithm is well known for its simplicity and low time complexity. However, the algorithm has three main drawbacks: dependency on the initial centroids, dependency on the number of clusters, and degeneracy. Our solution accommodates these three issues, by proposing an approach to automatically detect a semi-optimal number of clusters according to the statistical nature of the data. As a side effect; the method also makes choices of the initial centroid-seeds not critical to the clustering results. The experimental results show the robustness of the Y-means algorithm as well as its good performance against a set of other well known unsupervised clustering techniques. Furthermore, we study the performance of our proposed solution against different distance and outlier-detection functions and recommend the best combinations.

Evaluation of k-Nearest Neighbor classifier performance for direct marketing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Cross-validation; k-Nearest Neighbor; Runtime; Accuracy		Text data mining is a process of exploratory data analysis. Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. This paper describes the proposed k-Nearest Neighbor classifier that performs comparative cross-validation for the existing k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: direct marketing. Direct marketing has become an important application field of data mining. Comparative cross-validation involves estimation of accuracy by either stratified k-fold cross-validation or equivalent repeated random subsampling. While the proposed method may have a high bias; its performance (accuracy estimation in our case) may be poor due to a high variance. Thus the accuracy with the proposed k-Nearest Neighbor classifier was less than that with the existing k-Nearest Neighbor classifier, and the smaller the improvement in runtime the larger the improvement in precision and recall. In our proposed method we have determined the classification accuracy and prediction accuracy where the prediction accuracy is comparatively high. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Running advanced techniques, including meta-learning, requires general data mining systems, capable of efficient management of very complex machines. Requirements for running complex learning tasks, within such systems, are significantly different than those of running processes by operating systems. We address major requirements that should be met by Cl systems and present corresponding solutions tested and implemented in our system. The main focus are the aspects of task spooling and multitasking.

To address this situation, enterprises try to realize horizontal and vertical integration of business and engineering processes leading to real-time enterprise. Enterprise data model assists in integrating data generated from automation systems in (milli) seconds and data from business applications referring to long time horizons (e.g., days). However, the integrated data is not used extensively for real-time control of enterprise processes. Therefore, a methodology is presented for identification and assimilation of knowledge for real-time control of enterprise processes. Real-time control of enterprise processes aims at increasing performances in manufacturing.

However, a question that remains to be answered is whether SVM users may expect improvements in the interpretability of their models, namely by using rule extraction methods already available to ANN users. This study successfully applies the Orthogonal Search-based Rule Extraction algorithm (OSRE) to Support Vector Machines. The study evidences the portability of rules extracted using OSRE, showing that, in the case of SVM, extracted rules are as accurate and consistent as those from equivalent ANN models. Importantly, the study also shows that the OSRE method benefits from SVM specific characteristics, being able to extract less rules from SVM than from equivalent ANN models.

J	Guo, DS				Guo, Diansheng			Local entropy map: a nonparametric approach to detecting spatially varying multivariate relationships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						local analysis; entropy; minimum spanning tree; scan statistics; spatial data mining	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; WEIGHTED REGRESSION; MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; ASSOCIATION; STATISTICS; MODELS	The relationship between two or more variables may change over the geographic space. The change can be in parameter values (e.g., regression coefficients) or even in relation forms (e.g., linear, quadratic, or exponential). Existing local spatial analysis methods often assume a relationship form (e.g., a linear regression model) for all regions and focus only on the change in parameter values. Therefore, they may not be able to discover local relationships of different forms simultaneously. This research proposes a nonparametric approach, a local entropy map, which does not assume a prior relationship form and can detect the existence of multivariate relationships regardless of their forms. The local entropy map calculates an approximation of the Renyi entropy for the multivariate data in each local region (in the geographic space). Each local entropy value is then converted to a p-value by comparing to a distribution of permutation entropy values for the same region. All p-values (one for each local region) are processed by several statistical tests to control the multiple-testing problem. Finally, the testing results are mapped and allow analysts to locate and interactively examine significant local relationships. The method is evaluated with a series of synthetic data sets and a real data set.

The first one, named Compressed Arrays (CA), allows to process datasets that do not change along the time (static datasets) while the second one, based on the ideas of the former and named Dynamic Compressed Arrays (DCA), processes datasets that change along the time by adding/deleting transactions (dynamic datasets). Both algorithms introduce a novel way to use equivalence classes of itemsets by performing a breadth first search through them and by storing the class prefix support in compressed arrays, which allows fast itemset support computing. On the other hand, unlike previous algorithms for dynamic datasets that store the full dataset in main memory without reusing the current frequent itemsets, DCA algorithm stores the current frequent itemsets in binary files, grouped in equivalence classes, and reuses them to calculate the new frequent itemsets.

In some real data cases in customer classification, it is difficult to discriminate the favorable customers showing response 1 from others because many response 1 points and 0 points are closely located. In such a case, to find the denser regions to the favorable customers is considered to be an alternative. Such regions are called the bumps, and finding them is called the bump hunting. By pre-specifying a pureness rate p in advance a maximum capture rate c could be obtained. Then a trade-off curve between p and c can be constructed. Thus, to find the bump regions is equivalent to construct the trade-off curve. When we adopt simpler boundary shapes for the bumps such as the union of z-dimensional boxes located parallel to some explanation variable axes, it would be convenient to adopt the binary decision tree. Since the conventional binary decision tree will not provide the maximum capture rates, we use the genetic algorithm (GA), specified to the tree structure, the tree-GA. Using the property that the tree-GA has a tendency to provide many local maxima of the capture rates, we can estimate the upper bound curve for the trade-off curve by using the extreme-value statistics. Since the bump regions obtained by using the tree-GA are conservative comparing to the optimal regions, we should investigate how accurate the trade-off curve is using the tree-GA. We have assessed the accuracy for the trade-off curve in typical fundamental cases that may be observed in real customer data cases. We have found that the proposed tree-GA can construct the effective trade-off curve which is close to the optimal one.

When daily, weekly, and/or monthly reports are generated or published by the OLAP operators, the report readers can only rely on their smart eyes to find out hidden rules, similar reports, or trend inside the potentially huge amount of reports. Data mining is a well-developed field for finding hidden rules inside the data itself. However, there is few techniques focus on finding hidden rules, similarity, or trend using OLAP reports as the unit of analysis. In this paper, we explore how to use clustering analysis on OLAP reports in order to automatically and effectively find the grouping knowledge of OLAP reports. We also address the appropriate presentation of this grouping knowledge to OLAP users.

Meta-learning and other complex data mining approaches need to train and test thousands of learning machines while searching for the best solution (model), which often is quite complex. To facilitate working with projects of any scale, we propose intelligent mechanism of machine unification and cooperating mechanism of machine cache.

Language Analytics for Assessing Brain Health: Cognitive Impairment, Depression and Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease	BRAIN INFORMATICS, BI 2010	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI) / International Conference on Active Media Technology (AMT)	AUG 28-30, 2010	Toronto, CANADA	Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC), IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc Task Force Brain Informat (IEEE-CIS TF-BI)	York Univ		LIFE	We present data demonstrating how brain health may be assessed by applying data-mining and text analytics to patient language. Three brain-based disorders are investigated - Alzheimer's Disease, cognitive impairment and clinical depression. Prior studies identify particular language characteristics associated with these disorders. Our data show computer-based pattern recognition can distinguish language samples from individuals with and without these conditions. Binary classification accuracies range from 73% to 97% depending on details of the classification task. Text classification accuracy is known to improve substantially as training data approaches web-scale. Such a web scale dataset seems inevitable given the ubiquity of social computing and its language intensive nature. Given this context, we claim that the classification accuracy levels obtained in our experiments are significant findings for the fields of web intelligence and applied brain informatics.

Computations has shifted from off-site main frames, dependent on highly trained operators and located in special rooms accessible only to certain authorised staff, to the more accessible desktop and laptop computers. This accessibility has resulted in an increasing number of researches in data mining in which hidden predictive information are extracted from large databases, using techniques from database research, artificial intelligence and statistics, to a wide variety of domains such as finance, manufacturing and medicine. In this research we describe our experiments on the application of Classification And Regression Tree (CART) to predict the survival of AIDS. CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables and categorical or predictor variables, and by predicting the most likely value of the dependent variable. In this paper, a total of 998 patients who had been diagnosed with AIDS were grouped according to prognosis by CART. We found that CART were able to predict the survival of AIDS with an accuracy of 60-93% based on selected dependent variables, validated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). This could be useful in determining potential treatment methods and monitoring the progress of treatment for AIDS patients.

Due to the enormous volume existing and newly appearing network data, Data Mining classification methods are used for Intrusion Detection System. In this paper the classifying methods used are ID3, J48, Naive Bayes and OneR. The data set used for this experiment is kddcup1999. The dimensionality reduction is being performed from 41 attributes to 7 and 14 attributes based on Best First Search method and the 4 classifying methods are being applied. The result shows that ID3 and J48 method carry the highest accuracy and sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes. Naive Bayes holds the highest degree of specification for all three dimensionalities. OneR has the worst Sensitivity with 7 and 14 attributes but the time taken by OneR for classification is very less. It is found that the optimal algorithm may vary based on the dimensionality.

However, process can often go the way they were initially not designed for or a non-efficient performance process model could be designed. To solve this problem, business process mining which can be used as the basis for the business process re-engineering has been recognized to an important concept. However, current research in the domain of process mining has only focused on extracting a workflow-based process model from completed process logs. Thus, there is a limitation in expressing various types of business processes, and moreover, process discovery and log scanning take a considerable amount of time. In this paper, we present a modified FP-tree algorithm for FP-tree based business processes, which are used for association analysis in data mining. Our modified algorithm supports the discovery of an appropriate level of the process model according to the user's need without re-scanning all the process logs during updating.

Krishna			Towards Efficient Mining of Periodic-Frequent Patterns in Transactional Databases	DATABASE AND EXPERT SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS, PT 2	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Database and Expert systems Applications	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2010	Bilbao, SPAIN		Univ Deusto	Data mining; frequent pattern; rare periodic-frequent pattern; multiple constraints	ASSOCIATION RULES	Periodic-Frequent patterns are an important class of regularities that exist in a transactional database. A pattern is periodic-frequent if it satisfies both minimum support (minsup) and maximum periodicity (maxprd) constraints. Minsup constraint controls the minimum number of transactions that a pattern must cover in a database. Maxprd constraint controls the maximum duration between the two transactions below which a pattern should reoccur in a database. In the literature an approach has been proposed to extract periodic-frequent patterns using single minsup and single maxprd constraints. However, real-world databases are mostly non-uniform in nature containing both frequent and relatively infrequent (or rarely) occurring items. Researchers are making efforts to propose improved approaches for extracting frequent patterns that contain rare items as they contain useful knowledge. For mining periodic patterns that contain frequent and rare items we have to specify low minsup and high maxprd. It is difficult to mine periodic-frequent patterns because the low minsup and high maxprd can cause combinatorial explosion. In this paper we propose an improved approach which facilitates the user to specify different minsup and maxprd values for each pattern depending upon the items within it. Also, we present an efficient pattern growth approach and a methodology to dynamically specify maxprd for each pattern. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient.	[Kiran, R.

In this paper, we propose multi-agent-system and various techniques that are Web service, ontology, and data mining techniques. The multi agent system, which constitutes the backbone of the framework, connects these pieces together and makes them perform properly. JADE is the MAS platform implemented this project. JADE is quite easy to learn and use. Moreover, it supports many agent approaches such as agent communication, protocol, behavior and ontology. This framework has been experimented and evaluated in the realization of a simple, but realistic, prototype of an e-Wedding system. The results, though still preliminary, are quite encouraging.

The proposed solution is based on the close relationship between reduct calculation problem in rough set theory and association rule generation problem. This is a continuation of our previous results (see, e.g. [10] [11]). In this paper, the set of decision rules satisfying the test object is generated directly from the training data set. To make it scalable, we adopted the idea of the FP-growth algorithm for frequent item-sets [7], [6]. The experimental results on some benchmark data sets are showing the ability of the proposed solution to process a growing data sets.

Extraction of geospatial knowledge from the information content has been thus becoming a important process. Among theses applications, a typical example is to discover relationships between various geospatial texts/data and specific locations. In this paper, we describe a location based text mining approach using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify texts into various categories based on their geospatial features, with the aims to discovering relationships between documents and zones. First, the collected documents were mapped to corresponding zones by the Adaptive Affinity Propagation (Adaptive AP) clustering techniques, then we performed framed maximize zones by means of Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods, allowing the results of relationships between documents and zones to be well presented. Eventually, we compared our experimental results with that of baseline models using Self-organizing maps (SOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) methods. The preliminary results show that our platform framework has potential for geospatial knowledge discovery.

Due to the highly elusive characteristics of audio musical data, retrieving informative and reliable features from audio signals is crucial to the performance of any music genre classification system. Previous work on audio music genre classification systems mainly concentrated on using timbral features, which limits the performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to extract musical pattern features in audio music using convolutional neural network (CNN), a model widely adopted in image information retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that CNN has strong capacity to capture informative features from the variations of musical patterns with minimal prior knowledge provided.	[Li, Tom L.

Based on information systems, data mining and Extension Theory ( Extenics), we present a knowledge cultivating method and design a knowledge management platform for improve decision making quality. Through divergence analysis, correlation analysis, and implication analysis, a flow chart of knowledge cultivating algorithm has been designed, and an intelligent knowledge management platform has been developed. By collecting knowledge or information from conditions and the goal, we choose several knowledge as seed, then distribute it to all the department leaders, let them input relative knowledge including data mining knowledge to the platform. The platform then connects them into a knowledge tree with Human-Computer Interaction and enterprise ontology techniques intelligently.

A study has been carried out by the authors on the key technologies that are needed in a Case-Based knowledge system to support engineering design. This paper reports a uniform dynamic representation mechanism based on granularity to represent the engineering knowledge, in the form of cases and rules, for the design of fixtures on machine tools. Based on the Nearest-Neighbour algorithm, an algorithm of case retrieval is brought forth to support the dynamic adaptation of index words and to optimize case retrieval by some design rules. It has been identified that case adaptation is one of the most difficult issues of Case-Based Reasoning for fixture design. Design rules have been used to improve the automation and quality of case adaptation. According to the characteristics of fixtures in the CAD data, several mining patterns can be provided, including case cluster analysis, design rules mining, CAD data criterion mining and user application pattern mining. Then an application platform for mechanical CAD data mining based on cases is built, and a feasible way has come up with to settle the problem of design knowledge acquisition. Based on the developed key technologies, a Case-Based knowledge system for fixture design has been developed and has been tested and applied in an aviation corporation.

The super-store/hypermarket and the supermarket came in second and third, respectively. This demonstrates that retail channels are essential to the day-to-day life of the common populace. With the social and economic evolution, not only have product sales and shopping habits changed, but the current marketing concepts have also changed from being product-oriented to being consumer-oriented. In this research, we first provide new algorithms modified from the Apriori algorithm. The new approach can be applied in finding association rules, which can handle an uncertainty, combined with the rough set theory, and then to find the influence degree of the consumer preferences variables for the marketing decision-makers used.

It was used to compress a database into a tree structure which stored only large items. It, however, needed to process all transactions in a batch way. In the past, we proposed a Fast Updated FP-tree (FUFP-tree) structure to efficiently handle new transactions and to make the tree update process become easier. In this paper, we propose the structure of prelarge trees to incrementally mine association rules based on the concept of pre-large itemsets. Due to the properties of pre-large concepts, the proposed approach does not need to rescan the original database until a number of new transactions have been inserted. The proposed approach can thus achieve a good execution time for tree construction especially when a small number of transactions are inserted each time. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach has a good performance for incrementally handling new transactions.

These predictions are then fed into the power regulation system. This paper describes a real-time predictive model of network traffic load which is derived from experiments on real data. This model combines a linear regression based model and a highly reactive model that are applied to real-time data that is aggregated at two levels of granularity. The model gives excellent performance predictions when applied to network traffic load data.

Although data are not known exactly, probability distributions or expected errors are sometimes available. While most researchers on uncertain data mining are looking for methods to extract mining results from uncertain data, which is usually in the form of probability distributions or expected errors, it is also very important to lower the data uncertainty by making a part of data more certain to help get better mining results. For example, input values of some sensors in the sensor network are usually designed to be recorded more frequently than others because they are more important or more likely to change. In this paper, the issue of selecting a part of uncertain data and acquiring their exact values to improve clustering results is explored. Under a general uncertainty model, we propose both global and localized data selection methods, which can be used together with any existing uncertain clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the quality of clustering improves after the selective exact value acquisition is applied.

In previous work, we have shown that cross-layer failure detection can reduce failure detection latency significantly. In particular, we monitor the behavior of the WLAN MAC layer to predict failures on the link layer. In this paper, we investigate data mining techniques to determine which parameters, i.e., the events, or combination and timing of events, occurring on the MAC layer most probably lead to link failures. Our results show, that the parameters revealed with the data mining approach produce similar or even more accurate failure predictions than achieved so far.

It has been regarded as an interesting complex dynamical disordered system from a statistical mechanics point of view. In previous work, we have investigated the problem of learning the agent behaviors in the minority game by assuming the existence of one "intelligent agent" who can learn from other agent behaviors. In this paper, we propose a framework called Minority Game Data Mining (MGDM), that assumes the collective data are generated from combining the behaviors of variant groups of agents following the minority games. We then apply this framework to time-series data analysis in the real-world. We test on a few stocks from the Chinese market and the US Dollar-RMB exchange rate. The experimental results suggest that the winning rate of the new model is statistically better than a random walk.

Because flexible-receptor docking simulations generate large amounts of data, their manual analysis is impractical. We intend to apply classification decision trees algorithms to better understand this type of docking results. However, prior to that we need to discretize the target attribute, which in this work is the estimated Free Energy of Binding (FEB) of the flexible receptor-ligand interactions. Here we compare three different discretization methods, by equal frequency (I), by equal width (2) and our proposed method, based on the mode and standard deviation (3) of the FEB values.

Many methods have been developed to ensure the privacy of numerical data but very few of them deal with textual (categorical) information. In this paper a new method for protecting the individual's privacy for categorical attributes is proposed. It is a masking method based on the recoding of words that can be linked to less than k individuals. This assures the fulfillment of the k-anonymity property, in order to prevent the re-identification of individuals. On the contrary to related works, which lack a proper semantic interpretation of text, the recoding exploits an input ontology in order to estimate the semantic similarity between words and minimize the information loss.

This paper describes new advances that we have developed for Midas project. This project is being developed in the Electronic Technology Department of the University of Seville and its aim is to detect non-technical losses in the database of the Endesa Company. The main symptom of a NTL in a customer is an important drop in his billed energy. Thus, a main task for us is to detect customers with anomalous drops in their consumed energy. Concretely, in the paper we present two new algorithms based on a regression analysis in order to detect two types of patterns of decreasing consumption typical in customers with NTLs.

For example, people with heart disease do not want to disclose their electrocardiogram time-series, but they still allow mining of some accurate patterns from their time-series. Based on this observation, we introduce the related assumptions and requirements. We show that only randomization methods satisfy all assumptions, but even those methods do not satisfy the requirements. Thus, we discuss the randomization-based solutions that satisfy all assumptions and requirements. For this purpose, we use the noise averaging effect of piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA), which may alleviate the problem of destroying distance orders in randomly perturbed time-series. Based on the noise averaging effect, we first propose two naive solutions that use the random data perturbation in publishing time-series while exploiting the PAA distance in computing distances. There is, however, a tradeoff between these two solutions with respect to uncertainty and distance orders. We thus propose two more advanced solutions that take advantages of both naive solutions. Experimental results show that our advanced solutions are superior to the naive solutions.

It is a hybrid technique that combines supervised and unsupervised data mining algorithms and builds classifiers from association rules' models. The aim of this work is to apply these associative classifiers to improve estimation precision in the project management area where data sparsity involves a major drawback. Moreover, in this application domain, most of the attributes are continuous; therefore, they must be discretized before generating the rules. The discretization procedure has a significant effect on the quality of the induced rules as well as on the precision of the classifiers built from them. In this paper, a multivariate supervised discretization method is proposed, which takes into account the predictive purpose of the association rules.

A simple way to model the diffusion of ideas, innovative behavior, or "word-of-mouth" effects on such a graph is to consider an increasing process of "infected" (or active) nodes: each node becomes infected once an activation function of the set of its infected neighbors crosses a certain threshold value. Such a model was introduced by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (KKT) in [Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network, in Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2003, pp. 137-146] and [Influential nodes in a diffusion model for social networks, in Proceedings of the 32nd International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), 2005], where the authors also impose several natural assumptions: the threshold values are random and the activation functions are monotone and submodular. The monotonicity condition indicates that a node is more likely to become active if more of its neighbors are active, while the submodularity condition indicates that the marginal effect of each neighbor is decreasing when the set of active neighbors increases. For an initial set of active nodes S, let sigma(S) denote the expected number of active nodes at termination. Here, we prove a conjecture of KKT: we show that the function sigma(S) is submodular under the assumptions above. We prove the same result for the expected value of any monotone, submodular function of the set of active nodes at termination. Roughly, our results demonstrate that "local" submodularity is preserved "globally" under this diffusion process. This is of natural computational interest, as many optimization problems have good approximation algorithms for submodular functions.

All the software bug related data are kept in software bug repositories. Software bug (defect) repositories contains lot of useful informaton related to the development of a project. Data mining techniques can be applied on these repositories to discover useful intersting patterns. In this paper a prediction data mining technique is proposed to predict the software bug estimation from a software bug repository. A two step prediction model is proposed In the first step bug for which estimation is required, its summary and description is matched against the summary and description of bugs available in bug repositories. A weighted similarity model is suggested to match the summary and description for a pair of software bugs. In the second step the fix duration of all the similar bugs are calculated and stored and its average is calculated, which indicates the precicted estimation of a bug. The proposed model is implemented using open source technologies and is exaplained with the help of illustrative example.

Path data obtained from customers' movements recorded in a spatial configuration contain valuable information for marketing. Customers purchase behavior and their in-store movements can be analyzed not only by using path data but also by combining it with POS data. However, the volume of path data is very large, since the position of a cart is updated every second. Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be used to handle these data. In this paper, we apply LCMseq to shopping path data to extract promising sequential patterns with the purpose of comparing prime customers' in-store movements with those of general customers. LCMseq is an efficient algorithm for enumerating all frequent sequence patterns. Finally, we construct a decision tree model using the extracted patterns to determine prime customers' in-store movements.

Many literatures have reviewed the application of data mining technology in customer segmentation, and achieved sound effectives. But in the most cases, it is performed using customer data from a special point of view, rather than from systematical method considering all stages of CRM. This paper, with the aid of data mining tools, constructs a new customer segmentation method based on RFM, demographic and LTV data. The new customer segmentation method consists of two phases. Firstly, with K-means clustering, customers are clustered into different segments regarding their RFM. Secondly, using demographic data, each cluster again is partitioned into new clusters. Finally, using LTV, a profile for customer is created. The method has been applied to a dataset from Iranian bank, which resulted in some useful management measures and suggestions.

The well-known power method is a typical tool, but it modifies matrix and, therefore, the related solution. We propose and study both deterministic and randomized game algorithms based on Mirror Descent (MD) method which are intended for bounding the Euclidean norm residual parallel to Ax-x parallel to(2) on the standard simplex in R(N). We prove the explicit uniform upper bounds of type O(root ln(N)/n) with arbitrary horizon n >= 1. They improve the similar earlier results with respect to n which have been proved for the squared norm residual, i.e. parallel to Ax-x parallel to(2)(2). Numerical results for N = 100 illustrate the general decrease of the norm residual parallel to A (x) over cap (t) - (x) over cap (t)parallel to(2) in time t and corroborate theoretical results.

The objective of this study is to provide a better technological solution to implement a regular CR dose monitoring process. An online automatic CR dose data mining program which can be applied to different systems was developed based on freeware and existing softwares in the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) server. The program was tested with 69 CR images. This preliminary study shows that the program addresses the major weaknesses of some existing studies including involvement of manual procedures in the monitoring process and being only applicable to a single manufacturer's CR images. The proposed method provides an efficient and effective solution to implement a CR dose monitoring program regularly in busy clinical departments to regulate the dose creep problem so as to reinforce the 'As Low As Reasonably Achievable' (ALARA) principle.

Thus it is expected as an objective measurement of mental stress. However this newly developed interdisciplinary studies frequently showed inconsistent results. Some technical reasons were indicated for this discrepancy. Above all, we focused on the fact that in all these studies the only method introduced to estimate the relationship between the level of hormones and the subjective stress scale was the correlation analysis. In this study we employed Rough set analysis in place of conventional linear correlation analysis for mining the relationship between a subjective stress scale, "Profile of Mood Scale" (POMS), and a well known stress biomarker, salivary cortisol. As a developing result, numbers of items (inquiries in POMS) which relatively associated with cortisol level were found, whereas no significant linear correlation was obtained between them.

ERPs can be classified by their time/frequency characteristics and spatial location on the scalp. Traditionally, ERPs are manually located by temporally and spatially averaged EEG signals. This process is error prone and sensitive to a priori assumptions. Our proposed algorithm is a general neuroscience-focused data mining algorithm that performs time and frequency analysis on ERPs and automatically extracts templates corresponding to Spectral Spatio-Temporal (SST) regions exhibiting significant differences between experimental outcomes. The method uses time-aligned templates, which preserve the characteristics of the signal important to cognitive researchers. The ability of the selected signal templates to differentiate between stimulus responses has been verified using a pattern recognition procedure. SST template extraction is tested on data taken from a Go/NoGo task and shown to both find relationships consistent with published neuroscience literature as well as novel relationships.

It is a challenge to discover and disseminate knowledge hidden in these data. Many computational methods have been developed to solve this problem. Taking analysis of the microarray data as an example, we spent the past decade developing many data mining strategies and software tools. It appears still insufficient to cover all sources of data. In this paper, we summarize our experiences in mining microarray data by using two plant species, Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana, as examples. We present several successful stories and also a few lessons learnt. The domain problems that we dealt with were the transcriptional regulation in seed development and during defense response against pathogen infection.

In this paper we present and analyze a method for recognizing the indoor everyday activities of a monitored individual. This method is based on the data mining technique of association rules and Allen's temporal relations. Our experimental results show that for many (but not all) activities, this method produces a recognition accuracy of nearly 100%, in contrast to other methods based on data mining classifiers. The proposed method is accurate, very flexible and adaptable to a dynamic environment such as the "Smart Home" and we believe that it deserves further attention.

In this work, we examine the problem of discovering groups of motifs from different time series that exhibit some lag relationships. We define a new class of pattern called lagPatterns that captures the invariant ordering among motifs. lagPatterns characterize localized associative pattern involving motifs derived from each entity and explicitly accounts for lag across multiple entities. We present an exact algorithm that makes use of the order line concept and the subsequence matching property of the normalized time series to find all motifs of various lengths. We also describe a method called LPMiner to discover lagPatterns efficiently. LPMiner utilizes inverted index and motif alignment technique to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency. A detailed empirical study on synthetic datasets shows the scalability of the proposed approach. We show the usefulness of lagPatterns discovered from a stock dataset by constructing stock portfolio that leads to a higher cumulative rate of return on investment.

The best known approach to our knowledge is HOT SAX technique based on the equiprobable distribution of SAX representations of time series. This characteristic, however, is not preserved in the reduced-dimensionality literature, especially on the lack of Gaussian distribution datasets. In this paper, we introduce a k-means based algorithm for symbolic representations of time series called adaptive Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (aSAX) and propose HOT aSAX algorithm for time series discords discovery. Due to the clustered characteristic of aSAX words, our algorithm produces greater pruning power than the previous approach. Our empirical experiments with real-world time series datasets confirm the theoretical analyses as well as the efficiency of our approach.

Such algorithms work by introducing randomness in the induction of several decision trees before employing a voting scheme to give a prediction for unseen instances. In this paper, randomized trees ensembles are studied in the point of view of the basis functions they induce. We point out a connection with kernel target alignment, a measure of kernel quality, which suggests that randomization is a way to obtain a high alignment, leading to possibly low generalization error. The connection also suggests to post-process ensembles with sophisticated linear separators such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). Interestingly, post-processing gives experimentally better performances than a classical majority voting. We finish by comparing those results to an approximate infinite ensemble classifier very similar to the one introduced by Lin and Li. This methodology also shows strong learning abilities, comparable to ensemble post-processing.

To provide the proposed framework with semantics, we are using the Knowledge Discovery Ontology which defines relationships among the ingredients of knowledge discovery scenarios. It enables to reason which algorithms can be used to produce the results required by a specified knowledge discovery task, and to query the results of the knowledge discovery tasks. In addition, the ontology can also be used for automatic annotation of manually created workflows facilitating their reuse. Thus, the proposed framework provides an approach to third generation data. mining: integration of distributed, heterogeneous data, and knowledge resources and software into a coherent and effective knowledge discovery process. The abilities of the prototype implementation have been demonstrated on a text mining use case featuring publicly available data repositories, specialized algorithms, and third-party data analysis tools.

The gait of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to identify the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg. Results show that naive Bayes needs more tags and less noise to reach classification accuracy of 98 % than random forest for 99 %.

As changes are getting executed and deployed, knowledge is being created and stored. It is of paramount importance to the success of the business to re-use that knowledge for future changes. In fact, those who do not learn from past experiences are doomed to repeat the same mistakes as well as not bear the fruit of the ones that were successful. This paper addresses this concern by providing for every change being worked out the most similar past changes. Our solution combines data mining and optimization paradigms to model the problem of finding past similar changes by designing and learning similarity functions. Our approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of dealing with changes, by reducing the risk and shortening the time of introducing new changes.

An Adaptive Sensor Mining Framework for Pervasive Computing Applications	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM SENSOR DATA	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data	AUG 24-27, 2008	Las Vegas, NV			Sensor data mining; Sequential mining; Pervasive computing applications; Smart environments; Adaptation	PATTERNS	Analyzing sensor data in pervasive computing applications brings unique challenges to the KDD community. The challenge is heightened when the underlying data source is dynamic and the patterns change. We introduce a new adaptive mining framework that detects patterns in sensor data, and more importantly, adapts to the changes in the underlying model. In our framework, the frequent and periodic patterns of data are first discovered by the Frequent and Periodic Pattern Miner (FPPM) algorithm; and then any changes in the discovered patterns over the lifetime of the system are discovered by the Pattern Adaptation Miner (PAM) algorithm, in order to adapt to the changing environment. This framework also captures vital context information present in pervasive computing applications, such as the startup triggers and temporal information. In this paper, we present a description of our mining framework and validate the approach using data collected in the CASAS smart home testbed.

Clustering is a principal data discovery technique in data mining that segregates a dataset into subsets or clusters so that data values in the same cluster have some common characteristics or attributes. A number of clustering techniques have been proposed in the past by many researchers that can identify arbitrary shaped cluster; where a cluster is defined as a dense region separated by the low-density regions and among them DBSCAN is a prime density-based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN is capable of discovering clusters of any arbitrary shape and size in databases which even include noise and outliers. Many researchers have attempted to overcome certain deficiencies in the original DBSCAN like identifying patterns within datasets of varied densities and its high computational complexity; hence a number of augmented forms of DBSCAN algorithm are available. We present an incremental density-based clustering technique which is based on the fundamental DBSCAN clustering algorithm to enhance its computational complexity. Our proposed algorithm can be used in different knowledge domains like image processing, classification of patterns in GIS maps, x-ray crystallography and information security.

Current state-of-the-art systems for visualization include line plots and three-dimensional representations, which most of the time require screen resolutions that are not available in small transient mobile devices. Moreover, when data presents cyclic behaviors, such as in the electricity domain, predictive models may tend to give higher errors in certain recurrent points of time, but the human-eye is not trained to notice this cycles in a long stream. In these contexts, information is usually hard to extract from visualization. New visualization techniques may help to detect recurrent faulty predictions. En this paper we inspect visualization techniques in the scope of a real-world sensor network, quickly dwelling into future trends in visualization in transient mobile devices. We propose a simple dense pixel display visualization system, exploiting the benefits that it may represent on detecting and correcting recurrent faulty predictions. A case study is also presented, where a simple corrective strategy is studied in the context of global electrical load demand, exemplifying the utility of the new visualization method when compared with automatic detection of recurrent errors.

A Comparative Study and Choice of an Appropriate Kernel for Support Vector Machines	INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Information and Communication Technologies	SEP 07-09, 2010	Kochi, INDIA	Assoc Comp Elect & Elect Engn		Support Vector Machine; Pattern Classification; Kernel Function; Support Vectors; Mercer Kernels		Support Vector machine (SVM) has become an optimistic method for data mining and machine learning. The exploit of SVM gave rise to the development of a new class of theoretically refined learning machines, which uses a central concept of kernels and the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The performance of SVM largely depends on the kernel. However, there is no premise about how to choose a good kernel function for a particular domain. This paper focuses in this issue i.e. the choice of the Kernel Function is studied empirically and optimal results are achieved for binary class SVMs. The performance of the Binary class SVM is illustrated by extensive experimental results. The experimental results of the datasets show that RBF Kernel or any other kernels is not always the best choice to achieve high generalization of classifier although it is often the default choice.

Mining frequent itemsets in the presence of malicious participants	IET INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article								Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) algorithms attempt to reduce the injuries to privacy caused by malicious parties during the rule mining process. Usually, these algorithms are designed for the semi-honest model, where participants do not deviate from the protocol. However, in the real-world, malicious parties may attempt to obtain the secret values of other parties by probing attacks or collusion. In this study, the authors study how to preserve the privacy of participants in a collusion-free model of the frequent itemset mining process, where the protocol protects against probing attacks and collusion. The mining of frequent itemsets is the main step of association rule mining algorithms, and, in this study, the authors propose two privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining algorithms for both two-party and multi-party states in a collusion-free model for vertically partitioned (heterogeneous) data; in addition, a privacy measuring technique is proposed, which quantifies privacy based on the amount of disclosed sensitive information.

In this study, our objective is to build precise and accurate classification models to predict the factors, which attribute to the disparity in healthcare coverage in the United States. The study utilizes twenty-three variables and 67,636 records from the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In our comparative analysis, three statistical feature extraction methods, Chi-Square, Gain Ratio, and Info Gain, were used to extract a set of relevant features, which were then subjected to the classification models, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to analyze healthcare coverage. The most important factors that were discovered in the model are presented in this paper.

Different methods have been proposed and examined for mining frequent patterns from XML documents efficiently and effectively. While many frequent XML patterns generated are useful and interesting, it is common that a large portion of them is not considered as interesting or significant for the application at hand. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to ascertain whether the discovered XML patterns are significant and not just coincidental associations, and provide a precise statistical approach to support this framework. The proposed strategy combines data mining and statistical measurement techniques to discard the non significant patterns. In this paper we considered the "Prions" database that describes the protein instances stored for Human Prions Protein. The proposed unified framework is applied on this dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing interestingness of discovered XML patterns by statistical means. When the dataset is used for classification/prediction purposes, the proposed approach will discard non significant XML patterns, without the cost of a reduction in the accuracy of the pattern set as a whole.

This paper proposes a nearest neighbour based trajectory data as two-step process. Extensive experiments were conducted using real datasets of moving vehicles in Milan (Italy). In our method first, we build a classifier from the pre-processed 03 days training trajectory data and then we classify 04 days test trajectory data using class label. The resultant figure shows the our experimental investigation yields output as classified test trajectories, significant in terms of correctly classified success rate being 98.2. To measure the agreement between predicted and observed categorization of the dataset is carried out using Kappa statistics.

In this paper, we use this concept to build new feature vectors from extracted parameters to be used for visual speech classification. We extract the lip contour using edge detection and connectivity analysis. The boundary is defined using six cubic curves. The visual parameters are used to build n-gram feature vectors. Two sets of classification experiments are performed with the n-gram feature vectors: using the hidden Markov model and using multiple data mining algorithms in WEKA, a tool widely used by researchers.

Several approaches exist to scaling U p classification rule induction to large datasets, namely data reduction and the parallelisation of classification rule induction algorithms. In the area of parallelisation of classification rule induction algorithms most of the work has been concentrated on the Top Down Induction of Decision Trees (TDIDT), also known as the 'divide and conquer' approach. However powerful alternative algorithms exist that induce modular rules. Most of these alternative algorithms follow the 'separate and conquer' approach of inducing rules, but very little work has been done to make the 'separate and conquer' approach scale better on large training data. This paper examines the potential of the recently developed blackboard based J-PMCRI methodology for parallelising modular classification rule induction algorithms that follow the 'separate and conquer' approach. A concrete implementation of the methodology is evaluated empirically on very large datasets.

Rather than most commercial web sites having routine content publish schedules, online users deliver their postings on web communities with high variance in both temporality and quality. In this work, we address the scheduling problem for web crawlers, with the objective of optimizing the quality of the local index (i.e. minimizing the total weighted delays of postings) with the given quantity of resources. Towards this, we utilize the posting importance evaluation mechanism and the underlying publish pattern of data source to exploit a posting weights generation prediction model, which is leveraged to help web crawler decide the retrieval points for better index quality. From extensive experiments applied on several web communities, we show the effectiveness of our policy outperforms uniform scheduling and the one purely based upon posting generation pattern.

The focus of this work is on mining YouTube to discover hate videos, users and virtual hidden communities. Finding precise information on YouTube is a challenging task because of the huge size of the YouTube repository and a large subscriber base. We present a solution based on data mining and social network analysis (using a variety of relationships such as friends, subscriptions, favorites and related videos) to aid an analyst in discovering insightful and actionable information. Furthermore, we performed a systematic study of the features and properties of the data and hidden social networks which has implications in understanding extremism on Internet. We take a case study based approach and perform empirical validation of the proposed hypothesis. Our approach succeeded in finding hate videos which were validated manually.

Syntactic features are found to be good for large data sets, whereas lexical features are good for small data sets. The results can be used to customize and further improve authorship detection techniques according to the characteristics of the writing samples.

Recently, the support metric-based frequent pattern mining from data stream has achieved a great attention. However. the occurrence frequency of a pattern may not be an appropriate criterion or discovering meaningful patterns. Temporal regularity in occurrence behavior can be a key criterion for assessing the importance of patterns in several online applications such as market basket analysis, gene data analysis, network monitoring, and stock market. A pattern can be said regular if its occurrence behavior satisfies a user-given interval in the data steam. Mining regular patterns from static databases has recently been addressed. However, even though mining regular patterns from stream data is extremely required in on applications, no such algorithm has been proposed yet. Therefore, in this paper we develop a novel tree structure called Regular Pattern Stream tree (RPS-tree). and an efficient mining technique for discovering regular patterns over data stream. Using a sliding window method the RPS-tree captures the stream content, and with an efficient tree updating mechanism it constantly processes exact stream data when the stream flows. Extensive experimental analyses show that our RPS-tree is highly efficient in discovering regular patterns from a high-speed data stream.

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate a method for the non-intrusive detection of visual distraction, based on the vehicle dynamic data; in particular, we present and compare two models, applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) which are well-known data-mining methods. Despite of what already done in literature, our method does not use eye-tracker data in the final classifier. With respect to other similar works, we regard distraction identification as a classification problem and, moreover, we extend the datasets, both in terms of data-points and of scenarios. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task (SURT) while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics and features selection criteria have been compared. Potential applications of this research include the design of adaptive IVIS and of "smarter" Partially Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems (PADAS), as well as the evaluation of driver's distraction.

This algorithm deducts data from data warehouse by using rough sets' deduct function, and then moves the deducted data to the BP neural network as training data. By data deduct, the expression of training will become clearer, and the scale of neural network can be simplified. At the same time, neural network can easy up rough set's sensitivity for noise data.

This may be because AIS algorithms have previously been based on the adaptive immune system and biologically-naive models. This paper focuses on describing and testing a more complex and biologically-authentic AIS model, inspired by the interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Its performance on a realistic process anomaly detection problem is shown to be better than standard AIS methods (negative-selection), policy-based anomaly detection methods (systrace), and an alternative innate AIS approach (the DCA).

From the kinematic chain model, the human motion capture data is transformed to a spatial-temporal invariance representation called the motion feature representation, in which each segment of kinematic chain model is represented by an angle between itself and the root segment. We treat the human motion as a cluster of curves of angle. In the aim of finding a human motion capture data in a very large database, we propose a novel lower bounding distance called LB_Keogh_Lowe to speed up similarity search. In order to reduce the computational cost, we employ techniques to simplify the curves length of both the envelopes curves and the query data. The similarity between two human motions is measured by applying the constrained Dynamic Time Warping. We carry out an experimental analysis with various real motion capture dataset. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in the context of the human motion capture data and the potentiality to apply it in others contexts of the time-series data retrieval.

One of the most common source and the related methodology is to use radio-frequency ablation procedure. However, the rate of the risk of complications including arrhythmia recurrence remains enough high The drawback of the methodology used is that the suchlike destruction procedure cannot be monitored by visual spectra and results in the inability to control the ablation efficiency To the end of understanding the nature of possible complications and controlling the treating process, the means of thermovision could be used. The aim of the study was to analyse possible mechanisms of these complications, measure and determine optimal radio-frequency ablation parameters, according to the analysis of video data. acquired using thermovision	[Veikutis, Vincentas] Kaunas Univ Med, Inst Biomed Res, LT-3007 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dzemyda, Gintautas; Treigys, Povilas] Inst Math & Informat, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Morkunaite, Kristina] Kaunas Univ Med, Inst Cardiol, LT-3007 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Basevicius, Algidas; Lukosevicius, Saulius] Kaunas Univ Med, Dept Radiol, LT-3007 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sakalyte, Gintare] Kaunas Univ Med, Dept Cardiol, LT-3007 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sederevicius, Antanas] Lithuanian Vet Acad, LT-471813 Kaunas, Lithuania	Veikutis, V (reprint author), Kaunas Univ Med, Inst Biomed Res, Eiveniu 4, LT-3007 Kaunas, Lithuania.

Modern business process management frameworks provide great support for flexible design, deployment and management of business processes. However, integrating complex data mining services into such frameworks is not trivial due to unclear definitions of user roles and missing flexible data ruining services as well as missing standards and methods for the deployment of data mining solutions. This work contributes an integrated view on the definition of user roles for business, IT and data mining and discusses the integration of data mining in business processes and its evaluation in the context of BPR.

In the two approaches, the coding of the possible solutions is by binary strings, which form a discrete solution space. The paper extends the original approaches to continuous search space, and a fuzzy mining algorithm based on the improved ant approach is proposed. The improved ant approach doesn't have fixed paths and nodes and produces some paths in a dynamic way according to the distribution functions of pheromones.

The application domain is gossip about celebrities in the music world. The agent can inform herself and update the acquired knowledge by observing the web. Fans of musicians can ask for gossip information about stars, bands or people and groups related to them. This agent is built on top of information extraction, web mining, question answering and dialogue system technologies. The minimally supervised machine learning method for relation extraction gives the agent the capability to learn and update knowledge constantly from the web. The extracted relations are structured and linked with each other. Data mining is applied to the learned data to induce the social network among the artists and related people. The knowledge-intensive question answering technology enhanced by domain-specific inference and active memory allows the agent to have vivid and interactive conversations with users by utilizing natural language processing. Users can freely formulate their questions within the gossip data domain and access the answers in different ways: textual response, graph-based visualization of the related concepts and speech output.

It is a technique commonly used for statistical data analysis, and is also used in many other fields, including machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, image analysis, and bioinformatics, in which the distribution of information can be of any size and shape. An improved technique combining linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO) with an acceleration strategy is proposed in this paper. Accelerated linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (ALDWPSO) searches for cluster centers in an arbitrary data set and can effectively indentify the global optima. ALDWPSO is tested on six experimental data sets, and its performance is compared to the performance of PSO, NM-PSO, K-PSO, K-NM-PSO, LDWPSO and K-means clustering. Results indicate that ALDWPSO is both robust and suitable for solving data clustering problem.

Hadoop, a cloud computing project using the MapReduce framework in Java, has become of significant interest in distributed data mining. To resolve problems of globalization, random-write and duration in Hadoop, a data indexing approach on Hadoop using the Java Persistence API (JPA) is elaborated in the implementation of a KD-tree algorithm on Hadoop. An improved intersection algorithm for distributed data indexing on Hadoop is proposed, it performs O(M+logN), and is suitable for occasions of multiple intersections. We compare the data indexing algorithm on open dataset and synthetic dataset in a modest cloud environment. The results show the algorithms are feasible in large-scale data mining.

J	Yang, WJ; Qiao, SZ				Yang, Weijia; Qiao, Sanzheng			A novel anonymization algorithm: Privacy protection and knowledge preservation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Privacy protection; Data anonymization; Knowledge preservation		In data mining and knowledge discovery, there are two conflicting goals: privacy protection and knowledge preservation. On the one hand, we anonymize data to protect privacy; on the other hand, we allow miners to discover useful knowledge from anonymized data. In this paper, we present an anonymization method which provides both privacy protection and knowledge preservation. Unlike most anonymization methods, where data are generalized or permuted, our method anonymizes data by randomly breaking links among attribute values in records. By data randomization, our method maintains statistical relations among data to preserve knowledge, whereas in most anonymization methods, knowledge is lost. Thus the data anonymized by our method maintains useful knowledge for statistical study. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced algorithm for extra privacy protection to tackle the situation where the user's prior knowledge of original data may cause privacy leakage. The privacy levels and the accuracy of knowledge preservation of our method, along with their relations to the parameters in the method are analyzed. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is effective on both privacy protection and knowledge preservation comparing with existing methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unlike structured data, unstructured text data is more complicated to be analyzed because it contains too much information, e.g., syntactic and semantic. In this paper, we propose a semantics-based model to represent text data in two levels. One level is for syntactic information and the other is for semantic information. Syntactic level represents each document as a term vector, and the component records tf-idf value of each term. The semantic level represents document with Wikipedia concepts related to terms in syntactic level. The syntactic and semantic information are efficiently combined by our proposed multi-layer classification framework. Experimental results on benchmark dataset (Reuters-21578) have shown that the proposed representation model plus proposed classification framework improves the performance of text classification by comparing with the flat text representation models (term VSM, concept VSM, term+concept VSM) plus existing classification methods.

This paper analyzes the e-waste take-back and recycling systems, which is considered to be a service system. With the key stakeholders and their responsibilities clarified, the analysis focuses on the information flow management of the recycling system. With multiple authorities sharing the management of system's operation, the complexity of the information flow is very high. This paper proposes an information platform, to increase the efficiency of the information flow management and the efficiency of the recycling system. Three perspectives of the platform are explained: 1) information platform; 2) SaaS based ERP system for recyclers; 3) extension of the platform to include collection platform and transaction platform of recovered material. Furthermore, the data of the platform can be applied in further data analysis and data mining, to find better way to increase the eco-efficiency of the system.

Nowadays, coarse-grained data mining modules are used. This traditional black box approach focuses on specific algorithm improvements and is not flexible enough to be used for more general optimization and beneficial component reuse. The work presented in this paper elaborates on decomposing data mining tasks as data mining execution process plans which are composed of finer-grained data mining operators. The cost of an operator can be analyzed and provides means for more holistic optimizations. This process-based data mining concept is evaluated via an OGSA-DAI based implementations for association rule mining which show the feasibility of our approach as well as the re-usability of some of the data mining operators.

MCLP model is used as a classification method which can only solve linear separable problems in data mining. However, the proposed kernel-based MCLP model can deal with non-linear cases. Meanwhile, unlike some other complicated models, this model is effective and easy to understand. A couple of experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed kernel-based MCLP model compared with the existing methods: original MCLP and SVM. The results show that kernel-based MCLP model is a competitive method in dealing with nonlinear separable classification problems. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Most existing reliability estimation methods are usually limited in these areas because of the requirement of large sample. Furthermore, the large sample test is impractical in terms of implementation expense and time, since most product have the characteristics of high reliability, high cost and small sample. All of these challenges motivate us to propose a new reliability estimation method which can be applied for the special areas. In this paper, we investigate the reliability estimation modeling based on small sample and data mining of failure-physics to address these challenges. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance gains of our method through physical experiment and reliability estimation on Momentum Wheel of satellite.

Integer techniques, code tuning and profiling are absolutely essential in the world of the very small devices. We present three alternative methods of integer programming: scaling, fixed-point and rational arithmetic. These techniques are complemented by a brief review of bitwise and general optimisation techniques. As artifact of the usefulness of these techniques, we discuss the implementation details of a data mining algorithm that gained over a factor of 10 improvement in performance as a result of integer programming. We conclude by presenting a widely accepted time model adapted for a WSN platform.

J	Chen, KK; Liu, L				Chen, Keke; Liu, Ling			Privacy-Preserving Multiparty Collaborative Mining with Geometric Data Perturbation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy-preserving data mining; distributed computing; collaborative computing; geometric data perturbation		In multiparty collaborative data mining, participants contribute their own data sets and hope to collaboratively mine a comprehensive model based on the pooled data set. How to efficiently mine a quality model without breaching each party's privacy is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach based on geometric data perturbation and data mining service-oriented framework. The key problem of applying geometric data perturbation in multiparty collaborative mining is to securely unify multiple geometric perturbations that are preferred by different parties, respectively. We have developed three protocols for perturbation unification. Our approach has three unique features compared to the existing approaches: 1) with geometric data perturbation, these protocols can work for many existing popular data mining algorithms, while most of other approaches are only designed for a particular mining algorithm; 2) both the two major factors: data utility and privacy guarantee are well preserved, compared to other perturbation-based approaches; and 3) two of the three proposed protocols also have great scalability in terms of the number of participants, while many existing cryptographic approaches consider only two or a few more participants. We also study different features of the three protocols and show the advantages of different protocols in experiments.

J	Howington, EB; Gray, JB				Howington, Eric B.; Gray, J. Brian			Matrix-Based Genetic Algorithm for Computing the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Data mining; genetic algorithm (GA); outliers; robust covariance estimation; robust diagnostics	MULTIVARIATE LOCATION; MULTIPLE OUTLIERS; ESTIMATORS; POINTS; DESIGN; SHAPE	The minimum volume ellipsoid (MVE) is a useful tool in multivariate statistics and data mining. It is used for computing robust multivariate outlier diagnostics and for calculating robust covariance matrix estimates. Various search algorithms for finding or approximating the MVE have been developed, but due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, exact computation of the MVE is impractical for all but the smallest datasets. Since large datasets are increasingly common, alternative algorithms are desired. Even among small datasets, performance of the existing algorithms varies considerably-no single algorithm dominates in performance. This paper presents a unique matrix-structured genetic algorithm (GA) that directly searches the ellipsoid space for the MVE. By directly searching the space of ellipsoids, the impact of the combinatorial nature of the problem is minimized. The matrix-structured GA is described in detail, and evidence is provided to illustrate the performance of the new algorithm in detecting multivariate outliers.

In this paper, we focus on mining sequential patterns in the business-to-business (B2B) environment. Because customers' sequences in the B2B environment are very long, and almost all items are frequently purchased by all customers, using traditional methods may result in a large number of uninteresting and meaningless patterns and a long computational time. To solve these problems, we introduce three conditions (constraints) - compactness, repetition, and recency - and consider them jointly with frequency in selecting sequential patterns. An efficient algorithm is developed to discover frequent sequential patterns which satisfy the conditions. Empirical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and effective in extracting useful sequential patterns in the B2B environment.

J	Tu, YN; Seng, JL				Tu, Yi-Ning; Seng, Jia-Lang			Research intelligence involving information retrieval - An example of conferences and journals	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Citation analysis; Scientific web intelligence; Topic discovery and tracking; Data mining; Information retrieval; Academic intelligence	TEXT MINING APPROACH; ONLINE IMPACT; MODEL	This paper reports a work that was intended to reveal the connection between topics investigated by conference papers and journal papers. This work selected hundreds of papers in data mining and information retrieval from well-known databases and showed that the topics covered by conference papers in a year often leads to similar topics covered by journal papers in the subsequent year and vice versa. This study used some existing algorithms and combination of these algorithms to proposed a new detective procedure for the researchers to detect the new trend and get the academic intelligence from conferences and journals. The goal of this research is fourfold: First, the research investigates if the conference papers' themes lead the journal papers'. Second, the research examines how the new research themes can be identified from the conference papers. Third, the research looks at a specific area such as information retrieval and data mining as an illustration. Fourth, the research studies any inconsistencies of the correlation between the conference papers and the journal papers. This study explores the connections between the academic publications. The methodologies of information retrieval and data mining can be exploited to discover the relationships between published papers among all topics. By discovering the connections between conference papers and journal papers, researchers can improve the effectiveness of their research by identifying academic intelligence, This Study discusses how conference papers and journal papers are related. The topics of conference papers are identified to determine whether they represent new trend discussed in journal papers. An automatic examination procedure based on information retrieval and data mining is also proposed to minimize the time and human resources required to predict further research developments. This study develops a new procedure and collects a dataset to verify those problems. Analytical results demonstrate that the conference papers Submitted to journals papers are similar each year. Conference papers certainly affect the journal papers published over three years. About 87.23% of data points from papers published in 1991-2007 support our assumption. The research is intended to help researchers identify new trend in their research fields, and focus on the urgent topics. This is particularly valuable for new researchers in their field, or those who wish to perform cross-domain studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wan, Q; An, AJ				Wan, Qian; An, Aijun			Discovering Transitional Patterns and Their Significant Milestones in Transaction Databases	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; association rule; frequent pattern; transitional pattern; significant milestone	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION RULES; GROWTH	A transaction database usually consists of a set of time-stamped transactions. Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases has been studied extensively in data mining research. However, most of the existing frequent pattern mining algorithms (such as Apriori and FP-growth) do not consider the time stamps associated with the transactions. In this paper, we extend the existing frequent pattern mining framework to take into account the time stamp of each transaction and discover patterns whose frequency dramatically changes over time. We define a new type of patterns, called transitional patterns, to capture the dynamic behavior of frequent patterns in a transaction database. Transitional patterns include both positive and negative transitional patterns. Their frequencies increase/decrease dramatically at some time points of a transaction database. We introduce the concept of significant milestones for a transitional pattern, which are time points at which the frequency of the pattern changes most significantly. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to mine from a transaction database the set of transitional patterns along with their significant milestones. Our experimental studies on real-world databases illustrate that mining positive and negative transitional patterns is highly promising as a practical and useful approach for discovering novel and interesting knowledge from large databases.

However, most researches neglect a fundamental issue - the e-Learners prior knowledge oil which the useful intelligent systems arc, based. This research employs the e-Learner's prior knowledge and mines his/her interior desire oil appropriate target courses or materials as a part of a personalization process to construct the overall e-Learning strategy for education. This paper illustrates a novel web usage mining approach, based oil the sequence mining technique applied to e-Learners navigation behaviour, to discover patterns in the navigation of e-Learning websites. Three critical contributions are made in this paper: (1) using the footstep graph to visualize the e-Learners click-stream data so any interesting pattern can be detected more easily and quickly; (2) illustrating a novel sequence mining approach to identify pre-designated e-Learner navigation patterns automatically and integrating a back-propagation network (BPN) model smoothly; and (3) applying the empirical research to indicate that the proposed approach call predict and categorize the e-Learners' navigation behaviour with high accuracy.

This problem is particularly acute in the case of remotely sensed imagery. The continuous stream of sensory data from satellites poses major challenges in storage and retrieval of the satellite imagery. In the mean time, the ubiquity of Internet has resulted into an ever-growing population of users searching for various forms of information. in this paper, we describe the search engine SIMR-Satellite Image Matching and Retrieval system. SIMR Provides an efficient means to match remotely sensed imagery. It computes spectral and spatial attributes of the images using a hierarchical representation. A unique aspect of our approach is the coupling of second-level spatial autocorrelation with quad tree structure. The efficiency of the web-based SIMR has been evaluated using a database of images with known characteristics: cities, towns, airports, lakes, and mountains. Results show that the integrated signature can be an effective basis for accurately searching databases of satellite based imagery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Hegami, A				Al-Hegami, Ahmed			Pruning Based Interestingness of Mined Classification Patterns	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Knowledge discovery in databases; data mining; decision tree; domain knowledge; interestingness; novelty measure		Classification is an important problem in data,mining. Decision free induction is one of the most common techniques that are applied to solve the classification problem. Many decision tree induction algorithms have been proposed based on different attribute selection and pruning strategies. Although the patterns induced by decision trees are easy to interpret and comprehend compare to the patterns induced by other classification algorithms, the constructed decision trees may contain hundreds or thousand of nodes which are difficult to comprehend and interpret by the user who examines the patterns. For this reasons, the question of an appropriate constructing and providing a good pruning criteria have long been a topic of considerable debate. The main objective of such criteria is to create a tree such that the classification accuracy, when used on unseen data, is maximized and the tree size is minimized. Usually, most of decision tree algorithms perform splitting criteria to construct a tree first, then, prune the tree to find an accurate, simple, and comprehensible free. Even after pruning, the decision tree constructed may he extremely huge and may reflect patterns, which are not interesting from the user point of view. In many scenarios, users are only interested in obtaining patterns that are interesting; thus, users may require obtaining a simple, and interpretable, but on v approximate decision tree much better than an accurate tree that involves a. lot of details. In this paper, we proposed a pruning approach that captures the user subjectivity to discoverer interesting patterns. The approach computes the subjective interestingness and uses it as a pruning criterion to prime away uninteresting patterns. The proposed framework helps in reducing the size of the induced model and maintaining the model. One of the features of the proposed approach is to capture the user background knowledge, which is monotonically augmented. The experimental results are quite promising.

J	Goh, YM; Giess, M; McMahon, C				Goh, Yee Mey; Giess, Matt; McMahon, Chris			Facilitating design learning through faceted classification of in-service information	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article							MAINTENANCE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODELS	The maintenance and service records collected and maintained by engineering companies are a useful resource for the ongoing support of products. Such records are typically semi-structured and contain key information such as a description of the issue and the product affected. it is suggested that further value can be realised from the collection of these records for indicating recurrent and systemic issues which may not have been apparent previously. This paper presents a faceted classification approach to organise the information collection that might enhance retrieval and also facilitate learning from in-service experiences. The faceted classification may help to expedite responses to urgent in-service issues as well as to allow for patterns and trends in the records to be analysed, either automatically using suitable data mining algorithms or by manually browsing the classification tree. The paper describes the application of the approach to aerospace in-service records, where the potential for knowledge discovery is demonstrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guha, S; McGregor, A; Venkatasubramanian, S				Guha, Sudipto; McGregor, Andrew; Venkatasubramanian, Suresh			Sublinear Estimation of Entropy and Information Distances	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS			English	Article						Data streams; entropy; information divergences; property testing	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; COMMUNICATION; DIVERGENCE; COMPLEXITY	In many data mining and machine learning problems, the data items that need to be clustered or classified are not arbitrary points in a high-dimensional space, but are distributions, that is, points on a high-dimensional simplex. For distributions, natural measures are not l(p) distances, but information-theoretic measures such as the Kullback-Leibler and Hellinger divergences. Similarly, quantities such as the entropy of a distribution are more natural than frequency moments. Efficient estimation of these quantities is a key component in algorithms for manipulating distributions. Since the datasets involved are typically massive, these algorithms need to have only sublinear complexity in order to be feasible in practice. We present a range of sublinear-time algorithms in various oracle models in which the algorithm accesses the data via an oracle that supports various queries. In particular, we answer a question posed by Batu et al. on testing whether two distributions are close in an information-theoretic sense given independent samples. We then present optimal algorithms for estimating various information-divergences and entropy with a more powerful oracle called the combined oracle that was also considered by Batu et al. Finally, we consider sublinear-space algorithms for these quantities in the data-stream model. In the course of doing so, we explore the relationship between the aforementioned oracle models and the data-stream model. This continues work initiated by Feigenbaum et al. An important additional component to the study is considering data streams that are ordered randomly rather than just those which are ordered adversarially.

Especially, the usage of mobile phones and PDA is increased very rapidly. Added functions and values with these devices are thus greatly developed. If some regularity can be known from the user mobility behavior, then these functions and values can be further expanded and used intelligently. This paper thus attempts to discover personal mobility patterns for helping systems provide personalized service in a wireless network. The classification and the duration of each location area visited by a mobile user are used as important attributes in representing the results. A data mining algorithm has then been proposed, which is based on the AprioriAll algorithm, but different from it in several ways. Experiments are also made to show the effect of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, HF				Li, Hua-Fu			Mining top-k maximal reference sequences from streaming web click-sequences with a damped sliding window	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Web usage mining; Data streams; Top-k pattern mining; Path traversal patterns; Damped sliding windows	PATH TRAVERSAL PATTERNS; FREQUENT ITEMSETS	Online mining of path traversal patterns from continuous Web click streams is one of the challenging research problems of Web usage mining. Most of previous works focus on mining path traversal patterns over the entire history of Web click streams. Mining the recent changes of Web click streams can provide valuable information for the analysis of the Web click streams. In this paper, we propose a new, online mining algorithm, called Top-DSW (top-k path traversal patterns of stream Damped Sliding Window), to discover the set of top-k path traversal patterns from streaming maximal forward references, where k is the desired number of path traversal patterns to be mined. An effective summary data structure, called TKP-DSW-list (a list of top-k path traversal patterns of stream Damped Sliding Windows) is developed to maintain the essential information about the top-k path traversal patterns from the maximal forward references within a stream damped sliding window. An effective space pruning mechanism, called TKR-list-maintain, is developed to control the memory requirement of the TKP-DSW-list. Experimental studies show that the proposed Top-DSW algorithm is an efficient, single-pass algorithm for online mining of the set of top-k path traversal patterns over stream damped sliding windows.

Compared with traditional ISP networks, an IPTV distribution network (i) typically adopts a hierarchical instead of mesh-like structure, (ii) imposes more stringent requirements on both reliability and performance, (iii) has different distribution protocols (which make heavy use of IP multicast) and traffic patterns, and (iv) faces more serious scalability challenges in managing millions of network elements. These unique characteristics impose tremendous challenges in the effective management of IPTV network and service. In this paper, we focus on characterizing and troubleshooting performance issues in one of the largest IPTV networks in North America. We collect a large amount of measurement data from a wide range of sources, including device usage and error logs, user activity logs, video quality alarms, and customer trouble tickets. We develop a novel diagnosis tool called Giza that is specifically tailored to the enormous scale and hierarchical structure of the IPTV network. Giza applies multi-resolution data analysis to quickly detect and localize regions in the IPTV distribution hierarchy that are experiencing serious performance problems. Giza then uses several statistical data mining techniques to troubleshoot the identified problems and diagnose their root causes. Validation against operational experiences demonstrates the effectiveness of Giza in detecting important performance issues and identifying interesting dependencies. The methodology and algorithms in Giza promise to be of great use in IPTV network operations.

J	Zhang, SC; Zhang, JL; Jin, Z				Zhang, Shichao; Zhang, Jilian; Jin, Zhi			A decremental algorithm of frequent itemset maintenance for mining updated databases	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Incremental mining; Decremental mining; Dynamic database mining		Data-mining and machine learning must confront the problem of pattern maintenance because data update is a fundamental operation in data management. Most existing data-mining algorithms assume that the database is static, and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new data. While there are many efficient mining techniques for data additions to databases, in this paper, we propose a decremental algorithm for pattern discovery when data is deleted from databases. We conduct extensive experiments for evaluating this approach, and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can well model and capture useful interactions within data when the data is decreasing.

J	Kim, H; Chen, SS				Kim, Hyunki; Chen, Su-Shing			Associative Naive Bayes classifier: Automated linking of gene ontology to medline documents	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Gene ontology; Document classification		We demonstrate a text-mining method, called associative Naive Bayes (ANB) classifier, for automated linking of MEDLINE documents to gene ontology (GO). The approach of this paper is a nontrivial extension of document classification methodology from a fixed set of classes C = {c(1),c(2),...,c(n)} to a knowledge hierarchy like GO. Due to the complexity of GO, we use a knowledge representation structure. With that structure, we develop the text mining classifier, called ANB classifier, which automatically links Medline documents to GO. To check the performance, we compare our datasets under several well-known classifiers: NB classifier, large Bayes classifier, support vector machine and ANB classifier. Our results, described in the following, indicate its practical usefulness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The reasons therefore lie in the difficulties of handling and statistically analyzing medical data. We have developed a system that allows practitioners in the field to interactively analyze their data without assistance of statisticians or data mining experts. In the course of this paper we will introduce data mining of medical data and show how this can be achieved for survival data. We will demonstrate how to solve common problems of interactive survival analysis by presenting the Online Clinical Data Mining (OCDM) system. Thereby the main focus is on similarity based queries, a new method to select similar cases based on their covariables and the influence of these on their survival.

This caused a new interdisciplinary field of data mining to arise, encompassing both classical statistical, and modern machine learning techniques to support the data analysis and knowledge discovery from data. Data mining methods are powerful in dealing with large quantities of data, but on the other hand they are difficult to master by business users to facilitate decision support. In this paper we introduce our approach to integration of decision support system with data mining method called classification. We discuss the role of data mining to facilitate decision support, the use of classification method in decision support system, discuss applied approaches and introduce a data mining decision support system called DMDSS (Data Mining Decision Support System). We also present some obtained results and plans for future development.

J	Shafti, LS; Perez, E				Shafti, Leila S.; Perez, Eduardo			Evolutionary multi-feature construction for data reduction: A case study	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Feature construction; Non-algebraic feature; Attribute interaction; Machine learning; Data reduction	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DISCRETIZATION; ATTRIBUTES	Real-world data are often prepared for purposes other than data mining and machine learning and, therefore, are represented by primitive attributes. When data representation is primitive, preprocessing data before looking for patterns becomes necessary. The low-level primitive representation of real-world problems facilitates the existence of complex interactions among attributes. If lack of domain experts prevents traditional methods to uncover patterns in data due to complex attribute interactions, then the use of soft computing techniques such as genetic algorithms becomes necessary. This article introduces MFE3/GA(DR), a data reduction method derived from the learning preprocessing system MFE3/GA. The method restructures the primitive data representation by capturing and compacting hidden information into new features in order to highlight regularities to the learner. We thoroughly analyze the empirical results obtained on the poker hand data set. The results show that this approach successfully compacts the set of low-level primitive attributes into a smaller set of highly informative features which outline patterns to the learner; thus, the new approach provides data reduction and yields learning a smaller and more accurate classifier.

J	Tang, FH; Ip, HSH				Tang, Fuk-hay; Ip, H. S. Horace			Image fusion enhancement of deformable human structures using a two-stage warping-deformable strategy: A content-based image retrieval consideration	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Image registration; Warping; Deformable; Matching; Fusion	MR-IMAGES; REGISTRATION; DEFORMATIONS; LIVER; CT	In medical image registration and content-based image retrieval, the rigid transformation model is not adequate for anatomical structures that are elastic or deformable. For human structures such as abdomen, registration would involve global features such as abdominal wall as well as local target organs such as liver or spleen. A general non-rigid registration may not be sufficient to produce image matching of both global and local structures. In this study, a warping-deformable model is proposed to register images of such structures. This model uses a two-stage strategy for image registration of abdomen. In the first stage, the global-deformable transformation is used to register the global wall. The warping-transformation is used in second stage to register the liver. There is a good match of images using the proposed method (mean similarity index = 0.73545).The image matching correlation coefficients calculated from eight pairs of CT and MR images of abdomen indicates that the warping-deformable transformation gives better matching of images than those without transformation (p < 0.001, paired t-test). This study has established a model for image registration of deformable structures. This is particularly important for data mining of image content retrieval for structures which are non-rigid. The result obtained is very promising but further clinical evaluation is needed.	[Tang, Fuk-hay] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Hlth Technol & Informat, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ip, H. S.

Based on the existing solutions a new method of knowledge extraction in the form of spatial association rules and collocations has been worked out and is proposed herein. Delaunay diagram is used for determining neighborhoods. Based on the neighborhood notion, spatial association rules and collocations are defined. A novel algorithm for finding spatial rules and collocations has been presented. The approach allows eliminating the parameters defining neighborhood of objects, thus avoiding multiple "test and trial" repetitions of the process of mining for various parameter values. The presented method has been implemented and tested. The results of the experiments have been discussed.

However, effectively and efficiently handling and analyzing MS data requires to take into account a number of issues. In particular, the huge dimensionality and the variety of noisy factors present in MS data require careful preprocessing and modeling phases in order to make them amenable to the further analysis. In this paper we present MaSDA, a system performing advanced analysis on MS data. MaSDA has the following main features: (i) it implements an approach of MS data representation that exploits a model based on low dimensional, dense time series; (ii) it provides a wide set of MS preprocessing operations which are accomplished by means of a user-friendly graphical tool; (iii) it embeds a number of tools implementing various tasks of data mining and knowledge discovery, in order to assist the user in taking critical clinical decisions. our system has been experimentally tested on several publicly available datasets, showing effectiveness and efficiency in supporting advanced analysis of MS data.

J	Huang, HS; Yang, BH; Chang, YM; Hsu, CN				Huang, Han-Shen; Yang, Bo-Hou; Chang, Yu-Ming; Hsu, Chun-Nan			Global and componentwise extrapolations for accelerating training of Bayesian networks and conditional random fields	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Bayesian networks; Conditional random fields; Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm; Generalized iterative scaling; Aitken's extrapolation	EM ALGORITHM; PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; CONVERGENCE; INFORMATION; INDUCTION	The triple jump extrapolation method is an effective approximation of Aitken's acceleration that can accelerate the convergence of many algorithms for data mining, including EM and generalized iterative scaling (GIS). It has two options-global and componentwise extrapolation. Empirical studies showed that neither can dominate the other and it is not known which one is better under what condition. In this paper, we investigate this problem and conclude that, when the Jacobian is (block) diagonal, componentwise extrapolation will be more effective. We derive two hints to determine the block diagonality. The first hint is that when we have a highly sparse data set, the Jacobian of the EM mapping for training a Bayesian network will be block diagonal. The second is that the block diagonality of the Jacobian of the GIS mapping for training CRF is negatively correlated with the strength of feature dependencies. We empirically verify these hints with controlled and real-world data sets and show that our hints can accurately predict which method will be superior. We also show that both global and componentwise extrapolation can provide substantial acceleration. In particular, when applied to train large-scale CRF models, the GIS variant accelerated by componentwise extrapolation not only outperforms its global extrapolation counterpart, as our hint predicts, but can also compete with limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS), the de facto standard for CRF training, in terms of both computational efficiency and F-scores. Though none of the above methods are as fast as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), careful tuning is required for SGD and the results given in this paper provide a useful foundation for automatic tuning.

We develop a new method to automatically partition tools. The new method is called tolerance control partitioning (TCP). The advantages of TCP include 1) taking into account of unbalanced tool usage in manufacturing processes; 2) further partitioning these tools into several homogenous groups by related metrology results instead of detecting only the significant difference; and 3) partitioning these tools according to engineers' tolerance controls to avoid too many groups with small differences. TCP also could be applied in all similar cases such as experimental recipe or material comparisons. Therefore, using TCP, engineers could speed up yield or product quality ramping.

In this paper, we propose a general framework based on the decision tree for mining and processing image data. Pixel-wised image features were extracted and transformed into a database-like table which allows various data mining algorithms to make explorations on it. Each tuple of the transformed table has a feature descriptor formed by a set of features in conjunction with the target label of a particular pixel. With the label feature, we can adopt the decision tree induction to realize relationships between attributes and the target label from image pixels, and to construct a model for pixel-wised image processing according to a given training image dataset. Both experimental and theoretical analyses were performed in this study. Their results show that the proposed model can be very efficient and effective for image processing and image mining. It is anticipated that by using the proposed model, various existing data mining and image processing methods could be worked on together in different ways. Our model can also be used to create new image processing methodologies, refine existing image processing methods, or act as a powerful image filter.

We introduce a complementary problem: How to guide a seller in selecting the best attributes of a new tuple (e.g., a new product) to highlight so that it stands out in the crowd of existing competitive products and is widely visible to the pool of potential buyers. We develop several formulations of this problem. Although the problems are NP-complete, we give several exact and approximation algorithms that work well in practice. One type of exact algorithms is based on Integer Programming (IP) formulations of the problems. Another class of exact methods is based on maximal frequent item set mining algorithms. The approximation algorithms are based on greedy heuristics. A detailed performance study illustrates the benefits of our methods on real and synthetic data.

In this work, we use data mining techniques to search for rules that indicate modules with a high probability of being defective. Using datasets from the PROMISE repository1, we first applied feature selection to work only with those attributes from the datasets capable of predicting defective modules. Then, a genetic algorithm search for rules characterising subgroups with a high probability of being defective. This algorithm overcomes the problem of unbalanced datasets where the number of non-defective samples in the dataset highly outnumbers the defective ones.	[Riquelme, J.

J	Tsamardinos, I; Triantafillou, S				Tsamardinos, Ioannis; Triantafillou, Sofia			The possibility of integrative causal analysis: learning from different datasets and studies	ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IFIP Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations	APR 23-25, 2009	Thessaloniki, GREECE	IFIP			METAANALYSIS; NETWORKS	The current statistical, machine learning, and data mining (data analysis) algorithms available are only suited for analyzing single datasets (studies) in isolation. The findings of the analysis and the knowledge produced (e.g,. important predicting variables and risk-factors, rules for prediction, etc.) are published and this knowledge is then manually synthesized within the human brain. In this paper we argue that this process can be further automated: it is possible to develop algorithms that integratively analyze (co-analyze) data from different studies with different characteristics and measured quantities (variables). To develop such algorithms, we further argue that modeling and inducing causal relations is necessary. We call this process Integrative Causal Analysis or INCA. We present three cases and corresponding existing or newly developed algorithms and techniques that illustrate the feasibility of integrative causal analysis and the key enabling ideas. Specifically, we discuss algorithms for learning causal relations from (a) data obtained over different experimental conditions, (b) data over different variable sets, and (c) data over semantically similar variables that nevertheless cannot be pulled together for various technical reasons. The latter case particularly, often occurs in the setting of analyzing multiple gene-expression datasets. The grand vision of Integrative Causal Analysis is to enable the automated or semi-automated, large-scale integration of a large part of the available data to construct causal models involving a significant part of human concepts.

J	Yu, LA; Wang, SY; Lai, KK				Yu, Lean; Wang, Shouyang; Lai, Kin Keung			Forecasting foreign exchange rates with an improved back-propagation learning algorithm with adaptive smoothing momentum terms	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IN CHINA			English	Article						back-propagation neural network; adaptive smoothing momentum; heuristic method; foreign exchange rates forecasting		The slow convergence of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) has become a challenge in data-mining and knowledge discovery applications due to the drawbacks of the gradient descent (GD) optimization method, which is widely adopted in BPNN learning. To solve this problem, some standard optimization techniques such as conjugate-gradient and Newton method have been proposed to improve the convergence rate of BP learning algorithm. This paper presents a heuristic method that adds an adaptive smoothing momentum term to original BP learning algorithm to speedup the convergence. In this improved BP learning algorithm, adaptive smoothing technique is used to adjust the momentums of weight updating formula automatically in terms of "3 sigma limits theory." Using the adaptive smoothing momentum terms, the improved BP learning algorithm can make the network training and convergence process faster, and the network's generalization performance stronger than the standard BP learning algorithm can do. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed BP learning algorithm, three typical foreign exchange rates, British pound (GBP), Euro (EUR), and Japanese yen (JPY), are chosen as the forecasting targets for illustration purpose. Experimental results from homogeneous algorithm comparisons reveal that the proposed BP learning algorithm outperforms the other comparable BP algorithms in performance and convergence rate. Furthermore, empirical results from heterogeneous model comparisons also show the effectiveness of the proposed BP learning algorithm.

J	Chen, HL; Chen, MS; Lin, SC				Chen, Hung-Leng; Chen, Ming-Syan; Lin, Su-Chen			Catching the Trend: A Framework for Clustering Concept-Drifting Categorical Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; categorical clustering; data labeling	MULTIPLE EVOLVING STREAMS	Sampling has been recognized as an important technique to improve the efficiency of clustering. However, with sampling applied, those points that are not sampled will not have their labels after the normal process. Although there is a straightforward approach in the numerical domain, the problem of how to allocate those unlabeled data points into proper clusters remains as a challenging issue in the categorical domain. In this paper, a mechanism named MAximal Resemblance Data Labeling (abbreviated as MARDL) is proposed to allocate each unlabeled data point into the corresponding appropriate cluster based on the novel categorical clustering representative, namely, N-Nodeset Importance Representative(abbreviated as NNIR), which represents clusters by the importance of the combinations of attribute values. MARDL has two advantages: 1) MARDL exhibits high execution efficiency, and 2) MARDL can achieve high intracluster similarity and low intercluster similarity, which are regarded as the most important properties of clusters, thus benefiting the analysis of cluster behaviors. MARDL is empirically validated on real and synthetic data sets and is shown to be significantly more efficient than prior works while attaining results of high quality.

J	Nin, J; Torra, V				Nin, Jordi; Torra, Vicenc			Analysis of the Univariate Microaggregation Disclosure Risk	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						Privacy on Statistical Databases; Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Record Linkage; Microaggregation; DTW Distance	DATA-ORIENTED MICROAGGREGATION; RECORD-LINKAGE; MULTIVARIATE MICROAGGREGATION; K-ANONYMITY; ALGORITHMS	Microaggregation is a protection method used by statistical agencies to limit the disclosure risk of confidential information. Formally, microaggregation assigns each original datum to a small cluster and then replaces the original data with the centroid of such cluster. As clusters contain at least k records, microaggregation can be considered as preserving k-anonymity. Nevertheless, this is only so when multivariate microaggregation is applied and, moreover, when all variables are microaggregated at the same time. When different variables are protected using univariate microaggregation, k-anonymity is only ensured at the variable level. Therefore, the real k-anonymity decreases for most of the records and it is then possible to cause a leakage of privacy. Due to this, the analysis of the disclosure risk is still meaningful in microaggregation. This paper proposes a new record linkage method for univariate microaggregation based on finding the optimal alignment between the original and the protected sorted variables. We show that our method, which uses a DTW distance to compute the optimal alignment, provides the intruder with enough information in many cases to to decide if the link is correct or not. Note that, standard record linkage methods never ensure the correctness of the linkage. Furthermore, we present some experiments using two well-known data sets, which show that our method has better results (larger number of correct links) than the best standard record linkage method.

Private multiparty sampling and approximation of vector combinations	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Secure multiparty computation; Sublinear-communication algorithms; Approximation algorithms	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL	We consider the problem of private efficient data mining of vertically-partitioned databases. Each of several parties holds a column of a data matrix (a vector) and the parties want to investigate the componentwise combination of their vectors. The parties want to minimize communication and local computation while guaranteeing privacy in the sense that no party learns more than necessary. Sublinear-communication private protocols have primarily been studied only in the two-party case. In contrast, this work focuses on Multiparty settings. First, we give efficient private multiparty protocols for sampling a row of the data matrix and for computing arbitrary functions of a random row, where the row index is additively shared among two or more parties. These results can be used to obtain private approximation protocols for several useful combination functionalities. Moreover, these results have some interesting consequences for the general problem of reducing sublinear-communication secure multiparty computation to two-party private information retrieval (PIR). Second, we give protocols for computing approximations (summaries) of the componentwise sum, minimum, and maximum of the columns. Here, while providing a weaker privacy guarantee (where the approximation may leak up to the entire output vector), our protocols are extremely efficient. In particular, the required cryptographic overhead (compared to non-private solutions) is polylogarithmic in the number of rows. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The datasets generated by applying A and B to the disease are called contrast groups and, main differences between the groups are the mean and distribution differences, referred to structural differences in this paper. However, contrast groups are only two samples obtained by limited applications or tests on A and B, and may be with missing values. Therefore, the differences derived from the groups are inevitably uncertain. In this paper, we propose a statistically sound approach for measuring this uncertainty by identifying the confidence intervals of structural differences between contrast groups. This method is designed significantly against most of those applications whose exact data distributions are unknown a priori, and the data may also be with missing values. We apply our approach to LICI datasets to illustrate its power as a new data mining technique for, such as, distinguishing spam from non-spam emails; and the benign breast cancer from the malign one.

Finding "persistent rules": Combining association and classification results	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association mining; Classification; Persistent rules; Strong rules		Different data mining algorithms applied to the same data can result in similar findings, typically in the form of rules. These similarities can be exploited to identify especially powerful rules, in particular those that are common to the different algorithms. This research focuses on the independent application of association and classification mining algorithms to the same data to discover common or similar rules, which are deemed "persistent-rules". The persistent-rule discovery process is demonstrated and tested against two data sets drawn from the American National Election Studies: one data set used to predict voter turnout and the second used to predict vote choice.

However, for many practical machine learning and data mining applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available but labeled ones are very expensive to be obtained. Therefore, semi-supervised learning emerges as the times require. At present, the combination of SVM and semi-supervised learning principle such as transductive learning has attracted more and more attentions. Transductive support vector machine (TSVM) learns a large margin hyperplane classifier using labeled training data, but simultaneously force this hyperplane to be far away from the unlabeled data. TSVM might seem to be the perfect semi-supervised algorithm since it combines the powerful regularization of SVMs and a direct implementation of the clustering assumption, nevertheless its objective function is non-convex and then it is difficult to be optimized. This paper aims to solve this difficult problem. We apply least square support vector machine to implement TSVM, which can ensure that the objective function is convex and the optimization solution can then be easily found by solving a set of linear equations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can exploit unlabeled data to yield good performance effectively.

Recently there have been proposed new algorithms for the basic clustering problem for massive data sets that produce an approximate solution using efficiently the memory, which is the most critical resource for streaming computation.

Motivated by this challenge, much effort has concentrated on developing scalable versions of machine learning algorithms. However, the cost of mining large datasets is not just computational; preparing the datasets into the "right form" so that learning algorithms can be applied is usually costly, due to the human labor that is typically required and a large number of choices in data preparation, which include selecting different subsets of data and aggregating data at different granularities. We make the key observation that, for a number of practically motivated problems, these choices can be defined using database queries and analyzed in an automatic and systematic manner. Specifically, we propose a new class of data-mining problem, called bellwether analysis, in which the goal is to find a few query-defined predictors (e. g., first week sales of Peoria, IL of an item) that can be used to accurately predict the result of a target query (e. g., first year worldwide sales of the item) from a large number of queries that define candidate predictors. To make a prediction for a new item, the data needed to generate such predictors has to be collected (e. g., selling the new item in Peoria, IL for a week and collecting the sales data). A useful predictor is one that has high prediction accuracy and a low data-collection cost. We call such a cost-effective predictor a bellwether. This article introduces bellwether analysis, which integrates database query processing and predictive modeling into a single framework, and provides scalable algorithms for large datasets that cannot fit in main memory. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that bellwethers do exist in real-world databases, and that our computation techniques achieve good efficiency on large datasets.

J	Hong, TP; Huang, CM; Horng, SJ				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Huang, Cheng-Ming; Horng, Shi-Jinn			Discovering fuzzy personal moving profiles in wireless networks	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy set; Personal mobility pattern; Location area; Home location register	MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; LOCATION MANAGEMENT; MOBILITY MANAGEMENT; INDUCTION; PATTERNS; STRATEGY; TIME; ATTRIBUTES; RULES	Wireless networks and mobile applications have grown very rapidly and have made a significant impact on computer systems. Especially, the usage of mobile phones and PDA is increased very rapidly. Added functions and values with these devices are thus greatly developed. If some regularity can be known from the user mobility behavior, then these functions and values can be further expanded and used intelligently. This paper thus attempts to discover fuzzy personal mobility patterns for helping systems provide personalized service in a wireless network. The arrival time and the duration time of each location area visited by a mobile user are used as important attributes in representing the results. Since both the arrival time and the duration time are numeric, fuzzy concepts are used to process them and to form linguistic terms. A fuzzy mining algorithm has then been proposed, which is based on the AprioriAll algorithm, but different from it in several ways. The difference causes a delicate consideration in the design of the algorithm. An example is also given to demonstrate the algorithm. The linguistic representation of personal mobility patterns will be more natural and understandable for the system managers to provide better personalized service in a wireless network.

J	Lu, CL; Chen, TC				Lu, Chi-Lin; Chen, Ta-Cheng			A study of applying data mining approach to the information disclosure for Taiwan's stock market investors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Information disclosure; Data mining; Classification rule	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION	The financial literature and practices have shown the importance of corporate governance for decades, not only for firm's management but also for investor protection. Information disclosure plays a key role in all of the governance mechanisms. With good information disclosure, the asymmetric information and the agency cost between the insider and the outsider of firms call be reduced effectively. However, the information disclosure status of listed companies is hard to be evaluated or judged by investors before the annual official announcement is reported in the next year. The main purpose of this study is to explore the hidden knowledge of information disclosure status among the listed companies in Taiwan's stock market. In this paper, we employed decision tree-based mining techniques to explore the classification rules of information transparency levels of the listed firms in Taiwan's stock market. Moreover, the multi-learner model constructed by boosting ensemble approach with decision tree algorithm has been applied. The numerical results show that the classification accuracy has been improved by using multi-leaner model in terms of less Type I and Type II errors. In particular, the extracted rules from the data mining approach can be developed as a computer model for the prediction or the classification of good/poor information disclosure potential and like expert systems.

J	Wang, SL				Wang, Shyue-Liang			Maintenance of sanitizing informative association rules	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Privacy preserving data mining; Informative association rule; Sanitization; Maintenance		We propose here an efficient data mining algorithm to sanitize informative association rules when the database is updated, i.e., when a new data set is added to the original database. For a given predicting item, an informative association rule set [Li, J., Shen. Hong, & Topor, R. (2001). Mining the smallest association rule set for predictions. In Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE international conference on data mining (pp. 361-368)] is the smallest association rule set that makes the same prediction as the entire association rule set by confidence priority. Several approaches to sanitize informative association rules from static databases have been proposed [Wang, S. L, Parikh, B., & Jafari, A. (2007). Hiding informative association rule sets. Expert Systems with Applications, 33(2), 316-323 and Wang, S. L., Maskey, R., Jafari, A., & Hong, T. P. (2007). Efficient sanitization of informative association rules. Expert Systems with Applications. doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2007.07.039]. However, frequent updates to the database may require repeated sanitization of original database and added data sets. The efforts of previous sanitization are not utilized in these approaches. In this work, we propose using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan. It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database. Various characteristics of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Numerical experiments and running time analyses show that the proposed approach out performs the direct sanitization approach on original and added data sets. with similar side effects.

In catalog segmentation, an enterprise tries to develop k catalogs with r products that are sent to corresponding customers in order to maximize the overall number of catalog products purchased. In this paper, a novel model called catalog segmentation problem with double constraints (DCCSP) is presented. In this model, the interest constraint is minimized and the profit constraint is maximized so that the profit of products purchased by customers who have at least t interesting products in receiving catalogs is maximized. The complexity of the DCCSP is analyzed, and a DCCS algorithm to solve the optimization is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and can be used to solve the DCCSP effectively. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cao, WB; Haralick, R				Cao, Wenbo; Haralick, Robert			Affine feature extraction: A generalization of the Fukunaga-Koontz transformation	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Feature extraction; Affine transformation; Fisher's discriminant analysis; Fukunaga-Koontz transformation; Kullback-Leibler divergence	DISCRIMINATION	Dimension reduction methods are often applied in machine learning and data mining problems. Linear subspace methods are the commonly used ones, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FDA), common spatial pattern (CSP), et al. In this paper, we describe a novel feature extraction method for binary classification problems. Instead of finding linear subspaces, our method finds lower-dimensional affine subspaces satisfying a generalization of the Fukunaga-Koontz transformation (FKT). The proposed method has a closed-form solution and thus can be solved very efficiently. Under normality assumption, our method can be seen as finding an optimal truncated spectrum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Also we show that FDA and CSP are special cases of our proposed method under normality assumption. Experiments on simulated data show that our method performs better than PCA and FDA on data that is distributed on two cylinders, even one within the other. We also show that, on several real data sets, our method provides statistically significant improvement on test set accuracy over FDA, CSP and FKT. Therefore the proposed method can be used as another preliminary data-exploring tool to help solve machine learning and data mining problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In medical domains where data and analytics driven research is successfully applied, new and novel research directions are identified to further advance the clinical and biological studies. In this research, we used three popular data mining techniques (decision trees, artificial neural networks and support vector machines) along with the most commonly used statistical analysis technique logistic regression to develop prediction models for prostate cancer survivability. The data set contained around 120 000 records and 77 variables. A k-fold cross-validation methodology was used in model building, evaluation and comparison. The results showed that support vector machines are the most accurate predictor (with a test set accuracy of 92.85%) for this domain, followed by artificial neural networks and decision trees.

In this work we consider the case of examples represented as a set of multiple tables of a relational database and we propose a new relational classification algorithm, named TRANSC, that works in a transductive setting and employs a probabilistic approach to classification. Knowledge on the data model, i.e., foreign keys, is used to guide the search process. The transductive learning strategy iterates on a k-NN based re-classification of labeled and unlabeled examples, in order to identify borderline examples, and uses the relational probabilistic classifier Mr-SBC to bootstrap the transductive algorithm. Experimental results confirm that TRANSC outperforms its inductive counterpart (Mr-SBC). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Further, methods for finding emergent terms have attracted considerable attention as an important issue called temporal text mining. However, many conventional methods are not robust against changes in technical terms. In order to detect remarkable temporal trends of technical terms in given textual datasets robustly we propose a method based on temporal changes in several importance indices by assuming the importance indices of the terms to be a dataset. The method consists of an automatic term extraction method in given documents, three importance indices from text mining studies, and temporal trends detection based on results of linear regression analysis. Empirical studies show that the three importance indices are applied to the titles of four annual conferences about data mining field as sets of documents. After detecting the temporal trends of automatically extracted phrases, we compared the trends of the technical phrases among the titles of the annual conferences.

Automated mining of error-handling specifications is challenging for procedural languages such as C, which lack explicit exception-handling mechanisms. Due to the lack of explicit exception handling, error-handling code is often scattered across different procedures and files making it difficult to mine error-handling specifications through manual inspection of source code. In this paper, we present a novel framework for mining A-PI error-handling specifications automatically from API client code, without any user input. In our framework, we adapt a trace generation technique to distinguish and generate static traces representing different API run-time behaviors. We apply data mining techniques on the static traces to mine specifications that define correct handling of API errors. We then use the mined specifications to detect API error-handling violations. Our framework mines 62 error-handling specifications and detects 264 real error-handling defects from the analyzed open source packages.(1)	[Acharya, Mithun; Xie, Tao] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA	Acharya, M (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.	acharya@csc.ncsu.edu; xie@csc.ncsu.edu					Acharya M., 2007, ESEC FSE, P25; Ammons G., 2002, P 29 ACM SIGPLAN SIG, P4, DOI 10.1145/503272.503275; Bruntink M., 2006, P 28 INT C SOFTW ENG, P242, DOI 10.1145/1134285.1134320; Chang R.-Y., 2007, P ISSTA, P163, DOI 10.1145/1273463.1273486; Chen H., 2002, P 9 ACM C COMP COMM, P235; CHRISTIAN F, 1995, SOFTWARE FAULT TOLER, pCH5; Engler D., 2001, P 18 ACM S OP SYST P, P57; GEHANI NH, 1992, SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER, V22, P827, DOI 10.1002/spe.4380221003; GUNAWI H, 2006, P USENIX FAST, P242; Li Z., 2005, P 10 EUR SOFTW ENG C, P306, DOI DOI 10.1145/1081706.1081755; Ramanathan MK, 2007, PLDI'07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 ACM SIGPLAN CONFERENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, P123, DOI 10.1145/1250734.1250749; ROSENTHAL D, 1994, INTERCLIENT COMMUNIC; TOY W, 1982, THEORY PRACTICE RELI; Wang JY, 2004, PROC INT CONF DATA, P79, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.2004.1319986; Weimer W, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3440, P461; Weimer W., 2004, P OOPSLA, P419, DOI 10.1145/1028976.1029011; Yang J., 2006, P ICSE, P282, DOI 10.1145/1134285.1134325; *IEEE COMP SOC, 1994, 10031B1993 IEEE	18	1	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-642-00592-3	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5503						370	384				15	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BJF21	WOS:000265405500025

Therefore, WFP mining becomes an important research issue in data mining and knowledge discovery area. However the existing algorithms cannot be applied for stream data mining because they require multiple database scans. Moreover they cannot extract the recent change of knowledge in a data stream adaptively. In this paper we propose a sliding window based novel technique WFPMDS (Weighted Frequent Pattern Mining over Data Streams) using a single scan of data stream to discover important knowledge form the recent data elements. Extensive performance analyses show that our technique is very efficient for WFP mining over data streams.

A particular challenge of any generic, general purpose, AEDM system is the extensive scope of KDD. To address this challenge the authors suggest that any truly generic AEDM must be readily extendable and propose EMADS, The Extendable Multi-Agent Data mining System. A complete overview of the architecture and agent interaction models of EMADS is presented. The system's operation is described and illustrated in terms of two KDD scenarios: meta association rule mining and classifier generation. In conclusion the authors suggest that EMADS provides a sound foundation for both KDD research and application based AEDM.

The central feature of the framework is that it avoids the use of agreed meta-language formats by supporting a system of wrappers. The advantage offered is that the system is easily extendible, so that further data agents and mining agents can simply be added to the system. A demonstration EMADS framework is currently available. The paper includes details of the EMADS architecture and the wrapper principle incorporated into it. A full description and evaluation of the framework's operation is provided by considering two MADM scenarios.

It has been applied in many domains such as web mining, text categorization, gene expression microarray analysis, image analysis, and combinatorial chemistry. One type of well-studied feature selection methodology is filtering, which is typically divided into ranking and subset evaluation. This work provides an empirical study regarding one type of feature ranking for which very limited research exists, namely wrapper-based feature ranking. Nine performance metrics are evaluated, and while these metrics are commonly used in data mining to evaluate classifier performance, they are rarely used as feature ranking techniques. Moreover, five different learners, 5-Nearest Neighbors (5NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Nave Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in conjunction with two different methodologies, 3-Fold Cross-Validation (CV) and 3-Fold Cross-validation Risk Impact (CVR) are used in this study to evaluate feature relevancy and to determine ranking similarities among the different ranking techniques.

We use the framework to build a classifier that involves an algebra on hyper-rectangles. Our classifier, called VisClassifier, generates set-wise rules from simple gestures in an exploratory visual GUI. Logging these rules allows us to apply our analysis to a new sample or batch of data so that we can assess the predictive power of our visual-processing motivated classifier. The accuracy of this classifier on widely-used benchmark datasets rivals the accuracy of competitive classifiers.

A comprehensive harmonic monitoring program has been designed and implemented on a typical electrical medium-voltage distribution system in Australia. The monitoring program involved measurements of the three-phase harmonic currents and voltages from the residential, commercial, and industrial load sectors. Data over a three year period have been downloaded and available for analysis. The large amount of acquired data makes it difficult to identify operational events that significantly impact the harmonies generated on the system. More sophisticated analysis methods are required to automatically determine which part of the measurement data are of importance. Based on this information, a closer inspection of smaller data sets can then be carried out to determine the reasons for its detection. In this paper, we classify the measurement data using unsupervised learning based on clustering techniques using the minimum message length technique, which can provide the engineers with a rapid, visually oriented method of evaluating the underlying operational information contained within the clusters. Supervised learning is then used to describe the generated clusters and to predict the occurrences of unusual clusters in future measurement data.

Recent advances in data collection, data dissemination and related technologies have inaugurated a new era of research where existing data mining algorithms should be reconsidered from a different point of view, this of privacy preservation. This paper explores all the aspects of privacy issues in datamining, especially related with clustering, and provides a technique for privacy preserving clustering with a hypothetical banking scenario. Here we propose a model for clustering horizontally partitioned or centralized data sets using a simple PCA based transformation approach. The proposed PPC method has been implemented using Mat lab and evaluated using synthetic datasets. The proposed privacy preserving transformation preserved the nature of the data even in the transformed form. The classification accuracy while using the transformed data is almost equal to that of the original dataset.	[Banu, R.

While researchers often assume that their definition of "privacy" is universally held by all readers, this is rarely the case; so many papers addressing key challenges in this domain have actually produced results that do not consider the same problem, even when using similar vocabularies. This paper provides an explicit definition of data privacy suitable for ongoing work in data repositories such as a DBMS or for data mining. The work contributes by briefly providing the larger context for the way privacy is defined legally and legislatively but primarily provides a taxonomy capable of thinking of data privacy technologically. We then demonstrate the taxonomy's utility by illustrating how this perspective makes it possible to understand the important contribution made by researchers to the issue of privacy. The conclusion of this paper is that privacy is indeed multifaceted so no single current research effort adequately addresses the true breadth of the issues necessary to fully understand the scope of this important issue.

Proposed algorithm is easily implemented and because of use of a simple classifier in that, its computational complexity is very low. Experimentations are carried out on Reuters-21578 dataset. Simulation results on Reuters-21578 dataset show the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

It allows for dimensionality reduction and clustering and is particularly useful whenever the data are superpositions of basic entities. However, since its computation costs grow quadratically with the number of data points, the original algorithm hardly applies to modern pattern recognition or data mining settings. In this paper, we introduce ways of notably accelerating archetypal analysis. Our experiments are the first successful application of the technique to large scale data analysis problems.

However, experience has shown that Bit-Torrent is often used to distribute copyright protected movie and music files illegally. Consequently, copyright enforcement agencies currently monitor Bit Torrent swarms to identify users participating in the illegal distribution of copyright-protected files. These investigations rely on passive methods that are prone to a variety of errors, particularly false positive identification. To mitigate the potential for false positive peer identification, we investigate the feasibility of using active methods to monitor extremely large Bit Torrent swarms. We develop an active probing framework called Bit Stalker that identifies active peers and collects concrete forensic evidence that they were involved in sharing a particular file. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach through a measurement study with real, large torrents consisting of over 186,000 peers. We find that the current investigative methods produce at least 11% false positives, while we show that false positives are rare with our active approach.

However, this potential is far from being exploited considering the fact that most of commercial IDS in the market do not identify novel attacks and generate false alerts for legitimate user activities. They mainly deploy misuse detection and are fully dependant on human interaction. Neural networks can be applied successfully to tackle these issues and design better intrusion detection system. Neural networks have already been used to solve many problems related to pattern recognition, data mining, data compression and research is still underway with regards to intrusion detection systems. Unsupervised learning and fast network convergence are some features that can be integrated in the newly designed IDS system using neural networks. This study will aim to explore current applications of neural networks for intrusion detection systems and identify possible neural network algorithms suitable for the task in hand.

This data, may consists of missing, incorrect and sometimes incomplete values sets that can have a detrimental effect on the decisions that are outcomes of data analytics. Using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, we have proposed an efficient imputation method using a hybrid combination of CART and Genetic Algorithm, as a preprocessing step. The classical neural network model is used for prediction, on the preprocessed dataset. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model far exceeds the existing models, mainly because of the soft computing preprocessing adopted.

Useful concepts can be defined in terms of the complex interactions between the multi-dimensional attributes of subsets of these objects and of the relationships that exist between them. In this paper, we present Spatiotemporal Multi-dimensional Relational Framework (SMRF) Trees, a new data mining technique that extends the successful Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Tree models. From a set of labeled, multi-object examples of a target concept, our algorithm infers both the set of objects that participate in the concept and the key object and relation attributes that describe the concept. In contrast to other relational model approaches, SMRF trees do not rely on pre-defined relations between objects. Instead, our algorithm infers the relations from the continuous attributes. In addition, our approach explicitly acknowledges the multi-dimensional nature of attributes such as position, orientation and color. Our method performs well in exploratory experiments, demonstrating its viability as a relational learning approach.

Whenever a mining model is used in an application it is already outdated since the world has changed since the model induction. The solution is to predict the drift of a model and derive a future model based on such it prediction. One way would be to simulate future data and derive a model from it. but this is typically not feasible. Instead we suggest to predict the values of the measures that drive model induction. In particular, we propose to predict the future values of attribute Selection measures and class label distribution For the induction of decision trees. We give an example of how concept drift is reflected in the trend of these measures and that the resulting decision trees perform considerably better than the ones produced by existing approaches.

The A CO is a metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of real ants, where they search optimal solutions by considering both local heuristic and previous knowledge, observed by pheromone changes. In this paper we study a parallel implementation of the Ant-Miner algorithm developed by Parpinelli, Lopes and Freitas for rule induction. The main idea in this paper is to speed up the searching process and diminish the standard deviations obtained in the sequential version of this algorithm. This algorithm is suited for parallelization in the multi-ants population contrary to the standard proposition, when the performance of single ant is observed. The comparative study will be carried out using the 4 data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Parallelization of Ant-Miner demonstrates the improvement of the obtained results. It demonstrates also that high-performance computing of this approach is feasible to analyze large data sets from Machine Learning repository.

Our protocol allows a user to construct a classifier on a database held by a remote server without learning any additional information about the records field in the database. The server does not learn anything about the constructed classifier, riot even the user's choice of feature and class attributes. Our protocol uses several novel techniques to enable oblivious classifier construction. We evaluate a prototype implementation, and demonstrate that; its performance is efficient for practical scenarios.

On the other side it is equally important to concentrate on user side aspects of privacy control, i.e., to enable users of ubicomp applications to practice privacy dynamically and in an intuitive way. In our work we review previous approaches on user side management of private information in smart environments and motive a new ad hoc based, semi-automatic privacy control. We present a privacy focused, data mining powered interaction model with ubicomp services and provide a prototype environment for evaluating this model. This environment can be used to perform and capture privacy related service interaction in a user study with real users as well as in a simulation with agents simulating users and their privacy related service interaction. Finally we show results of a first simulation which initially tests the proposed interaction model in the prototype environment.

In the model, glyphs are defined with multiple network attributes and clustered with a recursive optimization algorithm for dimensional reduction. The user's Visual latency time is incorporated into the recursive process so that it updates the display and the optimization model according to a human-based delay factor and maximizes the capacity of real-time computation. The interactive search interface is developed to enable the display of similar data points according to the degree of their similarity of attributes. Finally, typical network anomalous events are analyzed and visualized such as password guessing, etc. This technology is expected to have an impact on visual real-time data mining for network security, sensor networks and many other multivariable real-time monitoring systems.

Timing tools attempt to model and capture all such paths on a chip. Due to the high performance nature of these designs, critical paths predicted by the timing tools often do not match the actual speedpaths found on silicon chips. Early silicon data therefore is used to identify the speedpaths, and further performance optimization is carried out by pushing the delays on these paths. In this context, the paper presents a novel data mining approach that analyzes a small number of identified speedpaths against a large number of non-speedpaths. The result of this analysis for each speedpath is a set of hypotheses explaining why the path is special. These hypotheses can be used in guiding the search for the root causes, or in predicting additional paths as potential speedpaths. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and summarize our findings based on analysis of silicon speedpaths collected from a 65nm microprocessor.

While many studies have been conducted in this field, the effect of many of these factors is yet to be properly investigated and understood. This study investigates the relative effects of number of subjects, number of recording sessions, sampling rate and a variety of different classification approaches. Results of this study demonstrate accurate classification is possible in isolated sessions and that variation between sessions and subjects has a significant effect on classifier success. The effect of sampling rate is also shown to impact on classifier success. The results also indicate that affective space is likely to be continuous and that developing an understanding of the dimensions of this space may offer a reliable way of comparing results between subjects and studies.

New techniques, such as parallel, distributed, and grid-based data mining, are often able to overcome some of the characteristics of current data sources such as their large scale, high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and distributed nature. In several of these data mining applications, neural networks can be successfully applied. Moreover, an approach using neural networks seems to be one of the most promising methods for intrusion detection in a computer system or network security today. In this paper we describe a grid computing data mining approach for an intrusion detection application based on neural networks. Detection is carried out through the analyses of internet traffic generated by users in a network computer system.

This work is a first attempt of investigating the anomaly detection task in the (multi-) relational data mining. By defining a data, block as the collection of complex data which periodically flow in the stream, a relational pattern base is incrementally maintained each time a new data, block flows in. For each pattern, the time consecutive support values collected over the data blocks of a time window are clustered, clusters are then used to identify the novelty patterns which describe a change in the evolving pattern base. An application to the problem of detecting novelties in all Internet packet stream is discussed.

For a country with a huge population and household census data, data mining is an ideal approach for analyzing this information. In Taiwan single-parent families, aborigines and the elderly have long been considered disadvantaged social classes, and their widening problems will have a tremendous impact and influence on society. This study aims to apply data mining techniques to investigate the demographic features of socially disadvantaged groups in Taiwan by using population and household data collected in the 2000 census to provide reference for social welfare decision makers in understanding these groups and forming policy. The demographic features, marital features and educational attainment of the heads of household in single-parent families were investigated. The demographic features, educational attainment and marital status of aborigines were analyzed. The marital features, educational attainment, care and life patterns of the elderly were studied.

Therefore, layoff prediction and management have become great concerns of employees and managers. Employees wish to retain their jobs and keep their work for a long time. Hence, they need to predict the possible layoff and then utilize their resources to retain their job. In response to the difficulty of layoff prediction, this study applies social networks and data mining techniques to build a model for layoff prediction. This study compares various techniques to propose a better approach to generate a possible layoff list for employees. Through an empirical study, the results indicate that the proposed approach has pretty good prediction accuracy by using organizational networks, employee databases and layoff records to build the layoff prediction model.

It is considered attractive for many real-life applications, mostly due to its interpretability. Recently, many researches have been reported to endow decision trees with incremental learning ability, which is able to address the learning task with a stream of training instances. However, there are few literatures discussing the algorithms with incremental learning ability regarding the new attributes. In this paper, i(+)Learning (Intelligent, Incremental and Interactive Learning) theory is proposed to complement the traditional incremental decision tree learning algorithms by concerning new available attributes in addition to the new incoming instances. The experimental results reveal that i(+)Learning method offers the promise of making decision trees a more powerful, flexible, accurate and valuable paradigm, especially in medical data mining community.

Although the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy reduced the number of AIDS cases since 1996 by significantly increasing the disease-free survival time, the therapy failure rate is still high due to HIV treatment complexity. To better understand the changes in the outcomes of HIV patients we have applied temporal data mining techniques to the analysis of the data collected since 1981 by the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain. We run a precedence temporal rule extraction algorithm on three different temporal periods, looking for two types of treatment failures: viral failure and toxic failure, corresponding to events of clinical interest to assess the treatment outcomes. The analysis allowed to extract different typical patterns related to each period and to meaningfully interpret the previous and current behaviour of HIV therapy.

It deals with determining which object descriptions co-refer in a dataset. Due to its practical significance for data mining and data analysis tasks many different ER approaches has been developed to address the ER challenge. This paper proposes a new ER Ensemble framework. The task of ER Ensemble is to combine the results of multiple base-level ER systems into a single solution with the goal of increasing the quality of ER. The framework proposed in this paper leverages the observation that often no single ER method always performs the best, consistently outperforming other ER techniques in terms of quality. Instead, different ER solutions perform better in different contexts. The framework employs two novel combining approaches, which are based on supervised learning. The two approaches learn a mapping of the clustering decisions of the base-level ER systems, together with the local context, into a combined clustering decision. The paper empirically studies the framework by applying it to different domains. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher disambiguation quality compared to the current state of the art solutions.

Efficient frequent sequence mining by a dynamic strategy switching algorithm	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent sequence; Sequence comparison; Strategy switching	PATTERN-GROWTH; DNA-SEQUENCE; PREFIXSPAN	Mining frequent sequences in large databases has been an important research topic. The main challenge of mining frequent sequences is the high processing cost due to the large amount of data. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to find all the frequent sequences without having to compute the support counts of non-frequent sequences. The previous works prune candidate sequences based on the frequent sequences with shorter lengths, while our strategy prunes candidate sequences according to the non-frequent sequences with the same lengths. As a result, our strategy can cooperate with the previous works to achieve a better performance. We then identify three major strategies used in the previous works and combine them with our strategy into an efficient algorithm. The novelty of our algorithm lies in its ability to dynamically switch from a previous strategy to our new strategy in the mining process for a better performance. Experiment results show that our algorithm outperforms the previous ones under various parameter settings.	[Chen, Arbee L.

In general, gradual patterns refer to regularities such as "The older a person, the higher his salary". Such patterns are extensively and successfully used in command-based systems, especially in fuzzy command applications. However, in such applications, gradual patterns are supposed to be known and/or provided by an expert, which is not always realistic in practice. In this work, we aim at mining from a given training dataset such gradual patterns for the generation of gradual classification rules. Gradual classification rules thus refer to rules where the antecedent is a gradual pattern and the conclusion is a class value.

It process constitutes a commonly encountered problem of global combinatorial optimization. This process reduces the number of features by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant data, thus resulting in acceptable classification accuracy. This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm called complementary binary particle swarm optimization (CBPSO), in which using complementary distribution strategy to improve the search capability of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) by facilitates global exploration and local exploitation via complementary particles and original particles, respectively. This complementary approach is introduction new particles ("complementary particles") into the search space, which generated by half of the whole particles selected randomly, and replaces the selected particles when the fitness of the global best particle has not improved for a number of consecutive iterations. In this study, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the quality of the solutions. CBPSO was applied and compared to ten classification problems taken from the literature. Experimental results show that CBPSO simplifies the feature selection process effectively, and either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features than BPSO and other feature selection methods.

Many important domains or applications such as Information Retrieval, biology, chemistry and marketing are concerned by this problematic. The aim of this data mining research field is to search for clustering patterns that perform a consensus between the patterns from different views. This requires to merge information from each view by performing a fusion process that identifies the agreement between the views and solves the conflicts. Various fusion strategies can be applied, occurring either before, after or during the clustering process. We draw our inspiration from the existing algorithms based on a centralized strategy. We propose a fuzzy clustering approach that generalizes the three fusion strategies and outperforms the main existing multi-view clustering algorithm both on synthetic and real datasets.

In particular, our approach intends to be a natural heir of the approaches based on clickstream visualization, by integrating them with the visualization of page-level data and by improving them with the definition of ad-hoe zoom and filter operations. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework to formally define our proposal. Lastly, in order to test the approach, a simple case-study for a particular practical usability evaluation has been carried out. To this aim, we built a prototypal system composed of a tracking tool, responsible for tracking user interactions and a visualization tool for task analysis.

The series represent an isokinetic curve that is obtained from a group of patients performing a knee exercise on an isokinetic machine. This system has two steps: the first one is to analyze the input time series in order to generate a simplified model of an isokinetic curve; the second step applies a grammar-guided genetic program including an evolutionary gradient operator and an entropy-based fitness function to obtain a set of rules for a knowledge-based system. This system performs medical prognosis for knee injury detection. The results achieved have been statistically compared to another evolutionary approach that generates fuzzy rule-based systems.

Data mining based on user behavior can be leveraged to analyze and catalog patterns of communications between entities to rank relationships. The advantage is that the analysis can be done in an automatic fashion and can adopt itself to organizational changes over time. We illustrate the algorithms over real world data using the Enron corporation's email archive. The results show great promise when compared to the corporations work chart and judicial proceeding analyzing the major players.

It combines methodologies from project management, data warehousing, mining and knowledge representation. Different from purely algorithmic papers, this one focuses on performance metrics used for managerial such as the time taken for Solution development, the amount of files not automatically managed and other, while preserving equivalent performance on the technical solution quality metrics. This environment has been validated with metadata collected from previous KDD projects developed and deployed for real world applications by the development team members. The case study carried out in actual contracted projects have shown that this environment assesses the risk of failure for new projects, controls and documents all the KDD project development process and helps understanding the conditions that lead KDD projects to success or failure.

Five wireless kinematic sensors were attached to 25 subjects with each subject asked to complete a range of basic activities in a controlled laboratory setting. Subjects were then asked to carry out similar self-annotated activities In a random order and in an unsupervised environment. A combination of time-domain and frequency-domain features were calculated using a sliding window segmentation technique. A reduced feature set was generated using a wrapper subset evaluation technique with a linear forward search. The meta-level classifier AdaBoostM1 with C4.5 Graft as Its base-level classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 95%. Equal sized datasets of subject independent data and subject dependent data were used to train this classifier and it was found that high recognition rates can be achieved without the need of user specific training.

We propose a framework for mining educational data using association rules, and a novel metric for assessing the strength of an association rule, called "cumulative interestingness". In a case study, we analyze the Informatics course examination results using association rules, rank course topics following their importance for final course marks based on the strength of the association rules, and propose which specific course topic should be improved to achieve higher student learning effectiveness and progress.

New intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which are based on sophisticated algorithms rather than current signature-base detections are in demand. In this paper, we propose a new data-mining based technique for intrusion detection using an ensemble of binary classifiers with feature selection and multiboosting simultaneously. Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifier's decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifiers' decision. Our model also makes use of multiboosting for reducing both variance and bias. The experimental results show that our approach provides better performance in terms of accuracy and cost than the winner entry of the 'Knowledge Development and Data mining' (KDD) '99 cup challenge. Future works will extend our analysis to a new 'Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure against Cyber Threats' (PREDICT) dataset as well as real network data.

An advantage of ACs is that they are rule-based and thus lend themselves to an easier interpretation. However, it is common knowledge that association rule mining typically yields a sheer number of rules defeating the purpose of a human readable model. Hence, selecting and ranking a small subset of high-quality rules without jeopardizing the classification accuracy is paramount. This article introduces a new method for building associative classifier. In this method, only association rules based on closed itemsets are used for constructing classifier. Furthermore, certainty factor is used for ranking rules in classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed associative classifier is effective.

Automatic image annotation is an effective way for resolving this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel system that automatically annotates images by semantic corpus which is constructed by mining Web image data. It includes three parts: 1) Constructing the semantic annotation corpus by mining 413,006 Web images and their surrounding text collected from several image search engine; 2) Searching for visually similar images in this semantic annotation corpus and extracting candidate annotation terms; 3) Ranking candidate annotation terms to filter out noisy ones. Our system is evaluated using two benchmark image datasets. Experimental results indicate that this approach is effective.

Computational analysis is recently introduced to discover other unknown methylation sites based on few known ones. To effectively predict possible methylation, sophisticated classification strategy should be well devised. In this paper, we first extracted informative features from methylated fragments in many protein sequences, including the physicochemical properties, secondary structure information, evolutionary profiles, and solvent accessibility of surrounding residues. Then, an efficient feature selection method (mRMR) is applied to eliminate redundant features but keep important ones. Since methylated residues are far less than non-methylated, the collected data is relatively imbalanced. Thus, we propose to use the granular support vector machine (GSVM) which is specially designed for imbalanced classification problems. A 7-fold cross validation shows that our strategy generates comparable predication accuracy with many current methods or even better. Meanwhile, our method provides insights to identify the underlying mechanisms of protein methylation.

It is a rising challenge for the network operators to understand network user behavior. In this paper, we present a general approach for identification and profiling user behavior model by using data mining technique to analyze user activity data. We present analysis of a data set comprised of the dial-up users' usage data in a typical metropolitan area network of a national broadband operator in China. The data recorded activity of over 250,000 unique user accounts. We identify several main behavior groups by using K-means algorithm, and further summarize behavior profile of each user group as main user, behavior models. The results show that our approach can properly identify user behavior models. Our results provide a basis for network operators to understand dial-up user behavior, optimize network planning and adjust customer related policies accordingly.

Spam has serious negative impact on the usability of electronic mail and network resources. In addition, it provides a medium for distributing harmful code and/or offensive content. The work in this paper is motivated by the dramatic increase in the volume of spam traffic in recent years and the promising ability of ant colony optimization in data mining. Our goal is to develop an ant-colony based spam filter and to empirically evaluate its effectiveness in predicting spam messages. We also compare its performance to three other popular machine learning techniques: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes and Ripper classifiers. The preliminary results show that the developed model can be a remarkable alternative tool in filtering spam; yielding better accuracy with considerably smaller rule sets which highlight the important features in identifying the email category.

When there is a need to learn the inherent grouping structure of data in an unsupervised manner, ant-based clustering stand out as the most widely used group of swarm-based clustering algorithms. Under this perspective, this paper presents a new Adaptive Ant-based Clustering Algorithm (AACA) for clustering data sets. The algorithm takes into account the properties of aggregation pheromone and perception of the environment together with other modifications to the standard parameters that improves its convergence. The performance of AACA is studied and compared to other methods using various patterns and data sets. It is also compared to standard clustering using a set of analytical evaluation functions and a range of synthetic and real data collection. Experimental results have shown that the proposed modifications improve the performance of ant-colony clustering algorithm in term of quality and run time.

This approach is a trainable classifier, which takes into account tfidf as a text feature. The main idea of the proposed approach is to take advantage of the most similar training errors to the classification model to successively update it based on a certain threshold. The proposed approach is simple to implement and flexible. The proposed approach performance is measured at several threshold values on the Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection.

Feature Selection is one of the most important and frequently used techniques in data preprocessing for data mining. In this paper, special attention is made on feature selection for classification with labeled data. Here an algorithm is used that arranges attributes based on their importance using two independent criteria. Then, the arranged attributes can be used as input one simple and powerful algorithm for construction decision tree (Oblivious Tree). Results indicate that this decision tree using featured selected by proposed algorithm outperformed decision tree without feature selection. From the experimental results, it is observed that, this method generates smaller tree having an acceptable accuracy.

The data set analyzed in this paper is about churn prediction in bank credit cards and is obtained from Business Intelligence Cup 2004. The data set under consideration is highly unbalanced with 93.11% loyal and 6.89% churned customers. Since identifying churner is of paramount importance from business perspective, sensitivity of classification model is more critical. Using the available, original unbalanced data only, we observed that the proposed hybrid SVM+NBTree yielded the best sensitivity compared to other classifiers.	[Farquad, M. A.

However, performing previous tasks require's a data mining engineer or expert which supervises the design and evaluate the whole process. The goat of this paper is to describe MOLE, an architecture to automatize the data, mining process. The architecture assumes than die data mining process can be seen from a Classical planning perspective! and hence. that classical planning tools can be used to design process. MOLE is built and instantiated oil the basis of i) standard languages to describe the data set and the data mining process, ii) available Cools to design, execute and evaluate the data mining processes.

Finding the best implementation and influential performance factors of hardware and software platforms for the data intensive applications requires trial and error. However, it is very difficult and costly to perform these trials in a real large-scale environment. In this paper we use a generic simulation framework SIMCAN to simulate hardware and software platforms of data intensive applications for investigating the influential performance factors, and thereby making decisions on the design of data intensive application architectures. We have employed a typical use case of a data mining application, in which the architecture has been proposed using a pipeline model. We have simulated various scenarios to investigate factors that affect the system performance to assist the architecture design and the simulation results provide useful information for this decision-making.

Web recommendation systems based on web usage mining try to mine users' behavior patterns from web access logs, and recommend pages to the online user by matching the user's browsing behavior with the mined historical behavior patterns. In this paper we propose effective and scalable technique to solve the web page recommendation problem. We use distributed learning automata to learn the behavior of previous users' and cluster pages based on learned pattern. One of the challenging problems in recommendation systems is dealing with unvisited or newly added pages. As they would never be recommended, we need to provide an opportunity for these rarely visited or newly added pages to be included in the recommendation set. By considering this problem, and introducing a novel Weighted Association Rule mining algorithm, we present an algorithm for recommendation purpose. We employ the HITS algorithm to extend the recommendation set. We evaluate proposed algorithm under different settings and show how this method can improve the overall quality of web recommendations.

In particular, we investigate the possibility of applying fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to discover temporal dependencies between medical concepts. We consider two types of simple concepts, i.e., medical interventions (such as prescribing drugs) and health effects expressed by changes of patients' conditions. The long-term goal of the research is the application of the discovered FCM to medical decision support and planning the therapy of patients. Finally, we present the results of experiments performed on temporal diabetes data.

This study uses six different data mining AS methods to identify a few key driving climate and air pollution attributes from small attribute sets (16 attributes) to increase knowledge about the underlying structures of acute respiratory hospital admission Counts, because understanding key factors in environmental science data helps constructing a cost effective data collection and management process by focusing on collecting and investigating more representative and important variables. The performance of the selected attribute set was tested with Ant-Miner and C4.5 classifiers to examine the ability to prediction the admission count. Removal of attributes was Successful over all AS methods, especially TNSU (a newly developed AS method, Tree Node Selection for unpruned), which achieved best in removing attributes and some improving the classification accuracy for Ant-Miner and C4.5. However, the overall prediction accuracy improvements are small, Suggesting that AS selects attribute sets sufficiently enough to maintain the accuracy for Ant-Miner and C4.5.

PORTO, LIAADO, sas, CRACS Inescporto LA, YAHOO				Some challenges in frequent pattern mining from data streams are the drift of data distribution and the computational efficiency. In this work an additional challenge is considered: data streams describe complex objects modeled by multiple database relations. A multi-relational data mining algorithm is proposed to efficiently discover approximate relational frequent patterns over a sliding time window of a complex data stream. The effectiveness of the method is proved on application to the Internet packet stream.

In a parallel thread, recent work from the NLP community suggests that for tasks such as natural language disambiguation even a simple algorithm can outperform a sophisticated one, if it is provided with large quantities of high quality training data. In those applications, training data occurs naturally in text corpora, and high quality training data sets running into billions of words have been reportedly used. We explore how we can apply the lessons from the NLP community to KDD tasks. Specifically, we investigate how to identify data sources that can yield training data at low cost and study whether the quantity of the automatically extracted training data can compensate for its lower quality. We carry out this investigation for the specific task of inferring whether a search query has commercial intent. We mine toolbar and click logs to extract queries from sites that are predominantly commercial (e.g., Amazon) and non-commercial (e.g., Wikipedia). We compare the accuracy obtained using such training data against manually labeled training data. Our results show that we can have large accuracy gains using automatically extracted training data at much lower cost.

The object of information security management is the protection of these systems, whereas security information and event management (SIEM) addresses those information management tasks which focus on the short term handling of events, as well as on the long term improvement of the entire information security architectures. This is carried out based on those data which can be logged and collected within the enterprise information security infrastructure. An especially interesting type of log data is data created by anti-malware software. This paper demonstrates in the context of a project case study that data mining (DM) is a well suited approach to detect hidden patterns in malware data and thus to support STEM.
