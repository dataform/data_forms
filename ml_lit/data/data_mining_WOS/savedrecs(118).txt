In this paper, we propose a method of simultaneously using two kinds of SOM whose features are different (the nSOM method). Namely, one is distributed in the area at which input data are concentrated, and the other self-organizes the whole of the input space. The competing behavior of the two kinds of SOM for nonuniform input data is investigated. Furthermore, we show its application to clustering and confirm its efficiency by comparing with the k-means method.

Intelligent Fril/SQL interrogator	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								The intelligent Fril/SQL interrogator is an object-oriented and knowledge-based support query system, which is implemented by the set of logic objects linking one another. These logic objects integrate SQL query, support logic programming language-Fril and Fril query together by processing them in sequence in slots of each logic object. This approach therefore takes advantage of both object-oriented system and a logic programming-based system. Fuzzy logic data mining and a machine learning tool kit built in the intelligent interrogator can automatically provide a knowledge base or rules to assist a human to analyze huge data sets or create intelligent controllers. Alternatively, users can write or edit the knowledge base or rules according to their requirements, so that the intelligent interrogator is also a support logic programming environment where users can write and run various Fril programs through these logic objects.

J	Rinzivillo, S; Turini, F				Rinzivillo, Salvatore; Turini, Franco			Knowledge discovery from spatial transactions	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						qualitative spatial relations; spatial dataset; spatial transactions; geographical information systems; data mining algorithm	CLASSIFICATION	We propose a general mechanism to represent the spatial transactions in a way that allows the use of the existing data mining methods. Our proposal allows the analyst to exploit the layered structure of geographical information systems in order to define the layers of interest and the relevant spatial relations among them. Given a reference object, it is possible to describe its neighborhood by considering the attribute of the object itself and the objects related by the chosen relations. The resulting spatial transactions may be either considered like "traditional" transactions, by considering only the qualitative spatial relations, or their spatial extension can be exploited during the data mining process. We explore both these cases. First we tackle the problem of classifying a spatial dataset, by taking into account the spatial component of the data to compute the statistical measure (i.e., the entropy) necessary to learn the model. Then, we consider the task of extracting spatial association rules, by focusing on the qualitative representation of the spatial relations. The feasibility of the process has been tested by implementing the proposed method on top of a GIS tool and by analyzing real world data.

J	Xu, JY; Sung, AH; Liu, QZ				Xu, Jianyun; Sung, Andrew H.; Liu, Qingzhong			Behaviour mining for fraud detection	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fraud detection; adaptive profiling; behaviour mining; anomaly detection	ASSOCIATION RULES	Despite significant efforts by merchants, card issuers and law enforcement to curb fraud, online fraud continues to plague electronic commerce web sites. More advanced solutions are desired to protect merchants from the constantly evolving problem caused by fraud. The supervised machine learning technique for the most well known fraud detection algorithms makes them inadequate for an online system, which usually contains a mammoth size of non-stationery data. This paper describes a method to dynamically create user profile for the purpose of fraud detection. We use a data mining algorithm to adaptively profile legitimate customer behaviour in a form of association rule set from a transaction database. Then the incoming transactions are compared against the user profile to indicate the anomalies. A novel pattern match approach is proposed to evaluate how unusual the new transactions are. An empirical evaluation shows that we can accurately differentiate the anomaly behaviour from profiled user behaviour.

Post-processing of mined results is one of the key processes in a data mining process. However, it is difficult for human experts to find out valuable knowledge from several thousands of rules obtained with a large dataset with noises. To reduce the costs in such rule evaluation task, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which learn from objective indices for mined classification rules and evaluations by a human expert for each rule. To estimate learning costs for predicting human interests with objective rule evaluation indices, we have done the two case studies with actual data mining results, which include different phases of human interests. With regarding to these results, we discuss about the relationship between performances of learning algorithms and human hypothesis construction process.

Most traditional data mining methods only deal with a single table and discretize columns that contain continuous numbers into nominal values. In a relational database, multiple records with numerical attributes are stored separately from the target table, and these records are usually associated with a single structured individual stored in the target table. Numbers in multi-relational data mining (MRDM) are often discretized, after considering the schema of the relational database, in order to reduce the continuous domains to more manageable symbolic domains of low cardinality, and the loss of precision is assumed to be acceptable. In this paper, we consider different alternatives for dealing with continuous attributes in MRDM. The discretization procedures considered in this paper include algorithms that do not depend on the multi-relational structure of the data and also that are sensitive to this structure. In this experiment, we study the effects of taking the one-to-many association issue into consideration in the process of discretizing continuous numbers. We implement a new method of discretization, called the entropy-instance-based discretization method, and we evaluate this discretization method with respect to C4.5 on three varieties of a well-known multi-relational database (Mutagenesis), where numeric attributes play an important role. We demonstrate on the empirical results obtained that entropy-based discretization can be improved by taking into consideration the multiple-in stance problem.

Today there are many scenarios where data for attributes that correspond to predictor variables and the response variable itself are distributed among several parties that do not trust each other. Privacy-preserving data mining has grown rapidly studying the scenarios where data is vertically partitioned. While algorithms have been developed for many tasks (like clustering, association-rule mining and classification), for regression, the case of only two parties remains open. Also open is the most interesting case when the response variable is to be kept private. This paper provides the first set of algorithms that solves these cases. Our algorithms are practical and only require a commodity server (a supplier of random values) that does not collude with the parties. Our protocols are secure in the spirit of the the semi-honest model.

Most of them are based on the aggregation of local models according to some collected local statistics. In this paper, we, propose a lightweight distributed clustering algorithm based on minimum variance increases criterion which requires a very limited communication overhead. We also introduce the notion of distributed perturbation to improve the globally generated clustering. We show that this algorithm improves the quality of the overall clustering and manage to find the real structure and number of clusters of the global dataset.

The distributed nature of peer-to-peer databases further complicates this issue by introducing an access overhead cost in addition to the cost of sending individual tuples over the network. We propose a two-level sampling approach focusing on peer-to-peer databases for maximizing sample quality given a user-defined communication budget. Given that individual peers may have varying cardinality we propose an algorithm for determining the optimal sample rate (the percentage of tuples to sample from a peer)for each peer We do this by analyzing the variance of individual peers, ultimately minimizing the total variance of the entire sample. By performing local optimization of individual peer sample rates we maximize approximation accuracy of the samples. We also offer several techniques for sampling in peer-to-peer databases given various amounts of known and unknown information about the network and its peers.

We concentrate our attention on the advantages we gain through design recovery, and in particular on subcomponent recovery, which helps to detect logical components of the system and their relationships. Components can be of various kinds: an, important category is that of Design Patterns [7]. Several approaches have been proposed to automate design pattern detection. In this paper we describe our approach to design pattern detection using supervised classification and data mining techniques based on subcomponents, and summarize the results we obtained on behavioral Design Patterns.

The system under consideration is constantly evolving as several releases a year are shipped to customers. Developers usually have limited resources for their testing and inspections and would like to be able to devote extra resources to faulty system parts. The main research focus of this paper is two-fold: (1) use and compare many data mining and machine learning techniques to build fault-proneness models based mostly, on source code measures and change/fault history data, and (2) demonstrate that the usual classification evaluation criteria based on confusion matrices may not be fully appropriate to compare and evaluate models.

Finding frequent itemsets is computationally the most expensive step in association rule discovery and therefore it has grasped significant research focus [1]. Discovery of frequently occurring subsets of items, called itemsets, is the core of many data mining methods. Most of the previous studies adopt Apriori-like algorithms, whom iteratively generate candidate itemsets and check their occurrence frequencies in the database. These approaches suffer from serious costs of repeated passes over the analyzed database. In this paper, we propose a new BDD-based (Binary Decision Diagram) data structure called TREESUPBDD. The TREESUPBDD extends the idea claimed by the authors of FP-TREE [9] and ITL-Tree [5] structures, aiming to improve storage compression and to allow frequent pattern mining without an "explicit" candidate itemset generation step. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, called TREESUPBDD-MINE, for reducing database activity of frequent itemset discovery algorithms. The idea of TREESUPBDD-MINE Consists in using a Binary Decision Diagram and a tree for representing both database and frequent itemsets. The proposed method requires one scan over the source database : to create the associated tree and BDD and check discovered itemset supports. The originality of our work stands on the fact that the proposed algorithm extracts the frequent itemsets directly from the TREESUPBDD. Carried out experiments showed very encouraged results. Its performance improvements have been shown in a series of our experiments. We extend the binary decision diagram structure to store transaction groups and propose a new method to discover frequents itemsets. To study the trade-offs in the new representation of transactions in binary decision diagram, we compare the performance of our algorithm with the fastest Apriori [2] implementation algorithm and the latest extension of FP-Growth [15]. We have tested all the algorithms using different benchmark datasets. The performance study shows that the new algorithm significantly reduces the processing time for mining frequent itemsets from dense datasets that contain relatively long patterns and for low threshold. We discuss the performance results in detail and also the strengths and limitations of our algorithm.

Genetic algorithm is a useful technique for discovering this kind of classifiers and it has been used for this purpose in some studies. In this paper, we propose a new symbiotic evolutionary approach to find desired fuzzy rule-based classifiers. For this purpose, a symbiotic combination operator has been designed as an alternative to the recombination operator (crossover) in the genetic algorithms. In the proposed approach, the evolution starts from simple chromosomes and the structure of chromosomes gets complex gradually during the evolutionary process. Experimental results on some standard data sets show the high performance of the proposed approach compared to the other existing approaches.	[Baghshah, M. Soleymani; Shouraki, S.

Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines(SVM) and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task. Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of input feature vectors impacts on the classification speed. The kernel parameters setting for SVM in a training process, impacts on the classification accuracy. Feature selection is another factor that impacts classification accuracy. The objective of this work is to reduce the dimension of feature vectors, optimizing the parameters to improve the SVM classification accuracy and speed. In order to improve classification speed we spent rough sets theory to reduce the feature vector space. We present a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection and parameters optimization to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate our method is more effective than traditional SVM methods and other traditional methods.

To solve these two deficiencies of Apriori algorithm, an efficient and fast algorithm based on Pattern Matrix (named P_Matrix algorithm) is proposed, which solves these two problems: scanning for the databases is cut down to one time and not generating the candidate itemsets but generating the frequent itemsets directly. It greatly reduces the temporal complexity and spatial complexity of the algorithm and highly promotes the efficiency of Aprior algorithm.

J	Barua, S; Alhajj, R				Barua, Sajib; Alhajj, Reda			High performance computing for spatial outliers detection using parallel wavelet transform	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; parallel wavelet transform; spatial outlier mining		Wavelet analysis is a practical tool to study signal analysis and image processing. Traditional Fourier transform can also transfer the signal into frequency domain, but wavelet analysis is more attractive for its features of multi-resolution and localization of frequency. Recently, there has been significant development in the use of wavelet methods in the data mining process. However, the objective of the study described in this paper is twofold: designing a wavelet transform algorithm on the multiprocessor architecture and using this algorithm in mining spatial outliers of meteorological data. Spatial outliers are the spatial objects with distinct features from their surrounding neighbors. Outlier detection reveals important and valuable information from large spatial data sets. As region outliers are commonly multi-scale objects, wavelet analysis is an effective tool to study them. In this paper, we present a wavelet based approach and its applicability in outlier detection. We design a suite of algorithms to effectively discover region outliers and also a parallel algorithm is designed to bring efficiency and speedup for the wavelet analysis. The applicability and effectiveness of the developed algorithms are evaluated on real-world meteorological dataset.

In last couple of years a number of different algorithms have been proposed on the basis of Apriori-FT frequent pattern mining concept. The main limitation of these existing FT frequent pattern mining algorithms is that, they try to find all FT frequent patterns without considering only useful long (maximal) patterns. This not only increases the processing time of mining process but also generates too many redundant short FT frequent patterns that are un-useful. In this paper we present a novel concept of mining only maximal (long) useful FT frequent patterns. For mining such patterns algorithm we introduce a novel depth first search algorithm Max-FTP (Maximal Fault-Tolerant Frequent Pattern Mining), with its various search space pruning and fast frequency counting techniques. Our different extensive experimental result on benchmark datasets show that Max-FTP is very efficient in filtering un-interesting FT patterns and execution as compared to Apriori-FT.

A few of these parameters may be known and understood by the domain expert or the end-user. The trends hidden in the evolving databases evolve with time and are manifestations of the underlying dgp. We believe that one of the objectives of the KDD technology is to discover the unknown parameters of the dgp and enable its characterization. This is a pre-requisite for developing capabilities to understand and possibly control the dgp. In this paper we draw the attention of the data mining research community towards the need to look beyond mining. The community is already paying serious attention to the issue of changes in the patterns discovered from evolving data repositories. We identify, the commanalities in these works and show that they fit in a common framework where the discovered knowledge is consolidated and deviations are quantified. We extend this framework by introducing abstraction levels facilitation characterization of the underlying data generation process.

Original relationship based clustering framework is based on a weighted graph partitioning system named METIS. However, it has two major drawbacks: no outlier filtering and forcing clusters to be balanced. Our proposed framework uses Graclus, an unbalanced kernel k-means based partitioning system. We have two major improvements over the original framework: First, we introduce a new space. It consists of tiny unbalanced partitions created using Graclus, hence we call it micro-partition space. We use a filtering approach to drop out singletons or micro-partitions that have fewer members than a threshold value. Second, we agglomerate the filtered micro-partition space and apply Graclus again for clustering. The visualization of the results has been carried out by CLUSION. Our experiments have shown that our proposed framework produces promising results on high dimensional datasets.

Motivated by real-world applications, e.g., in track mining, we consider a generalization of this problem to strongly accessible set systems and arbitrary closure operators. For this more general problem setting, the closed sets can be enumerated with polynomial delay if deciding membership in the set system and computing the closure operator can be solved in polynomial time. We discuss potential applications in graph mining.

All software projects encounter software faults during development and have to put much effort into locating and fixing these. A lot of information is produced when handling faults, through fault reports. This paper reports a study of fault reports from industrial projects, where we seek a better understanding of faults that have been reported during development and how this may affect the quality of the system. We investigated the fault profiles of five business-critical industrial projects by data mining to explore if there were significant trends in the way faults appear in these systems. We wanted to see if any types of faults dominate, and whether some types of faults were reported as being more severe than others. Our findings show that one specific fault type is generally dominant across reports from all projects, and that some fault types are rated as more severe than others. From this we could propose that the organization studied should increase effort in the design phase in order to improve software quality.

This paper presents a cost-sensitive approach feature selection that focuses on two fundamental requirements: (1) the quality of the features in order to promote the classifier accuracy and (2) the cost of computation due to the complexity that occurs during training and testing the classifier. The paper describes the approach in detail and includes a case study for a publicly available micro-array dataset. Results show that the proposed process yields state-of-art performance and uses only a small fraction of features that are generally used in competitive approaches on the same dataset.

The K-means algorithm is the most popular one for achieving this task because of its efficiency. However, it works only on numeric values although data sets in data mining often contain categorical values. Responding to this fact, the K-modes algorithm is presented to extend the K-means algorithm to categorical domains. Unfortunately, it suffers from computing the dissimilarity between each pair of objects and the mode of each cluster. Aiming at addressing these problems confronting K-modes, we present a new algorithm called K-distributions in this paper. We experimentally tested K-distributions using the well known 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compared it to K-modes. The experimental results show that K-distributions significantly outperforms K-modes in term of clustering accuracy and log likelihood.

In this paper we present a web based system for knowledge discovery assistance in Medicine able to advice a medical researcher in this kind of tasks. The user must define only the experiment specifications in a formal language we have defined. The system GUI helps users in their composition. Then the system plans a Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP) on the basis of rules in a knowledge base. Finally the system executes the KDP and produces a model as result. The system works through the co-operation of different web services specialized in different tasks. The system is still under development.

Linear subspace methods are the commonly used ones, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FDA), et al. In this paper, we describe a novel feature extraction method for binary classification problems. Instead of finding linear subspaces, our method finds lower-dimensional affine subspaces for data observations. Our method can be understood as a generalization of the Fukunaga-Koontz Transformation. We show that the proposed method has a closed-form solution and thus can be solved very efficiently. Also we investigate the information-theoretical properties of the new method and study the relationship of our method with other methods. The experimental results show that our method, as PCA and FDA, can be used as another preliminary data-exploring tool to help solve machine learning and data mining problems.

In this paper, we describe how we addressed the unique challenges associated with on-board mining of data as it is collected: uncalibrated data, noisy observations, and severe limitations on computational and memory resources. The goal of this effort, which falls into the emerging application area of spacecraft-based data mining, was to study three specific science phenomena on Mars. Following previous work that used a linear support vector machine (SVM) on-board the Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) spacecraft, we developed three data mining techniques for use on-board the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. These methods range from simple thresholding to state-of-the-art reduced-set SVM technology. We tested these algorithms on archived data in a flight software testbed. We also describe a significant, serendipitous science discovery of this data mining effort: the confirmation of a water ice annulus around the north polar cap of Mars. We conclude with a discussion on lessons learned in developing algorithms for use on-board a spacecraft.

It enables the reconstruction of a single textual element from texts associated to multiple layout components and makes both information extraction and content-based retrieval of documents more effective. A common aspect for all methods reported in the literature is that they strongly depend on the specific domain and are scarcely reusable when the classes of documents or the task at hand changes. In this paper we investigate the problem of detecting the reading order of layout components by resorting to a data mining approach which acquires the domain specific knowledge from a set of training examples. The input of the learning method is the description of the "chains" of layout components defined by the user Only spatial information is exploited to describe a chain, thus making the proposed approach also applicable to the cases in which no text can be associated to a layout component. The method induces a probabilistic classifier based on the Bayesian framework which is used for reconstructing either single or multiple chains of layout components. It has been evaluated on a set of document images.

The undeniable merit of FSM is its inherent ability of dealing with uncertain, imprecise, and incomplete data and still being able to make powerful inferences. This paper provides an overview of FSM techniques with an emphasis on new approaches on improving the prediction performances of system models. A short introduction to soft computing methods is provided and new improvements in FSMs, namely, Improved Fuzzy Functions (IFF) approaches is reviewed. IFF techniques are an alternate representation and reasoning schema to Fuzzy Rule Base (FRB) approaches. Advantages of the new improvements are discussed.

However, the relation between them is rarely studied. In this paper, we carry out a clinical epidemiology to collect 102 cases, each of which is a CHD instance confirmed by Coronary Artery Angiography. Moreover, each case is diagnosed by TCM experts as what syndrome and the corresponding nine NEI specifications are measured. We want to explore whether there exist relation between syndrome and NEI specifications. Therefore, we employ five distinct kinds of data mining algorithms: Bayesian model; Neural Network, Support vector machine Decision trees and logistic regression to perform prediction task and compare their performances. The results indicated that SVM is the best identifier with 90.5% accuracy on the holdout samples. The next is neural network with 88.9% accuracy, higher than Bayesian model with 82.2% counterpart. The decision tree is less worst,77.9%, logistic regression models performs the worst, only 73.9%. We concluded that there do exist relation between syndrome and western medicine and SVM is the best model for predicting syndrome by NEI specifications.

It is a hotspot in the research area of content management on WWW. Traditional recommendation systems do the data mining on web access logs, discover user's access patterns, and filter the information on behalf of the user at the server side. One critical limitation of traditional recommendation system is the lack of user's private daily data, such as schedules, favorite websites and personal emails. The reason for this limitation is the privacy leak issue when the server holds much more private user data. To solve this problem, this paper presents an agent-based personalized recommendation method called Content REcommendation System based on private Dynamic User Profile (CRESDUP). The system collects and mines the private data of user at the client side, discovers, stores and updates private Dynamic User Profile (DUP) at the client side. The system fetches preferred message from the content server according to DUP. An important usage of this technology is a personalized advertising system in the RSS (Rich Site Summary, or RDF Site Summary) reader application. Our experiment shows that the system can utilize DUP to identify the customers' potential preferences and deliver the more preferred messages, especially the advertisements, to people who are interested.

Therefore, understanding and retrieving transportation videos based on their semantic contents becomes an urgent task. For this purpose, this paper proposes an interactive Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework for semantic video retrieval. It incorporates techniques in multimedia processing, data mining, and information retrieval. By tracking vehicles' trajectories in a video and modeling semantic events, the framework initiates a progressive learning process guided by the user's Relevance Feedback (RF). The choice of RF is for reducing the "semantic gap" between the machine-readable features and the high level human concepts, which is a popular technique in the area of Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR). With the information provided by RF, a mapping between semantic video retrieval and MIL is established. Due to its robustness to high-dimensional data, One-class SVM is selected to be the core learning algorithm for MIL in this framework. Although the proposed work is intended for transportation surveillance videos, it is designed as a general framework and can he tailored to other applications as well. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by our experiments on real-life transportation surveillance videos.

S	Chiang, JK				Chiang, Johannes K.			Gestalt of an approach for multidimensional data mining on concept taxonomy forest to discover association patterns with various data granularities	19TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL I, PROCEEDINGS	Proceedings-International Conference on Tools With Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	OCT 29-31, 2007	Patras, GREECE	IEEE Comp Soc, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Soc, Univ Patras, Wright State Univ, ATRC				Data Mining is one of the most significant tools for discovering as association rules. Yet, there are some drawbacks in conventional mining techniques. Since most of them perform the plain ruining based on pre-defined schemata through the data warehouse as a whole, a rescan must be done whenever new attributes are added. Secondly, an association rule may be true on a certain granularity but,fail on a smaller one. Last but not least, they are usually designed specifically to find either frequent or infrequent rules. This article aims at providing a novel data schema and an algorithm to solve aforementioned problems. A forest of concept taxonomies is used as the data structure for discovery of associations rules that consist of concepts picked tip from various taxonomies. Then, the mining process is formulated as a combination of finding the large itemsets, generating, updating and output the association patterns. Crucial mechanisms in each,step will be clarified. At last, this paper presents experimental results regarding efficiency, scalability etc. of the proposed approach to prove the advents of the approach.

To utilize Grids for high-performance knowledge discovery, software tools and mechanisms are needed. To this purpose we designed a system called Knowledge Grid and we are implementing its services as WSRF-compliant Grid Services. This chapter describes the composition of distributed knowledge discovery services, according to the service oriented architecture model, by using the Knowledge Grid environment. We discuss Grid Services for searching Grid resources, composing software and data elements, and executing the resulting data mining application on the Knowledge Grid. The chapter focuses in particular on the application modeling.

These tools must be able to generate explicit knowledge and to restitute it. Visualization techniques have shown to be an efficient solution to achieve such goal. Even though considered as a key step in the mining process, the visualization step of association rules received much less attention than that paid to the extraction one. Nevertheless, some graphical tools have been developed to extract and visualize association rules. In those tools, various approaches are proposed to filter the huge number of association rules before the visualization step. However both DM steps (association rule extraction and visualization) are treated separately, in a one way process. Our approach differs, and uses meta-knowledge to guide the user during the mining process. Standing at the crossroads of DM and Hunian-Computer Interaction (HCI), we present an integrated framework covering both steps of the DM process. Furthermore, our approach can easily integrate previous techniques of association rule visualization.

Although there are a variety of change detection algorithms that have been developed, in practice it can be a problem to scale these algorithms to large data sets due to the heterogeneity of the data. In this paper, we describe a case study involving payment card data in which we built and monitored a separate change detection model for each cell in a multi-dimensional data cube. We describe a system that has been in operation for the past two years that builds and monitors over 15,000 separate baseline models and the process that is used for generating and investigating alerts using these baselines.

User-perceived quality can be approximated through the use of carefully chosen application layer metrics, precluding the need to poll users directly. We discuss the use of data mining prediction techniques to analyze application layer metrics to determine user-perceived quality ratings on media streams. We show that several such prediction techniques are able to assign correct (within a small tolerance) quality ratings to streams with a high degree of accuracy. The time it takes to train and tune the predictors and perform the actual prediction are short enough to make such a strategy feasible to be executed in real time and on real computer networks.

Although feature selection and tuple selection have been studied earlier in various research areas such as machine learning, data mining, and so on, they have rarely been studied together. The contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel distance measure to select the most representative features and tuples. Our experiments are conducted over some microarray gene expression datasets, UCI machine learning and KDD datasets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods quite significantly.

Usually, the Host based intrusion detection problem is formulated as a classification problem and different classification algorithms are applied to high dimensional vectors that represent the system call sequences. Any such classification algorithm demands repeated computation of similarity between pairs of vectors and the computational overhead increases with the increase in the dimensionality of the vectors. Here, we believe that dimensionality reduction of these vectors will help in classification. However, the choice of dimensionality reduction method critically depends on preservation of similarity for efficient classification. We show that Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) preserves the similarity in this context. In this paper, we examine its applicability in two different approaches for system call data with benchmark dataset.

The purpose of the work was, on the one hand, to make accurate predictions and, on the other, to verify whether the Bayesian network techniques are competitive with respect to classification trees. We have applied the techniques to a dataset and, in addition, performed a previous phase of variables selection to simplify the complexity of the classifiers. The results of the experiments show that Bayesians networks produce valid predictors, although improved definition of dependencies and refinement of the variables selection methods are required.

In this paper, we proposed a vision-based gesture recognition system. This system support hand gesture interaction with referring to the hand gesture ontology for improving efficiency.

Databases such as SPIE Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, indices such as PubMed, and search engines such as Google provide the user with sophisticated full-text search capabilities. However, information in 14 images and graphs within these articles is entirely disregarded. In this paper, we quantify the potential impact of using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to access this non-text data. Based on the Journal Citations Report (JCR), the journal Radiology was selected for this study. In 2005, 734 articles were published electronically in this journal. This 14 included 2,587 figures, which yields a rate of 3.52 figures per article. Furthermore, 56.4% of these figures are composed of several individual panels, i.e. the figure combines different images and/or graphs. According to the Image Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (ImageCLEF), the error rate of automatic identification of medical images is about 15%. Therefore, it is expected that, by applying ImageCLEF-like techniques, already 95.5% of A articles could be retrieved by means of CBIR. The challenge for CBIR in scientific literature, however, is the use of local texture properties to analyze individual image panels in composite illustrations. Using local features for content-based image representation, 8.81 images per article are available, and the predicted correctness rate may increase to 98.3%. From this study, we conclude that CBIR may have a high impact in medical literature research and suggest that additional research in this area is warranted.

Towards this direction, the inherently contradicting technologies of deductive software agents and inductive data mining have been integrated, in order to address knowledge intensive problems. However, there exists no generalized evaluation methodology for assessing the efficiency of such applications. On the one hand, existing data mining evaluation methods focus only on algorithmic precision, ignoring overall system performance issues. On the other hand, existing systems evaluation techniques are insufficient, as the emergent intelligent behavior of agents introduce unpredictable factors of performance. In this paper, we present a generalized methodology for performance evaluation of intelligent agents that employ knowledge models produced through data mining. The proposed methodology consists of concise steps for selecting appropriate metrics, defining measurement methodologies and aggregating the measured performance indicators into thorough system characterizations. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the proposed methodology to a real world application, in the Supply Chain Management domain.

Distributed data mining and knowledge management with networks of sensor arrays	KNOWLEDGE AND DATA MANAGEMENT IN GRIDS			English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Knowledge and Data Management in Grids	SEP 13-14, 2005	Poznan, POLAND			anaerobic digestion; data mining; telemonitoring and control; wastewater treatment		Environmental pollution control relies heavily on human expert judgment supported by historical data and scientific models. Telemonitoring, by networks of heterogeneous sensor arrays, provides the opportunity for data mining models to be constructed from the historical data to supplement human expertise. This paper reports some progress made in the TELEMAC project by Aata mining. TELEMAC is concerned with enhancing the efficacy of anaerobic digestion in potentially unstable digesters. In the laboratory using full instrumentation it is possible to derive a good description of the digester state. With data mining it is possible to identify some constraints on sensor choice. This paper examines this data mining work from the perspective of a three layer Grid architecture to see what implications and requirements arise that could benefit the exercise of expert judgment.

Mining spatio-temporal data can benefit many different functions: marketing team managers for identifying the right customers at the right time, cellular companies for optimizing the resources allocation, web site administrators for data allocation matters, animal migration researchers for understanding migration patterns, and meteorology experts for weather forecasting. In this research we use a compact representation of a mobile trajectory and define a new similarity measure between trajectories. We also propose an incremental clustering algorithm for finding evolving groups of similar mobile objects in spatio-temporal data. The algorithm is evaluated empirically by the quality of object clusters (using Dunn and Rand indexes), memory space efficiency, execution times, and scalability (run time VS. number Of objects).

One advantage of a fuzzy rule-based system is its interpretability. However, we're faced with some challenges when generating the rule-base. In high dimensional problems, we can not generate every possible rule with respect to all antecedent combinations. In this paper, by making the use of some data mining concepts, we propose a method for rule generation, which can result in a rule-base containing rules of different lengths. As the next phase, we use rule-weight as a simple mechanism to tune the classifier and propose a new method of rule-weight specification for this purpose. Through computer simulations on some data sets from UCI repository, we show that the proposed scheme achieves better prediction accuracy compared with other fuzzy and non-fuzzy rule-based classification systems proposed in the past.

Traditionally, it is assumed that training and test data are sampled from the same probability distribution, the so called "stationary or non-biased distribution assumption." However, this assumption is often violated in reality. Typical examples include marketing solicitation, fraud detection, drug testing, loan approval, school enrollment, etc. For these applications the only labeled data available for training is a biased representation, in various ways, of the future data on which the inductive model will predict. Intuitively, some examples sampled frequently into the training data may actually be infrequent in the testing data, and vice versa. When this happens, an inductive model constructed from biased training set may not be as accurate on unbiased testing data if there had not been any selection bias in the training data. In this paper, we first improve and clarify a previously proposed categorization of sample selection bias. In particular, we show that unless under very restricted conditions, sample selection bias is a common problem for many real-world situations. We then analyze various effects of sample selection bias on inductive modeling, in particular, how the "true" conditional probability P(y vertical bar x) to be modeled by inductive learners can be misrepresented in the biased training data, that subsequently misleads a learning algorithm. To solve inaccuracy problems due to sample selection bias, we explore how to use model averaging of (1) conditional probabilities P(y vertical bar x), (2) feature probabilities P(x), and (3) joint probabilities, P(x, y), to reduce the influence of sample selection bias on model accuracy. In particular, we explore on how to use unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning framework to improve the accuracy of descriptive models constructed from biased training samples.

This data set describes human proteins. Data mining was conducted using the LERS system. First, the data set was discretized by a cluster analysis algorithm based on agglomerative approach. Then the basic rule set was induced by the LEM2 algorithm. Finally, the rule set was refined using changing rule strength methodology and truncation of the rule set. Our results reach the level of sensitivity and specificity of competing methods. However, our results are explainable since they are in a form of rules and, additionally, we can interpret the role of important features.

Some of those approaches can handle time constraints between events. In particular some work has been done to mine generalized sequential patterns. However, such constraints are often too crisp or need a very precise assessment to avoid erroneous information. Therefore, in this paper we propose to soften temporal constraints used for generalized sequential pattern mining. To handle these constraints while data mining, we design an algorithm based on sequence graphs. Moreover, as these relaxed constraints may extract more generalized patterns, we propose temporal accuracy measure for helping the analysis of the numerous discovered patterns.

One of the most important approaches to support users in searching and navigating media collections is collaborative filtering. Recently, systems as flickr or last.fm have become popular. They allow users to not only rate but also tag items with arbitrary labels. Such systems replace the concept of a global common ontology, as envisioned by the Semantic Web, with a paradigm of heterogeneous, local "folksonomies". The problem of such tagging systems is, however, that resulting taggings carry only little semantics. In this paper, we present an extension to the tagging approach. We allow tags to be grouped into aspects. We show that introducing aspects does not only help the user to manage large numbers of tags, but also facilitates data mining in various ways.

As a very prominent method, the spatial scan statistic finds a region that deviates (most) significantly from the entire dataset. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of mining regional outliers in spatial data. A spatial regional outlier is a rectangular region which contains an outlying object such that the deviation between the non-spatial attribute value of this object and the aggregate value of this attribute over all objects in the region is maximized. Compared to the spatial scan statistic, which targets global outliers, our task aims at local spatial outliers. We introduce two greedy algorithms for mining regional outliers, growing regions by extending them by at least one neighboring object per iteration, choosing the extension which leads to the largest increase of the objective function. Our experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets and a real dataset demonstrates the meaningfulness of this new type of outliers and the greatly superior efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

The goal is not to conduct a thorough analysis of the state-of-art technologies, but rather to point out the directions for future technology development. Based on the market success of force control and machine vision in industry automation, this paper contends the arrival of the golden period of intelligent robotic technologies. The potential growth markets at present and in the near future are primarily assembly, and machining, where vision and force sensing continue to be the enabling technologies. As robot manufacturers start to embrace this technology wave, there are many technical challenges to be solved. The major problem for industrial R&D is how to safely and cost-effectively integrate sensor-driven functionalities with existing pure planning based position control system. For academic research, robust, efficient and effective sensor fusion and data mining methods should be the focus.

It uses general pattern matching, pattern recognition and data mining concepts so that a real life scene/image can be related to a particular category, helping in different prediction and forecasting mechanisms. It is a three-step process i.e. image gathering, learning and classification. As wavelet transform uses time frequency relation, it can be used for image mining instead of Fourier transform. Wavelet transform is used to decompose an image into different frequency sub bands and a low frequency sub band is used for Principal Component Analysis. Classification relates to identifying the category to which an image belongs. We have developed prototype system for recognition using DWT + PCA system. The concept of image mining thus can be efficiently used for weather forecasting so that we can know the natural disasters that may occur in advance.

Assessment of classification methods for soil erosion risks	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Soil erosion mapping; knowledge discovery; classification		Soil erosion is a serious problem in New-Caledonia mainly due to the cyclonic tropical weather, bush fires and human activities (openpit mining). Runoff on stripped soils causes degradations for anthropic laying out on high ultramafic terranes and pollution (mobilized soil particles) which modifies the coastal region and degrades the coral reefs by hypersedimentation processes. All the human activities chain that depend on natural resources regularly suffer the effects or the consequences of these phenomena. Geologists and geographers need to identify and rank erosion parameters and define sensitivity maps, particularly for decision-makers. For a peculiar region of new-caledonia, eight identified factors such as relief parameters, land use, geological substrate type and precipitations are available and the area of interest has been already studied and classified by experts from very sensitive to very robust at soil erosion. We propose in this paper to study classification methods in order to set soil erosion sensitivity maps. The first step consists in data mining work for knowledge discovery. A systematic cartography of actually stripped soils is used in this work as learning data. We have highlighted that used methods for data analysis are really suitable tools for experts because results are in closed correlation with their terrain observations when results are average for only mathematical analysis. These methods need very important exchanges between geologists/geographers experts and computer scientists to identify the real gain that knowledge discovery methods can produce. Several supervised classification methods such the bayesian classifier, decision trees are then used to predict erosion hazard on the basis of knowledge discovery results. Predicting results are described and compared to a linear combination of the factors based on expert knowledge (cf. Fig. 1). The output models (the soil erosion sensitivity maps) are then examined and commented from a geologic point of view. Once more we identify an improvement in the results, especially in the spatial repartition of erosion sensitive areas which are more similar with terrain observations than actuals experts predictive models. With these statistical approaches we are able to propose improved prediction tools for soil erosion sensitivity and on the top of that experts can access to attribute ranking and association rules with a confidence indicator, thing for which classical expert models give reliable results with difficulty. Knowledge discovery and prediction model construction constitute very interesting new methods of analysis for many specialists as in environmental and natural sciences as in fundamental or applied research.

Several traditional methods used to measure it do not provide adequate and promising results for further analysis. Data mining techniques, such as the association rides, have been used in the past and successfully led to discovering interesting patterns in public health data. In this work, we present the architecture of a novel framework which integrates data from multiple hospitals, discovers association rules, stores them in a data warehouse for future analysis and provides anytime accessibility through all intuitive well interface. We implemented the proposed architecture as a well application and evaluated it using data from the WHONET software installed in many Greek hospitals that belong to "the Greek System for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance" network. The contribution of the proposed framework is considered to be a standardized work flow aiming at the integration of data produced by various hospitals into a consistent data warehouse and the use of a mechanism that detects hidden and previously unknown patterns on large datasets, in terms of association rules, which call provide surveillance warnings.

It pervades applications from computer vision to bioinformatics and data mining. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a new feature extraction process based on the detection of extremal points on the cloud of points that represent the high dimensional data sample. These extremal points are assumed to define an approximation to the convex hull covering the data sample points. The features extracted are the coordinates of the data points relative to the extremal points, the convex coordinates.

Indeed, Web filtering is used to prevent access to undesirable Web pages. In this paper we review some existing solutions, then we propose a violent Web content detection and filtering system called "WebAngels filter" which uses textual and structural analysis. "WebAngels filter" has the advantage of combining several data-mining algorithms for Web site classification. We discuss how the combination learning based methods can improve filtering performances. Our preliminary results show that it can detect and filter violent content effectively.

In many large organizations, such a multi-relational database spans numerous departments and/or subdivisions, which are involved in different aspects of the enterprise such as customer profiling, fraud detection, inventory management, financial management, and so on. When considering multirelational classification, it follows that these subdivisions will express different interests in the data, leading to the need to explore various subsets of relevant relations with high utility with respect to the target class. The paper presents a novel approach for pruning the uninteresting relations of a relational database where relations come from such different parties and spans many classification tasks. We aim to create a pruned structure and thus minimize predictive performance loss on the final classification model. Our method identifies a set of strongly uncorrelated subgraphs to use for training and discards all others. The experiments performed demonstrate that our strategy is able to significantly reduce the size of the relational schema without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

In such tasks, the rule base is usually a set of If-Then rules and the rules are developed using an evolutionary trait. GA is usually a good solution for such tasks as it globally searches for good rule-sets without any prior bias or greedy force, but it is usually slow. This paper presents a novel algorithm for rule base generation based on natural process of symbiogenesis. The algorithm uses symbiotic combination operator instead of traditional sexual recombination operator of genetic algorithms. The new algorithm is compared with genetic algorithm on some globally used benchmarks and it is shown that it can either find better classification results from that of GA, or finds similar results with much less computation time.

However, the classical methods are restricted to data embedded in a real vector space and have only limited applicability to noneuclidean data as occurs in, for example, biomedical or symbolic fields. Recently, extensions of unsupervised neural prototype based clustering to dissimilarity data, i.e. data characterized in terms of a dissimilarity matrix only, have been proposed substituting the mean by the so-called generalized median. Thereby, the location of prototypes is chosen within the discrete input space which constitutes a severe limitation in particular for sparse data sets since the prototype flexibility is restricted. Here we present a generalization of median neural gas such that prototypes can be interpreted as mixtures of discrete input locations. We derive a batch optimization scheme based on a corresponding cost function.

The use of concept lattices, from Formal Concept Analysis, for disjoint clustering is a recently studied problem. We develop an algorithm for disjoint clustering of transactional databases using concept lattices. Several heuristics are developed for tuning the support parameters used in this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss the application of this algorithm to Location Learning. In location learning, an object (for example an employee) to be tracked and localized carries an electronic tag, such as an RFID, capable of communicating with some access points that are in the range of the tag. Clustering can then be used to estimate the location of the tag given the signal strengths that can be heard.

In this paper we describe a variety of modifications that we have made to the data mining algorithms in order to improve accuracy and efficiency. We also implement the modified algorithm on intrusion detection. The ant colony algorithm is employed to derive a set Of classification rules from network audit data. Experiment result and comparative study shows our approach is effective and practical.

In this work we introduce a novel temporal abstraction method to this study by detecting and exploiting temporal patterns and relations between events in viral hepatitis such as "event A slightly happened before event B and B simultaneously ended with event C". We developed algorithms to first detect significant temporal patterns in temporal sequences and then to identify temporal relations between these temporal patterns. Many findings by data mining methods show to be significant by physician evaluation and match with reported results in Medline.

The goal is to characterize, in a genetic basis, PD as a disease that affects these two brain regions in different ways. Using the same whole-genome microarray expression data introduced by Brown et al. (2002) [1], we could find significant differences in the expression of some key genes, well-known to be involved in the mechanisms of dopamine production control and PD. The problem of selecting such genes was modeled as the MIN (alpha,beta)-FEATURE SET problem [2]; a similar approach to that employed previously to find biomarkers for different types of cancer using gene expression microarray data [3]. The Feature Selection method produced a series of genetic signatures for PD, with distinct expression profiles in the Parkinson's model and control mice experiments. In addition, a close examination of the genes composing those signatures shows that many of them belong to genetic pathways or have ontology annotations considered to be involved in the onset and development of PD. Such elements could provide new clues on which mechanisms are implicated in hemisphere differentiation in PD.

So far, a lot of spatial clustering algorithms have been proposed. DBSCAN is one of the effective spatial clustering algorithms, which can discover clusters of any arbitrary shape and handle the noise effectively. However, it has also several disadvantages. First, it does based on only spatial attributes, does not consider non-spatial attributes in spatial databases. Secondly, when DBSCAN does handle large-scale spatial databases, it requires large volume of memory support and the I/O cost. In this paper, a novel spatial clustering algorithm with sampling (NSCAS) based on DBSCAN is developed, which not only clusters large-scale spatial databases effectively, but also considers spatial attributes and non-spatial attributes. Experimental results of 2-D spatial datasets show that NSCAS is feasible and efficient.

In on-line learning environments it is much more difficult to assess the motivation of the student and to have adaptive intervention strategies and rules of application to help prevent attrition. We developed MotSaRT - a motivational strategies recommender tool - to support on-line teachers in motivating learners. The design is informed by Social Cognitive Theory and a survey on motivation intervention strategies carried out with sixty on-line teachers. The survey results were analysed using a data mining algorithm (J48 decision trees) which resulted in a set of decision rules for recommending motivational strategies. MotSaRT has been developed based on these decision rules. Its functionality enables the teacher to specify the learner's motivation profile. MotSaRT then recommends the most likely intervention strategies to increase motivation.

At present, more and more data is generated and stored in local sites. The transmission of the entire local data set to server is often unacceptable because of performance considerations, privacy and security aspects, and bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering model based on ensemble learning, which could analyze and mine distributed data sources to find global clustering patterns. A typical scenario of the distributed clustering is a 'two-stage' course, i.e. firstly doing clustering in local sites and then in global site. The local clustering results transmitted to server site form an ensemble and combining schemes of ensemble learning use the ensemble to generate global clustering results. In the model, generating global patterns from ensemble is mathematically converted to be a combinatorial optimization problem. As an implementation for the model, a novel distributed clustering algorithm called DK-means is presented.

For example, in direct marketing, we often need to deploy different promotion strategies to customers with different likelihood (probability) of buying some products. When our learning task is to build a model with accurate class probability estimations, C4.4 is the most popular one for achieving this task because of its efficiency and effect. In this paper, we present a locally weighted version of C4.4 to scale up its class probability estimation performance by combining locally weighted learning with C4.4. We call our improved algorithm locally weighted C4.4, simply LWC4.4. We experimentally tested LWC4.4 using the whole 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compared it to other related algorithms: C4.4, NB, KNN, NBTree, and LWNB. The experimental results show that LWC4.4 significantly outperforms all the other algorithms in term of conditional log likelihood, simply CLL. Thus, our work provides an effective algorithm to produce accurate class probability estimation.

Recent research proposed a direct grouping-based approach that combines customers into segments by optimally combining transactional data of several customers and building a data mining model of customer behavior for each group. This paper proposes a new micro targeting method that builds predictive models of customer behavior not on the segments of customers but rather on the customer-product groups. This micro-targeting method is more general than the previously considered direct grouping method. We empirically show that it significantly outperforms the direct grouping and statistics-based segmentation methods across multiple experimental conditions and that it generates predominately small-sized segments, thus providing additional support for the micro-targeting approach to personalization.

However, the current statistical approaches of Chinese key-phrase extraction did not realize the semantic comprehension, thereby resulting in inaccurate and partial extraction. In this study, a Chinese patent mining approach based on sememe statistics and key-phrase extraction has been proposed to extract key-phrases from patent document. The key-phrase extraction algorithm is based on semantic knowledge structure of HowNet, and statistical approach is adopted to calculate the chosen value of the phrase in the patent document. With an experimental data set, the results showed that the proposed algorithm had improvements in recall from 62% to 73% and in precision from 72% to 8 1% compared with term frequency statistics algorithm.

This paper explains the use of Fuzzy logic as a data mining process to generate decision trees from a pavement (road) database containing historical pavement information. Generally there are many attributes in the pavement database and often it is a complicated process to develop any mathematical model to classify the data. This paper demonstrates the use of fuzzy logic to generate decision tree to classify the pavement data. The fuzzy decision tree is then converted to fuzzy rules. These fuzzy rules assist decision-making process for selecting a particular type of repair on a pavement based on its current condition. The fuzzy decision tree induction method used is based on minimizing the measure of classification ambiguity for different attributes. The model was developed and tested using the ODOT (Ohio Department of Transportation) data set.

The model we use for the protocol is novel in the sense that it utilizes two non-colluding third parties. We provide a brief security analysis of our protocol from information theoretic point of view, which is a stronger security model. We show communication and computation complexity analysis of our protocol along with another protocol previously proposed for the same problem. We also include experimental results for computation and communication overhead of these two protocols. Our protocol not only outperforms the others in execution time and communication overhead on data holders, but also uses a more efficient model for many data mining applications.

The increase in complexity, interconnectedness, dependency and the asynchronous interactions between the components that include hardware resources (computers, servers, network devices), and software (application services, middleware, web services, etc.) makes the fault detection and tolerance a challenging research problem. In this paper, we present an innovative approach based on statistical and data mining techniques to detect faults (hardware or software) and also identify the source of the fault. In our approach, we monitor and analyze in realtime all the interactions between all the components of a distributed system. We used data mining and supervised learning techniques to obtain the rules that can accurately model the normal interactions among these components. Our anomaly analysis engine will immediately produce an alert whenever one or more of the interaction rules that capture normal operations is violated due to a software or hardware failure. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and its performance to detect software faults that we inject asynchronously, and compare the results for different noise level.

Different individuals can have totally different responses to the same email based on their preferences. This paper presents an innovative approach that incorporates user preferences to construct an anti-spam mail system, which is different from the conventional content-based approaches. We OF build a user preference ontology to formally represent the important concepts and rules derived from a data mining process. Then we use an inference engine that utilizes the knowledge to predict the user's action on new incoming emails. We also suggest a new rule optimization procedure inspired from logic synthesis to improve comprehensibility and exclude redundant rules. Experimental results showed that our user preference based architecture achieved good performance and the rules derived from the architecture and the optimization method have better quality in terms of comprehensibility.

However, since network traffic data contain the information about Internet usage patterns of users, network users' privacy can be compromised during the mining process. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method for privacy preserving sequential pattern mining on network traffic data. In order to discover frequent sequential patterns without violating privacy, our method uses the N-repository server model that operates as a single mining server and the retention replacement technique that changes the answer to a query probabilistically. In addition, our method accelerates the overall mining process by maintaining the meta tables in each site. Extensive experiments with real-world network traffic data revealed the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed method.

Therefore, various SMT (Surface Mounting Technology) interconnection techniques are being developed to satisfy this need. Non-destructive inspection technology based on image captured by CCD (Charge Couple Device) has been widely used in a production of PCB (Printed Circuit Board), because of their excellent characters. This paper deals with the locating of solder joints in PCB. In recent years, the theory of Rough Sets has gained paramount applicability in diverse areas of research, especially in Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Artificial intelligence and Information Systems analysis. Rough Sets have also been used in image processing; however, the application of Rough Sets for image locating analysis has yet to be fully investigated. In this paper image segmentation using Rough Set Theory has been presented, and then locate the solder joint by calculating the correlation of solder joint image. In traditional production, the locating in automatic optical inspection must be done by manual, so design a new method to find the solder joint region becomes very important. This paper discusses the flow of locating solder joint based on the rough set. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method shows practical value in solder joint inspection.

It describes in detail the problems encountered, the commonly held beliefs challenged, and the techniques required to achieve reasonable performance with large-scale, time-constrained regression. We discuss in some detail the selection of the compilation tools, the construction of the fitness function, the chosen system grammar (including internal functions and operators), and the chosen system architecture (including multiple island populations). Furthermore in order to achieve the level of performance reported here, of necessity, we borrowed a number of ideas from disparate schools of genetic programming and recombined them in ways not normally seen in the published literature.

Having as motto "Let data speak for themselves", we can state that this approach is not invasive for the processed data set as it uses only the information of the data set without presuming the existence of different models in it [15]. This article presents original contributions for the classifications of the objects of a database using the elements of Rough Set Theory. Reduct Equivalent Rule Induction (or RERI), is presented as a new classification method based on Rough Set Theory. This article describes the mathematical essence of the Reduct Equivalent Rule Induction method, as well as the algorithm and the obtained experimental results.

Thus, data mining plays a very important role. In this paper, data of PD in power cables are obtained from on-site monitoring and from laboratory test. The PD patterns in terms of the univariate phase-resolved distributions are analysed. An alternative method to that using statistical moments for characterizing the patterns is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature extraction as well as dimensionality reduction in the proposed method. The results obtained are farther processed using self-organizing mapping (SOM) to enable better visualisation of the trend of the PD activides.	[Lai, K. X.; Phung, B. T.; Blackburn, T.

Different from the classical CRM for retaining and targeting profitable customers, the main focus of our proposed CRM system is to identify high-risk customers for avoiding potential loss. Through experiment analysis, we find that the Bayesian-based SVM ensemble data mining model with diverse components and "choose from space" selection strategy show the best performance over the testing samples.

After learning stock market historical data, a polygon descriptor can capture the dependencies among stock market quantities, such as stock prices, volumes, EPS (earn per share) and so on. By applying the EC-based similarity measurement on polygon descriptors which were trained by stock market data during different periods, the similarity of corresponding stock market behavior can be analyzed. To demonstrate the representation capabilities of the proposed polygon descriptor, Taiwan stock market data from 1986 to 2006 are used. Experimental results show that the polygon descriptor captures the dependencies of stock market quantities, and the similarity measurement shows that the proposed methods capture the changes of market behavior as expected.

Huge data collections are generated or updated from science, military, financial and environmental applications. Prediction of the future trends based on previous and existing values is of a high importance and various machine learning algorithms have been proposed. In this paper we discuss results of a new approach based on the moving average of the n(th)-order difference of limited range margin series terms. Based on our original approach, a new algorithm has been developed: performances on measurement records of sunspots for more than 200 years are reported and discussed.

While the majority of aneurysms do not burst, those that do would lead to serious complications including hemorrhagic stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death. Yet, surgical options for treating cerebral aneurysms carry high risk to the patient. It is vital for the doctors to accurately diagnose aneurysms that have high probabilities of rupturing. In this application, the patient dataset has many attributes, ranging from patient profile to results from diagnostic test and features extracted from brain images. Many of the attributes are discrete and have missing values. The dataset is also highly biased, with 15% unrupture cases and 85% rupture cases. Building a classifier that unerringly predicts the unrupture (rare) class is a challenge. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach to build such a classifier through suitable combination of data mining algorithms. Our approach automatically determines the optimal combination of these algorithms for a dataset. The system has an accuracy of 92% and is currently being deployed at the Huashan Hospital.

In this paper, we applied a causal discovery algorithm to the business traveler expenditure survey data [1]. A general class of causal models is adopted in this paper to discover the causal relationship among continuous and discrete variables. All those factors which have direct effect on the expense pattern of travelers could be detected. Our discovery results reinforced some conclusions of the rough set analysis and found some new conclusions which might significantly improve the understanding of expenditure behaviors of the business traveler.

However, only a few research concerns distributed clustering for analysing large, heterogeneous and distributed datasets. This is especially true with distributed density-based clustering although the centralised versions of the technique have been widely used fin different real-world applications. In this paper, we present a new approach for distributed density-based clustering. Our approach is based on two main concepts: the extension of local models created by DBSCAN at each node of the system and the aggregation of these local models by using tree based topologies to construct global models. The preliminary evaluation shows that our approach is efficient and flexible and it is appropriate with high density datasets and a moderate difference in dataset distributions among the sites.

Such problems occur when characters used for phylogenetic analyses are not independent of one another. Although a data mining technique known as rule induction from coverings has earlier been shown to be a promising approach for identifying such non-independence, its inherent computational complexity has limited its application for large phylogenetic data sets. Herein we present a parallelized implementation of the rule induction from coverings strategy which overcomes some of these limitations. We also discuss two heuristics that have been applied to the algorithm to further improve its efficiency.

This calls for reliable weather information, which in turn helps farmers make management decisions about their crops. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Computational model for Agro-MEteoroLogical data (CAMEL). The model serves three purposes. First, it effectively captures important information about large amounts of data collected from various weather stations distributed in a wide geographic expanse. Second, the proposed model learns from historical data and predicts future trends. This helps us obtain accurate weather forecasts. Third, through the prediction of weather trends, CAMEL gives us a better understanding of agro-meteorological data. When we compare the predicted results with the observed data, any significant difference between them may be an indication of equipment malfunction or other problems. In this way, CAMEL helps us detect abnormal data and facilitates in guarding against potential sources of error. Consequently, well-functioning equipment and accurate weather data help farmers make wise crop management decisions. Experimental results on real-life datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent computational model for agro-meteorological data.	[Leung, Carson K. -S.; Mateo, Mark A.

Facing the challenges from domestic and foreign competitors, Airlines need to understand customer demands and analyze their values properly in order to compete successfully in the field. And data mining analysis techniques can help the company to hold the demands of customers and provide scientific and technical support for air cargo developing strategies and decision-making. The using of data mining could not always stand on the level of algorithms and models. Data mining should connect with the air cargo business conditions so as to dig out useful rules. This thesis classifies the air cargo customers by the methods of decision-making tree, so as to forecast customer's leaving and making decision.

It has been applied broadly in many aspects and receiving great attention from enterprisers and scholars. This paper makes use of MATLAB language to produce a fuzzy clustering algorithm for classifying electric power companies according to some general financial indexes at the end of 2006, such as ratio of operating income, ratio of stockholder's equity and current ratio. By constructing and normalizing initial partition matrix, getting fuzzy similar matrix with Minkowski metric and gaining the transitive closure, the dynamic fuzzy clustering analysis for electric power companies is shown clearly that different clustered result change gradually with the threshold X reducing. It has a great value on many things, such as contrasting electric power companies' financial condition in order to grasp the chance of investment.

Nonlinear estimators and tail bounds for dimension reduction in l(1) using Cauchy random projections	Learning Theory, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Annual Conference on Learning Theory	JUN 13-15, 2007	San Diego, CA	Google, Machine Learning, IBM			STABLE-DISTRIBUTIONS	For dimension reduction in l(1), one can multiply a data matrix A is an element of R-nxD by R is an element of R-Dxk (k << D) whose entries are i.i.d. samples of Cauchy. The impossibility result says one can not recover the pairwise l(1) distances in A from B = AR is an element of R-nxk, using linear estimators. However, nonlinear estimators are still useful for certain applications in data stream computations, information retrieval, learning, and data mining. We propose three types of nonlinear estimators: the bias-corrected sample median estimator, the bias-corrected geometric mean estimator, and the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator. We derive tail bounds for the geometric mean estimator and establish that k = O (log n/epsilon(2)) suffices with the constants explicitly given. Asymptotically (as k -> infinity), both the sample median estimator and the geometric mean estimator are about 80% efficient compared to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We analyze the moments of the MLE and propose approximating the distribution of the MLE by an inverse Gaussian.

The introduction of mobile agent paradigm opens a new door for distributed data mining and knowledge discovery applications. In this paper, we present the design of a mobile agent system, which couples a logic language based application programming interface for service discovery and database access. Our proposal aims at implementing system tools to enable intelligent mobile agents to search for distributed data services, to roams the Internet for accessing distributed data sites, to discover patterns and extract useful information from facts recorded in databases, to generate global data model through the communication and aggregation of local results, and to overcome the barriers posed by network congestion, poor security and unreliability.

However, high false alarm rate, difficulties in obtaining exact clean data for the modeling of normal patterns and the deterioration of detection rate because of "unclean" training set always make it not as good as we expect. Therefore, we propose a novel data mining method for network anomaly detection in this paper. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate it can effectively detect anomalies with high true positives, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, even provided with not purely "clean" data (unclean data), the proposed method is still robust and effective.

The essential issue is to provide efficient methods for interpreting meaningful discovered knowledge in databases. This research presents a new technique called granule mining to improve the performance of data mining. Rather than using patterns, it uses granules in different tiers to generalize knowledge in databases. It also provides a mechanism to formally discuss meaningless discovered rules based on relationships between granules in different tiers.

This paper explores the relationship between these two issues, and presents a unifying method for dealing with both of them. Previous approaches often use parametric techniques p and try to give exact results. In contrast, we present a nonparametric method based on local Polynomial fitting, and give approximate results by fuzzy partition and decision. In order to measure the possibility of being an outlier and a change point, two novel score functions are defined based on the forward and backward prediction errors. The proposed method can detect outliers and changes simultaneously, and can distinguish between them. Comparing to the conventional parametric approaches, our method is more convenient for implementation, and more appropriate for online and interactive data mining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Recently, there has been much interest in mining data streams. Domingos and Hulten have presented a one-pass algorithm for decision tree constructions. Their system using Hoeffding inequality to achieve a probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the tree constructed. Gama et al. have extended VFDT in two directions. Their system VFDTc can deal with continuous data and use more powerful classification techniques at tree leaves. Peng et al. present soft discretization method to solve continuous attributes in data mining. In this paper, we revisit these problems and implemented a system sVFDT for data stream mining. We make the following contributions: 1) we present a binary search trees (BST) approach for efficiently handling continuous attributes. Its processing time for values inserting is O(nlogn), while VFDT's processing time is O(n(2)). 2) We improve the method of getting the best split-test point of a given continuous attribute. Comparing to the method used in VFDTc, it decreases from O(nlogn) to O (n) in processing time. 3) Comparing to VFDTc, sVFDT's candidate split-test number decrease from O(n) to O(logn)center dot 4)Improve the soft discretization method to increase classification accuracy in data stream mining.

There are three reductions: attribute (column) reduction, row reduction, and value reduction. Row reduction is merging the duplicate rows. Attribute reduction is to find important attributes. Value reduction is to reduce the decision rules to a logically equivalent minimal length. Most recent attentions have been on finding attribute reducts. Traditionally, the value reduct has been searched through the attribute reduct. This paper observes that this method may miss the best value reducts. It also revisits an old rudiment idea [11], namely, a rough set theory on high frequency data: The notion of high frequency value reduct is extracted in a bottom-up fashion without finding attribute reducts. Our method can discover concise and important decision rules in large databases, and is described and illustrated by an example.

For example, the traditional learning styles are previously limited with the space and time, but the current learning activity places are shifted from the traditional classrooms to Internet gradually. The e-learning has become one of the important parts in digital life even it cannot substitute for the whole traditional teachings. In recent years, the technologies of data mining, such as the data clustering, decision tree learning and association rule, etc. are widely applied to the information industry. In addition, because that the e-learning gets more popular as well as the Internet technologies become more mature, if adopting the concept of data mining to e-learning system, it will be helpful to make learning more efficient. Thus, we plan to integrate the techniques of LDAP and JAXB to reduce the load of development of search engine and the complexity of content parsing. Additionally, through analyzing the logs of learners' learning behaviors, the likely keywords and the association among the learning course contents will be conducted or figured out. And then, we integrate with the metadata of the learning materials distributed in different platforms, and maintain them in the LDAP server. Based on the experienced behaviors of previous learners, it will be better for learners to efficiently navigate the e-learning course contents with such the assistance of suggestion of relevant contents.

The method used both significance information of attributes and information of discernibility matrix to define the necessity of heuristic feature selection. The advantage of the algorithm is that it can find an optimal reduct for feature selection in most cases. Experimental results confirmed the above assertion. It also shown that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in time performance comparing with other similar computation methods.

Most current DM tools only support automatic modeling, during which uses have little interaction with computing machines other than assigning some parameter values at the beginning of the process. Arbitrary selection of parameter values, however, can lead to an unproductive modeling process. Automatic modeling also downplays the key roles played by humans in current knowledge discovery systems. Classification is the process of finding models that distinguish data classes in order to predict the class of objects whose class labels are unknown. Decision tree is one of the most widely used classification tools. A novel interactive visual decision tree (IVDT) classification process has been proposed in this research; it aims to facilitate decision tree classification process regarding enhancing users' understanding and improving the effectiveness of the process by combining the flexibility, creativity, and general knowledge of humans with the enormous storage capacity and computational power of computers. An IVDT for categorical input attributes has been developed and experimented on twenty subjects to test three hypotheses regarding its potential advantages. The experimental results suggested that compared to the automatic modeling process as typically applied in current decision tree modeling tools, IVDT process can improve the effectiveness of modeling in terms of producing trees with relatively high classification accuracies and small sizes, enhance users' understanding of the algorithm, and give them greater satisfaction with the task.

In this paper, we firstly give an improved semantic smoothing model for text data stream environment. Then we use the improved semantic model to improve the clustering quality and present an online clustering algorithm for clustering massive text data streams. In our algorithm, a new cluster statistics structure, cluster profile, is presented in which the semantics of text data streams are captured. We also present the experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of our technique.

The existing character recognition algorithms are focused mainly on increasing the recognition rate. However, as in the recent Google Library Project, the requirement for speeding up recognition of enormous amount of documents is growing. Moreover, the existing algorithms do not pay enough attention to Asian characters. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for fast recognition of Asian characters based on the database methodologies. Since the number of Asian characters is very large and their shapes are complicated, Asian characters require much more recognition time than numeric and Roman characters. The proposed algorithm extracts the feature from each of Asian characters through the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and optimizes the recognition speed by storing and retrieving the features using a multidimensional index. We improve the recognition speed of the proposed algorithm using the association rule technique, which is a widely adopted data mining technique. The proposed algorithm has the advantage that it can be applied regardless of the language, size, and font of the characters to be recognized.

Distribution rules are a kind of association rules particularly suited for the exploratory study of numerical variables of interest. Being an exploratory technique, the result of a distribution mining process is typically a very large number of patterns. Exploring such results is thus a complex task and limits the use of the technique. To overcome this shortcoming we developed a tool, written in Java, which supports subgroup discovery in a post-processing step. The tool engages the analyst in an interactive process of subgroup discovery by means of a graphical interface with well defined statistical grounds, where domain knowledge can be used during the identification of such subgroups amid the population. We show a case study to analyze the results of students in a large scale university admission examination.

The extraction of frequent (closed) itemsets is a very expensive phase needed to extract from a transactional database a reduced set of meaningful association rules. We figure out an environment where different datasets are stored in different sites. We assume that, due to the huge size of datasets and privacy concerns, dataset partitions cannot be moved to a centralized site where to materialize the whole dataset and perform the mining task. Thus it becomes mandatory to perform separate mining at each site, and then merge local results for deriving global knowledge. This paper shows how frequent closed itemsets, mined independently at each site, can be merged in order to derive globally frequent closed itemsets. Unfortunately, such merging might produce a superset of all the frequent closed itemsets, while the associated supports could be smaller than the exact ones because some globally frequent closed itemsets might be not locally frequent in some partitions. To avoid an expensive post-processing phase, needed to compute exact global results, we use a method to approximate the supports of closed itemsets. The approximation is only needed for those globally (closed) frequent itemsets which are locally infrequent on some dataset partitions, and thus are not returned at all from the corresponding sites.

One of the difficulties encountered is how to evaluate the relevance of the extracted rules? Many authors use statistical interestingness measures to evaluate the relevance of each rule (taken alone). Recently, few research works have done a synthesis study of the existing interestingness measures but their study presents some limits. In this paper, firstly, we present an overview of related works studying more than forty interestingness measures. Secondly, we establish a list of nineteen other interestingness measures not referenced by the related works. Then, we identify twelve semantic properties characterizing the behavior of interestingness measures. Finally, we did a theoretical study of sixty two interestingness measures by outlining their semantic properties. The results of this study are useful to the users of a data-mining system in order to help them to choose an appropriate measure.

It is often not practical or possible to keep the entire data set in main memory and often the data could be observed in a single run in the order in which they are presented. Traditional reservoir-based approaches perform well in this situation. One drawback of these approaches is that the examples not included in the final reservoir are often ignored. To remedy this situation we propose a modification to the baseline reservoir algorithm. Instead of keeping the actual target values of reservoir examples, an estimate of their conditional expectation is kept and updated online as new data are observed from the stream. The estimate is obtained by averaging target values of the similar examples. The proposed algorithm uses a paired t-test to determine the similarity threshold. Thorough evaluation on generated two dimensional data shows that the proposed algorithm is producing reservoirs with considerably reduced target noise. This property allows training of significantly improved prediction models as compared with the baseline reservoir-based approach.

In this paper, we compare the memory requirements and support counting performance of FP Tree, and Compressed Patricia Trie against several novel variants of vertical bit vectors. First, borrowing ideas from the VLDB domain, we compress vertical bit vectors using WAH encoding. Second, we evaluate the Gray code rank-based transaction reordering scheme, and show that in practice, simple lexicographic ordering, obtained by applying LSB Radix soil, outperforms this scheme. Led by these results, we propose HDO, a novel Hamming-distance-based greedy transaction reordering scheme, and aHDO, a linear-time approximation to HDO. We present results Of experiments performed on 15 common datasets with varying degrees of sparseness, and show that HDO-reordered WAH encoded bit vectors can take as little as 5% of the uncompressed space, while aHDO achieves similar compression on sparse datasets. Finally, with results from over a billion database and data mining style frequency query executions, we show that bitmap-based approaches result in up to hundreds of times faster support counting, and HDO-WAH encoded bitmaps offer the best space-time tradeoff.

Unfortunately, nowadays there isn't a formal process model for this kind of projects, or existing approaches are not right or complete enough. In some sense, present situation is comparable to that in software that led to 'software crisis' in latest 60's. Software Engineering matured based on process models and methodologies. Data Mining's evolution is being parallel to that in Software Engineering. The research work described in this paper proposes a Process Model for Data Mining Projects based on the study of current Software Engineering Process Models (IEEE Std 1074 and ISO 12207) and the most used Data Mining Methodology CRISP-DM (considered as a "facto" standard) as basic references.

Collaborative filtering systems rely on user-to-user similarities using standard similarity measures. The symmetry of most standard similarity measures makes it difficult to differentiate users' patterns based on their historical behaviour. That means, they are not able to distinguish between two users when one user' behaviour is quite similar to the other but not vice versa. We have found that the k-nearest neighbour algorithm may generate groups which are not necessarily homogenous. In this paper, we use an asymmetric similarity measure in order to distinguish users' patterns. Recommendations are delivered based on the users' historical behaviour closest to a target user. Preliminary experimental results have shown that the similarity measure used is a powerful tool for differentiating users' patterns.

Simplified polynomial neural network for classification task in data mining	2007 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-10, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	SEP 25-28, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE				In solving classification task of data mining the, traditional Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) algorithm takes longer time while generating complex mathematical models. PNN algorithm takes the combinations two or three inputs to generates one Partial. Description (PD) for the next layer. The output of the PDs becomes the input to the next layer. The number of PDs in each layer increases very fast, which consume lot of time for evaluation of the coefficients of the PDs, consume huge memory and increase complexity of the model. We propose Simplified Polynomial Neural Network (SPNN) for the task of classification. PDs for a single layer of the PNN model are developed. The outputs of these PDs along with the original inputs from the dataset are fed to a single perception model of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) without any hidden layers. The ANN is trained with gradient descent method as well as with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The results of both techniques for training are considered for the comparison of the performance. Simulation and result shows that the performance of SPNN is better than PNN model.	[Misra, B.

In this setting, queries which return patterns are called inductive queries and solving them is one of the core research topics for data mining. Indeed, constraint-based mining techniques on string datasets have been studied extensively. Efficient algorithms enable to compute complete collections of patterns (e.g., substrings) which satisfy conjunctions of monotonic and/or anti-monotonic constraints in large datasets (e.g., conjunctions of minimal and maximal support constraints). We consider that fault-tolerance and softness are extremely important issues for tackling real-life data analysis. We address some of the open problems when evaluating soft-support constraint which implies the computations of pattern soft-occurrences instead of the classical exact matching ones. Solving efficiently soft-support constraints is challenging since it prevents from the clever use of monotonicity properties. We describe our proposal and we provide an experimental validation on real-life clickstream data which confirms the added value of this approach.

However, the companies in this area still face several difficulties to benefit from data mining. A major problem is to extract useful information from the currently available non-labeled digitized time series. This work focuses on automatic classification of faults in transmission lines. These faults are responsible for the majority of the disturbances and cascading blackouts. To circumvent the current lack of labeled data, the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) simulator was used to create a public comprehensive labeled dataset. Results with different preprocessing (e.g., wavelets) and learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees and neural networks) are presented, which indicate that neural networks outperform the other methods.

Data mining query languages can be designed to support such a feature. There are data mining query languages like DMQL for mining relational databases. In this paper, we have proposed a new data mining language for mining transaction databases called TDML. This proposed language mines association rule mining and sequential pattern mining. It uses a new bit map processing approach with buffered storage of results. Various types of data mining approaches that are supported like generalized mining, multilevel mining, multidimensional mining, distributed mining, partition mining, incremental mining, online mining, merge mining, transaction reduction, stream mining and targeted itemset mining.

Many of these techniques are based on the importance of relationships among the interacting units. A number of models and measures that analyze the relationship importance (link structure) have been proposed (e.g., centrality, importance and page rank) and they are generally based on intuition, where the analyst intuitively decides a reasonable model that fits the underlying data. In this paper, we address the problem of learning such models directly from training data. Specifically, we study a way to calibrate a connection strength measure from training data in the context of reference disambiguation problem. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model surpasses the best model used for reference disambiguation in the past, leading to better quality of reference disambiguation.

The data mining methodology while extracting useful, valid patterns from higher education database environment contribute to proactively ensuring students maximize their academic output. This paper develops a methodology by the derivation of performance prediction indicators to deploying a simple student performance assessment and monitoring system within a teaching and learning environment by mainly focusing on performance monitoring of students' continuous assessment (tests) and examination scores in order to predict their final achievement status upon graduation. Based on various data mining techniques (DMT) and the application of machine learning processes, rules are derived that enable the classification of students in their predicted classes. The deployment of the prototyped solution, integrates measuring, 'recycling' and reporting procedures in the new system to optimize prediction accuracy.			ogor@tciway.tc					ALLENBY GM, 1999, J ECONOMETRICS; Barker Kash, 2004, P 2004 SYST INF ENG, P79; COUNCIL N, 2001, KNOWING WHAT STUDENT; Delavari Naeimeh, 2005, ITHET 6 ANN INT C JU, pF4B; FRAWLEY WJ, 1997, KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, P1; Lakshminarayan K, 1996, P 2 INT C KNOWL DISC, P140; Luan J., 2002, DATA MINING KNOWLEDG; LUAN J, 2001, AIR C LONG BEACH CA, P1; Luau J., 2002, DATA MINING ITS APPL; MICHALSKI RS, 1978, 897 ISG; NOLAN J, 1998, AAAI IAAI P, P1134; RUBENKING N, 2001, PC MAGAZINE     0522; Shavelson R.

Recently, the works related to anomaly-based intrusion detection have attracted considerable attention because the anomaly detection technique can handle previously unknown intrusion methods effectively. However, most of them assume that the normal behavior of a user is fixed. Due to this reason, the new activities of the user may be regarded as anomalous events. In this paper, a new anomaly detection method based on an incremental clustering algorithm is proposed. To adaptively model the normal behavior of a user, the new profile of the user is effectively merged to the old one whenever new user transactions are added to the original data set.

To solve this problem, we propose a new approach called extreme outlier elimination and hybrid sampling technique. k Reverse Nearest Neighbors (kRNNs) concept used as a data cleaning method for eliminating extreme outliers in minority regions. Hybrid sampling technique, a combination of SMOTE to over-sample the minority data (fraud samples) and random under-sampling to under-sample the majority data (non-fraud samples) is used for improving the fraud detection accuracy. This method was evaluated in terms of True Positive rate and True Negative rate on the insurance fraud dataset. We conducted the experiments with classifiers namely C4.5, Naive Bayes, k-NN and Radial Basis Function networks and compared the performance of our approach against simple hybrid sampling technique. Obtained results shown that extreme outlier elimination from minority class, produce high predictions for both fraud and non-fraud classes.	[Padmaja, T. Maruthi; Dhulipalla, Narendra; Krishna, P.

The problem to detect the fraud is that the dataset is unbalanced where non-fraudulent class heavily dominates the fraudulent class. In this work, we considered the fraud detection problem as unbalanced data classification problem and proposed a model based on hybrid sampling technique, which is a combination of random under-sampling and over-sampling using SMOTE. Here, SMOTE is used to widen the data region corresponding to minority samples and random under-sampling of majority class is used for balancing the class distribution. The value difference metric (VDM) is used as distance measure while doing SMOTE. We conducted the experiments with classifiers namely k-NN, Radial Basis Function networks, C4.5 and Naive Bayes with varied levels of SMOTE on insurance fraud dataset. For evaluating the learned classifiers, we have chosen fraud catching rate, non-fraud catching rate in addition to overall accuracy of the classifier as performance measures. Results indicate that our approach produces high predictions against fraud and non-fraud classes.	[Padmaja, T. Maruthi; Dhulipalla, Narendra; Krishna, P.

As such it represents a possible alternative to more common methods for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (e.g. electromyography). However, manual analysis of thermal images can be a tedious job, requiring some patience and accuracy. Here we present a software-based intelligent system for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Artificial neural networks, known as a well established data mining technique, were used for thermal image anallysis. Reliability was tested oil 44 images (23 depicting pathological hands and 21 healthly). Results acquired are presented.

Specifically, the localization problem is to determine the location of a client device accurately given the radio signal strength values received at the client device from multiple beacon sensors or access points. Conventional data mining and machine learning methods can be applied to solve this problem. However, all of them require large amounts of labeled training data, which can be quite expensive. In this paper. we propose a probabilistic semi-supervised learning approach to reduce the calibration effort and increase the tracking accuracy. Our method is based on semi-supervised conditional random fields which can enhance the learned model from a small set of training data with abundant unlabeled data effectively. To make our method more efficient, we exploit a Generalized EM algorithm coupled with domain constraints. We validate our method through extensive experiments in a real sensor network using Crossbow MICA2 sensors. The results demonstrate the advantages of methods compared to other state-of-the-art object-tracking algorithms.

Based on analyzing the demand of intelligent transportation system and the problems of the exiting recognition methods, the intelligent real-time recognition method of chaos in traffic flow was proposed. The principle and the structure of the system are briefly introduced. There are online recognition subsystem and offline recognition subsystem mainly. Normal methods are used in the offline recognition model. The online recognition model was established using reduced support vector machine, which the wavelet packet energy features vector of the anterior time series of traffic flow in every training samples were used as input variables. The reduced samples are treated as the final training sample. When the new samples are appended, the reduced set may be updated. The rules of models can be updated and the problem of large sample size could be solved. The simulation result shows that the method is correct and feasible. And it can satisfy the real-time requirement of chaos recognition.

Color correlogram extracts not only the color distribution of pixels in images like color histogram, but also extracts the spatial information of pixels in the images. The characteristic of the color correlogram to take into account the spatial information as well as the distribution of color pixels greatly attracts the researcher for content based image retrieval. Even though, a single correlogram is not enough for efficient and robust image retrieval system. In this paper, we propose the use of color correlogram on multiresolution images. The multiresolution color correlograin gives much better retrieval efficiency but with higher computations. The multiresolution images are generated using the median filters.

One of the most popular and widely studied clustering methods is K-means. Several improvements to the standard K-means algorithm have been carried out, most of them related to the initial parameter values. In contrast, this article proposes an improvement using a new convergence condition that consists of stopping the execution when a local optimum is found or no more object exchanges among groups can be performed. For assessing the improvement attained, the modified algorithm (Early Stop K-means) was tested on six databases of the UCI repository, and the results were compared against SPSS, Weka and the standard K-means algorithm. Experimentally Early Stop K-means obtained important reductions in the number of iterations and improvements in the solution quality with respect to the other algorithms.

The system utilizes data-mining techniques (association rules mining) that operate on top of query-specific XML documents. Application of HealthObs on a real world breast-cancer clinico-genomic study demonstrates the utility and efficiency of the approach.

In our paper, we introduce a new approach to discovering compound nouns, including proper compound nouns. Our approach combines the data mining methods with shallow lexical analysis. We propose a simple pattern language for specifying grammatical patterns to be satisfied by extracted compound nouns. Our method requires annotating the words with part of speech tags, thus to this extent, it is language-dependent. Based on the data mining GSP algorithm, we propose T-GSP as its modification for extracting frequent text patterns, and in particular, frequent word sequences that satisfy given grammatical rules. The obtained sequences are regarded as candidates for compound nouns. The experiments have proven very high quality of the method.

The process may be done on a dedicated and expensive machinery or, for some tasks, one can use distributed computing techniques on a network of affordable machines. In either approach it is usual the user to specify the workflow of the sub-tasks composing the whole KDD process before execution starts. In this paper we propose a technique that we call Distributed Generative Data Mining. The generative feature of the technique is due to its capability of generating new sub-tasks of the Data Mining analysis process at execution time. The workflow of sub-tasks of the DM is, therefore, dynamic. To deploy the proposed technique we extended the Distributed Data Mining system HARVARD and adapted an Inductive Logic Programming system (IndLog) used in a Relational Data Ming task. As a proof-of-concept, the extended system was used to analyse an artificial dataset of a credit scoring problem with eighty million records.

Computational models of such diseases have led to new insights into the mechanism of action which have resulted in the development of novel therapeutic intervention strategies. Such models are generally quite complex because they incorporate a wide range of relevant biological variables and parameters. In this paper, we examine a biologically realistic computational model of acute ischaemic stroke with respect to the variable and parameter space using rough sets. The aim of this investigation was to extract a set(s) of variables and relevant parameters that predict in a qualitative fashion the final extent of tissue damage caused by a "typical" ischameic stroke.

In this paper, we are searching for mining patterns satisfying correct properties in presence of missing values (it means that these patterns must satisfy the properties in the corresponding complete database). We focus on k-free patterns. Thanks to a new definition of this property suitable for incomplete data and compatible with the usual one, we certify that the extracted k-free patterns in an incomplete database also satisfy this property in the corresponding complete database. Moreover, this approach enables to provide an anti-monotone criterion with respect to the pattern inclusion and thus design an efficient level-wise algorithm which extracts correct k-free patterns in presence of missing values.

Datasets representative of three of the most important types of cancer considered in modem medicine (liver, lung and stomach) are considered in the study. They are composed of samples from normal and tumor tissues, described in terms of tens of thousands of variables, which are the corresponding gene expression intensities measured in microarray experiments. Despite the very high dimensionality of the studied patterns, high quality visual representations in the form of structure-preserving virtual spaces are obtained using SAMANN neural networks, which enables the differentiation of cancerous and noncancerous tissues. The same networks could be used as nonlinear feature generators in a preprocessing step for other data mining procedures.

The presence of these data in huge masses, their ambiguity and especially the high costs of the in vitro analysis in terms of time and money, make the use of data mining rather a necessity than a rational choice. However, the data mining techniques, which often process data under the relational format, are confronted with the inappropriate format of the biological sequences. Hence, an inevitable step of pre-processing must be established. This work presents the biological sequences encoding as a preparation step before their classification. We present three existing encoding methods based on the motifs extraction.

Given the large amount of sensor data that are obtained for intersections and from sensor-equipped cars, analysis and learning of such data is essential. This paper presents a new method to improve safety at intersections using a combination of a mathematical based collision detection algorithm and data mining. A number of scenarios at a simulated intersection are explored with encouraging results from our data mining implementation. The results suggest that our approach can help improve situation awareness and automate understanding of intersections, which, in turn, can be used to increase safety at intersections.

Nowadays, databases are distributed among two or more parties because of different reasons such as physical and geographical restrictions and the most important issue is privacy. Related data is normally maintained by more than one organization, each of which wants to keep its individual information private. Thus, privacy-preserving techniques and protocols are designed to perform data mining on distributed environments when privacy is highly concerned. Cluster analysis is a technique in data mining, by which data can be divided into some meaningful clusters, and it has an important role in different fields such as bio-informatics, marketing, machine learning, climate and medicine. k-means Clustering is a prominent algorithm in this category which creates a one-level clustering of data. In this paper we introduce privacy-preserving protocols for this algorithm, along with a protocol for Secure comparison, known as the Millionaires' Problem, as a sub-protocol, to handle the clustering of horizontally or vertically partitioned data among two or more parties.

However most reverse engineering techniques still consider a single view of a software system with restricted scope of analysis. In this paper we propose a novel approach that amalgamates dynamic and static views of a software system. The dynamic view is represented through profiling information that is extracted from executing a set of task scenarios that cover frequently used software features. The obtained profiling information is then embedded into a static view recovery process. We propose a pattern based structure recovery, as static view, that defines the high-level architecture of the software system using abstract components and interconnections that is defined using an architecture query language (AQL). In this context, both static and dynamic aspects of the software system are used to collect software entities into cohesive components whose dynamic interactions can be controlled The whole recovery process is modeled as a Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP). A case study with promising results on the Xfig drawing tool has also been presented.

Contrast sets, conjunctions of attribute-value pairs significantly more frequent in one group than another, were proposed to describe such differences, which lead to the introduction of a new data mining technique - contrast-set mining. A number of attempts have been made in this regard by various authors; however, no clear picture seems to have emerged In this paper, we try to address the problem of finding meaningful contrast sets by using Association Rule based analysis. We present the results for our experiments for interesting contrast sets and compare these results with those obtained from the well-known algorithm for contrast sets-STUCCO.

Such applications include spam filtering in the case where users never check emails marked "spam", document retrieval where users cannot give relevance feedback on unretrieved documents, and online advertising where user behavior cannot be observed for unshown advertisements. One-sided feedback can cripple the performance of classical mistake-driven online learners such as Perceptron. Previous work under the Apple Tasting framework showed how to transform standard online learners into successful learners from one sided feedback. However, we find in practice that this transformation may request more labels than necessary to achieve strong performance. In this paper, we employ two active learning methods which reduce the number of labels requested in practice. One method is the use of Label Efficient active learning. The other method, somewhat surprisingly, is the use of margin-based learners without modification, which we show combines implicit active learning and a greedy strategy to managing the exploration exploitation tradeoff. Experimental results show that these methods can be significantly more effective in practice than those using the Apple Tasting transformation, even on minority class problems.

Rank Aggregation for Similar Items	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	7th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 26-28, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	Amer Stat Assoc				The problem of combining the ranked preferences of many experts has gained renewed importance in data mining, and information retrieval applications. Effective rank aggregation becomes difficult in real-world situations in which the rankings are noisy, incomplete, or even disjoint. We address these difficulties by extending several standard methods of rank aggregation to consider similarity between items in the various ranked lists, in addition to their rankings. We establish evaluation criteria for these algorithms by extending previous definitions of distance between ranked lists to include the role of similarity between items. Experimental results show that this approach improves the performance of several standard rank aggregation methods, particularly when used with noisy, incomplete rankings.

However, law enforcement agencies, particularly in view of current emphasis on terrorism, increasingly face the challenge of information overload and lack of advanced, automated techniques for the effective analysis of criminal and terrorism activities. Data mining applied in the context of law enforcement and intelligence analysis, called Investigative Data Mining (IDM), holds the promise of alleviating such problems. An important problem targeted by IDM is the identification of terror/crime networks, based on available intelligence and other information.

With proper composition of the building block, most applications, such as; circuit evaluation, data mining, and private information retrieval, can be executed securely and collaboratively by potentially dishonest parties. In this work, we propose a commodity-based secure number-product protocol, the security of which has been validated with the metrics proposed by Chiang et al. based on information theory. We prove that the protocol can be executed securely under the assumption of semi-honest behavior. Furthermore, if an extra semi-trusted party exists, the proposed protocol can resist any number of corrupt parties. In addition to the security issue, we compare the. protocol's communication and computation costs with those of the theoretically secure solution proposed by Ben-Or et al.

Most previous data mining and machine learning research, however, assumes that a fixed set of training examples is given. In this paper, we propose an online cost-sensitive framework that allows a learner to dynamically acquire examples as it learns, and to decide the ideal number of examples needed to minimize the total cost. We also propose a new strategy for Partial Example Acquisition (PAS), in which the learner can acquire examples with a subset of attribute values to reduce the data acquisition cost. Experiments on UCI datasets show that the new PAS strategy is an effective method in reducing the total cost for data acquisition.

CSRoulette is based on cost proportional roulette sampling technique (called CPRS in short). CSRoulette is closely related to Costing, another cost-sensitive meta-learning algorithm, which is based on rejection sampling. Unlike rejection sampling which produces smaller samples, CPRS can generate different size samples. To further improve its performance, we apply ensemble (bagging) on CPRS; the resulting algorithm is called CSRoulette. Our experiments show that CSRoulette outperforms Costing and other meta-learning methods in most datasets tested. In addition, we investigate the effect of various sample sizes and conclude that reduced sample sizes (as in rejection sampling) cannot be compensated by increasing the number of bagging iterations.

Protein Ontology is a standard for representing protein data in a way that helps in defining data integration and data mining models for Protein Structure and Function. In paper we summarize the development of PO that we discussed in previous chapters. A large number of diverse bioinformatics sources are available today. The future of biological sciences promises more data. No individual data source will provide us with answers to queries that we need to ask. Instead knowledge has to be composed from multiple data sources to answer the queries. Even though multiple databases may cover same data their focus might be different. Thus, Protein Ontology Project is an ongoing project with creation of every new protein data source. We also outline herein this paper the future work that we will be doing in Protein Ontology Project.

Science gateways, based on service oriented architectures and scientific workflows, provide yet another step in democratizing access to advanced numerical and scientific tools, computational resource and massive data storage, and fostering collaborations. Dynamic, data-driven applications, such as those found in weather forecasting, present interesting challenges to Science Gateways, which are being addressed as part of the LEAD Cyberinfrastructure project. In this article, we discuss three important data related problems faced by such adaptive data-driven environments: managing a user's personal workspace and metadata on the Grid, tracking the provenance of scientific workflows and data products, and continuous data mining over observational weather data.

In order to apply these algorithms effectively to any dataset the continuous attribute need to be transformed to discretized ones. This paper presents an approach using Clustering and Rough Set Theory (RST). The experiments are performed on four datasets from UCI ML repository. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with some common discretization methods based on the two parameters - the number of intervals and the Class-Attribute Interdependence Redundancy (CAIR) value. The results of the proposed method show a satisfactory trade off between the number of intervals and the information loss due to discretization.

Due to a variety of reasons inherent in web browsing and web logging, the likelihood of bad or incomplete data is higher than conventional applications. The analytical techniques in web mining need to accommodate such data. Fuzzy and rough sets provide the ability to deal with incomplete and approximate information. Fuzzy set theory has been shown to be useful in three important aspects of web and data mining, namely clustering, association, and sequential analysis. There is increasing interest in research on clustering based on rough set theory. Clustering is an important part of web mining that involves finding natural groupings of web resources or web users. Researchers have pointed out some important differences between clustering in conventional applications and clustering in web mining. For example, the clusters and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. As a result, researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in web mining clustering applications. Recent attempts have used genetic algorithms based on rough set theory for clustering. However, the genetic algorithms based clustering may not be able to handle the large amount of data typical in a web mining application. This paper proposes a variation of the K-means clustering algorithm based on properties of rough sets topology.

In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of the Apriori algorithm and then propose an enhancement for improving its efficiency. The improved algorithm is based on the combination of forward scan and reverse scan of a given database. If certain conditions are satisfied, the improved algorithm can greatly reduce the scanning times required for the discovery of candidate itemsets. Theoretical proof and analysis are given for the rationality of our algorithm. A simulation instance is given in order to show the advantages of this algorithm compared with Apriori.

The min-cut bipartitioning problem is a fundamental graph partitioning problem and is NP-Complete. In this paper, we present an effective multi-level refinement algorithm based on swarm intelligence for bisecting graph. The success of our algorithm relies on exploiting both the swarm intelligence theory with a boundary refinement policy. Our experimental evaluations on 18 different benchmark graphs show that our algorithm produces high quality solutions compared with those produced by MeTiS that is a state-of-the-art partitioner in the literature.

As the use of experiments to validate the function of biological sequence is too expensive and hardly to be applied to large-scale data, the use of computer for prediction of gene function has become an economical and effective substitute. This paper proposes a new design of BLAST-based GO term annotator which incorporates data mining techniques and utilizes rough set theory. Moreover, this method is an evolution against the traditional methods which only base on BLAST or characters of GO Terms. Finally, experimental results prove the validity of the proposed rough set-based method.

Nevertheless, in order to assure further usability of SAR images, specific data mining tools are still to be developed to provide an efficient automatic interpretation of SAR data. The aim of this paper is to introduce texture analysis performed in the framework of time - frequency theory, as a means to detect oil spills in the sea surface. In particular, an algorithm permitting a precise quantitative characterization of the border between the oil spill candidate and the sea, will allow a novel classification of oil spills and look-alikes.

We made two contributions. First, we propose a novel hybrid approach, which takes advantage of the strength of the two existing approaches, randomization and the secure multi-party computation (SMC), to balance the accuracy and efficiency constraints. Compared to these two existing approaches, our proposed approach can achieve much better accuracy than randomization approach and much reduced computation cost than SMC approach. We also propose a multi-group scheme that makes it flexible for data miners to control the balance between data mining accuracy and privacy. We partition attributes into groups, and develop a scheme to conduct group-based randomization to achieve better data mining accuracy. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed schemes for the ID3 decision tree algorithm.

The World Wide Web has become in reality, the largest online information available practically to anyone with access to Internet. An e-business framework is proposed in the paper, as well as the knowledge discovery technique to personalize e-business, increase cross selling; and improve the customer relationship management. Due to the enormous size of the Web and low precision of user queries, results returned from present Web search engines can reach hundreds or even thousands data Therefore, finding the tight information can he difficult if not impossible. One approach that tries to solve this problem is by using clustering techniques for grouping similar data together in order to facilitate presentation of results in more compact form and enable browsing of the results set.

Privacy, however, is a concern. In many situations it is required that data mining should be conducted without any privacy being violated. In response to this requirement, this paper proposes an effective distributed privacy-preserving data mining approach called CRDM (Collusion-Resistant Data Mining). CRDM is characterized by its ability to resist the collusion. Let the number of sites participating in data mining be M. Unless the number of colluding sites is not less than M - 1, privacy cannot be violated. Results of both analytical and experimental performance study demonstrated the effectiveness of CRDM.

We propose a framework that avoids this bias by supporting all major model structures e.g. clustering, sequences, etc., as well as specifications of data and DM (Data Mining) algorithms, in the same language. A unification operation is provided to match automatically the data to the relevant DM algorithms in order to extract models and their related structure. The MDL principle is used to evaluate and rank models. This evaluation is based on the covering relation that links the data to the models. The notion of schema, related to the category theory, is the key concept of our approach. Intuitively, a schema is an algebraic specification enhanced by the union of types, and the concepts of list and relation. An example based on network alarm mining illustrates the process.

Machine learning and data mining give us techniques which can be used to analyze that data and uncover previously unknown rules and associations, hidden knowledge which once acquired - and properly interpreted - can be used in multitude of ways. Even though data mining has mostly been used by the marketing field, lately it is not uncommon to use machine learning techniques in other environments. This paper presents how data mining algorithms and techniques can be used in the academic community to potentially improve some aspects of education quality.

Neural network as a data mining method commonly is used to find classification knowledge in IDSS. But the classic data mining based on neural network is short in dealing with the blank value data or data with the character of blurring and randomicity. Such data is called as imperfect data. In order to overcoming this shortcoming the method of combination of cloud model and neural network to find knowledge from imperfect data in IDSS is proposed. Firstly the cloud is used to depict the imperfect data by group decision. In the following, attribution generation based on cloud model or grey cloud model is used to generate the upper concept layer. In this step the cloud model depicting the imperfect data is classified into the concept layer that is proximal to itself according to distance between two cloud models. Then classic neural network method is used to gain knowledge. The data is input into the neural network to training and gaining the classification knowledge. Lastly an experiment is given to verify the validity of the method.

It is the process of extracting patterns or predicting previously unknown and useful trends from large quantities of data by using the knowledge of multidisciplinary fields such as statistics, mode identify, artificial intelligence., machine learning, database, management information system and so on. The artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the techniques of data mining. It is the nonlinear auto-fit dynamic system made of many cells with simulating the construction of biology neural systems. ANN has the ability to mapping high nonlinear system, associable memory and abstractly generalization. It can make model from analyzing the mode in the data and discover the unknown knowledge. The present paper gives an engineering application of data mining based on neural networks. The back propagation (BP) neural network is used as the algorithm of data mining. Then the effects of structural technologic parameters on stress in the weld region of the shield engine rotor in a submarine are analyzed. The mined data come from the numerical simulations of the finite element method. The effects of different parameters on the stress in the weld region are achieved from the results of the data mining. The discovered knowledge is beneficial to the security improvement of structural strength design for the engine rotor.	[Wang, L.; Sui, T.

Recently, M.S.Ying introduces a novel fuzzy framework for linguistic quantifiers which are modeled by Sugeno integrals. Essentially, the conjunction and disjunction in Ying's framework are interpreted as the "min" and "max" operations, which restricts the application of this theory in some sense. In this paper, we extended Ying's framework by interpreting the conjunction and disjunction as t-norm and t-conorm respectively. And some elegant logical results for our framework have been obtained.

Detecting worms, especially new, unseen worms, is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new worm detection approach based on mining dynamic program executions. This approach captures dynamic program behavior to provide accurate and efficient detection against both seen and unseen worms. In particular, we execute a large number of real-world worms and benign programs (executables), and trace their system calls. We apply two classifier-learning algorithms (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) to obtain classifiers from a large number of features extracted from the system call traces. The learned classifiers are further used to carry out rapid worm detection with low overhead on the end-host. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to detect new worms in terms of a very high detection rate and a low false positive rate.

Generally speaking, the relation is considered to have a highly complicated structure containing the influences from various financial factors characterizing the enterprise. Recent development of data mining techniques has significantly extended the power to model such a complicated relation in accurate and tractable manners. In this study, we assessed the feasibility to model the relation in the framework of data mining, and analyzed the characteristics of the model.

Memory cost and adaptation cost are two major concerns of incremental learning algorithms. In this paper we provide a novel incremental learning method, AttributeNets, which is efficient both in memory utilization and updating cost of current hypothesis. AttributeNets is designed for addressing incremental classification problem. Instead of memorizing every detail of historical cases, the method only records statistical information of attribute values of learnt cases. For classification problem, AttributeNets could generate effective results interpretable to human beings.

It decomposes a high dimensional problem into several low dimensional ones in first step and then gets the final clusters by second clustering. Because the irrelevant attributes are removed from each cluster in first step, it diminishes the dimensions effectively. Furthermore, the algorithm compresses data effectively by using 'Sparse Feature Vector'. Data scale is reduced enormously, but clustering quality is not affected. Because of the effective dimension deduction and data compression, the algorithm finds clusters in high dimensional large datasets effectively and efficiently.

Instead examining all data features to detect intrusion or misuse patterns, the approach of Adhoc-based feature selection and support vector machine classifier for detect intrusion is performed. In this performance of IDS, Ad hoc technology is used to optimize the feature subset for raw data and 10-fold cross validation is used to optimize the parameters of SVM for intrusion detection. The result of our experiments shows that the FS & SVM is not only superior to the famous data mining strategy, but also superior to other intelligent paradigms.

To improve the performance and reliability of the traditional Linux LVM snapshot, we propose a novel cached dependent snapshot system, Esnap. Esnap decreases the total amount of data copy effectively using the data dependency among snapshot volumes. A new snapshot metadata organization scheme is designed to support massive snapshot volumes and the corresponding read / write algorithms are put forward. Also the automatic extending of snapshot volumes is implemented in Esnap to avoid the failure of the whole dependent snapshot chain due to space overflow of one snapshot. Experimental results show that Esnap has higher performance, reliability and the resource utilization rate than traditional Linux LVM snapshot system.

One of the most commonly used techniques in data mining, Artificial Neural Networks provide non-linear predictive models that learn through training and resemble biological neural networks in structure. This paper deals with a new adaptive neural network model: a feed-forward higher order neural network with a new activation function called neuron-adaptive activation function. Experiments with function approximation and stock market movement analysis have been conducted to justify the new adaptive neural network model. Experimental results have revealed that the new adaptive neural network model presents several advantages over traditional neuron-fixed feed-forward networks such as much reduced network size, faster learning, and more promising financial analysis.

One of the objectives of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems is to help reduce the number of unexpected failures by continuously monitoring the components of interest and predicting their failures sufficiently in advance to allow for proper planning. In other words, PHM systems may help turn unexpected failures into expected ones. Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of data mining to help build prognostic models for PHM but also has identified the need for new model evaluation methods that take into account the specificities of prognostic applications. This paper investigates this problem. First, it reviews classical and recent methods to evaluate data mining models and it explains their deficiencies with respect to prognostic applications. The paper then proposes a novel approach that overcomes these deficiencies. This approach integrates the various costs and benefits involved in prognostics to quantify the cost saving expected from a given prognostic model. From the end user's perspective, the formula is practical as it is easy to understand and requires realistic inputs. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methods through a real-world case study involving data-mining prognostic models and realistic costs/benefits information. The results show the feasibility of the approach and its applicability to various prognostic applications.

This paper analyze the usage of personal data in electronic commerce firstly, Then discuss the P3P to realize security of personal data. This mechanism cannot guarantee that Web sites do act according to their policies once they have obtained user's personal data. In light of this, a new algorithm was used to acquire improved security. The proposed algorithm uses homomorphism as principle to preserve privacy. This method can make the important data to be appeared with secret content in the web service, and prevent personal data from being misused. The simulation results proved that the modified method can protect personal privacy effectively, and can carry on data mining to provide the characteristic service for the customer and modified method has shorter response time.

Although these network management tasks require deep understanding of network status, various new network devices make it difficult by increasing the complexity of whole network system. This paper proposes a visualization technique of network status that uses a frequent itemset mining algorithm to find important phenomena in the network. We also show that a simple interface with the proposed technique can visualize not only the ordinal network status but also the various security incidents. The understanding of the ordinal network status and the rapid finding of security incident helps the naive users in monitoring and configuring network equipments. Finding of various security incidents from real Internet traffic data are described as the typical usage of the proposed visualization technique.

Spatial data mining for optimized selection of facility locations in field-based services	2007 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	APR 01-05, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			DATA SETS; ALGORITHMS	Spatial data mining has been developed as the effective technique in many applications that involve large amounts of geo-spatial data. Many organizations provide field-based services such as delivery, field-services and emergency to their customers. Considering the geographical distribution of the customer request points, the location of facilities will have noticeable impact on the overall efficiency of the company's operations. The closer the facilities are to the customers, the sooner and cheaper will be the service provision transaction. In this paper, we empirically study the role of spatial clustering methods in such context. We have implemented and tuned some of the main spatial clustering algorithms to discover the best locations for facility establishment. A new spatial clustering algorithm is proposed that does not require the number of facilities as input. The new algorithm will determine the optimal number of facilities along with their locations based on the business context trade-offs. Many experiments are conducted to study the performance of the studied algorithms on real world and synthetic data sets. The results reveal valuable distinctions between the different methods and confirm the higher efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

One of the key purposes of customer segmentation is customer retention. But the application of single data mining technology mentioned in previous literatures is unable to identify customer chum trend for adopting different actions on customer retention. This paper focus on constructs a integrated data mining and survival analysis model to segment customers into heterogeneous group by their survival probability (chum trend) and help enterprises adopting appropriate actions to retain profitable customers according to each segment's chum trend. This model contains two components. Firstly, using data mining clustering arithmetic cluster customers into heterogeneous clusters according to their survival characters. Secondly, using survival analysis predicting each cluster's survival/hazard function to identify their chum trend and test the validity of clustering for getting the correct customer segmentation. This model proposed by this paper was applied in a dataset from one biggest china telecommunications company. This paper also suggests some propositions for further research.

The hypothesis of independent demand, which falls short of the real state, has been widely introduced in the model of traditional production planning. In general, the future demand and current orders are not completely independent. This paper introduces the data mining method of timing association rules to the model of MTO production planning. Through timing association rules, the relevancy of the future demand and current orders is considered and the future order demand can be forecasted from the history order data by association rules, The heuristic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the model. A numeric example is built to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm.

However how to set the right trade-off between the abstraction levels of the local data sources and the global model accuracy is crucial for getting the optimal abstraction, especially when the local data are inter-correlated to different extents. In this paper we define the optimal abstraction task as a game and compute the Nash equilibrium as its solution. Also, we propose an iterative version of the game so that the Nash equilibrium can be computed by actively exploring details from the local sources in a need-to-know manner.

The change types for 1994-2002 and 1988-1994 were extracted and validated with overlay analysis of GIS. The experimental results were shown that the overall classification accuracy is 88.1% compared with 69.3% of MLC in 2002 for six watershed types, and detection accuracy for five change types was 89.1% and 91.4% respectively for 1994-2002 and 1988-1994. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is of capability for the change detecting, and can be achieved better accuracy at 30m resolution for distributed hydrological models with multitemporal data.

In this paper, a new stock time series segmentation algorithm is proposed. This proposed segmentation method contributes to containing both the important data points and the primitive trends like uptrend and downtrend, while most of the current algorithms only contain one aspect of that. The proposed segmentation algorithm is more efficient and effective in reserving the trends and less complexity than those combined split-and-merge segmentation algorithm. The research result shows that patterns found by using the algorithm and prior to the transaction time impact the stock transaction price. Encouraging experiment is reported from the tests that certain patterns appear most frequently before the low transaction price occurrence.

Building a brain informatics portal is, in fact, to develop a data mining grid centric multi-layer grid system on the Wisdom Web, on which various data mining agents are deployed, for multi-aspect data analysis. We propose an approach for collecting, modeling, transforming, managing, and mining multiple human brain data obtained from systematic fMRI/EEG experiments. The proposed approach provides a new way in Brain Informatics (BI) for automatic analysis and understanding of human brain data to replace human-expert centric visualization. We attempt to change the perspective of cognitive scientists from a single type of experimental data analysis towards a holistic view at a long-term, global field of vision to understand the principle, models and mechanisms of human information processing system.

There are two fundamental issues regarding the effectiveness of Web information gathering: information mismatch and overload. To tackle these difficult issues, an integrated information filtering and sophisticated data processing model has been presented in this paper In the first phase of the proposed scheme, an information filter that based on user search intents was incorporated in Web search process to quickly filter out irrelevant data. In the second data processing phase, a pattern taxonomy model (PTM) was carried out using the reduced data. PTM rationalizes the data relevance by applying data mining techniques that involves more rigorous computations. Several experiments have been conducted and the results show that more effective and efficient access Web information has been achieved using the new scheme.

In this paper, we present a prototype expense reimbursement system that dramatically reduces the elapsed time and costs involved, by eliminating paper from the process life cycle. Our complete solution involves (1) an electronic submission infrastructure that provides multi-channel image capture, secure transport and centralized storage of paper documents; (2) an unconstrained data mining approach to extracting relevant named entities from un-structured document images; (3) automation of auditing procedures that enables automatic expense validation with minimum human interaction. Extracting relevant named entities robustly from document images with unconstrained layouts and diverse formatting is a fundamental technical challenge to image-based data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. In many applications that require such capability, applying traditional language modeling techniques to the stream of OCR text does not give satisfactory result due to the absence of linguistic context. We present an approach for extracting relevant named entities from document images by combining rich page layout features in the image space with language content in the OCR text using a discriminative conditional random field (CRY) framework. We integrate this named entity extraction engine into our expense reimbursement solution and evaluate the system performance on large collections of real-world receipt images provided by IBM World Wide Reimbursement Center.

This paper introduces two methods for improving the efficiency of algorithm, such as filtrating basic item set, or ignoring the transaction records that are useless for frequent items generated. In order to meet the requirement of personal book recommendation service, we applied the improved algorithm to mine association rules from circulation records in university library.

Current industries have already entered the era of cross-industry competition, and only by cooperating with other industries can they quickly take advantage of all kinds of competitive opportunities. Data mining plays a decisive role in enabling firms get a better grasp of market trends, formulate strategies, suggest action plans, and improve competitive advantage. This study uses RFM analysis and data mining techniques with the focus on banks and other industrial partners as examples, and analyzes the behavior of banks' credit card customers. Since the buying behavior of credit card customers encompasses several industry products, this research proposes a potential customer mechanism, analyzing the interests of credit card customers and their need for all types of products in order to predict the next chance of a possible purchase.

Parallel Bifold: Large-scale parallel pattern mining with constraints	DISTRIBUTED AND PARALLEL DATABASES			English	Article						parallel data mining; frequent pattern mining; constraint-based mining; share-nothing memory		When computationally feasible, mining huge databases produces tremendously large numbers of frequent patterns. In many cases, it is impractical to mine those datasets due to their sheer size; not only the extent of the existing patterns, but mainly the magnitude of the search space. Many approaches have suggested the use of constraints to apply to the patterns or searching for frequent patterns in parallel. So far, those approaches are still not genuinely effective to mine extremely large datasets. We propose a method that combines both strategies efficiently, i.e. mining in parallel for the set of patterns while pushing constraints. Using this approach we could mine significantly large datasets; with sizes never reported in the literature before. We are able to effectively discover frequent patterns in a database made of billion transactions using a 32 processors cluster in less than an hour and a half.

Customs authorities and international traders need a HS code query tool to make their processing efficient and automatic. Since HS codes are identified at 5-7 levels of classification, then any intelligent coding service will need to combine a knowledge database, with the techniques of data mining, machine learning and semantics reasoning. In this paper, the authors propose a comprehensive solution for such a coding service. The architecture, related techniques, technical solution and implementation considerations for the proposed system have been provided. Several of the proposed functions and implementation techniques have been developed and deployed by the Shanghai International Airport Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau. The coding service has been published as a Web service, and has the potential to be widely used by authorities and international traders around the world. The proposed system may also be appropriate for other applications that relate to code or classification processes, such as RFID-based or product ontology based applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is devoted to a novel data clustering approach based on a generalized particle model (GPM). The GPM transforms the data clustering process into a stochastic process over the configuration space on a GPM array. The proposed approach is characterized by the self-organizing clustering and many advantages in terms of the insensitivity to noise, quality robustness to clustered data, suitability for high-dimensional and massive data sets, learning ability, openness and easier hardware implementation with the VLSI systolic technology. The analysis and simulations have shown the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed GPM approach to data clustering.

However, recent developments in data mining present a new challenge for database security even when traditional database security techniques, such as database access control, are employed. This paper presents a data mining framework using semi-supervised learning that demonstrates the potential for privacy leakage in multi-relational databases. Many different types of semi-supervised learning techniques, such as the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, can be used to demonstrate privacy leakage. However, we also introduce a new approach to semi-supervised learning, hyperclique pattern-based semi-supervised learning (HPSL), which differs from traditional semi-supervised learning approaches in that it considers the similarity among groups of objects instead of only pairs of objects. Our experimental results show that both the KNN and HPSL methods have the ability to compromise database security, although the HPSL is better at this privacy violation (has higher prediction accuracy) than the KNN method. Finally, we provide a principle for avoiding privacy leakage in multi-relational databases via semi-supervised learning and illustrate this principle with a simple preventive technique whose effectiveness is demonstrated by experiments.

Extraction of classification rules characterized by ellipsoidal regions using soft-computing techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; multilayer classification systems; rule extraction; regularization; self-organizing mapping; evolutionary strategy	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; CONVERGENCE; GENERATION; MLP	This article presents a soft-computing-based data mining technique that addresses methodology aspects on extracting classification rules characterized by ellipsoidal regions in feature space. Self-organizing mapping and statistical techniques are employed to initialize the rules. A regularization model embedding some information on recognition rate and generalization ability is presented for refining the initial rules. Rule optimization is implemented for each individual rule using an evolutionary strategy. To generate rules for patterns with low probability of occurrence but considerable conceptual importance, a multilayer structure of rule generation and use is proposed. Simulation results are carried out by three benchmark data sets, and compared with other data mining tools and classifiers, such as decision trees, BRAINNE (Building Representations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Neural Networks), support vector machine, and neural networks.

J	Levine, MD; Rajwade, A				Levine, Martin D.; Rajwade, Ajit			Three-dimensional view-invariant face recognition using a hierarchical pose-normalization strategy	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						3D face recognition; support vector regression; iterated closest point; 3D pose estimation; pose normalization; residual error	REGISTRATION	Face recognition from three-dimensional (3D) shape data has been proposed as a method of biometric identification as a way of either supplanting or reinforcing a two-dimensional approach. This paper presents a 3D face recognition system capable of recognizing the identity of an individual from a 3D facial scan in any pose across the view-sphere, by suitably comparing it with a set of models (all in frontal pose) stored in a database. The system makes use of only 3D shape data, ignoring textural information completely. Firstly, we propose a generic learning strategy using support vector regression [Burges, Data Mining Knowl Discov 2(2): 121-167, 1998] to estimate the approximate pose of a 3D head. The support vector machine (SVM) is trained on range images in several poses belonging to only a small set of individuals and is able to coarsely estimate the pose of any unseen facial scan. Secondly, we propose a hierarchical two-step strategy to normalize a facial scan to a nearly frontal pose before performing any recognition. The first step consists of either a coarse normalization making use of facial features or the generic learning algorithm using the SVM. This is followed by an iterative technique to refine the alignment to the frontal pose, which is basically an improved form of the Iterated Closest Point Algorithm [Besl and Mckay, IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 14(2):239-256, 1992]. The latter step produces a residual error value, which can be used as a metric to gauge the similarity between two faces. Our two-step approach is experimentally shown to outperform both of the individual normalization methods in terms of recognition rates, over a very wide range of facial poses. Our strategy has been tested on a large database of 3D facial scans in which the training and test images of each individual were acquired at significantly different times, unlike all except two of the existing 3D face recognition methods.

J	Chen, YJ; Chen, YB				Chen, Yangjun; Chen, Yibin			On the signature tree construction and analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						signature files; bit-slice files; S-trees; signature trees; information retrieval	FILES	Advanced database application areas, such as computer aided design, office automation, digital libraries, data-mining, as well as hypertext and multimedia systems, need to handle complex data structures with set-valued attributes, which can be represented as bit strings, called signatures. A set of signatures can be stored in a file, called a signature file. In this paper, we propose a new method to organize a signature file into a tree structure, called a signature tree, to speed up the signature file scanning and query evaluation. In addition, the average time complexity of searching a signature tree is analyzed and how to maintain a signature tree on disk is discussed. We also conducted experiments, which show that the approach of signature trees provides a promising index structure.

J	Kam, J; Dick, S				Kam, Jeffery; Dick, Scott			Comparing nearest-neighbour search strategies in the SMOTE algorithm	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING-REVUE CANADIENNE DE GENIE ELECTRIQUE ET INFORMATIQUE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th Annual Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		classification; data mining; machine learning; nearest-neighbour; oversampling; performance testing; resampling; skewness		Nearest-neighbour searches are a key element of the new SMOTE algorithm for resampling highly skewed datasets for machine learning. However, at present no work has been done to determine the most efficient and scalable neighbour search to use in the SMOTE algorithm. This question will be a key consideration if SMOTE is to be deployed in extremely large, highly skewed datasets. This paper reports on empirical investigations of two fast neighbour search strategies, namely, K-D trees and box-assisted neighbour searches. The times required to oversample three well-known datasets with SMOTE using these two strategies are compared to each other as well as to the time required for a brute-force sequential search strategy. In general, an order-of-magnitude improvement in execution time is found from sequential search to K-D trees, and a further order-of-magnitude improvement is found from K-D trees to box-assisted search, indicating that the SMOTE algorithm scales best with increasing dataset size when box-assisted search is used. However, it is also observed that SMOTE scales best with an increasing degree of oversampling when K-D trees are used as the neighbour search strategy.

The Sony CSL laboratory is primarily interested in the context of popular music browsing in large-scale catalogues. First, we are interested in human-centred issues related to browsing "Popular Music." Popular here means that the music accessed to is widely distributed, and known to many listeners. Second, we consider "popular browsing" of music, i.e., making music accessible to non-specialists (music lovers), and allowing sharing of musical tastes and information within communities, departing from the usual, single user view of digital libraries. This research project covers all areas of the music-to-listener chain, from music description-descriptor extraction from the music signal, or data mining techniques-similarity based access and novel music retrieval methods such as automatic sequence generation, and user interface issues. This paper describes the scientific and technical issues at stake, and the results obtained.

Once grown, they can be used as a special case of a Bayesian network, for PDF approximation, and for many other uses. Given the data, a well-known algorithm can fit an optimal tree in time that is quadratic in the number of attributes and linear in the number of records. We show how to modify it to exploit partial knowledge about edge weights. Experimental results show running time that is near-constant in the number of records, without significant loss in accuracy of the generated trees.

Sometimes this requires the data owner to make data available to the data analyst. Unless the analyst is trusted by the data owner, the latter may wish to have his intellectual property rights protected. Watermarking is a way to provide some protection, not only for multimedia data, but also for numerical data. It consists of imperceptibly embedding a secret mark into the data to be protected. The mark can later be used to resolve any subsequent disputes on data ownership. This paper presents a watermarking method that embeds a watermark into each attribute of a multivariate continuous numerical dataset. This watermarking method is shown to be robust against random noise addition attacks. Data quality is assured to the extent that the watermarked data nearly preserve the attribute means and the covariance matrix from the original dataset. Our proposal is the first known watermarking system for multivariate numerical datasets with such robustness and quality properties.

Moreover, scientific and commercial applications, as well as Grid middleware, will increasingly produce an overwhelming quantity of application and usage data. Although the ongoing convergence between Grids, Web Services, and the Semantic Web constitutes a milestone towards a service-oriented Grid architecture, which has the potential to face important issues such as application programming and business modelling, many other issues need research and development efforts. The great availability of data and information at the different layers of Grids, the maturity of data exploration techniques able to extract and synthesize knowledge, such as data mining, text summarization, semantic modelling, and knowledge management, and the demand for intelligent services in different phases of application life cycle are the driving forces towards novel knowledge-based Grid services. Guided by those considerations, the paper first introduces main requirements of next-generation Grids and then describes some representative knowledge-based Grid services for both applications support and system management. Simple cases study showing how such services could be employed are discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Of the many cognitive and psychological factors relating the comprehensibility of knowledge, we focus on the use of human amenable concepts as a representation language in expressing classification rules. Existing work in neural logic networks ( or neulonets) provides impetus for our research; its strength lies in its ability to learn and represent complex human logic in decision-making using symbolic-interpretable net rules. A novel technique is developed for neulonet learning by composing net rules using genetic programming. Coupled with a sequential covering approach for generating a list of neulonets, the straightforward extraction of human-like logic rules from each neulonet provides an alternate perspective to the greater extent of knowledge that can potentially be expressed and discovered, while the entire list of neulonets together constitute an effective classifier. We show how the sequential covering approach is analogous to association-based classification, leading to the development of an association-based neulonet classifier. Empirical study shows that associative classification integrated with the genetic construction of neulonets performs better than general association-based classifiers in terms of higher accuracies and smaller rule sets. This is due to the richness in logic expression inherent in the neulonet learning paradigm.

A frequent itemset is maximal if none of its supersets is frequent. GridDMM is specifically suitable for use in Grid environments due to low communication and synchronization overhead. GridDMM consists of a local mining phase and a global mining phase. During the local mining phase, each node mines the local database to discover the local maximal frequent itemsets, then they form a set of maximal candidate itemsets for the top-down search in the subsequent global mining phase. A new prefix-tree data structure is developed to facilitate the storage and counting of the global candidate itemsets of different sizes. We built a Data Grid system on a cluster of workstations using the open-source Globus Toolkit, and evaluated the GridDMM algorithm in terms of performance, scalability, and the overhead of communication and synchronization. GridDMM demonstrates better performance than other sequential and parallel algorithms, and its performance is scalable in terms of the database size and the number of nodes.

As the size of available graphs increases, our ability to arrive at the embedded semantics grows into a much more complicated task. One form of important hidden semantics is that which is embedded in the edges of directed graphs. Citation graphs serve as a good example in this context. This paper attempts to understand temporal aspects in publication trends through citation graphs, by identifying patterns in the subject matters of scientific publications using an efficient, vertical association rule mining model. Such patterns can (a) indicate subject-matter evolutionary history, (b) highlight subject-matter future extensions, and (c) give insights on the potential effects of current research on future research. We highlight our major differences with previous work in the areas of graph mining, citation mining, and Web-structure mining, propose an efficient vertical data representation model, introduce a new subjective interestingness measure for evaluating patterns with a special focus on those patterns that signify strong associations between properties of cited papers and citing papers, and present an efficient algorithm for the purpose of discovering rules of interest followed by a detailed experimental analysis.

J	Zhao, HM; Sinha, AP; Ram, S				Zhao, Huimin; Sinha, Atish P.; Ram, Sudha			Elitist and ensemble strategies for cascade generalization	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cascade generalization; data mining; decision tree; elitist strategy; ensemble method; voting method	NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREES	Several methods have been proposed for cascading other classification algorithms with decision tree learners to alleviate the representational bias of decision trees and, potentially, to improve classification accuracy. Such cascade generalization of decision trees increases the flexibility of the decision boundaries between classes and promotes better fitting of the training data. However more flexible models may not necessarily lead to more predictive power. Because of polential overfitting problems, the true classification accuracy on test data may not increase. Recently, a generic method for cascade generalization has been proposed. The method uses a parameter-the maximum cascading depth-to constrain the degree that other classification algorithms are cascaded with decision tree learners. A method for efficiently learning a collection (i.e., a forest) of generalized decision trees, each with other classification algorithms cascaded to a particular depth, also has been developed In this article, we propose several new strategies, including elitist and ensemble (weighted or unweighted), for using the various decision trees in such a collection in the prediction phase. Our empirical evaluation using 32 data sets in the UCI machine learning repository shows that, on average, the elitist strategy outperforms the weighted full ensemble strategy, which, in turn, outperforms the unweighted full ensemble strategy. However no strategy is universally superior across all applications. Since the same training process can be used to evaluate the various strategies, we recommend that several promising strategies be evaluated and compared before selecting the one to use for a given application.

J	Ivanek, J				Ivanek, J			Combining implicational quantifiers for equivalence ones by fuzzy connectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Workshop on Uncertainty Processing	SEP 24-27, 2003	Hejnice, CZECH REPUBLIC					Relations between two Boolean attributes derived from data can be quantified by truth functions defined on fourfold tables corresponding to pairs of the attributes. Several classes of such quantifiers (implicational, double implicational, and equivalence ones) with truth values in the unit interval were investigated in the frame of the theory of data mining methods. The definition of double implicational quantifiers is based on the idea of conjunction of both directions implications (similarly for equivalence). In the fuzzy logic theory, there are well-defined classes of fuzzy operators, namely t-norms representing various types of evaluations of fuzzy conjunction (and t-conorms representing fuzzy disjunction). I assert that each t-norm applied to an implicational quantifier gives a double implicational quantifier. Analogously, each t-conorm applied to a double implicational quantifier gives an equivalence quantifier. Logical properties of obtained quantifiers are discussed. The method is illustrated by examples of well-known quantifiers and operators. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In response to this scenario and to help guarantee a stable communication quality for business based users, it is expected that mobile carriers will introduce the SLA (Service Level Agreement) for business user mobile communication services in a similar manner to that which has been done for land-lined communications services. This paper explains a mobile service level management system that supports mobile carriers in providing SLA compliance management services for business users. When introducing the SLA, the radio wave quality inside an enterprise building may be accurately predicted by using a 3-D radio wave propagation simulator. After the introduction of the SLA, quality information is acquired from both the enterprise terminal and the mobile network. By analyzing this information statistically, radio cell anomalies and other adverse symptoms are detected, thus enabling the radio wave quality to be improved and the SLA guaranteed quality level to be maintained.									0	1	1	NEC CORPORATION	TOKYO	EXTERNAL RELATIONS DIVISION, 7-1 SHIBA 5-CHOME, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 108-01, JAPAN	1880-5884		NEC TECH J	NEC Tech J.

This work incorporates Naive Bayes classifier with Case-Based Reasoning in order to classify and analyze Arabic texts related to fanaticism. The Arabic vocabularies are converted to equivalent English words using conceptual hierarchy structure. The understanding process operates at two phases. At the first phase, a discrimination network of multiple questions is used to retrieve explanatory knowledge structures each of which gives an interpretation of a text according to a particular aspect of fanaticism. Explanation structures organize past documents of fanatic content. Similar documents are retrieved to generate additional valuable information about the new document. In the second phase, the document classification process based on Naive Bayes is used to classify documents into their fanatic class. The results show that the classification accuracy is improved by incorporating the explanation patterns with the Naive Bayes classifier.

In recent, years privacy issues also became important for data mining. In this paper, we construct a privacy preserving version of the popular clustering algorithm DBSCAN. This algorithm is density-based. Such notion of clustering allows us to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only two input parameters, but it offers some support in determining appropriate values. Originally, DBSCAN uses R-Trees to support efficient associative queries. Thus, one solution for privacy preserving DBSCAN requires to have privacy preserving R-Trees. We achieve this here.

An important first step, before analysis can begin, is ensuring that the data is accurate. A common data quality problem is that the data may inadvertently contain several distinct references to the same underlying entity: the process of reconciling these references is called entity-resolution. D-Dupe is an interactive tool that combines data mining algorithms for entity resolution with a task-specific network visualization. Users cope with complexity of cleaning lame networks by focusing on a small subnetwork containing a potential duplicate pair. The subnetwork highlights relationships in the social network, making the common relationships easy to visually identify. D-Dupe users resolve ambiguities either by merging nodes or by marking them distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative: as pairs of nodes are resolved, additional duplicates may be revealed; therefore. resolution decisions are often chained together. We give examples of how users can flexibly apply sequences of actions to produce a high quality entity resolution result. We illustrate and evaluate the benefits of D-Dupe on three bibliographic collections. Two of the datasets had already been cleaned, and therefore should not have contained duplicates-, despite this fact, many duplicates were rapidly identified using D-Dupe's unique combination of entity resolution algorithms within a task-specific visual interface.

DB2 Intelligent Miner for Data was successfully used in data mining of a huge Web log which was collected during the World FIFA Cup 1998. The clustering, associations and sequential pattern mining functions were considered in the context of Web usage mining. The clustering method was found the most profitable and the discovered usage patterns can be used in Web personalization and recommendation systems.

By adopting the Minimum Description Length criterion for ranking and selecting relevant features, experiments are carried out to investigate the accuracy and effectiveness of the above methods in classifying many targets as well as to study the effects of feature selection on the sensitivity of each classifier. The paper also shows how the knowledge of a domain expert makes it possible to decompose the multi-target classification in a set of binary classifications, one for each target, with a substantial improvement in accuracy. The effectiveness of the MDL criterion to decide on particular feature subsets is asserted by empirical results showing that MDL is comparable with entropy based feature selection methodologies reported by earlier works.

The repository is part of a multidisciplinary approach for schema evolution called the predictive approach for database evolution. The schema repository has a dual role in the approach: (1) during the data-mining process, the repository identifies and analyzes trends on collected schemas belonging to the same domain. (2) the repository is used in the building of the requirements ontology-a domain ontology that contributes in the database design and its evolution. This paper presents both the design and a heuristic-based method to populate such a repository.

Each value of a spectrum is composed of two measurements, m/Z (mass to charge ratio) and intensity. Even if data produced by mass spectrometers contains potentially huge amount of information, data are often affected by errors and noise due to sample preparation and instrument approximation. Preprocessing consists of (possibly) eliminating noise from spectra and identifying significant values (peaks). Preprocessing techniques need to be applied before performing analysis: cleaned spectra may then be analyzed by using data mining techniques or can be compared with known spectra in databases. This paper surveys different techniques for spectra preprocessing, working either on a single spectrum, or on an entire data set. We analyze preprocessing techniques aiming to correct intensity and m/Z values in order to: (i) reduce noise, (ii) reduce amount of data, and (iii) make spectra comparable.

The FSQL language is an extension of the SQL language, which permits us to write flexible conditions in our queries to a fuzzy or traditional database. In this paper, we proceed to extend FSQL into a new language called dmFSQL (data mining Fuzzy Structured Query Language) which can be used to solve real problems of clustering and classification. We consider that this model satisfies the requirements of Data Mining systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm FSPAN (Fast Sequential Pattern mining algorithm) to do the sequence mining. FSPAN can mine all the frequent sequential patterns in large datasets and it integrates a depth-first traversal approach with an effective pruning mechanism. This pruning mechanism solves the problem of searching frequent sequences in a sequence database by searching frequent items or frequent itemsets, which makes this method very efficient. Moreover, the databases scanned via FSPAN keep shrinking quickly, which makes the algorithm more efficient when the sequential patterns are longer. Experiments on standard test data show that FSPAN is very effective.

The regression tree is built by iteratively splitting data set and selecting factors into a hierarchical tree model. The sample size reduces sharply after few levels of data splitting and causes unreliable factor seletion. In contrast, the forward regression analysis selects the influential variables all the way with the same set of data. Regression analysis is, however, not capable of splitting data into groups with different models. In this research, we propose a Sample-Efficient Regression Tree (SERT) that combines the forward regression and regression tree methodologies and show that SERT is effective in discovering yield-loss causes during the yield ramp-up stage where the sample size available for analysis is extremely small.

Transactions in real-world applications, however, usually consist of quantitative values. Designing a sophisticated data-mining algorithm able to deal with various types of data presents a challenge to workers in this research field. In this paper, a cluster-based fuzzy-genetic.. g algorithm is proposed for extracting both fuzzy association rules and membership functions from quantitative transactions. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust membership functions by genetic algorithms and uses them to fuzzify quantitative transactions. It can also speed up the evaluation process and keep good quality of solutions by clustering chromosomes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Nevertheless, different problems may require different network architectures and parameters. Therefore, rule of thumb or "try and error" methods are usually used to determine them. However, these methods may lead worse network architectures and parameters. A dataset may contain many features; however, not all features are beneficial for classification in BPN. Therefore, a simulated annealing (SA) approach is proposed to select the beneficial subset of features and to obtain the better network architectures and parameters which result in a better classification. In order to verify the developed approach, three dataset, namely PIMA, IONOS, and CANCER from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning database, are employed for evaluation, and the 10-fold cross-validation is applied to calculate the classification result. Compared with the MONNA (Multiple ordinate neural network architecture) structure developed by Leazoray and Cardot, the classification accurate rates of the developed approach are superior to those of the MONNA. When the feature selection is taken into consideration the classification accurate rates of three dataset are increased. Therefore, the developed approach can be utilized to find out the network architecture and parameters of BPN, and discover the useful attributes effectively.

These concepts, not properly defined and studied in previous research study for incomplete information system, but are very important from data mining and rough set theory community. We consider two kinds of dependency relationships: one is related to the conditional attribute subset and the decision, and the other is related to two different conditional attribute subsets.

However, existing approaches for mining sequential patterns are designed for point-based events. In many applications, the essence of events are interval-based, such as disease suffered, stock price increase or decrease, chatting etc. This paper presents a new algorithm to discover temporal pattern from temporal sequences database consisting of interval-based events.

Currently, these techniques focus on structural aspects of the process and disregard data that are kept by many real systems, such as information about activity executors, parameter values, and time-stamps. In this paper, an enhanced process mining approach is presented, where different process variants (use cases) can be discovered by clustering log traces, based on both structural aspects and performance measures. To this aim, an information-theoretic framework is used, where the structural information as well as performance measures are represented by a proper domain, which is correlated to the "central domain" of logged process instances. Then, the clustering of log traces is performed synergically with that of the correlated domains. Eventually, each cluster is equipped with a specific model, so providing the analyst with a compact and handy description of the execution paths characterizing each process variant.

However, not all users appreciate the strengths of such interface features because of the variations of user backgrounds and skills. In this context, human factors are important issues in deciding user preferences. This study applies a data mining approach to examine user preferences of interface features and to identify the influence of human factors on this issue. K-modes, a data mining technique extensively applied to user modeling, was used to group users' preferences. The results indicated that users' preferences could be divided into eight groups where gender and computer experience significantly influenced the choices made by users.

There are two main aspects that we can benefit from utilizing a Web search engine. First, we can obtain the freshest content for each term that represents the up-to-date knowledge on the term. This is particularly useful for dynamic ontology management in that ontologies must evolve with time as new concepts or terms appear. Second, in comparison with the approaches that use the certain amount of crawled Web documents as corpus, our method is less sensitive to the problem of data sparseness because we access as much content as possible using a search engine. At the core of our proposed methodology, we present two different measures for similarity computation, a mutual information based and a feature-based metric. Moreover, we show how the proposed metrics can be utilized for modifying existing ontologies. Finally, we compare the extracted similarity relations with semantic similarity using WordNet. Experimental results show that our method can extract topical relations between terms that are not present in conventional concept-based ontologies.

Many IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) suffer from a high rate of false alarms and missed intrusions. We want to be able to improve the intrusion detection rate at a reduced false positive rate. The focus of this paper is rule-learning, using RIPPER, on highly imbalanced intrusion datasets with an objective to improve the true positive rate (intrusions) without significantly increasing the false positives. We use RIPPER as the underlying rule classifier. To counter imbalance in data, we implement a combination of oversampling (both by replication and synthetic generation) and undersampling techniques. We also propose a clustering based methodology for oversampling by generating synthetic instances. We evaluate our approaches on two intrusion datasets - destination and actual packets based - constructed from actual Notre Dame traffic, giving a flavor of real-world data with its idiosyncrasies. Using ROC analysis, we show that oversampling by synthetic generation of minority (intrusion) class outperforms oversampling by replication and RIPPER's loss ratio method. Additionally, we establish that our clustering based approach is more suitable for the detecting intrusions and is able to provide additional improvement over just synthetic generation of instances.

In this scenario, future Grids can be effectively used as an environment for distributed data mining and knowledge discovery in large data sets. To utilize Grids for high-performance knowledge discovery, software tools and mechanisms are needed. To this purpose we designed a system called Knowledge Grid and. we are implementing its services as Grid Services. This chapter describes the design and composition of distributed knowledge discovery services, according to the OGSA model, by using the Knowledge Grid environment.

The Naive Bayes Classifier is based on the assumption of independence among the values of the attributes given the class value. Consequently, its effectiveness may decrease when the attributes are interdependent. We present FBL, a wrapper that uses information about dependencies to guide the search for the optimal subset of features and we use the Naive Bayes Classifier as the black-box Machine Learning algorithm. Experimental results show that FBL allows the Naive Bayes Classifier to achieve greater accuracies, and that FBL performs better than other classical filters and wrappers.

A neural approach for modeling the inference of awareness in computer-supported collaboration	INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL 2006)	OCT 01-04, 2006	Crete, GREECE	PRO LEARN, Pro LC, ARIADNE, imc, PROLIX, GIUNTI Labs, X Learning Co				Individuals interacting in a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment produce a variety of information elements during their participation; these information elements usually have a complex structure and semantics, which make it rather difficult to find out the behavioral attitudes and profiles of the users involved. This work provides a model that can be used to discover awareness information lying underneath multi-user interaction. This information is initially captured in log files and then is represented in a specific form in events-databases. By using data mining techniques, it is possible to infer both the users' behavioral profiles and the relationships that occur in a CSCL environment. In this work we combine different data mining strategies and a neural-based approach in order to construct a multi-layer model that provides a mechanism for inferring different types of awareness information from group activity and presenting it to the interested parties.

Cooperative discovery of interesting action rules	FLEXIBLE QUERY ANSWERING SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Flexible Query Answering Systems	JUN 07-10, 2006	Milan, ITALY	Assoc Italiana Informat Calcolo Automat, Univ Degli Studi Milano Bicoca, Univ Milano, Dipartment Tecnol Informaz			DISTRIBUTED KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS	Action rules introduced in [12] and extended further to e-action rules [21] have been investigated in [22], [13], [20]. They assume that attributes in a database are divided into two groups: stable and flexible. In general, an action rule can be constructed from two rules extracted earlier from the same database. Furthermore, we assume that these two rules describe two different decision classes and our goal is to re-classify objects from one of these classes into the other one. Flexible attributes are essential in achieving that goal since they provide a tool for making hints to a user what changes within some values of flexible attributes are needed for a given set of objects to re-classify them into a new decision class. There are two aspects of interestingness of rules that have been studied in data mining literature, objective and subjective measures [8], [1], [1,4], [15], [23]. In this paper we focus on a cost of an action rule which was introduced in [22] as an objective measure. An action rule was called interesting if its cost is below and support higher than some user-defined threshold values. We assume that our attributes are hierarchical and we focus on solving the failing problem of interesting action rules discovery. Our process is cooperative and it has some similarities with cooperative answering of queries presented in [3] [5] [6].

Data mining approaches to criminal career analysis	ICDM 2006: Sixth International Conference on Data Mining, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Narrative reports and criminal records are stored digitally across individual police departments, enabling the collection of this data to compile a nation-wide database of criminals and the crimes they committed. The compilation of this data through the last years presents new possibilities of analyzing criminal activity through time. Augmenting the traditional, more socially oriented, approach of behavioral study of these criminals and traditional statistics, data mining methods like clustering and prediction enable police forces to get a clearer picture of criminal careers. This allows officers to recognize crucial spots in changing criminal behaviour and deploy resources to prevent these careers from unfolding. Four important factors play a role in the analysis of criminal careers: crime nature, frequency, duration and severity. We describe a tool that extracts these from the database and creates digital profiles for all offenders. It compares all individuals on these profiles by a new distance measure and clusters them accordingly. This method yields a visual clustering of these criminal careers and enables the identification of classes of criminals. The proposed method allows for several user-defined parameters.

While complex data mining tools accompanied by large feature sets extracted from the images can bring accuracy in paintings authentication, it is very difficult or not possible to understand their underlying logic. A small feature set linked to a minor classification error seems to be the key to understanding and interpreting the obtained results. In this study the selection of a small feature set for painting classification is done by the means of building an optimal pruned decision tree. The classification accuracy and the possibility of extracting knowledge for this method are analyzed. The results show that a simple small interpretable feature set can be selected by building an optimal pruned decision tree.

Euclidean distance measure is typically used init. However, the measure is an extremely brittle distance measure. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is proposed to deal with this case, but its expensive computation limits its application in massive datasets. In this paper, we present a new distance measure algorithm, called local segmented dynamic time warping (LSDTW), which is based on viewing the local DTW measure at the segment level. The DTW measure between the two segments is the product of the square of the distance between their mean times the number of points of the longer segment. Experiments about cluster analysis on the basis of this algorithm were implemented on a synthetic and a real world dataset comparing with Euclidean and classical DTW measure. The experiment results show that the new algorithm gives better computational performance in comparison to classical DTW with no loss of accuracy.

We propose a novel approach for visualizing transactional data using multiple clustering results for knowledge discovery. This scheme necessitates us to relate different clustering results in a comprehensive manner. Thus we have invented a method for attributing colors to clusters of different clustering results based on minimal transversals. The effectiveness of our method VISUMCLUST has been confirmed with experiments using artificial and real-world data sets.

While ILP initially focussed on automated program synthesis from examples, it has recently expanded its scope to cover a whole range of data analysis tasks (classification, regression, clustering, association analysis). ILP algorithms can this be used to find patterns in relational data, i.e., for relational data mining (RDM). This paper briefly introduces the basic concepts of ILP and RDM and discusses some recent research trends in these areas.

Optimal multivariate discretization is in general computationally intractable. We have proposed approximation algorithms with performance guarantees for training error minimization by axis-parallel hyperplanes. This work studies their efficiency and practicability. We give efficient implementations to both greedy set covering and linear programming approximation of optimal multivariate discretization. We also contrast the algorithms empirically to an efficient heuristic discretization method.

Such rules are usually hand-coded by a security administrator and statically detect one or few attack types: minor modifications of an attack may result in detection failures. For that reason, signature based classification is not the best technique to detect novel or slightly modified attacks. In this paper we approach this problem by extracting a set of features from network traffic and computing rules which are able to classify such traffic. Such techniques are usually employed in off line analysis, as they are very slow and resource-consuming. We want to assess the feasibility of a detection technique which combines the use of a common signature-based intrusion detection system and the deployment of a data mining technique. We will introduce the problem, describe the developed architecture and show some experimental results to demonstrate the usability Of Such a system.

In this context, the user interacts with the DBMS using advanced, constraint-based languages for data mining where constraints have been specifically introduced to increase the relevance of the results and, at the same time, to reduce its volume. In this paper we study the problem of mining frequent itemsets using an inductive database. We propose a technique for query answering which consists in rewriting the query in terms of union and intersection of the result sets of other queries, previously executed and materialized. Unfortunately, the exploitation of past queries is not always applicable. We then present sufficient conditions for the optimization to apply and show that these conditions are strictly connected with the presence of functional dependencies between the attributes involved in the queries. We show some experiments on an initial prototype of an optimizer which demonstrates that this approach to query answering is viable and in many practical cases it drastically reduces the query execution time.

This includes the general areas of information retrieval, data mining, and natural language processing. Existing approaches have primarily focused on noun to noun synonym comparison. We propose a new technique for the comparison of general expressions that combines web searching with Latent Semantic Analysis. This technique is more general than previous approaches, as it is able to match similarities between multi-word expressions, abbreviations, and alpha-numeric phrases. Consequently, it can be applied to more complex comparison problems such as ontology alignment.

First, discovered association rule relevancy isenhanced by exploiting the expert knowledge encoded within a Bayesian network, i.e., avoiding to provide trivial rules w.r.t. known dependencies. Moreover, the Bayesian network can be updated thanks to an expert-driven annotation process on computed association rules. Our approach is experimentally validated on the Asia benchmark dataset.

In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novel macroblock partition mode decision algorithm for inter-frame prediction to be used as part of a high-efficient MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoder. The proposed tools are used to compute an optimal MB coding mode decision with significantly reduced computational complexity. Specifically, we achieve the computational savings by using the following MB information coming from MPEG-2: the MB coding modes in MPEG-2 and the mean and variance of the 16 4x4 sub blocks of the MPEG-2 residual MBs. We use data mining algorithms to develop a decision tree for obtaining the H.264 coding decision modes. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to maintain a good picture quality while considerably reducing the number of operations to be performed.

We describe Backward-Chaining Rule Induction (BCRI) as a semi-supervised mechanism for biasing the search for IF-THEN rules that express plausible feature interactions. BCRI adds to a relatively limited tool-chest of hypothesis generation software and is an alternative to purely unsupervised association-rule learning. We illustrate BCRI by using it to search for gene-to-gene causal mechanisms that underlie lung cancer. Mapping hypothesized gene interactions against prior knowledge offers support and explanations for hypothesized interactions, and suggests gaps in current knowledge that induction might help fill. Our assumption is that "good" hypotheses incrementally extend/revise existing knowledge. BCRI is implemented as a wrapper around a base supervised-rule-leaming algorithm. We summarize our prior work with an adaptation of C4.5 as the base algorithm (C45-BCRI), extending this in the current study to use Brute as the base algorithm (Brute-BCRI). In contrast to C4.5's greedy strategy, Brute extensively searches the rule space. Moreover, Brute returns many more rules (i.e., hypothesized feature interactions) than does C4.5. To remain an effective hypothesis-generation tool requires that Brute-BCRI more carefully rank and prune hypothesized interactions than does C45-BCRI. Prior knowledge serves to evaluate final Brute-BCRI rules just as it does with C45-BCRI, but prior knowledge also serves to evaluate and prune intermediate search states, thus maintaining a manageable number of rules for evaluation by a domain expert.

Improving current microbial pathway models by statistical modeling of phenotype array experiments	2006 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics	MAY 28-30, 2006	College St, TX	IEEE			YERSINIA-PESTIS	Hundreds of bacterial genomes have been sequenced, but only a fraction of the genes have known biochemical function. Advances in cellular phenotyping promise to narrow the gap and improve current annotations. Phenotype MicroArrays (PMs) simultaneously measure the response of an organism against thousands of conditions, and thus provide a high-throughput means to characterize microbial phenotypes and metabolism. The PM technology is completely automated, but current analysis methods involve time consuming visual inspection of the data, and thus present a bottleneck. We propose rigorous statistical methods to automatically assess the results of PM experiments, and to incorporate the functional information gained from PMs with existing knowledge from complementary genomic and proteomic platforms. The impact will be an improved data mining of high-throughput phenotype experiments, as well as an unprecedented ability to characterize microbes and improve current microbial pathway models.

The method evolves a population of trees for a fixed number of rounds and, after each round, it chooses the predictors to include into the ensemble by applying a clustering algorithm to the population of classifiers. The method proposed runs on a distributed hybrid multi-island environment that combines the island and cellular models of parallel genetic programming. The large amount of memory required to store the ensemble makes the method heavy to deploy. The paper shows that by applying suitable pruning strategies it is possible to select a subset of the classifiers without increasing misclassification errors; indeed, up to 20% of pruning, ensemble accuracy increases. Experiments on several data sets show that combining clustering and pruning enhances classification accuracy of the ensemble approach.

Its advantages over traditional time series representation approaches include: representing time series directly in time domain (shape preservation), retrieving time series data according to the importance of the data points and facilitating multi-resolution time series retrieval. Based on these benefits, one may find this representation particularly attractive in financial time series domain and the corresponding data mining tasks, i.e. categorization and clustering. In this paper, an investigation on the size of the SB-Tree is reported. Two SB-Tree optimization approaches are proposed to reduce the size of the SB-Tree while the overall shape of the time series can be preserved. As demonstrated by various experiments, the proposed approach is suitable for different categorization and clustering applications.

In addition to classic p-norm distance, numerous other distance measures exist and the most popular is Dynamic Time Warping. Here we propose a new distance measure, called Adaptable Time Warping (ATW), which generalizes all previous time warping distances. We present a learning process using a genetic algorithm that adapts ATW in a locally optimal way, according to the current classification issue we have to resolve. It's possible to prove that ATW with optimal parameters is at least equivalent or at best superior to the other time warping distances for all classification problems. We show this assertion by performing comparative tests on two real datasets. The originality of this work is that we propose a whole learning process directly based on the distance measure rather than on the time series themselves.

However, the management of firewall rules hits been proven to he complex, error-prone, costly and inefficient for many large-networked organizations. These firewall rules are mostly custom-designed and hand-written thus fit constant need for tuning and validation, due to the dynamic nature of the traffic characteristics, ever-changing network environment and its market demands. One of the main problems that we address in this paper is that how much the firewall rules are useful, up-to-dated, well-organized or efficient to reflect the current characteristics of network traffics. lit this paper, we present a set or techniques and algorithms to analysis aid manage firewall policy rules: (1) Data Mining technique to deduce efficient firewall policy rules by mining its network traffic log based on its frequency, (2) Filtering-Rule Generalization (FRG) to reduce the number or policy rules by generalization, and (3) a technique to identify any decaying rule and at set of few dominant rules, to generate it new set of efficient firewall policy rules. The anomaly detection based oil the mining exposes many hidden but not detectable by analyzing only the firewall policy rules, resulting in two new types of the anomalies As at result of these mechanisms, network security administrators can automatically review and update the rules. We have developed it prototype system and demonstrated usefulness of our approaches.

This work is based on the Brazilian census geo-referenced data for the revenue and education level of 540 districts in a mid-size city. The data was analyzed by k-means clustering algorithms for determination of groups of similar behavior based only on the revenue and education level data. The groups were then plotted into the city map using geo-referenced information. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of groups of equivalent socio-economic levels, taking into account the uncertainty of the classification process. The results show that the model is able to represent the distribution of the social groups in an inter-related and continuous space.

So far, most of studies on Data Mining algorithms where focused on efficiency and usability. One of a factor of achieved improvements is using a data warehouse as a source of analyzed data. In our work, we focus on the association rule mining within the parallel spatial data warehouse with data privacy preserving. According to the data model of the data warehouse, we use VPSI algorithm which operates on vertically partitioned data. The data protection mechanism uses a secure intersection of sets. The algorithm is based on the parallel version of Apriori algorithm, but instead of mining data on a transaction level, it operates on aggregated data. In our paper we analyze both aspects, efficiency and data privacy level of the algorithm.

Personalization in context: Does context matter when building personalized customer models?	ICDM 2006: Sixth International Conference on Data Mining, Proceedings	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			AWARE APPLICATIONS; INFORMATION	The idea that context is important when predicting customer behavior has been maintained by scholars in marketing and data mining. However, no systematic study measuring how much the contextual information really matters in building customer models in personalization applications have been done before. In this paper, we address this problem. To this aim, we collected data containing rich contextual information by developing a special-purpose browser to help users to navigate a well-known e-commerce retail portal and purchase products on its site. The experimental results show that context does matter for the case of modeling behavior of individual customers. The granularity of contextual information also matters, and the effect of contextual information gets diluted during the process of aggregating customers' data.

As there is no rationale for a particular choice of these connectives, avoiding this choice permits to reduce the part of arbitrary in the fuzzy rough approximation. Another advantage of the new approach is that it is based on the ordinal properties of fuzzy membership degrees only. The concepts of fuzzy lower and upper approximations are thus proposed, creating a base for induction of fuzzy decision rules having syntax and semantics of gradual rules. The proposed approach to rule induction is also interesting from the viewpoint of philosophy supporting data mining and knowledge discovery, because it is concordant with the method of concomitant variations by John Stuart Mill. The decision rules are induced from lower and upper approximations defined for positive and negative relationships between credibility degrees of multiple premises, on one hand, and conclusion, on the other hand.

This occurs for instance if the points of P can only occur in one land cover type. We extend the definition of clusters to region-restricted clusters, and give efficient algorithms for exact computation and approximation. The algorithm determines all axis-parallel squares with exactly m out of n points inside, size at most some prespepcified value, and area of a given land cover type at most another prespecified value. The exact algorithm runs in O(nmlog(2) n+(nm + nn(f)) log(2)n(f)) time, where n(f) is the number of edges that bound the regions with the given land cover type. The approximation algorithm allows the square to be a factor 1 + epsilon too large, and runs in O(nlogn + n/epsilon(2) + n(f)log(2)n(f) + (nlog(2)nf)/(m epsilon(2))) time. We also show how to compute largest clusters and outliers.

Traditional methods of repair are being upgraded to include data mining and intelligent agents to help stimulate intelligent decision support systems in creating a more efficient and reliable maintenance environment for Defense. A concept demonstration, called the Automated Test Equipment Multi-Agent System (ATEMAS), is being developed under a collaborative program between Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO), the University of South Australia and Raytheon Australia. It is envisaged that when developed, this system will be able to provide cognitive intelligence to support better reliability predictions and thus making possible the much needed proactive obsolescence management for avionics parts.

This paper presents an incremental clustering system to organize and manage Newsgroup articles. It serves administrators and readers of a Newsgroup to archive important postings and to get a structured overview on current developments and topics. To be practically applicable, such a system must fulfill two conditions. First, it must be able to process rapidly changing text streams, modifying the cluster structure dynamically by adding, deleting and restructuring clusters. Second, it must consider the user in the incremental process. Severe changes in the organization structure are unacceptable for most users, even if they are optimal from the point of view of an abstract clustering criterion. We propose an approach to model the cost to accommodate to changes in the cluster structure explicitly. Users then may constraint, which changes are acceptable to them.

The chapter shows that two of the principal constructs that have been used to understand environmental damage - the negative externality, and the tragedy of the commons - apply equally well to privacy injuries. Thus, a common conceptual structure can be used to understand both environmental damage and privacy injuries. Can environmental law and policy serve as a model for the nascent field of privacy protection? The chapter examines the evolution of environmental regulation from first generation, "command-and-control" methods to more flexible, second generation strategies. It argues that first generation approaches, while appropriate for addressing some social ills, are not a good fit for the regulation of fast-changing information businesses. Second generation strategies, which demand meaningful results while also providing flexibility and reducing regulatory costs, will work better in the privacy context. The chapter concludes that environmental covenants and environmental management systems can be adapted to protect personal information. An emission fee approach can be used to combat spam effectively.

Recent research results show that if the Pearson variation of the distance distribution converges to zero with increasing dimensionality, the distance function will become unstable (or meaningless) in high dimensional space even with the commonly used L, metric on the Euclidean space. This result has spawned many subsequent studies. We first comment that although the prior work provided the sufficient condition for the unstability of a distance function, the corresponding proof has some defects. Also, the necessary condition for unstability (i.e., the negation of the sufficient condition for the stability) of a distance function, which is required for function design, remains unknown. Consequently, we first provide in this paper a general proof for the sufficient condition of unstability. More importantly, we go further to prove that the rapid degradation of Pearson variation for a distance distribution is in fact a necessary condition of the resulting unstability. With the result, we will then have the necessary and the sufficient conditions for unstability, which in turn imply the sufficient and necessary conditions for stability. This theoretical result derived leads to a powerful means to design a meaningful distance function. Explicitly, in light of our results, we design in this paper a meaningful distance function, called Shrinkage-Divergence Proximity (abbreviated as SDP), based on a given distance function. It is empirically shown that the SDP significantly outperforms prior measures for its being stable in high dimensional data space and robust to noise, and is thus deemed more suitable for distance-based clustering applications than the priorly used metric.

Adaptive resonance theory network (ART) is an important algorithm in Clustering. ART is also very popular in the unsupervised neural network. Type I adaptive resonance theory network (ART1) deals with the binary numerical data, whereas type II adaptive resonance theory network (ART2) deals with the general numerical data. Several information systems collect the mixing type attitudes, which included numeric attributes and categorical attributes. However, ART1 and ART2 do not deal with mixed data. If the categorical data attributes are transferred to the binary data format, the binary data do not reflect the similar degree. It influences the clustering quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified adaptive resonance theory network (M-ART) and the conceptual hierarchy tree to solve similar degrees of mixed data. This paper utilizes artificial simulation materials and collects a piece of actual data about the family income to do experiments.

This paper compares three graph partitioning based methods. They differ in how to summarize the clustering ensemble in a graph. They are evaluated in a series of experiments, where component clusterings are generated by tuning parameters controlling their quality and resolution. Finally the combination accuracy is analyzed as a function of the learning dynamics vs. the number of clusterings involved.

The differences between groups can be measured from either statistical or data mining perspective. In this paper, we propose an empirical likelihood (EL) based strategy of building confidence intervals for the mean and distribution differences between two contrasting groups. In our approach we take into account the structure (semi-parametric) of groups, and experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using both simulated and real-world data. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective in building confidence intervals for group differences such as mean and distribution function.

In automotive industry, the auto problem descriptions are often used as the first step of a diagnostic process that map the problem descriptions to diagnostic categories such as engine, transmission, electrical, brake, etc. This mapping of problem description to diagnostic categories is currently being done manually by mechanics that perform this task largely based on their memory and experience, which usually lead to lengthy repair processes, less accurate diagnostics and unnecessary part replacement. This paper presents our research in applying text mining technology to the automatic mapping of problem descriptions to the correct diagnostic categories. We present our results through the study on a number of important issues relating to text document classification including term weighting schemes, LSA and similarity functions. A text document categorization system is presented and it has been tested on a large test data collected from auto dealers. Its system performance is very satisfactory.

When access to such services is required anytime at anyplace, the integration of mobile devices and wireless networks into Grids is useful. However, mobile technologies exhibit limited capabilities and movement further causes frequent changes of context, like location and, thus, network connectivity. In this paper, the integration of mobile devices as ubiquitous knowledge discovery clients is proposed. The major service classes in knowledge discovery workflow management are addressed, that are, the monitoring and controlling of executing services. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by means of a .NET-based prototypical implementation on PDAs for the knowledge discovery framework GridMiner.

We developed a representation for marking up temporal information in a narrative, consisting of five elements: 1) reference point, 2) direction, 3) number, 4) time unit, and 5) pattern. We identified 254 temporal expressions from 50 discharge summaries and represented them using our scheme. The overall inter-rater reliability among raters applying the representation model was 75 percent agreement. The model can contribute to temporal reasoning in computer systems for decision support, data mining, and process and outcomes analyses by providing structured temporal information.

Since all data in the downstream is broadcasted, it is susceptible to be eavesdropped by a malicious user, which can use it to try Theft of Service (ToS) through masquerading techniques. These threats remain present when encryption is applied to EPON frame payloads. In order to avoid user profile inference through data mining techniques, a method for encryption of the preamble of the data units is proposed in this paper and a short description of its operations is presented. This new encryption mechanism assures that any two EPON frames are always transmitted with different and uncorrelated preambles.

In order to represent structural features among words appearing in tree structured documents, firstly, we introduce a consecutive path pattern (CPP, for short) on a list of words. A CPP is a sequence of consecutive paths from leaves to leaves. Then, we give a matching function over CPPs with respect to the recent frequency of a CPP, the recency of a CPP and the viewing time of tree structured document in which a CPP appears. Secondly, we present an online algorithm based on a sliding window strategy for extracting continuously all maximal CPPs as characteristic structural features from an infinite sequence of tree structured documents. Finally, by reporting experimental results on our algorithm, we show the good performance of our algorithm.

Although some data mining models such as frequent patterns and clusters have been proven to be very successful for analyzing very large data sets, they have some limitations. Frequent patterns are inadequate to describe the quantitative correlations among nominal members. Traditional cluster models ignore distances of some pairs of members, so a pair of members in one big cluster may be far away. As a combination and complementary of both techniques, we propose the Maximal-Correlated-Member-Cluster (MCMC) model in this paper. The MCMC model is based on a statistical measure reflecting the relationship of nominal variables, and every pair of members in one cluster satisfy unified constraints. Moreover, in order to improve algorithm's efficiency, we introduce pruning techniques to reduce the search space. In the first phase, a Tri-correlation inequation is used to eliminate unrelated member pairs, and in the second phase, an Inverse-Order-Enumeration-Tree (IOET) method is designed to share common computations. Experiments over both synthetic datasets and real life datasets are performed to examine our algorithm's performance. The results show that our algorithm has much higher efficiency than the naive algorithm, and this model can discover meaningful correlated patterns in high dimensional database.

Regarding the significance of attribute defined from the viewpoint of information theory as heuristic information and introducing it into Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), an effective heuristic ACO method is proposed to,search the minimal relative reduction. Firstly, we research the model of attribute reduction and analyze the differences between TSP and attribute reduction. Secondly, we redefine the heuristic information and the pheromone updating rule. Lastly, the formation process of solution is researched. Experiments show that the proposed method can reduce attributes effectively.

The most time-consuming step is the backprojection that is often limited by the memory bandwidth. Recently, a novel general purpose architecture optimized for distributed computing became available: the Cell Broadband Engine (CBE). Its eight synergistic processing elements (SPEs) currently allow for a theoretical performance of 192 GFlops (3 GHz, 8 units, 4 floats per vector, 2 instructions, multiply and add, per clock). Our aim is to maximize the image reconstruction speed for flat-panel-based cone-beam CT such as micro-CT or C-arm-CT. Therefore we implemented a highly optimized perspective cone-beam backprojection algorithm on the Cell processor. Data mining techniques and double buffering of source data were extensively used to optimally utilize both the memory bandwidth and the available local store of each SPE. The voxel-driven backprojection code uses 32 bit floating point arithmetic and bilinear interpolation between neighboring detector channels. The latter is performed in two stages by first upsampling the detector (this includes bilinear interpolation) to double the number of detector pixels followed by a nearest neighbor interpolation during backprojection. Performance was measured by backprojecting simulated data with 512 cone-beam projections per full rotation and 1024 by 1024 detector elements. The data were backprojected into a volume of 512(3) voxels fully contained in the field of measurement using an optimized PC-based (CPU-based) approach and the new Cell-based (CBE-based) algorithm. Both the PC and the CBE were clocked at 3 GHz. PC-based backprojection takes 3.2 min whereas the CBE version finishes within 13.6 s. Using both CBEs of our dual Cell-based blade (Mercury Computer Systems) one can do the cone-beam backprojection in 6.8 s.

Univariate Discretization is the most commonly used method. It discretizes only one single attribute of a dataset at a time, without considering the interaction information with other attributes. Since it is multi-attribute rather than one single attribute determines the targeted class attribute, the result of Univariate Discretization is not optimal. In this paper, a new Multivariate Discretization algorithm is proposed. It uses ICA (Independent Component Analysis) to transform the original attributes into an independent attribute space, and then apply Univariate Discretization to each attribute in the new space. Data mining tasks can be conducted in the new discretized dataset with independent attributes. The numerical experiment results show that our method improves the discretization performance, especially for the nongaussian datasets, and it is competent compared to PCA-based multivariate method.

Analyzing a class of pseudo-random bit generator through inductive machine learning paradigm	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						machine learning; classificatory prediction problem; next-bit prediction; stream cipher; linear feedback shift register; pseudo random bit generator	PREDICTION	Random number generation is an integral part of strong cipher systems. If a pseudo-random sequence can be predicted with better than chance probability then the generator is considered to be cryptographically weak. This paper deals with next bit prediction of pseudo-random binary sequences generated by Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and LFSR-based Pseudo-Random Bit Generators (PRBG), using inductive Machine Learning (ML) paradigm, namely C4.5 the most common and widely used inductive data mining algorithm. This machine learning technique has been introduced to convert the theoretical prediction problem into a classification problem, which we coined as Classificatory Prediction problem. We further extended the use of this technique to predict next bit without having any knowledge of subsequent bits of the PRBG and can be termed as true Next Bit Predictor. The technique used is independent of the parameters and domain knowledge of the pseudo-random bit generators. The present study is a comprehensive extension of the work done by Hernandez et al. [15]. We performed meticulous experiments (over wide range of LFSRs) and came out with a more explanatory analysis. Our classificatory prediction results paved the way for the evolution of the next bit prediction model.

The trajectories are treated as motion time series and modelled using orthogonal basis polynomial approximations. Trajectory clustering is then carried out to discover patterns of similar object motion behaviour. The coefficients of the basis functions are used as input feature vectors to a Self-Organising Map which can learn similarities between object trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Clustering in the basis coefficient space leads to efficiency gains over existing approaches that encode trajectories as point-based flow vectors. Experiments on pedestrian motion data gathered from video surveillance demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, Applications to motion data mining in video surveillance databases are envisaged.

Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of DOBIS/LIBIS data structure, data extraction, including data mining, and data conversion of bibliographic, non-bibliographic and bilingual data was carried out to provide maximum information to libraries about the complexities of source data and how to overcome them. Findings - The majority of the problems came from the lack of full MARC support in DOBIS/LIBIS and because of some local practices. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the KFUPM library experience in data conversion from DOBIS/LBIS to Horizon. Practical implications - This study will have implications for libraries still operating under legacy systems. They are expected to be informed by the KFUPM library experience and hopefully will work on migrating to a new system sooner than later. On the other hand, libraries in the Middle East will receive encouragement from the authors' experience and will feel some relief that, despite the complexities of bilingual data, they have a good example to follow. Originality/value - This is the first study of data conversion in the Middle East and has enormous value for libraries still struggling with legacy systems. Following the KFUPM library example, they can now plan for their own system and data migration.

However, the existing movement pattern extraction methods including STPMine1 and STPMine2 create lots of candidate movement patterns when the minimum support is low. As a result of that, the performance of time and space is sharply increased as a weak point. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest the STMPE (Spatio-Temporal Movement Pattern Extraction) algorithm in order to efficiently extract movement patterns of moving objects from the large capacity of spatio-temporal data. The STMPE algorithm generalizes spatio-temporal data and minimizes the use of memory. Because it produces and maintains short-term movement patterns, the frequency of database scan can be minimized. Actually, the STMPE algorithm was improved twice to 10 times better than STPMine1 and STPMine2 from the result of performance evaluation.

The decision tree method, a well-known data raining technique, is used to extract decision rules because using it, we can understand the grounds of classification or prediction. The decision tree method thus can be used to analyze spatial data. There is an enormous amount of spatial data in GIS (Geographic Information System), which has been studied in modeling with these data. Spatial modeling as applied to a decision tree method can be carried out more effectively. In this paper, we extracted spatial rules using the decision tree method, and then applied them to urban growth modeling based on Cellular Automata (CA). An evaluation comparing the model using the decision tree method (the proposed model) with the standard UGM showed that the proposed model is more accurate.

However, since the intention of cluster analysis is a global partition of a data set into clusters, it is not suitable to identify single clusters in a large data set where the majority of the data can not be assigned to meaningful clusters. This paper presents a new objective function-based approach to identify a single good cluster in a data set making use of techniques known from prototype-based, noise and fuzzy clustering. The proposed method can either be applied in order to identify single clusters or to carry out a standard cluster analysis by finding clusters step by step and determining the number of clusters automatically in this way.

Distance-based clustering algorithms rarely have the means to autonomously come up with the correct number of clusters from the data. A recent approach to identifying the natural clusters is to compare the point densities in different parts of the sample space. In this paper we put forward an agglomerative clustering algorithm which accesses density information by constructing a Voronoi diagram for the input sample. The volumes of the point cells directly reflect the point density in the respective parts of the instance space. Scanning through the input points and their Voronoi cells once, we combine the densest parts of the instance space into clusters. Our empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm is able to come up with a high-accuracy clustering for many different types of data. The Voronoi approach clearly outperforms k-means algorithm on data conforming to its underlying assumptions.

Furthermore, we present M-steps and E-steps for EM clustering and a method for finding a good initial model.

Exploring the capabilities of mobile agents in distributed data mining	10th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium, Proceedings	International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium - Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS 2006)	DEC 11-14, 2006	Delhi, INDIA	Concordia Univ, IEEE Comp Soc				Over the past decade, data mining has gained an important role in analysis of large datasets and there by understanding the complex systems in almost all areas. Such datasets are often collected in a geographically distributed way, and cannot, in practice, be gathered in to single repository. Existing data mining methods for distributed data are of communication intensive. Many algorithms for data mining have been proposed for a data at a single location and some at multiple locations with improvement in terms of efficiency of algorithms as a part of quality but effectiveness of these algorithms in real time distributed environment are not addressed as data on the web/network are distributed by very of its nature. As a consequence, both new architectures and new algorithms are needed. In this paper we introduce the software agent technology that supports building of distributed data mining architecture and explore the capabilities of mobile agents' paradigm and will show by experiment that, it is suited for distributed data Mining compared to traditional approaches like client server computing.

A non trivial application of cluster analysis occurs in the identification of different subpopulations of particles in large-sized heterogeneous flow-cytometric data. Mixture-model based clustering has been several times applied in the past to medical and biological data analysis; to our knowledge, however, non of these applications was involved with flow-cytometric data. We claim, that utilizing the probabilities mixture model offers several advantages compared to other proposed flow-cytometric data clustering approaches. We apply this model in order to gate lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which is a necessary first-step procedure when dealing with various hematological diseases diagnoses, such as lymphocytic leukemias and lymphoma.

Pixelization is the mapping of each data point in some set to a pixel in an image. Dimensional stacking is a layout method where N dimensions are projected into 2. We have combined both methods to support visual data mining of a vast neuroscience database. Images produced from this approach have now appeared in the Journal of Neurophysiology [1] and are being used for educational purposes in neuroscience classes at Emory University. In this paper we present our combination of dimensional stacking and pixelization, our extensions to these methods, and how our techniques have been used in neuroscience investigations.

Self-adjusting associative rules generator for classification: An evolutionary computation approach	Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Mountain Workshop on Adaptive and Learning Systems			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Mountain Workshop on Adaptive and Learning Systems	JUL 24-26, 2006	Logan, UT	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Ind Applicat TC, Helsinki Univ Technol, Autonomous Solut Inc, Hewlett Packard, Micron	Utah State Univ		ALGORITHMS	The problem of generating efficient association rules can seen as search problem since many different sets of rules are possible from a given set of instances. As the application of evolutionary computation in searching is well studied, it is possible to utilize evolutionary computation in mining for efficient association rules. In this paper, a program known as Self-adjusting Associative Rules Generator (SARG) is described. SARG is a data mining program which can generate associative rules for classification. It is an improvement of the data mining program called Genetic Programming for Inductive learning (GPIL). Both utilize evolutionary computation in inductive learning. The shortcoming of GPIL lies in the operations crossover and selection. These two operations were inflexible and not able to adjust themselves in order to select suitable methods for the task at hand. SARG introduces new method of crossover known as MaxToMin crossover together with a self-adjusting reproduction. It has been tested on several benchmark data sets available in the public domain. Comparison between GPIL and SARG revealed that SARG achieved better performance and was able to classify these data sets with higher accuracy. The paper also discusses relevant aspects of SARG and suggests directions for future work.

In this system, we find out discriminating words for protein-protein interaction by way of statistics and the results from literatures. A threshold is also evaluated to check if a given literature is related to protein-protein interactions. In addition, a keypage-based search mechanism is used to find related papers for protein-protein interactions from a given document. To expand the search space and ensure better performance of the system, mechanisms for protein name identification and databases for protein names ar e also developed. The system is designed with a web-based user interface and a job-dispatching kernel. Experiments are conducted and the results have been checked by a biomedical expert. The experimental results indicate that by using the proposed mining system, it is helpful for researchers to find out protein-protein literatures from the overwhelming piece of information available on the biomedical databases on the Internet.

There are two types of approach to build a hybrid model, i.e., the whole data approach and the segmented data approach. In this research, we present a new structure of the latter type of hybrid model, which we shall call SePI. In the SePI, input data is segmented using the performance information of the models tried in the training phase. We applied the SePI to a real customer chum problem of a Korean company that provides streaming digital music services through Internet. The result shows that the SePI outperformed any model that employed only one data mining technique such as artificial neural network, decision tree and logistic regression.

In this research, we incorporated the capability of context reasoning in a music recommendation system. Our proposed system contains such modules as Intention Module, Mood Module and Recommendation Module. The Intention Module performs context reasoning that infers whether a user wants to listen to music or not by using the environmental context data. The Mood Module determines the genre of the music suitable to the user's context. Finally, the Recommendation Module recommends the music to the user. Context reasoning is implemented using case-based reasoning.

The proposed method also improves data pre-processing step by identifying important features for intrusion detection. Furthermore, we develop a learning algorithm to find classifiers for imbalanced training data to avoid some assumptions made in most learning algorithms that are not necessarily sound. Preliminary experimental results indicate that our approach is very effective in anomaly detection.

In this paper, we investigate program logic errors, which rarely incur memory access violations but generate incorrect outputs. We show that through mining program control flow abnormality, we could isolate many logic errors without knowing the program semantics. In order to detect the control abnormality, we propose a hypothesis testing-like approach that statistically contrasts the evaluation probability of condition statements between correct and incorrect executions. Based on this contrast, we develop two algorithms that effectively rank functions with respect to their likelihood of containing the hidden error. We evaluated these two algorithms on a set of standard test programs, and the result clearly indicates their effectiveness.

In the age of E-Commerce, it is important for firms to develop web-based marketing strategy such as product bundling to increase revenue. Recommendation. system(RS) is a platform that can be used to reduce the searching cost of consumers, increase the effectiveness of firm's promotion strategies and enhance consumer's loyalty. This paper propose a web-based collaborative filtering mechanism for firm's product bundling strategy. First, Clustering using Adaptive Resonance Theory is applied to generate different kinds of customer group, in which members have same attributes or habits. Second, Data Mining using association rule techniques is applied to find the relations between two products in given support and confidence values. And last, the RS value is calculated to generate personal product bundling list and top-N recommendations. Experiment results also show that it is a feasible and effective design scheme.

This paper develops a kind of network security management framework using collection, analysis and integration, event-correlation and scenario-analysis technique to process the raw data gathered from hybrid network. Data-mining and wavelet technology are introduced into this framework, which can rapidly identify the types of security events from integrated information by using frequent episodes, wavelet and case-based reasoning. By these means, it can help to analyze the status of network security and then adjust the strategy to secure the network. We have implemented a prototype system following this framework, which can rapidly react to typical security events with visual output of result.

Traditional method is not a real-time response, and incurs high communication and storage costs. Existing distributed stream mining algorithms do not consider the resource limitation on the lightweight devices such as sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed traffic stream mining system. The central server performs various data mining tasks only in the training and updating stage and sends the interesting patterns to the sensors. The sensors monitor and predict the coming traffic or raise alarms independently by comparing with the patterns observed in the historical streams. The sensors provide real-time response with less wireless communication and small resource requirement, and the computation burden on the central server is reduced. We evaluate our system on the real highway traffic streams in the GCM Transportation Corridor in Chicagoland.

Compared with traditional Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm, this algorithm has better efficiency and wider application range. Aimed at reducing the defect of traditional Apriori algorithm, this algorithm avoids lots of redundant operations with inverted list. This algorithm only needs scan data set twice and don't need joining and pruning operations. Frequent item set is saved in each transaction frequent set TF, and insert next frequent single item one by one,then generate new possible frequent item set. In this way, lots of redundant operations can be reduced. The performance study shows that it is more efficient in both dense datasets and sparse datasets.

The purpose of this study was to test a knowledge discovery method to detect elderly patients with impaired mobility in a large clinical dataset. The research method applied an exploratory design and a data mining classification method (cost sensitive Decision Tree J48 from WEKA) to classify patients. Important factors were identified by the Feature Selection method. The Decision Tree algorithm classified patients in the dataset with 65% sensitivity and 72% specificity for a reduced model. The results were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. Examples of decision rules were also extracted. The study can be applied to classify different health problems in different populations and serves as a foundation for the development of healthcare decision support systems.

However, situations with more than fifty percent of outliers often occur in practice. The efficient identification of objects from a noisier background is thus a difficult problem. In this paper, a highly robust estimator is formulated to tackle such a difficulty. The proposed estimator is called the regression density decomposition (RDD) estimator. The computational analysis of the estimator and its properties are discussed and a simulated annealing algorithm is proposed for its implementation. It is demonstrated that the RDD estimator can resist a very large proportion of noisy data, even more than fifty percent. It is successfully applied to some simulated and real-life noisy data sets. It appears that the estimator can solve efficiently and effectively general regression problems, pattern recognition, computer vision and data mining problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The EART system treats texts only not images or figures. EART discovers association rules amongst keywords labeling the collection of textual documents. The main characteristic of EART is that the system integrates XML technology (to transform unstructured documents into structured documents) with Information Retrieval scheme (TF-IDF) and Data Mining technique for association rules extraction. EART depends on word feature to extract association rules. It consists of four phases: structure phase, index phase, text mining phase and visualization phase. Our work depends on the analysis of the keywords in the extracted association rules through the co-occurrence of the keywords in one sentence in the original text and the existing of the keywords in one sentence without co-occurrence. Experiments applied on a collection of scientific documents selected from MEDLINE that are related to the outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza virus.

In this paper, a novel in-place sorting algorithm is presented. The algorithm comprises two phases; rearranging the input unsorted array in place, resulting segments that are ordered relative to each other but whose elements are yet to be sorted. The first phase requires linear time, while, in the second phase, elements of each segment are sorted in-place in the order of z log (z), where z is the size of the segment, and O(1) auxiliary storage. The algorithm performs, in the worst case, for an array of size n, an O(n log z) element comparisons and O(n log z) element moves. Further, no auxiliary arithmetic operations with indices are required. Besides these theoretical achievements of this algorithm, it is of practical interest, because of its simplicity. Experimental results also show that it outperforms other in-place sorting algorithms. Finally, the analysis of time and space complexity, and required number of moves are presented, along with the auxiliary storage requirements of the proposed algorithm.

Feature selection in an electric billing database considering attribute inter-dependencies	ADVANCES IN DATA MINING: APPLICATIONS IN MEDICINE, WEB MINING, MARKETING, IMAGE AND SIGNAL MINING	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Industrial Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2006)	JUL 14-15, 2006	Leipzig, GERMANY				FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; BOUND ALGORITHM; BRANCH	With the increasing size of databases, feature selection has become a relevant and challenging problem for the area of knowledge discovery in databases. An effective feature selection strategy can significantly reduce the data mining processing time, improve the predicted accuracy, and help to understand the induced models, as they tend to be smaller and make more sense to the user. Many feature selection algorithms assumed that the attributes are independent between each other given the class, which can produce models with redundant attributes and/or exclude sets of attributes that are relevant when considered together. In this paper, an effective best first search algorithm, called buBF, for feature selection is described. buBF uses a novel heuristic function based on n-way entropy to capture inter-dependencies among variables. It is shown that buBF produces more accurate models than other state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms when compared on several real and synthetic datasets. Specifically we apply buBF to a Mexican Electric Billing database and obtain satisfactory results.

The goal is to predict the functional family of novel protein sequences based on their motif composition. In order to improve the results obtained with other known approaches, we propose a new data mining technique for protein classification based on Bayes' theorem, called Highest Subset Probability (HiSP). To evaluate our proposal, datasets extracted from Prosite, a curated protein family database, are used as experimental datasets. The computational results have shown that the proposed method outperforms other known methods for all tested datasets and looks very promising for problems with characteristics similar to the problem addressed here.

Unfortunately the number of frequent itemsets describing the data is often too large to comprehend. This problem has been attacked by condensed representations of frequent itemsets that are subcollections of frequent itemsets containing only the frequent itemsets that cannot be deduced from other frequent itemsets in the subcollection, using some deduction rules. In this paper we review the most popular condensed representations of frequent itemsets, study their relationship to transaction databases and each other, examine their combinatorial and computational complexity, and describe their relationship to other important concepts in combinatorial data analysis, such as Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and hypergraph transversals.

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in the theory of Boolean functions, and there have been developed fast symmetry checking methods based on BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams). Here we discuss the property of symmetric items in data mining problems, and describe an efficient algorithm based on ZBDDs (Zero-suppressed BDDs). The experimental results show that our ZBDD-based symmetry checking method is efficiently applicable to the practical size of benchmark databases.

The problem is similar to knowledge discovery in artificial intelligence. Here our goal is to discover rules that reflect the pattern in the data. These rules are called association rules. In [AS94] an algorithm is proposed to extract these association rules from the large/frequent itemsets computed by the apriori algorithm. In this paper we present a more efficient and output sensitive algorithm to compute these association rules given the lattice L of large itemsets. Our approach is based on pruning a lot of redundant association rules that have to be tested in the algorithm of [AS94] We use a variation of the data structure for hashing using separate chaining in our algorithm. Our algorithm, is output sensitive in the sense that its time complexity will be proportional to the number of association rules that have to be generated and it is also optimal.

The objective is to find sub-matrices, i.e., maximal subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities over a range of conditions. Since these two objectives are mutually conflicting, they become suitable candidates for multi-objective modeling. In this study, a novel multi-objective evolutionary biclustering framework is introduced by incorporating local search strategies. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate better performance as compared to existing algorithms available in literature.

For handheld devices, minimization of CPU operations is the most important factor in performance. In this paper, we propose the efficient algorithms that extract sequences similar to the given query sequence from the time-series stream such as network traffic data, stock prices, and sensor data. First, we formally define the stream sequence matching that finds similar sequences from the time-series stream. Second, we propose an efficient window-based approach by using the window construction mechanism of traditional subsequence matching methods. Third, we provide the notion of a window MBR and propose two different stream sequence matching algorithms based on the notion. Fourth, we formally prove correctness of the proposed algorithms by presenting the related theorems. Last, through extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our approach improves performance significantly compared with the naive approach. Experimental results show that our window-based approach improves performance by tens to hundreds of times over the naive approach. Overall, we believe that our methods would be very suitable for handheld devices as the embedded algorithms.

Significant work has been done to extend the basic association rule framework to allow for mining rules with negation. Negative association rules indicate the presence of negative correlation between items and can reveal valuable knowledge about examined dataset. Unfortunately, the sparsity of the input data significantly reduces practical usability of negative association rules, even if additional pruning of discovered rules is performed. In this paper we introduce the concept of dissociation rules. Dissociation rules present a significant simplification over sophisticated negative association rule framework, while keeping the set of returned patterns concise and actionable. A new formulation of the problem allows us to present an efficient algorithm for mining dissociation rules. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Crimes are a social nuisance and cost our society dearly in several ways. Any research that can help in solving crimes faster will pay for itself A bout 10% of the criminals commit about 50% of the crimes. Here we look at use of clustering algorithm for a data mining approach to help detect the crimes patterns and speed up the process of solving crime. We will look at k-means clustering with some enhancements to aid in the process of identification of crime patterns. We applied these techniques to real crime data from a sheriffs office and validated our results. We also use semi-supervised learning technique here for knowledge discovery from the crime records and to help increase the predictive accuracy. We also developed a weighting scheme for attributes here to deal with limitations of various out of the box clustering tools and techniques. This easy to implement data mining framework works with the geospatial plot of crime and helps to improve the productivity of the detectives and other law enforcement officers. It can also be applied for counter terrorism for homeland security.

Recent advances in data extraction techniques have resulted in tremendous increase in the input data size of data mining applications. Data mining systems, on the other hand, have been unable to maintain the same rate of growth. Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand the bottlenecks associated with the execution of these applications in modern architectures. In this paper, we present MineBench, a publicly available benchmark suite containing fifteen representative data mining applications belonging to various categories: classification, clustering, association rule mining and optimization. First, we highlight the uniqueness of data mining applications. Subsequently, we evaluate the MineBench applications on an 8-way shared memory (SMP) machine and analyze important performance characteristics such as L1 and L2 cache miss rates, branch misprediction rates.

Unfortunately, it suffers from the feature weighting problem. In this framework, similar case retrieval plays an important role, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) method or its variants are widely used as the retrieval mechanism. However, the most important assumption of k-nn is that all of the features presented are equally important, which is not true in many practical applications. Many variants of k-nn have been proposed to assign higher weights to the more relevant features for case retrieval. Though many feature-weighted variants of k-nn have been reported to improve its retrieval accuracy on some tasks, few have been used in conjunction with the neural network learning. We propose CANSY, a feature-weighted CBR with neural network for symbolic features.

There exist too few success stories about organizations having managed to satisfy even some of those expectations. This situation is very similar to the one inside the information systems (IS) field, especially earlier but even currently. The recent lively debate about the identity of the IS discipline included also the analysis concerning the customers of IS research. Inspired by IS researchers' insights related to the topic, we ask the question "who is our customer?" as data mining researchers. With this we want to raise to discussion the border that limits the topics 'acceptable' to work with as a data mining researcher. We suggest in this paper that the border should be transferred more clearly towards the direction so that beside the technical concerns also at least some user- and organizationrelated research questions are included.

In this paper, we present our first results concerning a medical image retrieval approach using a semantic medical image and report indexing within a fusion framework, based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) metathesaurus. We propose a structured learning framework based on Support Vector Machines to facilitate modular design and extract medical semantics from images. We developed two complementary visual indexing approaches within this framework: a global indexing to access image modality, and a local indexing to access semantic local features. Visual indexes and textual indexes - extracted from medical reports using MetaMap software application - constitute the input of the late fusion module. A weighted vectorial norm fusion algorithm allows the retrieval system to increase its meaningfulness, efficiency and robustness. First results on the CLEF medical database are presented. The important perspectives of this approach in terms of semantic query expansion and data-mining are discussed.

Their special case is predicate observational calculus. It, can be obtained by modifications of classical predicate calculus - only finite, models axe allowed and generalised quantifiers are added. Association rules can be understood as special formulas of predicate observational calculi. Such association rules correspond to general relations of two Boolean attributes. A problem of the possibility to express association rule by the means of classical predicate calculus is investigated. A reasonable criterion of classical definability of association rules is presented.

Comparison of documents classification techniques to classify medical reports	ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	APR 09-12, 2005-2006	Singapore, SINGAPORE	USAF Off Sci Res, Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev, USA ITC, PAC Asian Res Off, Informat Dev Author Singapore, Lee Fdn, SAS, SPSS Inc, Embassy United States Amer, Singapore		text classification; partially supervised classification; labeled and unlabeled data; medical data mining; and features reduction		This paper addresses a real world problem: the classification of text documents in the medical domain. There are a number of approaches to classifying text documents. Here, we use a partially supervised classification approach and argue that it is effective and computationally efficient for real-world problems. The approach uses a two-step strategy to cut down on the effort required to label each document for classification. Only a small set of positive documents are labeled initially, with others being labeled automatically as a result of the first step. The second step builds the actual text classifier. There are a number of methods that have been proposed for each step. A comprehensive evaluation of various combinations of methods is conducted to compare their performances using real world medical documents. The results show that using EM based methods to build the classifier yields better results than SVM. We also experimentally show that careful selection of a subset of features to represent the documents can improve the performance of the classifiers.

Combining two data mining methods for system identification	INTELLIGENT COMPUTING IN ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Workshop of the European-Group-for-Intelligent-Computing-in-Engineering	JUN 25-30, 2006	Ascona, SWITZERLAND	European Grp Intelligent Comp Engn			RECOGNITION	System identification is an abductive task which is affected by several kinds of modeling assumptions and measurement errors. Therefore, instead of optimizing values of parameters within one behavior model, system identification is supported by multi-model reasoning strategies. The objective of this work is to develop a data mining algorithm that combines principal component analysis and k-means to obtain better understandings of spaces of candidate models. One goal is to improve views of model-space topologies. The presence of clusters of models having the same characteristics, thereby defining model classes, is an example of useful topological information. Distance metrics add knowledge related to cluster dissimilarity. Engineers are thus better able to improve decision making for system identification and downstream tasks such as further measurement, preventative maintenance and structural replacement.

Use of instance typicality for efficient detection of outliers with neural network classifiers	ICIT 2006: 9th International Conference on Information Technology, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2006)	DEC 18-21, 2006	Bhubaneswar, INDIA	Orissa Informat Technol Soc, Inst Tech Educ & Res, NJ Inst Technol, Satyam Comp Ltd, IEEE N Jersey Sect		classification; data mining; instance-typicaliiy; outliers		Detection of outliers is one of the data pre-processing tasks. In all the applications, outliers need to be detected to enhance the accuracy of the classifiers. Several different techniques, such as statistical, distance-based and deviation-based outlier detection exist to detect outliers. Many of these techniques use filter method. A wrapper method using the concept of instance typicality may also be used to detect outliers. This paper deals with a new wrapper method that builds an initial model using neural networks and treats values at the output of neurons in the output layer as the typicality scores. Instances with lowest output values are treated as potential outliers. In addition, the method is also useful to build compact and accurate classifiers by selecting a few most typical instances resulting in significant reduction in storage space. The method is generic and thus can also be used for instance selection with any kind of classifiers. Resultant compact models are useful for imputation of missing values.

In most of other methods, selection of interesting rules is defined by subjective thresholds values of some criteria, such as support and confidence. This leads to subjectivity of the inducted knowledge. Here, we propose a way to avoid this subjectivity, to induct all the most important rules a given data support. First, on the set of rules, we define preference relationship, which incorporates comparison of the rules by both generality and validity. Then, we define digest of rules as a minimal subset of rules, which includes a preferable rule for any rule not in the digest. This way, the digest comprises the most important and diverse knowledge in data. We propose an algorithm of the search for the digest, show existence and uniqueness of the digest for a given data. The results are obtained for production rules, which generalize such types of rules as association rules and interval rules.

We assume that a specification is expressed as a set of ground Horn clauses which is divided into two sets T-pst and T-tmp that are the unchangeable and changeable parts of the specification, respectively. Since a minimal revision is obtained by removing a minimal set of clauses from Ttmp so that the remaining set is consistent, our task can be restated as enumerating maximal consistent subsets of a given set of Horn clauses. Moreover, consistency property is monotone, that is, if a set of Horn clauses is consistent then every subset of the set is also consistent. Then, we can apply our previous method of enumerating maximal frequent sets in data mining which can be used for any enumeration for maximal subsets w.r.t. a monotone property. We show that our algorithm performs a dualization only once for an enumeration of maximal subsets, and the number of consistency checks is at most vertical bar MinI(Tpst)(T-tmp)vertical bar + vertical bar MaxC(Tpst)(T-tmp)vertical bar. (.) vertical bar T-tmp vertical bar and the necessary space is O(Sigma(S is an element of MaxCTpst(Ttmp))vertical bar S vertical bar) where vertical bar MinIT(pst)(T-tmp)vertical bar is the number of minimal subsets of T-tmp that are inconsistent with T-pst, and vertical bar MaxC(Tpst)(T-tmp)vertical bar is the number of maximal subsets of T-tmp that are consistent with T-pst.			ksatoh@nii.ac.jp; uno@nii.ac.jp					BENNETT KH, 2000, ICSE, P75; DOMINGO C, 1998, THESIS U POLITECHNIC; Dowling W.

It has been applied in various fields including market analysis, customer habit study, detection, classification, clustering and so on. However, it consumes a great amount of time. In the Apriori approach, all frequent patterns are found and then generate association rules from above frequent patterns. However, this approach generates a huge time-intensive query called "iceberg query". Various researches have been done under the Apriori-like approach to improve performance of the frequent pattern mining task but the results were not as much as expected due to many scans on the dataset. This research aims to propose a flexible way of mining frequent patterns by extending the idea of the Associative Classification method. For better performance, the Neural-Network Associative Classification (NAC) method is proposed here to be one of the approaches for building accurate and efficient classifiers. In this paper, the Neural Networks Associative Classification method is used in order to improve its accuracy. The structure of the network reflects the knowledge uncovered in the previous discovery phase. The trained network is then used to classify unseen data. The accuracy rates obtained from the datasets show promising results.

The partitions come from the distributed processing requirements of a large scale simulation where the volume of the data is such that classifiers can train only on data local to a given partition. As a result of the partition reflecting the need for efficient simulation analysis, rather than the needs of data mining, the class statistics vary across partitions; indeed some classes will likely be absent from some partitions. We combine a fast ensemble learning algorithm with majority voting to generate an accurate working model of the simulation. Results from several simulations show that regions of interest are successfully identified in spite of training set class imbalances. Accuracy is analyzed both at the level of nodes in the simulation data structure, and in terms of higher-level regions of interest. It is shown that over 98% of salient regions are found in independent test sets. Hence, this approach will be a significant time saver for simulation users and developers.

Operationally, such an inductive database is a database in which models and patterns are first class citizens. In the extensive literature on inductive databases there is at least one consequence of this operational definition that is conspicuously missing. That is the question: if we have models and patterns in our inductive database, how does this help to discover other models and patterns? This question is the topic of this paper.

A genetic program (GP) is an algorithm that evolves other algorithms or mathematical expressions. Methods for accelerating convergence of the data mining procedure are examined. The methods include introducing fuzzy rules into the GP and a new innovation based on computer algebra. Experimental results related to using computer algebra are given. Comparisons between trees created using a genetic program and those constructed solely by interviewing experts are made. Connections to past GP based data mining procedures for evolving fuzzy decision trees are established. Finally, experimental methods that have been used to validate the data mining algorithm are discussed.

In this paper the reductions for a set-valued decision information system(DIS) are studied. The judgment theorem and the discernibility matrix of the generalized decision reduct in a set-valued DIS are given, and the relationships among the generalized decision reduct and alternative types of knowledge reduction in set-valued DIS are investigated. It is proved that the reduct in the consistent set-valued DIS is equivalent to the generalized decision reduct, and the possible reduct in the inconsistent set-valued DIS is equivalent to the generalized decision reduct. The judgment theorem and the discernibility matrix associated with the possible reduct are also established.

The new method is an integration of closed sequential pattern mining and closed itemset pattern mining. Based on this method, we show that (1) the number of complete closed multidimensional sequential patterns is not larger than the number of complete multidimensional sequential patterns (2) the set of complete closed multidimensional sequential patterns covers the complete resulting set of multidimensional sequential patterns. In addition, mining using closed itemset pattern mining on multidimensional information would mine only multidimensional information associated with mined closed sequential patterns, and mining using closed sequential pattern mining on sequences would mine only sequences associated with mined closed itemset patterns.

In the paper we deal with the problem of enhancing classical fault injection tools in two aspects: improvement of experiment effectiveness and result analysis capabilities. In particular we discuss the problem of distributing fault injection processes within a computer network and collecting the simulation results in a data warehouse with data mining capabilities. The presented considerations are illustrated with some experimental results performed with simulation tools developed in our Institute.

When relating manufacturing events to failure events, the main challenge is to master the huge number of combinations of both event types, of which each is only covered by a small number of occurrences. Additionally, this leads to the problem of selection of interesting findings - the appropriateness of the selection criterion for consequent decision making is a critical point. Another challenge is the necessity of mapping the process of manufacturing tests to a vector of variables characterizing the manufacturing process. The solution presented, focuses on correct rule generation and selection in the case of combinations with low coverage. Therefore statistical and decision theory approaches were used. The multiple hypothesis aspect of the rule set has also been considered. The application field was quality control of electronic units in automotive assembly, with thousands of variables observed.

In this approach, compression of ECG is done in real-time by the mobile phone for the very first time. The fast and effective compression scheme, designed for the proposed telemonitoring system, outperforms most of the real-time lossless ECG compression algorithms. This mobile phone based computation platform is a promising solution for privacy issues in telemonitoring through encryptions. Moreover, the mobile phones used in this platform performs preliminary detection of abnormal biosignal in real-time.

A tolerance space is an abstract set having a similarity which is a binary relation with two properties: reflexivity and symmetry. A representative clustering is a representative system of the space so that any element is similar to at least one representative. If a similarity is properly chosen so that similar elements belong likely to the same class, the clustering is used to develop a classification model, which is used to estimate the conditional probabilities of classes. Then a classification decision can be made based on the conditional probabilities. Before defining a tolerance space for a huge database in a classification task, the database is first reduced by feature selection and signature search. The records classifiable by the signatures will be excluded. The classification model is for the rest of the records and is developed by first forming the feature vectors of a training data set to a tolerance space with a suitable similarity and then computing a sub-minimal representative system. Conditional probabilities of classes for a record are estimated by comparing the record with the representatives in the sub-minimal representative system. Experiments on a network intrusion dataset show that a classification model can predict network attacks accurately when a proper similarity is chosen.

One equivalent form of FIM can be stated as follows: given a rectangular data matrix with binary entries, find every submatrix of Is having a minimum number of columns. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of several statistical questions related to this problem when noise is present. We begin by establishing several results concerning the extremal behavior of submatrices of ones in a binary matrix with random entries. These results provide simple significance bounds for the output of FIM algorithms. We then consider the noise sensitivity of FIM algorithms under a simple binary additive noise model, and show that, even at small noise levels, large blocks of Is leave behind fragments of only logarithmic size. Thus such blocks cannot be directly recovered by FIM algorithms, which search for submatrices of all Is. On the positive side, we show how, in the presence of noise, an error-tolerant criterion can recover a square submatrix of Is against a background of Os, even when the size of the target submatrix is very small.

A hippocampal-inspired self-organising learning memory model with analogical reasoning for decision support	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			FUZZY-SETS; SYSTEMS; ASSOCIATIONS; FAILURES	Decision-making is innately human-centered; and a decision support system seeks to provide a systematic and consistent way to information processing by integrating the domain knowledge with a rational reasoning capability to support the human decision process. Traditionally, decision support systems are based on data-mining solutions, statistical models and conventional AI techniques. These systems have several deficiencies such as lacking in ability to explain the computed decisions (black-box nature) and are not dynamically adaptive to handle the emergence of new information. This paper presents a brain-inspired learning memory model with analogical reasoning as a tool to facilitate human decision-making. The proposed model is named GenSoFNN-AR and constitutes a neurocognitive approach to the science of knowledge discovery to support the human decision process. The GenSoFNN-AR model is subsequently evaluated with a bank failure classification and analysis problem using a set of historical financial records. The results are encouraging.

So far it has been tackled by several researchers that apply various statistical and machine learning techniques, achieving high accuracy levels, often over 90%. In this paper we propose a mahine learning approach that can further improve the prediction accuracy. First, we provide a concise review of the literature in this field. Then we propose a novel feature set. We perform extensive experiments on a publicly available, real world dataset for various vertebrate organisms using a variety of novel features and classification setups. We evaluate our results and compare them with a reference study and show that our approach that involves new features and a combination of the Ribosome Scanning Model with a meta-classifier shows higher accuracy in most cases.

Virtual reality visual data mining via neural networks obtained from multi-objective evolutionary optimization: Application to geophysical prospecting	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			REPRESENTATION	A method for the construction of Virtual Reality spaces for visual data mining using multi-objective optimization with genetic algorithms on non-linear discriminant (NDA) neural networks is presented. Two neural network layers (output and last hidden) are used for the construction of simultaneous solutions for: a supervised classification of data patterns and an unsupervised similarity structure preservation between the original data matrix and its image in the new space. A set of spaces are constructed from selected solutions along the Pareto front. This strategy represents a conceptual improvement over spaces computed by single-objective optimization. In addition, genetic programming (in particular gene expression programming) is used for finding analytic representations of the complex mappings generating the spaces (a composition of NDA and orthogonal principal components). The presented approach is domain independent and is illustrated via application to the geophysical prospecting of caves.

Along with the increasing competition for. customers among many application service providers (ASPs), decision makers of ASPs hope to find useful and potent association rules that will help them track users' demands and make correct decisions. The characters of ASP platform itself bespeak that it is a possible way to mine association rules from ASP. Every ASP platform has a self-contained database where vast data are stored and invisible association rules hide. Parallel mining technique among multi-tables is applied in the paper. An experiment of mining fuzzy association rules is given, and GA, a new association rule mining method, has been used in the experiment. The method of treating quantitive attributes values has been narrated in detail. And the results of the experiment show that GA based fuzzy association rules mining method is really of efficiency.

Traditionally, the distance based approach and the information content based approach are the two major methods. In this paper, on the basis of analyzing these previous approaches, a new method based on hierarchy information content and attribute information content is provided and a similarity calculating algorithm, HIC-AIC, based on this theory is presented. In terms of theoretical analysis and experiments, the new approach obtains higher accuracy in calculating the semantic similarity between concepts.

Many different semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed to tackle this difficulty by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data. However, most Of them focus on semi-supervised classification. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised regression algorithm named Semi-Supervised Kernel Regression (SSKR). While classical kernel regression is only based on labeled examples, our approach extends it to all observed examples using a weighting factor to modulate the effect of unlabeled examples. Experimental results prove that SSKR significantly outperforms traditional kernel regression and graph-based semi-supervised regression methods.

In this paper, we present our RTRC system that has good classification accuracy when concept drifts and enough samples are scanned in data stream. By using Markov chain and least-square method, the system is able to predict not only on which the next concept is but also on when the concept is to drift. Experimental results confirm the advantages of our system over Weighted Bagging and CVFDT, two representative systems in streaming data mining.

The Web environment and clickstream data demand even more efficacy to knowledge discovery: such data is a rich, complex and huge source of information; the discoveries are easily actionable; and time constrains are typically hard. One general, crucial and very challenge issue of knowledge discovery is the selection of the right methods to apply according to the nature of the problem under analysis. This issue, particularly within the Web usage mining scope, is the focus of our work. This paper describes a case-based reasoning system especially oriented to assist users in the development and application of Web usage mining processes. This system takes as inputs the characteristics of the available data, the analysis' requirements, and, based on acquired experience from successfully processes, delivers a solution: a mining plan suited to the data analysis problem at hand.

As these approaches are good at dealing with discrete values, a discretizer is required when the approaches are applied to continuous attributes. In this paper, a novel adaptive discretizer based on a statistical distribution index is proposed to preprocess continuous valued attributes in an instance information system, so that the knowledge discovery approaches based on rough sets can reach a high decision accuracy. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed discretizer is able to improve the decision accuracy.

The human brain, a significant intelligent system, works with a huge number of spiking neurons. Based on spiking neuron models a new generation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been developed for artificial intelligence systems. SNNs are computationally more powerful than conventional artificial neural networks. In this paper, the spiking neuron model is applied to represent logic rules and fuzzy rules. Based on the STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) principle, a new SNN model is proposed for pattern recognition. An efficient learning rule derived from the STDP is applied for self-organizing the input training set efficiently. An example, Animal-Growth-Record, is used to explain the principle of the SNN model. Benchmark data sets are applied to compare the proposed approach with other approaches. As there are very efficient learning rules in the SNN model, the model can be applied not only for fusion of multi-sensory data, but also for data mining in large databases with large numbers of attributes.

Furthermore, lots of related algorithms have been proposed to improve ID3 on different aspects such as ID4, C4.5 and so on. In this paper, we propose the improved classification algorithm by minsup and minconf based on ID3 to decrease the data amount and reduce the impact of data with poor-quality. This improved algorithm introduces two new concepts,support of test attribute set to class' and 'rule confidence', which are used to improve the decision tree construction process by both prepruning and postpruning and ultimately to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of classification. Both theoretical analysis and test show that the improved algorithm avoids constructing a large decision tree with lots of branches which contains little information by reducing the size of data set during building process and pruning the useless rules from the built decision tree. It weakens the affect of poor quality data and produces a more appropriate decision tree finally.

There are two main branches for peptide prediction methods; structural and data mining approaches. These methods can be successfully used for prediction of T-Cell epitopes in cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. In this paper, association rule mining methods are implemented to generate rules of peptide selection by MHCs. To capture the binding characteristics, modified rule mining and data transformation methods are implemented in this paper. Peptides are known to bind to the same MHC show sequence variability, to capture this characteristic, we used a reduced amino acid alphabet by clustering amino acids according to their physico-chemical properties. Using the classification of amino acids and the OR-operator to combine the rules to reflect that different amino acid types and positions along the peptide may be responsible for binding are the innovations of the method presented. We can predict MHC Class-I binding with 75-97% coverage and 76-100% accuracy.

Using clustering methods to analyze time series not only can find some typical patterns of traffic flow, but also can group the sections of highway by their different flow characteristics.

Experiments show that the proposed method has a better performance on the change trend of time series than classic algorithm.

Specifically, F computes a score based on the coordinates of each point; our objective is to report the object whose score is the phi N-th smallest in the dataset. phi-quantiles provide a succinct summary about the F-distribution of the underlying data, which is useful for online decision support, data mining, selectivity estimation, query optimization, etc. Assuming that the dataset is indexed by a spatial access method, we propose several algorithms for retrieving a quantile efficiently. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that a branch-and-bound method is highly effective in practice, outperforming alternative approaches by a significant factor.

In recent years, various methods for ensemble selection and clustering result combinations have been designed to optimize clustering results. Moreover, conducting data analysis using multiple sources, given the complexity of data objects, is a much more powerful method than evaluating each source separately. Therefore, a new paradigm is required that combines the genome-wide experimental results of multi-source datasets. However, multi-source data analysis is more difficult than single source data analysis. In this paper, we propose a new clustering ensemble approach for multi-source bio-data on complex objects. In addition, we present encouraging clustering results in a real bio-dataset examined using our proposed method.

Software projects success factors identification using data mining	2006 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems (ICCES 06)	NOV 05-07, 2006	Cairo, EGYPT	Ain Shams Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Engn & Syst Dept		project success and failure; project management; data mining	PERSPECTIVE	Software project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects to achieve predetermined corporate goals. It requires knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle. The project manager's main responsibility is to ensure a successful project outcome. Project success is normally defined as achieving desired project objectives and features within desired cost and schedule. Many factors affect project success including dealing with gathering requirements, customer involvements and project management. Several researchers have investigated the success or failure of software projects using statistical approaches. In this paper, a web based survey and interviews are used to collect project data, about requirements, project sponsor and customers. Tools such as association, neural networks, clustering, naive bayes and decision tree are used to discover common characteristics and rules that govern project success and failure. The results show the power of data mining algorithms to discover the most important factors and associations in project success and failure. Results showed that each mining algorithm has a particular strength to provide knowledge and make predictions about project success opportunities.

S	Zaniolo, C		Bonchi, F; Boulicaut, JF		Zaniolo, Carlo			Mining databases and data streams with query languages and rules	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN INDUCTIVE DATABASES	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases	OCT 03, 2005	Oporto, PORTUGAL					Among data-intensive applications that are beyond the reach of traditional Data Base Management Systems (DBMS), data mining stands out because of practical importance and the complexity of the research problems that must be solved before the vision of Inductive DBMS can become a reality. In this paper, we first discuss technical developments that have occurred since the very notion of Inductive DBMS emerged as a result of the seminal papers authored by Imielinski and Mannila a decade ago. The research progress achieved since then can be subdivided into three main problem subareas as follows: (i) language (h) optimization, and (iii) representation. We discuss the problems in these three areas and the different approaches to Inductive DBMS that are made possible by recent technical advances. Then, we pursue a language-centric solution, and introduce simple SQL extensions that have proven very effective at supporting data mining. Finally, we turn our attention to the related problem of supporting data stream mining using Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) and introduce the notion of Inductive DSMS. In addition to continuous query languages, DSMS provide support for synopses, sampling, load shedding, and other built-in functions that are needed for data stream mining. Moreover, we show that Inductive DSMS can be achieved by generalizing DSMS to assure that their continuous query languages support efficiently data stream mining applications. Thus, DSMS extended with inductive capabilities will provide a uniquely supportive environment for data stream mining applications.

J	Zhang, D; Simoff, SJ				Zhang, D; Simoff, SJ			Informing the curious negotiator: Automatic news extraction from the Internet	DATA MINING: THEORY, METHODOLOGY, TECHNIQUES, AND APPLICATIONS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article								Information acquisition and validation play an important role in the decision making process during negotiation. In this chapter we briefly present the framework of a smart data mining system for providing contextual information extracted from the Internet to a negotiation agent. We then present one of its components in more details - an effective automated technique for extracting relevant articles from news web sites, so that they can be used further by the mining agents. Most current techniques experience difficulties in coping with changes in web site structure and formats. The proposed extraction process is completely automatic and independent of web site formats. Proposed technique identifies regularities in both format and content of news web sites. The algorithms are applicable to both single- and multi-document web sites. Since invalid URLs can cause errors in data extraction, we also present a method for the negotiation agent to estimate the validity of the extracted data based on the frequency of the relevant words in the news title. Once the news articles are extracted the next task is to construct sets of given articles. This chapter presents a new procedure for constructing news data sets on given topics. The extracted news data set is further utilised by the parties involved in negotiation. The information retrieved from the data set can support both human and automated negotiators.

However the numerical feedback of clustering algorithms is difficult for user to have an intuitive overview of the dataset that they deal with. Visualization has been proven to be very helpful for high-dimensional data analysis. Therefore it is desirable to introduce visualization techniques with user's domain knowledge into clustering process. Whereas most existing visualization techniques used in clustering are exploration oriented. Inevitably, they are mainly stochastic and subjective in nature. In this paper, we introduce an approach called HOV3 (Hypothesis Oriented Verification and Validation by Visualization), which projects high-dimensional data on the 2D space and reflects data distribution based on user hypotheses. In addition, HOV3 enables user to adjust hypotheses iteratively in order to obtain an optimized view. As a result, HOV3 provides user an efficient and effective visualization method to explore cluster information.

Besides the exponential growth of individual databases, the number of data depositories is increasing too. Because of the complexity of the biological concepts, bioinformatics data usually has complex data structures and cannot be easily captured with relational model. As a result, various flat-file formats have been used. Although easy for human interpretation, flat-file formats lack of standards and are hard to be recognized automatically. As a result, manually written parsers, are widely used to extract data from them. This has limited the readiness of the data for data consuming programs, such as integration systems. This paper presents a data mining based approach for automatically assigning schema labels to the attributes in a flat-file biological dataset. In conjunction with our prior work on semi-automatically identifying the delimiters and automatically generating parsers, automatic schema labeling offers a novel and practical solution for integrating biological datasets on-the-fly. Our approach for schema labeling is based on unsupervised learning, and uses a feature representation of an attribute by most frequently occurring data values in it. We combine the use of a biological ontology with heuristics. We are able to deal with noise in the datasets by using cutoff functions. Detailed experimental results from three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of data mining for biological applications.

Many methods have been proposed in the literature, but few of them have taken into account constraints that may be present in the data or constraints on the clustering. These constraints have significant influence on the results of the clustering process of large spatial data. In this paper, we discuss the problem of spatial clustering with obstacles constraints and propose a novel spatial clustering method based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and K-Medoids, called GKSCOC, which aims to cluster spatial data with obstacles constraints. It can not only give attention to higher local constringency speed and stronger global optimum search, but also get down to the obstacles constraints and practicalities of spatial clustering. The results on real datasets show that it is better than standard GAs and K-Medoids.

In the framework, we propose three steps for time-changing feature selection. The first step is a qualitative-based search, to find qualitative features (or, structural time-changing features). The second step performs a quantitative-based search, to find quantitative features (or, value time-changing features). In the third step, the results from the first two steps are combined to form hybrid search models to select a subset of global time-changing features according to a certain criterion of medical experts. The present application of the time-changing feature selection method involves time-changing episode history, an integral part of medical health records and it also provides some challenges in time-changing data mining techniques.

This was approached by clustering patients into groups receiving similar patterns of care and visualising the features devised to highlight interesting patterns of care.

Traditional distance measures fail to differentiate the furthest point from the nearest point in very high dimensional data space. To tackle the problem, we design minimal subspace distance which measures the similarity between two points in the subspace where they are nearest to each other. It can discover subspace clusters implicitly when measuring the similarities between points. We use the new similarity measure to improve traditional k-means algorithm for discovering clusters in subspaces. By clustering with low-dimensional minimal subspace distance first, the clusters in low-dimensional subspaces are detected. Then by gradually increasing the dimension of minimal subspace distance, the clusters get refined in higher dimensional subspaces. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure and algorithm.

For rough set based methods, finding reducts is an essential step, yet it is of high complexity. In this paper, based on particle swarm optimization (PS 0) which is an optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior of flocks of birds when they are searching for food, a novel method is proposed for finding useful features instead of reducts in rough set theory. Subsequent experiments on UCI show that this method performs well on whole convergence, and can retrieve useful subsets effectively while retaining attributes of high importance as possible.

The learning agent module in this model can self-adjustingly learn network based audit data and host based audit data with more than one technique of data mining, such as the artificial neural network, the association rules and so on. The learning agent can produce rules, and the detection agent can detect audit data according to these rules and response to them. A lot of experiments indicate that this system has very high self-adapting ability, intelligence, and expansibility.

However, these packages are often based on main-memory data structures, limiting the amount of data they can handle. In this paper we use a relational database as secondary storage in order to eliminate this limitation. Unlike existing approaches, which often focus on optimizing a single algorithm to work with a database backend, we propose a general approach, which provides a database interface for several algorithms at once. We have taken a popular machine learning software package, Weka, and added a relational storage manager as back-tier to the system. The extension is transparent to the algorithms implemented in Weka, since it is hidden behind Weka's standard main-memory data structure interface. Furthermore, some general mining tasks are transfered into the database system to speed up execution. We tested the extended system, refered to as WekaDB, and our results show that it achieves a much higher scalability than Weka, while providing the same output and maintaining good computation time.

In this paper, we propose a novel embedded subtree mining algorithm, called PrefixTreeESpan (i.e. Prefix-Tree-projected Embedded-Subtree pattern), which finds a subtree pattern by growing a frequent prefix-tree. Thus, using divide and conquer, mining local length-1 frequent subtree patterns in Prefix-Tree-Projected database recursively will lead to the complete set of frequent patterns. Different from Chopper and XSpanner [4], PrefixTreeESpan does not need a checking process. Our performance study shows that PrefixTreeESpan outperforms Apriori-like algorithm: TreeMiner [6], and pattern-growth algorithms: Chopper, XSpanner.

This paper addresses algorithms for ranking variables in a dataset, as well as for ranking values of a specific variable. We propose two new techniques, called Max Gain (MG) and Sum Max Gain Ratio (SMGR), which are well-correlated with existing techniques, yet are much more intuitive. MG and SMGR were developed for the public safety domain using categorical traffic accident data. Unlike the typical abstract statistical techniques for ranking variables and values, the proposed techniques can be motivated as useful intuitive metrics for non-statistician practitioners in a particular domain. Additionally, the proposed techniques are generally more efficient than the more traditional statistical approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show how they increase the productivity of the analyst who seeks relationships among the contents of multiple utterances and ultimately must link some newly discovered context into testable hypotheses about new information. While, in its simplest form, one can extend text data mining to speech data mining by using text tools on the output of a speech recognizer, we have found that it is not optimal. We show how data mining techniques that are typically applied to text should be modified to enable an analyst to do effective semantic data mining on a large collection of short speech utterances. For the purposes of this paper, we examine semantic data mining in the context of semantic parsing and analysis in a specific situation involving the solution of a business problem that is known to the analyst. We are not attempting a generic semantic analysis of a set of speech. Our tools and methods allow the analyst to mine the speech data to discover the semantics that best cover the desired solution. The coverage, in this case, yields a set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) classifiers that serve as testable hypotheses.

The annotations are at an increasingly conceptual level, up to identifying general biomedical fields to which the sequences could contribute. This bioinformatics data-mining system makes substantial use of several resources: a locally stored MEDLINE(R) database; a manually built classification system; the MeSH(R) taxonomy; relational technology; and bioinformatics methods. Knowledge is generated from various data sources by using well-defined semantics, and by exploiting direct links between them. A two-dimensional "Concept Map(TM)" displays the knowledge graph, which allows causal connections to be followed. The use of this method has been valuable and has saved considerable time in our in-house projects, and can be generally exploited for any sequence-an notation or knowledge-condensation task.

Consequently, such observations may be expressed in structured patterns to support the process of network planning. The underlying system monitors the network protocol tables that describe each network connection or host session in order to discover interesting patterns. To achieve this purpose a data abstraction procedure is applied to learn rules that may express the behavior of network characteristics. Thus, the system is capable to discover various operational patterns, provide sensible advices, and support the network planning activity. A database system has been designed and implemented for monitoring the network traffic. Also the results from the experiments have been used to classify real traffic data. The system presented in this paper called network characteristics discovery system. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

[J. ACM 51 (2004) 263-280], along with several algorithms that select each segment's prototype vector from the segment. The algorithms were shown to have an approximation ratio of at least 2(root2 - 1) approximate to 0.828. We show that a lemma used in this proof is tight, and that the asymptotic approximation ratio of no algorithm of this type can exceed 5/6 approximate to 0.833. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Katsaros, D; Nanopoulos, A; Manolopoulos, Y				Katsaros, D; Nanopoulos, A; Manolopoulos, Y			Fast mining of frequent tree structures by hashing and indexing	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						tree mining; hashing; sernistructured data; association rules	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION; GRAPHS	Hierarchical semistructured data arise frequently in the Web, or in biological information processing applications. Semistructured objects describing the same type of information have similar but not identical structure. Usually they share some common 'schema'. Finding the common schema of a collection of semistructured objects is a very important task and due to the huge amount of such data encountered. data mining techniques have been employed. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering frequently occurring structures in semistructured objects using the notion of association rules. We identify that discovering the frequent structures in the early phases of the mining procedure is the dominant cost and we provide a fast algorithm addressing this issue. We present experimental results, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and also its efficiency in reducing dramatically the processing cost. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

On Variable Constraints in Privacy Preserving Data Mining	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 21-23, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc				In recent years, privacy preserving data mining has become an important problem because of the large amount of personal data which is tracked by many business applications. In many cases, users are unwilling to provide personal information unless the privacy of sensitive information is guaranteed. A recent framework performs privacy preserving data mining by using a condensation based approach. In this framework, the privacy of all records is treated homogeneously. It is therefore inefficient to design a system with a uniform privacy requirement over all records. We discuss a new framework for privacy preserving data mining, in which the privacy of all records is not the same, but can vary considerably. This is often the case in many real applications, in which different groups of individuals may have different privacy requirements. We discuss a condensation based approach for privacy preserving data mining in which an efficient method is discussed for constructing the condensation in a heterogeneous way. The heterogeneous condensation is capable of handling both static and dynamic data sets. We present empirical results illustrating the effectiveness of the method.

PADS (Protein structure Alignment by Directional shape Signatures) incorporates the three dimensional coordinates of the main atoms of each amino acid and extracts a geometrical shape signature along with the direction of each amino acid. As a result, each protein structure is presented by a series of multidimensional feature vectors representing local geometry, shape, direction, and biological properties of its amino acid molecules. Furthermore, a distance matrix is calculated and is incorporated into a local alignment dynamic programming algorithm to find the similar portions of two given protein structures followed by a sequence alignment step for more efficient filtration. The optimal superimposition of the detected similar regions is used to assess the quality of the results. The proposed algorithm is fast and accurate and hence could be used for analysis and knowledge discovery in large protein structures. The method has been compared with the results from CE, DALI, and CTSS using a representative sample of PDB structures. Several new structures not detected by other methods are detected.

This paper combines these two hot research areas to introduce the term multiagent association rule mining on a cooperative learning system, which investigates employing data mining on a cooperative multiagent system. Learning in a partially observable and dynamic multiagent systems environment still constitutes a difficult and major research problem that is worth further investigation. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a strong method for learning in multi-agent systems, So far, many researchers have proposed various methods to improve the learning ability in multiagent systems. However, reinforcement learning still has some drawbacks. One drawback is not modeling other learning agents present in the domain as part of the state of the environment. Another drawback is that even in learning case, some state-action pairs are experienced much less than others. In order to handle these problems, we describe a new action selection model based on association rules mining. Experimental results obtained on a well-known pursuit domain show the applicability, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed learning approach.

First the dataset is mapped into a binary image plane. The synthesized image is then processed utilizing efficient image processing techniques to cluster the data in the dataset. Henceforth, the algorithm avoids exhaustive search to identify clusters. The algorithm considers only a small set of the data that contains critical boundary information sufficient to identify contained clusters. Compared to available data clustering techniques, the proposed algorithm produces similar quality results and outperforms them in execution time and storage requirements.

To achieve a better performance, many efficient algorithms have been proposed. Despite these efforts, we are often unable to complete a mining task because these algorithms require a large amount of main memory to enumerate all frequent itemsets, especially when dataset is large or the user-specified support is low. Thus, it becomes apparent that we need to have an efficient main memory handling technique, which allows association rule mining algorithms to handle larger datasets in main memory. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose an algorithm for vertical association rule mining that compresses a vertical dataset in an efficient manner, using bit vectors. Our performance evaluations show that the compression ratio attained by our proposed technique is better than those of the other well known techniques.

However, publishers cannot anticipate all possible ways in which users would search for the items in their documents. In fact, many times, there may be no direct keyword match between a keyword search phrase and descriptions of relevant items that are perfect matches for the search. We present an automated, high precision-based information retrieval solution to boost item find-ability by bridging the semantic gap between item information and popular keyword search phrases. Our solution achieves an average of 80% F-measure for various boosted matches for keyword search phrases in various categories.

Then, in knowledge-rich domains often the interestingness of the mined patterns can be increased significantly. In this paper we categorize several classes of background knowledge for subgroup discovery, and present how the necessary knowledge elements can be modelled. Furthermore, we show how subgroup discovery methods benefit from the utilization of background knowledge, and discuss its application in an incremental process-model. The context of our work is to identify interesting diagnostic patterns to supplement a medical documentation and consultation system. We provide a case study in the medical domain, using a case base from a real-world application.

We define some characteristics which any neural network must have if we would want to employ it for the task of FIM.

Compared to other fuzzy models, simple fuzzy logic rules (IF ... THEN ... rules) based on triangular or trapezoidal shape fuzzy sets are much simpler and easier to understand. For fuzzy rule based learning algorithms, choosing the right combination of attributes and fuzzy sets which have the most information is the key point to obtain good accuracy. On the other hand, the fuzzy ID3 algorithm gives an efficient model to select the right combinations. We therefore discover the set of simple fuzzy logic rules from a fuzzy decision tree based on the same simple shaped fuzzy partition, after dropping those rules whose credibility is less than a reasonable threshold, only if the accuracy of the training set using these rules is reasonably close to the accuracy using fuzzy decision tree. The set of simple fuzzy logic rules satisfied with this condition is also able to be used to interpret the information of the tree. Furthermore, we use the fuzzy set operator "OR" to merge simple fuzzy logic rules to reduce the number of rules.

A relatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient to guarantee privacy when datamining techniques are used. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of modifying the database in such a way to prevent the discovery of sensible information. Due to the large amount of possible techniques that can be used to achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide some standard evaluation metrics to determine the best algorithms for a specific application or context. Currently, however, there is no common set of parameters that can be used for this purpose. This paper explores the problem of PPDM algorithm evaluation, starting from the key goal of preserving of data quality. To achieve such goal, we propose a formal definition of data quality specifically tailored for use in the context of PPDM algorithms, a set of evaluation parameters and an evaluation algorithm. The resulting evaluation core process is then presented as a part of a more general three step evaluation framework, taking also into account other aspects of the algorithm evaluation such as efficiency, scalability and level of privacy.

Evolutionary Approach for Automated Discovery of Censored Production Rules	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 10	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	DEC 16-18, 2005	Cracow, POLAND			Censored Production Rule; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Evolutionary Algorithms	ALGORITHM; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	In the recent past, there has been an increasing interest in applying evolutionary methods to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and a number of successful applications of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) to KDD have been demonstrated. The most predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the standard Production Rules (PRs) in the form If P Then D. The PRs, however, are unable to handle exceptions and do not exhibit variable precision. The Censored Production Rules (CPRs), an extension of PRs, were proposed by Michalski & Winston that exhibit variable precision and supports an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions. A CPR is an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to the rule. Such rules are employed in situations, in which the conditional statement 'If P Then D' holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. By using a rule of this type we are free to ignore the exception conditions, when the resources needed to establish its presence are tight or there is simply no information available as to whether it holds or not. Thus, the 'If P Then D' part of the CPR expresses important information, while the Unless C part acts only as a switch and changes the polarity of D to similar to D. This paper presents a classification algorithm based on evolutionary approach that discovers comprehensible rules with exceptions in the form of CPRs. The proposed approach has flexible chromosome encoding, where each chromosome corresponds to a CPR. Appropriate genetic operators are suggested and a fitness function is proposed that incorporates the basic constraints on CPRs. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

User subjectivity in monitoring and modeling of the changes adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper addresses the problem of i) capturing user subjectivity and ii) change modeling, in applications that monitor frequency behavior of item-sets. We propose a three stage strategy for focusing on item-sets, which are of current interest to the user and introduce metrics that model changes in their frequency (support) behavior.

For example, given a large collection of retinal images from several different experimental conditions (normal, detached, reattached, etc.), how can data mining help biologists focus on important regions in the images or on the differences between different experimental conditions? If the images were text documents, we could square nd the main terms and concepts for each condition by existing IR methods (e.g., tf/idf and LSI). We propose something analogous, but for the much more challenging case of an image collection: We propose to automatically develop a visual vocabulary by breaking images into n x n tiles and deriving key tiles ("ViVos ")for each image and condition. We experiment with numerous domain-independent ways of extracting features from tiles (color histograms, textures, etc.), and several ways of choosing characteristic tiles (PCA, ICA). We perform experiments on two disparate biomedical datasets. The quantitative measure of success is classill cation accuracy: Our " ViVos " achieve high classil) cation accuracy (up to 83% for a nine-class problem on feline retinal images). More importantly, qualitatively, our "ViVos" do an excellent job as "visual vocabulary terms ": they have biological meaning, as corroborated by domain experts; they help spot characteristic regions of images, exactly like text vocabulary terms do for documents; and they highlight the differences between pairs of images.

Using a variety of data mining techniques, interaction-specific features are learned; to distinguish this class of galaxies from a control sample of normal galaxies. Eventually, the corresponding rule-based feature model of that class of galaxies will be applied to the large multi-wavelength astronomical survey databases that are becoming available. This distributed data mining activity is a prototype science use case for the VO (Virtual Observatory). We specifically apply multi-archive multi-wavelength data to the problem. In a preliminary validation experiment, we recovered exactly the type of object that we hope to find automatically with our data mining tools: a distant hyper-luminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG); the most luminous class of known galaxies.

The Wisdom Grid project (a joint research effort of the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology) aims, as the first research effort, to cover all aspects of the knowledge life cycle on the Grid -from discovery in Grid data repositories, to processing, sharing and finally reusing of knowledge as input for a new discovery. This paper first outlines the architecture of the Wisdom Grid infrastructure and then focuses on the kernel architecture component called GridMiner, which realizes the knowledge discovery, based on data mining and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) in Grid repositories. A running GridMiner prototype is already available to the scientific community as an Open Service System.

Many new types of association rules based on both categorial or quantitative data have been founded ([8], [7], [2], [4]). Our work is directed to the theoretical features of association rules; especially, we study a specific class of association rules called delta-cosymmetric rules. We present here some interesting properties of such rules and provide a definition of rules expressing the significant difference in position, as an example. We show here that even the usual implicational rules are special cases of delta-cosymmetric rules.

New approaches to the design and implementation of autonomic systems have emerged, including the use of goal policies[2], utility functions [2], intelligent monitoring, data mining, reinforcement learning, and planning. Unfortunately, these new approaches do nothing to reduce administrators' skepticism towards automation-how is an administrator to believe that an autonomic system will help his systems perform better? In this report, we describe an approach by which an autonomic system can win the trust of its users, and can continuously adjust ilself to make better decisions based on the users' preferences.

For many practical applications, the users may be only interested in those sequential patterns satisfying some constraints expressing their interest. The proposed constraints in general can be categorized into four classes, among which monotony and tough constraints are the most difficult ones to be processed. However, many of the available algorithms are proposed for some special constraints based sequential pattern mining. It is thus difficult to be adapted to other classes of constraints. In this paper we propose a new general framework called CBPSA1gm based on the projection-based pattern growth principal. Under this framework, ineffective item pruning strategies are designed and integrated to construct effective algorithms for monotony and tough constraint based sequential pattern mining. Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform other algorithms.

Because the investors desire to make profit from the balance of the wave of bond fund prices, so how to find the factors of the bond fund prices at any times that is an important problem. In this paper, we developed a Chinese keywords finding technique (CKFT) to find the influential keywords from the electronic news of bond fund. A bond fund price can be shown by the net equity or the net profit on the days' electronic news columns by some network stations in Chinese. The CKFT is used to find the important keywords from the news of electronic report by the network station in Chinese. The CKFT can find the important keywords automatically from the electronic news when there have not given the keywords before. After the keywords are got, then the keywords relate to the price stability or up or down are classifications. The conclusions are that the important keywords which influence in the wave of bond fund prices would he found, and that the classifications is used to find keywords groups when the price is stable or up or down. The model can be extended to the groups of bond fund analysis that is our discussion. To prove the practical using, the data of BW-bond fund, (Eurobond) of days' news of Cnyes network station reporting is as our case example.

This paper proposes a novel and simple approach, which does not belong to the candidate generation-and-test approach (for example, the Apriori algorithm) and the pattern-growth approach (such as the FP-growth algorithm)two approaches. This approach treats the database as a stream of data and finds the frequent patterns by scanning the database only once. Two versions of the approach (i.e., mapping-table and transformation-function) are provided. Analyses and simulations of the approach are also performed Analyses show that the transformation-function version is much better than the Apriori and FP-growth ones in storage complexity. Simulation results show that the mapping-table version is comparable to the FP-growth algorithm in execution time.

Given the popularity of Web news services, we focus our attention on news streams mining. News articles are retrieved from Web news services, and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue within news repository management is the high rate of document insertion. To address this problem, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the ability to identify meaningful patterns (e.g., news events, and news topics) while reducing the amount of computations by maintaining cluster structure incrementally. In addition, to overcome the lack of topical relations in conceptual ontologies, we propose a topic ontology learning framework that utilizes the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm produces high-quality clusters, and a topic ontology provides interpretations of news topics at different levels of abstraction.

We compare execution times and speed-up of two parallel implementations: pure Apriori and hybrid FP-growth - Apriori version on grid with one to six processors. As expected, the latter shows superior performances. We also discuss the effects of database characteristics on overall performance, and give directions for proper choice of execution parameters and suitable number of executors.

Management representations based on the concept of ontology are being used to incorporate semantic expressiveness and reasoning capabilities. This paper proposes the adoption of a semantically-rich CIM (Common Information Model)-based policy management system for the OGSA Security Architecture, in which the security policy development is based on the use of OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OWL-S (OWL-based Web Service Ontology).

To obtain what we called temporal rules, a discretisation phase that extracts events from raw data is applied first, followed by an induction phase, which constructs classification trees from these events. The theoretical framework we proposed, based on first-order temporal logic, permits us to define the main notions (event, temporal rule, constraint) in a formal way. The concept of consistent linear time structure allows us to introduce the notions of general interpretation and of confidence. These notions open the possibility to use statistical approaches in the design of algorithms for inferring higher order temporal rules, denoted temporal meta-rules.

The main motivation lies in two observations : the number of mined patterns is often too large to be useful for any end-users and user-defined input parameters of many data mining algorithms are most of the time almost arbitrary defined (e.g. the frequency threshold). In this setting, we apply the results given in the seminal paper [11] for frequent sets to the problem of approximating a set of approximate inclusion dependencies with k inclusion dependencies. Using the fact that inclusion dependencies are "representable as sets", we point out how approximation schemes defined in [11] for frequent patterns also apply in our context. An heuristic solution is also proposed for this particular problem. Even if the quality of this approximation with respect to the best solution cannot be precisely defined, an interaction property between IND and FD may be used to justify this heuristic. Some interesting perspectives of this work are pointed out from results obtained so far.

The, exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern, data sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also, poses a number of common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or "data farming"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases, interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition, visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science, scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.

Although many efficient frequent-pattern mining techniques have been developed in the last decade, most of them assume relatively small databases, leaving extremely large but realistic datasets out of reach. A practical and appealing direction is to mine for closed itemsets. These are subsets of all frequent patterns but good representatives since they eliminate what is known as redundant patterns. In this paper we introduce an algorithm to discover closed frequent patterns efficiently in extremely large datasets. Our implementation shows that our approach outperforms Similar state-of-the-art algorithms when mining extremely large datasets by at least one order of magnitude in terms of both execution time and memory usage.

It is desirable to incorporate this concept into car and personal navigation systems, which are nowadays based on distance and turn instructions. In this paper, an approach to identify landmarks automatically using existing GIS databases is introduced. By means of data mining methods, building information of the digital cadastral map of Germany is analyzed in order to identify landmarks. In a second step, a digital surface model obtained by laser scanning is used to assess the visibility of landmarks for a given route.

The key idea consists in constructing a decision tree, within the DBMS, using bitmap indices. Indeed bitmap, indices have many useful properties such as the count and bit-wise operations. We will show that these operations are efficient to build decision trees. In addition, by using bitmap indices, we don't need to access raw data. This implies clear improvements in terms of processing time.

Gene expression profiles are composed of thousands of genes at the same time, representing complex relationships between them. One of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes in comparison with the small number of available experiments or cases. In this context, the ability to identify an accurate gene selection strategy is crucial to reduce the generalization error (false positives) of state-of-the-art classification algorithms. This paper presents a reduction algorithm based on the notion of fuzzy gene expression, where similar (co-expressed) genes belonging to different patients are selected in order to construct a supervised prototype-based retrieval model. This technique is employed to implement the retrieval step in our new gene-CBR system. The proposed method is illustrated with the analysis of microarray data belonging to bone marrow cases from 43 adult patients with cancer plus a group of three cases corresponding to healthy persons.

To exploit these ressources we need new algorithms adapted to this kind of environment, in particular with respect to the way to fragment data and to use this fragmentation. An "intelligent" distribution of data is required and can be obtained from clustering. Most existing parallel methods of clustering are developped for super-computers with shared memory and hence can not be used on a Grid. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm, called Progressive Clustering, which executes a clustering in an efficient and incremental distributed way. The data clusters resulting from this algorithm can subsequently be used in distributed data mining tasks.

The stochastic complexity of a class of models is the length of a universal, one-part code representing this class. It combines the length of the maximum likelihood code with the parametric complexity, a normalization that acts as a penalty against overfitting. For models with few parameters relative to sample size, k << n, the parametric complexity is approximately (k)/(2) log n. The accuracy of this approximation, however, deteriorates as k grows relative to n, as occurs in denoising, data mining, and machine learning. For these tasks, the contribution of parameters depends upon the complexity of the model class. Adding a parameter to a model class that already has many produces a different effect than adding one to a model class that has few. In denoising, for example, we show that the parametric complexity leads to an adaptive model selection criterion. We also address the calculation of the parametric complexity when the underlying integration is unbounded over the natural parameter space, as in Gaussian models.

To the best of our knowledge, three typical forms for negative association rules and three corresponding mining methods have been proposed. However, the existing forms are not general enough, and can not represent some special cases in the real world. In this paper, an extended form for negative association rules is proposed, and a corresponding mining algorithm is presented. The proposed mining algorithm is performed on two datasets. Experimental results show that the algorithm is efficient on simple and sparse datasets when minimum support is high to some degree, and it overcomes some limitations of the previous mining methods.

Given a large set of tuples with demographic information and personal interest information, association rules can be derived, that associate ages and gender with interests. However, it is a problem to come up with rules with high support whenever the mined data set is sparse. On the other hand, if rules with high support can be generated, they tend to involve interests that are too abstract to be of practical use. To overcome the first problem, we have developed a method of raising data instances to higher levels in the ontology. In this paper we give a formal definition of the raising operation. We also show that in some cases data mining with raised data leads to rules that better represent the reality. In order to avoid the second problem, namely rules that are too abstract, we formulate a notion of an optimal target level for the raising operation. We then derive two estimates for this optimal raising level. Knowing to which level to raise reduces the computational effort of raising to several levels and reduces the user effort of selecting those mined rules that best fit her/his needs from a large candidate set.

To achieve high quality for such services, spatio-temporal data mining techniques are needed. In this paper, we describe experiences with spatio-temporal rule mining in a Danish data mining company. First, a number of real world spatio-temporal data sets are described, leading to a taxonomy of spatio-temporal data. Second, the paper describes a general methodology that transforms the spatio-temporal rule mining task to the traditional market basket analysis task and applies it to the described data sets, enabling traditional association rule mining methods to discover spatio-temporal rules for LBS. Finally, unique issues in spatio-temporal rule mining are identified and discussed.

The focus in this case is not only the processing requirements anymore: memory, network and storage capacity must all be considered in making a scheduling decision. Job executions are irregular and data dependent, alternating between CPU-bound and I/O-bound phases. In this paper, we propose and implement a parallel job scheduling strategy for such jobs, called AnthillSched, based on a simple heuristic: we map the behavior of a parallel application with minimal resources as we vary its input parameters. From that mapping we infer the best scheduling for a certain set of input parameters given the available resources. To test and verify AnthillSched we used logs obtained from a real system executing data mining jobs. Our main contributions are the implementation of a parallel job scheduling strategy in a real system and the performance analysis of AnthillSched, which allowed us to discard some other scheduling alternatives considered previously.

Most data mining algorithms work on labeled data. In order to set up basic data set for mining, huge volumes of network data need to be collected and labeled manually. In fact, it is rather difficult and impractical to label intrusions, which has been a big restrict for current IDSs and has led to limited ability of identifying all kinds of intrusion types. An improved unsupervised clustering-based intrusion model working on unlabeled training data is introduced. In this model, center of a cluster is defined and used as substitution of this cluster. Then all cluster centers are adopted to detect intrusions. Testing on data sets of KDDCUP'99, experimental results demonstrate that our method has good performance in detection rate. Furthermore, the incremental-learning method is adopted to detect those unknown-type intrusions and it decreases false positive rate.

It is ideal to prevent all failures, However, when a failure occurs, it is important to quickly specify the cause stage and take countermeasures. Reviewing wafer level and composite lot level yield patterns has always been an effective way of identifying yield inhibitors and driving process improvement. This process is very time consuming and as such generally occurs only when the overall yield of a device has dropped significantly enough to warrant investigation. The automatic method of failure pattern extraction from fail bit map provides reduced time to analysis and facilitates yield enhancement. The automatic method of failure pattern extraction from fail bit map provides reduced time to analysis and facilitates yield enhancement. This paper describes the techniques to automatically recognize and classifies a failure pattern using a fail bit map, a new simple schema which facilitates the failure analysis.

For example, in an airport threat classification scenario, data from heterogeneous sensors are used to extract features for classifying potential threats. This requires a training set that utilizes non-traditional information sources (e.g., domain experts) to assign a threat level to each training set instance. Sensor reliability, accuracy, noise, etc., all contribute to feature level ambiguities; conflicting opinions of experts generate class label ambiguities that may however indicate important clues. To accommodate these, a belief theoretic approach is proposed. It utilizes a data structure that facilitates belief/plausibility queries regarding "ambiguous" itemsets. An efficient apriori-like algorithm is then developed to extract frequent such itemsets and to generate corresponding association rules. These are then used to classify an incoming "ambiguous" data instance into a class label (which may be "hard" or "soft"). To test its performance, the proposed algorithm is compared with C4.5 for several databases from the UCI repository and a threat assessment application scenario.

Since data mining is a complex process that requires expertise, it is beneficial to provide it as a service on the web. On the other hand, such use of data mining services combined with data collection efforts by private and government organizations leads to increased privacy concerns. In this work, we address the issue of preserving privacy while providing data mining services on the web and present an architecture for privacy preserving sharing of data mining models on the web. In the proposed architecture, data providers use APPEL for specifying their privacy preferences on data mining models, while data collectors use P3P policies for specifying their data-usage practices. Both parties use PMML as the standard for specifying data mining queries, constraints and models.

For retaining customers it is very important to be able to predict whether a customer is still active. Effectless marketing expenses directed towards already inactive customers can be avoided and more intensive marketing actions can be taken in order to support active customers' purchase intentions. Several methods exist that can be used to predict customer activity. In this paper we apply a stochastic and a data mining method to real-life B2B purchase histories and compare the usability and the quality of churn prediction of each of the methods in a non-contractual B2B environment.

UDM is the process of mining data streams in a ubiquitous environment, on resource constrained devices [KPP02]. UDM is widely applied in facilitating real-time decision making in mobile and highly dynamic environments/applications, such as road safety and mobile stock portfolio monitoring. A significant challenge in these contexts is the interpretation and analysis of results produced through unsupervised techniques (which are invaluable since little is known about the streamed data). We propose a novel fuzzy approach that leverages the significant benefits of UDM clustering and supplements the interpretation and use of these results through using expert/background knowledge.

This paper describes a nearest-neighbor method to impute missing values, showing that it can be useful for a clustering genetic algorithm. The proposed nearest-neighbor method is assessed by means of simulations performed in two datasets that are benchmarks for data mining methods: Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Congressional Voting Records. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated both in prediction and clustering scenarios. Empirical results show that the employed imputation method is a suitable data preparation tool.

To additionally capture the quantitative association knowledge, Korn et. al. recently propose a paradigm named Ratio Rules [6] for quantifiable data mining. However, their approach is mainly based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and as a result, it cannot guarantee that the ratio coefficients are non-negative. This may lead to serious problems in the rules' application. In this paper, we propose a new method, called Principal Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (PSNMF), for learning the associations between itemsets in the form of Ratio Rules. In addition, we provide a support measurement to weigh the importance of each rule for the entire dataset. Experiments on several datasets illustrate that the proposed method performs well for discovering latent associations between itemsets in large datasets.

It therefore achieves much better performance and efficiency than Apriori-like algorithms. However, the database still needs to be scanned twice to get the FP-tree. This can be very time-consuming when new data is added to an existing database because two scans may be needed for not only the new data but also the existing data. In this research we propose a new data structure, the pattern tree (P-tree in short), and a new technique, which can get the P-tree through only one scan of the database and can obtain the corresponding FP-tree with a specified support threshold. Updating a P-tree with new data needs one scan of the new data only, and the existing data does not need to be re-scanned. Our experiments show that the P-tree method outperforms the FP-tree method by a factor up to an order of magnitude in large datasets.

A continuity is a kind of causal relationship which describes a definite temporal factor with exact position between the records. Since continuities break the boundaries of records, the number of potential patterns will increase drastically. An alternative approach is to mine closed frequent continuities. Mining closed frequent patterns has the same power as mining the complete set of frequent patterns, while substantially reducing redundant rules to be generated and increasing the effectiveness of mining. In this paper, we propose a method called projected window list technology for the mining of frequent continuities. We present a closed frequent continuity mining algorithm, ClosedPROWL. Experimental result shows that our algorithm is more efficient than previously proposed algorithms.

Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is often used to give a solution. When data is vertically partitioned scalar product is a feasible tool to securely discover frequent itemsets Of association rule mining. However, there may be disparity among the securities of different parties. To obtain equal privacy, the security of some parties may be lowered. This paper discusses the disharmony between the securities of two parties. The scalar product of two parties from the point of view of matrix computation is described. We present one algorithm for completely two-party computation of scalar product. Then we give a method of security improvement for both parties.

Various sectors, including commercial, government, financial, medical, and scientific, are applying Data Mining techniques on their datasets that typically contain sensitive individual information. During this process the datasets get exposed to several parties, which can potentially lead to disclosure of sensitive information and thus to breaches of privacy. Several Data Mining privacy preserving techniques have been recently proposed. In this paper we focus on data perturbation techniques, i.e., those that add noise to the data in order to prevent exact disclosure of confidential values. Some of these techniques were designed for datasets having only numerical non-class attributes and a categorical class attribute. However, natural datasets are more likely to have both numerical and categorical non-class attributes, and occasionally they contain only categorical attributes. Noise addition techniques developed for numerical attributes are not suitable for such datasets, due to the absence of natural ordering among categorical values. In this paper we propose a new method for adding noise to categorical values, which makes use of the clusters that exist among these values. We first discuss several existing categorical clustering methods and point out the limitations they exhibit in our context. Then we present a novel approach towards clustering of categorical values and use it to perturb data while maintaining the patterns in the dataset. Our clustering approach partitions the values of a given categorical attribute rather than the records of the datasets; additionally, our approach operates on the horizontally partitioned dataset and it is possible for two values to belong to the same cluster in one horizontal partition of the dataset, and to two distinct clusters in another partition. Finally, we provide some experimental results in order to evaluate our perturbation technique and to compare our clustering approach with an existing method, the so-called CACTUS.

In this paper, we introduce a new type of contrast pattern, called a Minimal Distinguishing Subsequence (MDS). An MDS is a minimal subsequence that occurs frequently in one class of sequences and infrequently in sequences of another class. It is a natural way of representing strong and succinct contrast information between two sequential datasets and can be useful in applications such as protein comparison, document comparison and building sequential classification models. Mining MDS patterns is a challenging task and is significantly different from mining contrasts between relational/transactional data. One particularly important type of constraint that can be integrated into the mining process is the maximum gap constraint. We present an efficient algorithm called ConSGapMiner, to mine all MDSs according to a maximum gap constraint. It employs highly efficient bitset and boolean operations, for powerful gap based pruning within a prefix growth framework. A performance evaluation with both sparse and dense datasets, demonstrates the scalability of ConSGapMiner and shows its ability to mine patterns from high dimensional datasets at low supports.

This paper takes a new approach for this problem and makes two major contributions. First, we present a one pass algorithm for frequent itemset mining, which has deterministic bounds on the accuracy, and does not require any out-of-core summary structure. Second, because our one pass algorithm does not produce any false negatives, it can be easily extended to a two pass accurate algorithm. Our two pass algorithm is very memory efficient, and allows mining of datasets with large number of distinct items and/or very low support levels. Our detailed experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets shows the following. First, our one pass algorithm is very accurate in practice. Second, our algorithm requires significantly lower memory than Manku and Motwani's one pass algorithm and the multi-pass Apriori algorithm. Our two pass algorithm outperforms Apriori and FP-tree when the number of distinct items is large and/or support levels are very low. In other cases, it is quite competitive, with possible exception of cases where the average length of frequent itemsets is quite high.

In this paper, we propose two novel index-based techniques for top-k ranked query: (1) indexing the layered skyline, and (2) indexing microclusters of objects into a grid structure. We also develop efficient algorithms for ranked query by locating the answer points during the sweeping of the line/hyperplane of the score function over the indexed objects. Both methods can be easily plugged into typical multi-dimensional database indexes. The comprehensive experiments not only demonstrate that our methods outperform the existing ones, but also illustrate that the application of data mining technique (microclustering) is a useful and effective solution for database query processing.

The detailed physical modelling of such populations is computationally expensive, inhibiting the detailed analysis of the several million galaxy spectra becoming available over the next few years. Here we present a data mining application aimed at decomposing the spectra of galaxies into several coeval stellar populations, without the use of detailed physical models. This is achieved by performing a linear independent basis transformation that essentially decouples the initial problem of joint processing of a set of correlated spectral measurements into that of the independent processing of a small set of prototypical spectra. Two methods are investigated: (1) A fast projection approach is derived by exploiting the correlation;structure of neighboring wavelength bins within the spectral data. (2) A factorisation method that takes advantage of the positivity of the spectra is also investigated. The preliminary results show that typical features observed in stellar population spectra of different evolutionary histories can be convincingly disentangled by these rnethods, despite the absence of input physics. The success of this basis transformation analysis in recovering physically interpretable representations indicates that this technique is a potentially powerful tool for astronomical data mining.

Recently applying artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to intrusion detection system are increasing. But most of researches are focused on improving the classification performance of classifier. Selecting important features from input data lead to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection rates. Thus selecting important features is an important issue in intrusion detection. Another issue in intrusion detection is that most of the intrusion detection systems are performed by off-line and it is not proper method for realtime intrusion detection system. In this paper, we develop the realtime intrusion detection system which combining on-line feature extraction method with Least Squares Support Vector Machine classifier. Applying proposed system to KDD CUP 99 data, experimental results show that it have remarkable feature feature extraction and classification performance compared to existing off-line intrusion detection system.

In order to control highly constrained non-linear system such as a 3D space robot, the analytical formulation for the system with complex dynamics and effective control methodology based on the formulation, are not always obtainable. In the proposed method, correspondingly, a non-analytical but effective self-organizing modeling method for controlling a highly constrained system is proposed based on a polynomial data mining algorithm. In order to control the attitude of a planar space robot, it is well known to require inputs characterized by a special pattern in time series with a non-deterministic length. In order to correspond to this type of control paradigm, we adopt the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme where the length of the non-deterministic horizon is determined based on implementation cost and control performance. The optimal solution to finding the size of the input pattern is found by a solving two-stage programming problem.

We try to develop a discovered rule filtering method to filter rules discovered by a data mining system to be novel and reasonable ones by using information retrieval technique. In this method, we rank discovered rules according to the results of information retrieval from an information source on the Internet. In this paper, we show two approaches toward discovered rule filtering; the micro view approach and the macro view approach. The micro view approach tries to retrieve and show documents directly related to discovered rules. On the other hand, the macro view approach tries to show the trend of research activities related to discovered rules by using the results of information retrieval. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the micro view approach and feasibility of the macro view approach by using an example of clinical data mining and MEDLINE document retrieval.

The purpose is to develop evaluation methodology for finding features of energy provision and consumption from observed data. While there are four evaluation measures (economy, environment, comfort, and risk) in general, this paper focuses on economical and environmental aspects, and selects energy consumption, CO2 discharge and cost as inputs for the first step model. In order to consider the evaluation methodology based on four plants data, this paper has focused on hot-water supply as output. Then the numerical study illustrates the findings from data on energy supply patterns, seasonal effects, and so on.

Due to privacy issues, web based data mining systems are not efficient for the purpose of constructing candidate's profiles, even if they can offer some help; therefore a distributed solution that permits each candidate's workplace to he explored was developed As a means of aggregating collected knowledge for sharing, a conceptual model, relating candidate's profiles and their knowledge domain was developed in the form of an ontology. This strategy allows the system to be specialised in terms of the candidates' main knowledge domain.

Besides their sheer amount, the stored data objects are also more and more complex. Therefore, classification of these complex objects is an important data mining task that yields several new challenges. In many applications, the data objects provide multiple representations. E.g. proteins can be described by text, amino acid sequences or 3D structures. Additionally, many real-world applications need to distinguish thousands of classes. Last but not least, many complex objects are not directly expressible by feature vectors. To cope with all these requirements, we introduce a novel approach to classification of multi-represented objects that is capable to distinguish large numbers of classes. Our method is based on k nearest neighbor classification and employs density-based clustering as a new approach to reduce the training instances for instance-based classification. To predict the most likely class, our classifier employs a new method to use several object representations for making accurate class predictions. The introduced method is evaluated by classifying proteins according to the classes of Gene Ontology, one of the most established class systems for biomolecules that comprises several thousand classes.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to discover these types of rules by means of Boolean reasoning. An alternative approach is based on data mining techniques and proved to be useful in the case of large data sets. In this paper, we apply recent data mining achievements in the area of concise representation of patterns to generation of all optimal certain and generalized decision rules. We prove that antecedents of such rules are generators. We use this result to offer adapted versions of the AprioriCertain and AprioriGeneralized algorithms that drastically reduce the number of useless candidate rules.

In this paper we investigate the use of sequences of system calls for classifying intrusions and faults induced by privileged processes in Unix Operating system. In our work we applied sequence-data mining approach in the context of intrusion detection system (IDS). This paper introduces a new similarity measure that considers both sequence as well as set similarity among sessions. Considering both order of occurrences as well as content in a session enhances the capabilities of kNN classifier significantly, especially in the context of intrusion detection. From our experiments on DARPA 1998 IDS dataset we infer that the order of occurrences plays a major role in determining the nature of the session. The objective of this work is to construct concise and accurate classifiers to detect anomalies based on sequence as well as set similarity.

In literature, concept hierarchy is usually given by domain experts. In this paper, we propose algorithms to automatically build a concept hierarchy from a provided distance matrix. Our approach is modifying the traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms. For the purpose of algorithm evaluation, a distance matrix is derived from the concept hierarchy built by our algorithm. Root mean squared error between the provided distant matrix and the derived distance matrix is used as evaluation criterion. We compare the traditional hierarchical clustering and our modified algorithm under three strategies of computing cluster distance, namely single link, average link, and complete link. Empirical results show that the traditional algorithm under complete link strategy performs better than the other strategies. Our modified algorithms perform almost the same under the three strategies, and our algorithms perform better than the traditional algorithms under various situations.

It often uses advanced data mining and machine learning methodologies to perform prediction or pattern recognition tasks. This paper describes a new method for prediction of protein secondary structure content based on feature selection and multiple linear regression. The method develops a novel representation of primary protein sequences based on a large set of 495 features. The feature selection task performed using very large set of nearly 6,000 proteins, and tests performed on standard non-homologues protein sets confirm high quality of the developed solution. The application of feature selection and the novel representation resulted in 14-15% error rate reduction when compared to results achieved when standard representation is used. The prediction tests also show that a small set of 5-25 features is sufficient to achieve accurate prediction for both helix and strand content for non-homologous proteins.

Propositionalisation consists in changing the representation of relational data in order to apply usual attribute-value learning systems. Data mining practitioners are not necessarily aware of existing works and try to propositionalise by hand. Unfortunately there exists some tempting pitfalls. This article aims at bridging the gap between data mining practitioners and relational data, pointing out the most usual traps and proposing correct approaches to propositionalisation. Similar situations with sequential data and the multiple-instance problem are also covered. Finally the strengths and weaknesses of propositionalisation are listed.
