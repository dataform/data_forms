The pharmacological relevance of drug-event associations is not considered in SDR prioritisation algorithms. This aimed to propose and test a pharmacological score for SDR prioritisation. The Pharmacological Score for SDRs Prioritisation (PS-SP) was developed using a Delphi approach. An expert group agreed that PS-SP should include general criteria concerning SDRs and criteria concerning pharmacological relevance, and that criteria should be weighted for their risk representation. Once defined, the PS-SP was tested for prioritisation of SDRs for extrapyramidal syndrome in the French Pharmacovigilance database; the SDR classification was compared to that obtained using a traditional disproportionality approach. For a given drug, the general criteria retained were the reporting rate of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) and value of the 95% confidence interval (CI) lower boundary of the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR). Pharmacological criteria consisted of the ADR reporting rate without concomitant at-risk drugs or those indicated for ADR treatment, and the value of the ROR 95% CI lower boundary as estimated in the subset of reports concerning drugs from the same therapeutic and then pharmacological class. Compared with traditional disproportionality, PS-SP prioritised specific drugs within congeners: metoclopramide, indoramin, and trimetazidine appeared as outliers within their classes; conventional antipsychotics had higher prioritisation than atypical antipsychotics. The pilot evaluation of PS-SP performed in extrapyramidal syndrome advocates for the use of pharmacological criteria in SDR prioritisation algorithms.

J	Fiorillo, G; Ghosn, M				Fiorillo, Graziano; Ghosn, Michel			Procedure for Statistical Categorization of Overweight Vehicles in a WIM Database	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Weigh in motion; Bayesian updating; Overweight trucks; Illegal overweight trucks; Overweight permit trucks; Pattern recognition; Data mining		Recently observed increases in the numbers of permitted and illegal overweight trucks travelling over U.S. highways have raised concerns over their contributions to the reduction in the service lives of pavements and bridges and the costs of maintaining, upgrading and replacing the highway infrastructure system. Cost allocation studies are used by transportation officials to help their asset management processes and to establish truck traffic and permitting policies taking into consideration information on the composition of overweight trucks and their permit categorization. In recent years, cost allocation studies have heavily relied on data assembled by weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems which provide information on traffic counts, truck axle configurations and weights for various highway classes and economic regions. However, WIM data by themselves do not provide information on the numbers of illegal overweight trucks because many of the overweight trucks may have been issued permits that allow them to operate on a yearly basis or on a trip-by-trip basis. The object of this paper is to develop a data mining procedure to identify and classify overweight vehicles whose axle weights were collected by WIM systems into different permit and illegal categories. The first step of the proposed data mining procedure establishes a set of rules that are satisfied by different types of permit trucks. These rules are inferred from a review of available permit databases. In a second step, a search algorithm is used to check each vehicle in a WIM database and identify whether it violates any of a jurisdiction's legal weight limits. Subsequently, every overweight truck's axle weights, axle spacings, total length and gross vehicle weight are checked to verify whether these characteristics match any of the criteria established when setting up the data mining rules. The overweight vehicles are separated based on the likelihood of having been issued a particular type of permit or if they are potentially illegal. The validity of the algorithm is demonstrated by analyzing truck data collected at a WIM site in upstate New York. The algorithm's output showed reasonable agreement when compared to the results of a truck survey performed by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). A parametric analysis is executed to assess the sensitivity of the results to the level of accuracy of the WIM system. It is concluded that the algorithm produces statistically robust overweight truck and permit categorizations which can eventually help highway agencies establish rational permit issuance policies, weight enforcement strategies, and cost allocation studies.

Recently, clustering algorithms were shown to be useful for helping users find content in large networks. Yet, many of these algorithms overlook the fact that p2p networks follow graph models with a power-law node degree distribution. This paper studies the obtained clusters when applying clustering algorithms on power-law graphs and their applicability for finding content. Driven by the observed deficiencies, a simple yet efficient clustering algorithm is proposed, which targets a relaxed optimization of a minimal distance distribution of each cluster with a size balancing scheme. A comparative analysis using a song-similarity graph collected from 1.2 million Gnutella users reveals that commonly used efficiency measures often overlook search and recommendation applicability issues and provide the wrong impression that the resulting clusters are well suited for these tasks. We show that the proposed algorithm performs well on various measures that are well suited for the domain.

In this paper, a new feature selection evaluation criterion based on low-loss learning vector quantization (LVQ) classification is proposed. Based on the evaluation criterion, a feature selection algorithm that optimizes the hypothesis margin of LVQ classification through minimizing its loss function is presented. Some experiments that are compared with well-known SVM-RFE and Relief are carried out on 4 UCI data sets using Naive Bayes and RBF Network classifier. Experimental results show that new algorithm achieves similar or even higher performance than Relief on all training data and has better or comparable performance than SVM-RFE.

Over the recent years, digital technologies have enhanced various aspects of scholarly practices, such as data collection and analysis, research collaboration, and publishing. New technology-enhanced research approaches have been emerging in a number of educational research domains, such as learning analytics, educational data mining, digital ethnography and educational informatics. Although the potential of digital approaches has been generally acknowledged, many overarching conceptual and methodological questions remain unexplored and under-theorised. This special issue provides a landmark collection that synthesises some important empirical and methodological advances in this research field, including methodologically innovative case studies and critical analyses of overarching epistemological, methodological and practical issues that inevitably will shape future developments of this research field.

The automated detection of these constructs allows EDM researchers to develop intervention strategies that can be implemented either by the software or the teacher. It also allows for secondary analyses of the construct, where the detectors are applied to a data set that is much larger than one that could be analyzed by more traditional methods. However, in many cases, the data used to develop EDM models are collected from students who may not be representative of the broader populations who are likely to use ICT. In order to use EDM models (automated detectors) with new populations, their generalizability must be verified. In this study, we examine whether detectors of affect remain valid when applied to new populations. Models of four educationally relevant affective states were constructed based on data from urban, suburban and rural students using ASSISTments software for middle school mathematics in the Northeastern United States. We found that affect detectors trained on a population drawn primarily from one demographic grouping do not generalize to populations drawn primarily from the other demographic groupings, even though those populations might be considered part of the same national or regional culture. Models constructed using data from all three subpopulations are more applicable to students in those populations than those trained on a single group, but still do not achieve ideal population validity-the ability to generalize across all subgroups. In particular, models generalize better across urban and suburban students than rural students. These findings have important implications for data collection efforts, validation techniques, and the design of interventions that are intended to be applied at scale.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							REGULATORY PROCESSES; COGNITIVE SCIENCE	This paper discusses the fundamental question of how data-intensive e-research methods could contribute to the development of learning theories. Using methodological developments in research on self-regulated learning as an example, it argues that current applications of data-driven analytical techniques, such as educational data mining and its branch process mining, are deeply grounded in an event-focused, ontologically flat view of learning phenomena. These techniques provide descriptive accounts of the regularities of events, but have limited power to generate theoretical explanations. Building on the philosophical views of critical realism, the paper argues that educational e-research needs to adopt more nuanced ways for investigating and theorising learning phenomena that could provide an account of the mechanisms and contexts in which those mechanisms are realised. It proposes that future methodological extensions should include three main aspects: (1) stratified ontological frameworks, (2) multimodal data collection and (3) dynamic analytical methods.

With each drug added to a regime, the number of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) increases by a power law. Early prediction of relevant interactions by computerized tools greatly aids clinicians and can guide their prescribing choices. Areas covered: In this article, we discuss different types of DDIs, on which levels they can arise and what efforts have been made in the past to detect and predict them. The emphasis is on data mining technology and network analysis, but overlaps with traditional pharmacovigilance are also discussed. Finally, we discuss strategies to focus and simplify mining efforts to get meaningful results with less effort. Expert opinion: The necessary technology for detecting adverse DDIs exists and is quite refined, although it is more often implied in lower risk scenarios (such as syntactic analysis in web searches and online libraries). Data mining for DDIs, on the other hand, still requires a great deal of human intervention, not only to validate the results but also, more importantly, to separate the relevant from the spurious. The fields of network analysis and graph theory show great promise but have not yet shown much beyond descriptive analyses.

ESHRE PGD Consortium data collection XII: cycles from January to December 2009 with pregnancy follow-up to October 2010	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						PGD; preimplantation genetic screening; fluorescence in situ hybridization; PCR; ESHRE PGD consortium	PRACTICE GUIDELINES	How do data in the 12th annual data collection (Data XII) of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) Consortium compare with the cumulative data for collections IXI? Since the beginning of the data collections, there has been a steady increase in the number of cycles, pregnancies and babies reported annually. The PGD Consortium has collected, analysed and published 11 previous data sets since 1997. Data were collected from each participating centre using a pre-designed FileMaker Pro database (versions 510). Separate FileMaker Pro files were used for the cycles, pregnancies and baby records. The study documented cycles performed during the calendar year 2009 and follow-up of the pregnancies and babies born which resulted from these cycles (until October 2010). Data were submitted by 60 centres (full PGD Consortium members), and the blank files were distributed to each PGD Consortium member centre at the end of 2008. The submitted data were thoroughly analysed to identify incomplete data entries and corrections were requested from the participating centres. Records remaining with incomplete data were excluded from the calculations. Corrections, tables and calculations were made by expert co-authors. For data collection XII, 60 centres reported data for 6160 cycles with oocyte retrieval (OR), along with details of the follow-up on 1607 pregnancies and 1238 babies born. A total of 870 OR were reported for chromosomal abnormalities, 113 OR for sexing for X-linked diseases, 1597 OR for monogenic diseases, 3551 OR for preimplantation genetic screening and 29 OR for social sexing. These data cannot include every PGD cycle performed annually, and only indicate the trends in PGD worldwide. The annual data collections provide an extremely valuable resource for data mining and for following trends in PGD practice. None.

J	Rasheed, F; Alhajj, R				Rasheed, Faraz; Alhajj, Reda			A Framework for Periodic Outlier Pattern Detection in Time-Series Sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Outlier periodic patterns; performance; periodicity detection; suffix tree; surprising patterns; surprising periodicity; time series; unusual periods	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE; SUFFIX TREES; DATABASES; MODEL	Periodic pattern detection in time-ordered sequences is an important data mining task, which discovers in the time series all patterns that exhibit temporal regularities. Periodic pattern mining has a large number of applications in real life; it helps understanding the regular trend of the data along time, and enables the forecast and prediction of future events. An interesting related and vital problem that has not received enough attention is to discover outlier periodic patterns in a time series. Outlier patterns are defined as those which are different from the rest of the patterns; outliers are not noise. While noise does not belong to the data and it is mostly eliminated by preprocessing, outliers are actual instances in the data but have exceptional characteristics compared with the majority of the other instances. Outliers are unusual patterns that rarely occur, and, thus, have lesser support (frequency of appearance) in the data. Outlier patterns may hint toward discrepancy in the data such as fraudulent transactions, network intrusion, change in customer behavior, recession in the economy, epidemic and disease biomarkers, severe weather conditions like tornados, etc. We argue that detecting the periodicity of outlier patterns might be more important in many sequences than the periodicity of regular, more frequent patterns. In this paper, we present a robust and time efficient suffix tree-based algorithm capable of detecting the periodicity of outlier patterns in a time series by giving more significance to less frequent yet periodic patterns. Several experiments have been conducted using both real and synthetic data; all aspects of the proposed approach are compared with the existing algorithm InfoMiner; the reported results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

Phishing websites comprise a variety of cues within its content-parts as well as the browser-based security indicators provided along with the website. Several solutions have been proposed to tackle phishing. Nevertheless, there is no single magic bullet that can solve this threat radically. One of the promising techniques that can be employed in predicting phishing attacks is based on data mining, particularly the 'induction of classification rules' since anti-phishing solutions aim to predict the website class accurately and that exactly matches the data mining classification technique goals. In this study, the authors shed light on the important features that distinguish phishing websites from legitimate ones and assess how good rule-based data mining classification techniques are in predicting phishing websites and which classification technique is proven to be more reliable.

For this purpose, a well-controlled experiment was designed, in which standardized visual and auditory stimuli were systematically selected and presented to participants to induce various emotions spontaneously in a laboratory setting. Numerous physiological signals, including facial electromyogram, electroencephalography, skin conductivity and respiration data, were recorded when participants were exposed to the stimulus presentation. Two data mining methods, namely decision rules and k-nearest neighbor based on the rough set technique, were applied to construct emotion prediction models based on the features extracted from the physiological data. Experimental results demonstrated that auditory stimuli were as effective as visual stimuli in eliciting emotions in terms of systematic physiological reactivity. This was evidenced by the best prediction accuracy quantified by the F-1 measure (visual: 76.2% vs. auditory: 76.1%) among six emotion categories (excited, happy, neutral, sad, fearful and disgusted). Furthermore, we also constructed culture-specific (Chinese vs. Indian) prediction models. The results showed that model prediction accuracy was not significantly different between culture-specific models. Finally, the implications of affective auditory stimuli in human-computer interaction, limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are discussed.

Resolving the wave-particle-plasma interaction: advances in the diagnosis, interpretation and self-consistent modelling of waves, particles and the plasma configuration	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION			English	Review						wave-particle interaction; resonance; equilibrium; diagnostics; validation classification	MAGNETIC DIAGNOSTICS; SPHERICAL TOKAMAK; ALFVEN EIGENMODES; JET TOKAMAK; MHD MODES; FUSION; DECOMPOSITION; STABILITY; PRESSURE; PROPAGATION	The purpose of this review is to present the state-of-the-art in diagnosis, interpretation and modelling of waves, particles and the magnetic configuration in fusion plasmas. Knowledge of the magnetic configuration underpins all confinement, stability and transport physics, as well as being an essential prerequisite for the inference of plasma parameters from many diagnostics. As the effect of fast particles become important enough to modify the macroscopic variables of the plasma, the macroscopic fluid equations for equilibrium need to be modified to encapsulate the effects of pressure anisotropy, particle and heat flow. We present a review of such modifications in tokamak geometry, and review probabilistic validation techniques of different equilibrium models. In the last decade new spectral tools have also emerged to characterize the linear behaviour of waves and wave-modes, such as SVD, Fourier-SVD, data-mining and the bispectrum. An emerging trend is the use of statistics to characterize the nonlinear wave population of the plasma from wave field data. Finally, progress is reported on developments in understanding the physics of wave-particle resonant interactions, and the emerging science of the wave-particle-plasma interaction.	[Hole, M.

However, in most cases these attempts are centered mainly on the simultaneous multiple reading capability of RFID technology, and thus neglect the management of massive data generated from the RFID reader. As a result, it is difficult to obtain flow information for RFID data mining related to real time process control. In this paper, we propose an advanced process management method, called 'Procedure Tree' (PT), for RFID data mining. Using the suggested PT, we are able to manage massive RFID data effectively, and perform real time process management efficiently. Then we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, after applying it to a real time process control system connected to the RFID-based EIS. For the verification of the suggested system, we collect an enormous amount of data in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) database, analyze characteristics of the collected data, and then compute the elapsed time on each stage in process control. The suggested system was able to perform what the traditional RFID-based process control systems failed to do, such as predicting and tracking of real time process and inventory control.

It can be approached by the application of some instance selection algorithms to filter out unrepresentative or noisy data from a given (training) dataset. However, the performance of instance selection over very high dimensional data has not yet been fully examined. In this paper, we introduce a novel efficient genetic algorithm (EGA), which fits "biological evolution" into the evolutionary process. In other words, after long-term evolution, individuals find the most efficient way to allocate resources and evolve. The experimental study is based on four very high dimensional datasets ranging from 200 to 18,236 dimensions. In addition, four state-of-the-art algorithms including IB3, DROP3, ICF, and GA are compared with EGA. The experimental results show that EGA allows the k-NN and SVM classifiers to provide the most comparable classification performance with the baseline classifiers without instance selection. Particularly, EGA outperforms the four algorithms in terms of average classification accuracy. Moreover, EGA can produce the largest reduction rates (the same as GA) and it requires relatively less computational time than the other four algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, many of these techniques rely on the peculiar characteristics of a specific type of data to detect the outliers. As a result, they cannot be easily applied to different types of data in other application domains; they should at least be tuned and customized to adapt to the new domain. They also may need certain amount of training data to build their models. This makes them hard to apply especially when only a limited amount of data is available. The work described in this paper tackle the problem by proposing a graph-based approach for the discovery of contextual outliers in sequential data. The developed algorithm offers a higher degree of flexibility and requires less amount of information about the nature of the analyzed data compared to the previous approaches described in the literature. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments on stock market and weather data; we compared the results with the results from our previous work. Our analysis of the results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper is successful and effective in detecting outliers in data from different domains, one financial and the other meteorological.

Among them, cluster detection techniques are of major importance. Although these techniques have already been largely explored in the scientific literature, there are at least two important open issues: the existent algorithms are not scalable for large high-dimensional datasets, and the unsupervised nature of traditional data clustering makes it very difficult to generate meaningful clusters. This article presents an overview of the strategies being explored in order to deal more deeply with these issues. Moreover, it describes a new semi-supervised clustering strategy that exemplifies the integration of several approaches and that can be employed with partitioning algorithms, such as PAM and Clarans. The technique addresses an improvement to these types of algorithms, which is obtained by using must-link feedback information provided by the users in an interactive and visual environment.

On the basis of the evolutionary cycle, similarities and differences between these algorithms are described. We briefly discuss how EAs can be adapted to work well in case of multiple objectives, and dynamic or noisy optimization problems. We look at the tuning of algorithms and present some recent developments coming from theory. Finally, typical applications of EAs to real-world problems are shown, with special emphasis on data-mining applications.

Compared to static representations like rules or decision trees, the temporal component greatly increases the pattern diversity. It is important to keep the human perception of time flow in mind when representing temporal patterns, otherwise we open the floodgates to misinterpretation and misconception. This article gives an overview of temporal interval patterns, which are considered as being a well-suited mechanism of knowledge representation, and focusses on the various pattern representation languages. Four typical phenomena in temporal data, and how the pattern languages can cope with them, are discussed. Given the domain knowledge, this provides the reader some guidance on which pattern language may be best-suited for a given application.

J	Huang, Y; Gao, XD				Huang, Yue; Gao, Xuedong			Clustering on heterogeneous networks	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review							MULTITYPE RELATIONAL DATA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; INFORMATION NETWORKS; WEB	Objects that are interrelated with each other are often represented as homogeneous networks, in which objects are of the same entity type and relationships between objects are of the same relationship type. However, heterogeneous information networks, composed of multiple types of objects and/or relationships, are ubiquitous in real life. Mining heterogeneous information networks is a new and promising field of research in data mining, and clustering is an important way to identify underlying patterns in data. Although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied for several decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has been explored only recently. However, some progress has already been made with respect to this theme, ranging from algorithms to various related applications. This paper presents a brief summary of current research regarding heterogeneous network clustering and addresses some promising research directions. First, it presents a formalized definition and two important aspects of heterogeneous information networks to elaborate why clustering on heterogeneous networks is of significance. Then, this review provides a concise classification of existing heterogeneous network clustering algorithms based on their methodological principles. In addition, it discusses experimental developments and applications of heterogeneous network clustering. The paper addresses several open problems and critical issues for future research.

Specifically, the aim of this study is to review the current state of the SVM technique, and to show some of its latest successful results in real-world problems present in different engineering fields. The paper starts by reviewing the main basic concepts of SVMs and kernel methods. Kernel theory, SVMs, support vector regression (SVR), and SVM in signal processing and hybridization of SVMs with meta-heuristics are fully described in the first part of this paper. The adoption of SVMs in engineering is nowadays a fact. As we illustrate in this paper, SVMs can handle high-dimensional, heterogeneous and scarcely labeled datasets very efficiently, and it can be also successfully tailored to particular applications. The second part of this review is devoted to different case studies in engineering problems, where the application of the SVM methodology has led to excellent results. First, we discuss the application of SVR algorithms in two renewable energy problems: the wind speed prediction from measurements in neighbor stations and the wind speed reconstruction using synoptic-pressure data. The application of SVMs in noninvasive cardiac indices estimation is described next, and results obtained there are presented. The application of SVMs in problems of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data processing is further discussed in the paper: brain decoding and mental disorder characterization. The following application deals with antenna array processing, namely SVMs for spatial nonlinear beamforming, and the SVM application in a problem of arrival angle detection. Finally, the application of SVMs to remote sensing image classification and target detection problems closes this review.

A feasible way of improving the clinical therapy effectiveness is needed to correctly differentiate the syndrome classifications based on the clinical manifestations. In this paper, a novel data mining method based on manifold ranking (MR) is proposed to explore the relation between syndromes and symptoms for viral hepatitis. Since MR could take the symptom data with expert differentiation and the symptom data without expert differentiation into the task of syndrome classification, the clinical information used for modeling the syndrome features is greatly enlarged so as to improve the precise of syndrome classification. In addition, the proposed method of syndrome classification could also avoid two disadvantages in previous methods: linear relation of the clinical data and mutually exclusive symptoms among different syndromes. And it could help exploit the latent relation between syndromes and symptoms more effectively. Better performance of syndrome classification is able to be achieved according to the experimental results and the clinical experts.

FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize; Ear competition; MARS; MLR; Participatory plant breeding (PPB); Data mining	ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; SELECTION; MEXICO; PREDICTION; EVOLUTION; VARIETIES; PORTUGAL; FARMER; OAXACA; PLANTS	Under the scope of a Portuguese regional maize ear competition (the "Sousa Valley Best Ear Competition"), an ear value (EV) formula was developed in 1993 based on published maize trait correlations. This formula had two main purposes, ears evaluation for the ear competition and maize improvement selection. The EV formula included only ear length, kernel weight at 15% moisture, number of rows and number of kernels/ear, with no direct inputs from farmers maize yield. In order to add a more scientific dimension to this popular maize evaluation approach, four main goals were defined: (1) to test alternative interpretable regression methods to provide new ear value formulas that better estimates the yield potential using ear traits; (2) to develop a new instance ranking method, allowing to select the best new ear value formula to be used on the ear competition; (3) to identify a set of traits that will help farmers on selection toward better yield; and (4) to compare the ranking results obtained by the original EV formula and the newly one developed, using data from the "Sousa Valley Best Ear" competition. To achieve these goals we analyzed some of the competition winning maize populations, on a multilocation field trial, collecting not only ear, but also field traits and yield. This data was analyzed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). A new ranking evaluation measure (PR.NDCG measure) was developed to rank the eleven interpretable regression methods obtained, and our results indicated that the most appropriate formula for yield potendal estimation included the original EV traits, but with different coefficients and was entitled adjusted EV (EVA). Ear weight, kernel depth and rachis 2, followed by cob and ear diameters and number of kernels per row were also considered traits of major importance to define potential EV formulas, i.e., contributing to yield increase. Plant stand was the most important field variable for yield potential estimation. We also observed, from comparing EV and EVA ranking, that four of the top ranks maize ears using EV were included on the EVA top ten ranks. From all the above and due to its simplicity, we conclude that the new EVA formula is a valid starting point for a long term engagement of farmers with maize germplasm development and improvement and an open door to their better understanding of maize quantitative genetics.

J	Abdeyazdan, M				Abdeyazdan, Marjan			Data clustering based on hybrid K-harmonic means and modifier imperialist competitive algorithm	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Modified imperialist competitive algorithm; K-means; K-harmonic means; Data clustering		Clustering is a process for partitioning datasets. Clustering is one of the most commonly used techniques in data mining and is very useful for optimum solution. K-means is one of the simplest and the most popular methods that is based on square error criterion. This algorithm depends on initial states and is easily trapped and converges to local optima. Some recent researches show that K-means algorithm has been successfully applied to combinatorial optimization problems for clustering. K-harmonic means clustering solves the problem of initialization using a built-in boosting function, but it is suffering from running into local optima. In this article, we purpose a novel method that is based on combining two algorithms; K-harmonic means and modifier imperialist competitive algorithm. It is named ICAKHM. To carry out this experiment, four real datasets have been employed whose results indicate that ICAKHM. Four real datasets are employed to measure the proposed method include Iris, Wine, Glass and Contraceptive Method Choice with small, medium and large dimensions. The experimented results show that the new method (ICAKHM) carries out better results than the efficiency of KHM, PSOKHM, GSOKHM and ICAKM methods.

Queries defined on data warehouses are generally complex due to join operations involved. The performance of star schema queries in data warehouses is highly critical and its optimization is hard in general. Several query performance optimization methods exist, such as indexes and table partitioning. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on binary particle swarm optimization for solving the bitmap join index selection problem in data warehouses. This approach selects the optimal set of bitmap join indexes based on a mathematical cost model. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the bitmap join index selection problem. Further testing of the method is performed using a database environment specific cost function. The binary particle swarm optimization is found to be more effective than both the genetic algorithm and data mining based approaches.

The functional repertoire of rabbit antibodies and antibody discovery via next- generation sequencing	MABS			English	Article						immunogobulins; therapeutic antibodies; antigen-binding site; antibody gene usage	HEAVY-CHAIN LOCUS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; LYMPHOID-TISSUES; MOUSE; EXPRESSION; DIVERSITY; LIBRARY; REGION; GENES; SERUM	To gain insight into the functional antibody repertoire of rabbits, the VH and VL repertoires of bone marrow (BM) and spleen (SP) of a naive New Zealand White rabbit (NZW; Oryctolagus cuniculus) and that of lymphocytes collected from a NZW rabbit immunized (IM) with a 16-mer peptide were deep-sequenced. Two closely related genes, IGHV1S40 (VH1a3) and IGHV1S45 (VH4), were found to dominate (similar to 90%) the VH repertoire of BM and SP, whereas, IGHV1S69 (VH1a1) contributed significantly (similar to 40%) to IM. BM and SP antibodies recombined predominantly with IGHJ4. A significant proportion (similar to 30%) of IM sequences recombined with IGHJ2. The VK repertoire was encoded by nine IGKV genes recombined with one IGKJ gene, IGKJ1. No significant bias in the VK repertoire of the BM, SP and IM samples was observed. The complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3 and -L3 length distributions were similar in the three samples following a Gaussian curve with average length of 12.2 +/- 2.4 and 11.1 +/- 1.1 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid composition of the predominant CDR-H3 and -L3 loop lengths was similar to that of humans and mice, rich in Tyr, Gly, Ser and, in some specific positions, Asp. The average number of mutations along the IGHV/KV genes was similar in BM, SP and IM; close to 12 and 15 mutations for VH and VL, respectively. A monoclonal antibody specific for the peptide used as immunogen was obtained from the IM rabbit. The CDR-H3 sequence was found in 1,559 of 61,728 (2.5%) sequences, at position 10, in the rank order of the CDR-H3 frequencies. The CDR-L3 was found in 24 of 11,215 (0.2%) sequences, ranking 102. No match was found in the BM and SP samples, indicating positive selection for the hybridoma sequence. Altogether, these findings lay foundations for engineering of rabbit V regions to enhance their potential as therapeutics, i.e., design of strategies for selection of specific rabbit V regions from NGS data mining, humanization and design of libraries for affinity maturation campaigns.

The commonest method used for discovering previously unknown safety risks is spontaneous notifications. In this study we examine the use of data mining algorithms to identify signals from adverse events reported in a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of several Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in African children. Methods: We used paediatric safety data from a multi-site, multi-country clinical study conducted in seven African countries (Burkina Faso, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Mozambique). Each site compared three out of four ACTs, namely amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or chlorproguanil/dapsone and artesunate (CD+A). We examine two pharmacovigilance signal detection methods, namely proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network on the clinical safety dataset. Results: Among the 4,116 children (6-59 months old) enrolled and followed up for 28 days post treatment, a total of 6,238 adverse events were reported resulting into 346 drug-event combinations. Nine signals were generated both by proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network. A review of the manufacturer package leaflets, an online Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker (DoubleCheckMD) and further by therapeutic area experts reduced the number of signals to five. The ranking of some drug-adverse reaction pairs on the basis of their signal index differed between the two methods. Conclusions: Our two data mining methods were equally able to generate suspected signals using the pooled safety data from a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial. This analysis demonstrated the possibility of utilising clinical studies safety data for key pharmacovigilance activities like signal detection and evaluation. This approach can be applied to complement the spontaneous reporting systems which are limited by under reporting.

AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF TIME-VARIABLE X-RAY SOURCES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; methods: statistical; X-rays: general	SERENDIPITOUS SOURCE CATALOG; XMM-NEWTON; OPTICAL-IDENTIFICATION; III. CLASSIFICATION; LIGHT CURVES; BLACK-HOLE; STARS; SKY; VARIABILITY; TRANSIENTS	To maximize the discovery potential of future synoptic surveys, especially in the field of transient science, it will be necessary to use automatic classification to identify some of the astronomical sources. The data mining technique of supervised classification is suitable for this problem. Here, we present a supervised learning method to automatically classify variable X-ray sources in the Second XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (2XMMi-DR2). Random Forest is our classifier of choice since it is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. Our training set consists of 873 variable sources and their features are derived from time series, spectra, and other multi-wavelength contextual information. The 10 fold cross validation accuracy of the training data is similar to 97% on a 7 class data set. We applied the trained classification model to 411 unknown variable 2XMM sources to produce a probabilistically classified catalog. Using the classification margin and the Random Forest derived outlier measure, we identified 12 anomalous sources, of which 2XMM J180658.7-500250 appears to be the most unusual source in the sample. Its X-ray spectra is suggestive of a ultraluminous X-ray source but its variability makes it highly unusual. Machine-learned classification and anomaly detection will facilitate scientific discoveries in the era of all-sky surveys.	[Lo, Kitty K.; Farrell, Sean; Murphy, Tara; Gaensler, B.

J	Renaud-Gentie, C; Burgos, S; Benoit, M				Renaud-Gentie, Christel; Burgos, Stephane; Benoit, Marc			Choosing the most representative technical management routes within diverse management practices: Application to vineyards in the Loire Valley for environmental and quality assessment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						Cropping system; Partitioning; Association rule; Typology; Viticulture; Life cycle assessment	CROP MANAGEMENT; WINTER-WHEAT; SYSTEM; IMPACTS; DESIGN; FARMS; YIELD; MODEL	Diversity of agricultural systems can be described at different scales in terms of three main types of variables: technical management of cropping systems, farming systems and food supply chains. We focus on the diversity of technical management routes (TMRs), defined as logical successions of technical options (TOs) designed by the farmers. The study, comparison and assessment of this great diversity of complex routes are impossible with classical agronomic experiments or exhaustive assessments such as life cycle assessment (LCA). Hence, the selection of representative cases is necessary. Multidimensional data analysis methods permit the characterization of a diversity of TMRs and the construction of typologies but do not allow the consideration of the specific associations of TOs constituting the various TMRs. The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) to propose a new combined method, "Typ-iti", to classify the field TMRs of farmers, to identify key TO associations and to select the most relevant cases for study; (ii) to test this method on vineyard management diversity using a panel of vineyard fields of Loire Valley producers; and (iii) to discuss the capability of the proposed Typ-iti method for use in the characterization and selection of cases of other agricultural systems at diverse scales. The example developed in this paper is the selection of vineyard management cases for grape LCA combined with grape quality evaluation. The cases were selected to represent the regional diversity of management practices. A detailed on-farm survey of management methods was performed on a diverse range of wine production estates in the Middle Loire Valley. The Typ-iti method was constructed and implemented on the survey database. It combines a multidimensional analysis of qualitative survey data and typology and partitioning (clustering) associated with data mining methods (frequent pattern mining search and association rules). The surveyed sample was partitioned into 5 types of management practices, 2 of which were organic and 3 conventional. The partitioning was driven primarily by choices involving pest management and floor management. Each type was characterized by specific TOs, specific associations of TOs and remarkable TMRs. The cases were chosen on the basis of these 3 parameters. The Typ-iti method can be applied to other crops and at different scales; the only limitation is the availability of precise information on the practices used by farmers in their fields.

The challenges become even larger when considering uncertain data. This paper studies the problem of outlier detection on uncertain data streams. We propose Continuous Uncertain Outlier Detection (CUOD), which can quickly determine the nature of the uncertain elements by pruning to improve the efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a pruning approach Probability Pruning for Continuous Uncertain Outlier Detection (PCUOD) to reduce the detection cost. It is an estimated outlier probability method which can effectively reduce the amount of calculations. The cost of PCUOD incremental algorithm can satisfy the demand of uncertain data streams. Finally, a new method for parameter variable queries to CUOD is proposed, enabling the concurrent execution of different queries. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to perform outlier detection on uncertain data streams which can handle parameter variable queries simultaneously. Our methods are verified using both real data and synthetic data. The results show that they are able to reduce the required storage and running time.

Physicians have traditionally been unable to control who has access to their data or how their data are used. The widespread adoption of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) by physicians will create a larger and more valuable healthcare data market with broad implications for the healthcare system. It is, therefore, important for physicians to understand the evolving healthcare data market and the importance of maintaining ownership of and control over their electronic health data.Recent findingsSeveral entities, including private health insurance companies, federal payers, medical societies, and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing healthcare data to drive reimbursement policies and commercial initiatives.SummaryGiven the critical importance that EHR data will play in multiple aspects of the healthcare industry, it is in physicians' interest to maintain ownership and control of the healthcare data that they generate. It would be prudent for physicians to exercise caution before relinquishing data rights to entities that may sell the data to payers or other customers with whom physicians' interests may not be aligned.

Mapping methods using data mining are investigated and designed to improve the output-based speech quality assessment algorithm. The degraded speech is firstly separated into three classes (unvoiced, voiced and silence), and then the consistency measurement between the degraded speech signal and the pre-trained reference model for each class is calculated and mapped to an objective speech quality score using data mining. Fuzzy Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to generate the artificial reference model trained on perceptual linear predictive (PLP) features. The mean opinion score (MOS) mapping methods including multivariate non-linear regression (MNLR), fuzzy neural network (FNN) and support vector regression (SVR) are designed and compared with the standard ITU-T P.563 method. Experimental results show that the assessment methods with data mining perform better than ITU-T P.563. Moreover, FNN and SVR are more efficient than MNLR, and FNN performs best with 14.50% increase in the correlation coefficient and 32.76% decrease in the root-mean-square MOS error.

J	Zhou, YJ; Hu, GM; Wu, DP				Zhou, Yingjie; Hu, Guangmin; Wu, Dapeng			A data mining system for distributed abnormal event detection in backbone networks	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						distributed correlated abnormal event; anomaly detection; network data mining; unsupervised learning; supervised learning; backbone networks	INTERNET	Detecting distributed abnormal events has become an increasingly significant task for efficient network management and operation. However, it is still challenging to uncover these distributed behaviors in backbone networks because of the voluminous amount of noisy, high-dimensional traffic data. In this paper, we present a novel system for detecting distributed abnormal events in backbone networks. The proposed system emphasizes on detecting distributed correlated abnormal events, which are caused by the same reason. In contrast, existing methods are not able to distinguish correlated abnormal events from the independent abnormal events. In our proposed system, a set of data mining techniques is used for modeling and detecting distributed correlated abnormal events by analyzing the traffic features. Specifically, traffic behavior representation is constructed to define and select traffic features for describing the traffic behaviors of interest, feature clustering is performed to group together similar transformations in each feature, behavioral data mining is employed to discover the most significant patterns in network interactions with respect to typical behavior, and behavior classification is used to expose the behaviors of interest. Experiment results using real traffic data present the effectiveness of our proposed methods for detecting distributed correlated abnormal events in the backbone network.

Microbial genome sequencing in particular has evolved from a research tool into an approach that can be used to characterize foodborne pathogen isolates as part of routine surveillance systems. Genome sequencing efforts will not only improve outbreak detection and source tracking, but will also create large amounts of foodborne pathogen genome sequence data, which will be available for data-mining efforts that could facilitate better source attribution and provide new insights into foodborne pathogen biology and transmission. Although practical uses and application of metagenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data and associated tools are less prominent, these tools are also starting to yield practical food safety solutions.

Profiling of drugs and environmental chemicals for functional impairment of neural crest migration in a novel stem cell-based test battery	ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Test battery-based compound screening; Developmental toxicity testing; hESC-based test system; Neural crest migration assay	IN-VITRO TEST; DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; TEST SYSTEMS; REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; ALTERNATIVE METHODS; TOXCAST CHEMICALS; DENDRITIC GROWTH; DIFFERENTIATION	Developmental toxicity in vitro assays have hitherto been established as stand-alone systems, based on a limited number of toxicants. Within the embryonic stem cell-based novel alternative tests project, we developed a test battery framework that allows inclusion of any developmental toxicity assay and that explores the responses of such test systems to a wide range of drug-like compounds. We selected 28 compounds, including several biologics (e.g., erythropoietin), classical pharmaceuticals (e.g., roflumilast) and also six environmental toxicants. The chemical, toxicological and clinical data of this screen library were compiled. In order to determine a non-cytotoxic concentration range, cytotoxicity data were obtained for all compounds from HEK293 cells and from murine embryonic stem cells. Moreover, an estimate of relevant exposures was provided by literature data mining. To evaluate feasibility of the suggested test framework, we selected a well-characterized assay that evaluates 'migration inhibition of neural crest cells.' Screening at the highest non-cytotoxic concentration resulted in 11 hits (e. g., geldanamycin, abiraterone, gefitinib, chlorpromazine, cyproconazole, arsenite). These were confirmed in concentration-response studies. Subsequent pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that triadimefon exerted its effects at concentrations relevant to the in vivo situation, and also interferon-beta and polybrominated diphenyl ether showed effects within the same order of magnitude of concentrations that may be reached in humans. In conclusion, the test battery framework can identify compounds that disturb processes relevant for human development and therefore may represent developmental toxicants. The open structure of the strategy allows rich information to be generated on both the underlying library, and on any contributing assay.

Ramos, Fernando			Knowledge extraction from large climatological data sets using a genome-wide analysis approach: application to the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							SEASON COLORADO CYCLONES; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; CAUTIONARY NOTE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICROARRAY; PRECIPITATION; EVENTS; EOFS	Today, the volume of data generated in almost all disciplines, particularly in meteorology and climate science, is dramatically increasing. Among the challenges generated by this "data deluge" is the development of efficient knowledge discovery strategies. Here, we show that statistical and computational tools used to analyze large data sets of genome-wide studies can be fruitfully applied to a climatic context. Although not as powerful as some techniques already in use by climatologists, these tools are simple and robust, and can easily be adapted to detect early warning signals for extreme events like droughts or be used to filter large data sets before applying other more advanced and computationally expensive methods. We test this approach in our investigation of the causes of the Amazon droughts of 2005 and 2010. Our results highlight the major role played in these extreme events by the warming of the sea's surface temperature, mainly in the tropical North Atlantic. Our findings are in agreement with several analyses published in the literature. The main message we convey is that free and open-source data mining and visualization techniques routinely used in genetic studies can be useful in helping scientists to extract knowledge from large climatic data sets, particularly in regions of the world that are vulnerable to climate change but where the availability of technical expertise is critically scarce.

At present, data mining and knowledge discovery in electricity meter data suffer from three notable weaknesses: 1) insufficient focus on intelligent data analysis of subgroups (subsets) whose patterns vary significantly from aggregate patterns embodied in an entire dataset; 2) a lack of effort towards generating intuitively understandable and practically applicable knowledge for industrial practitioners to identify such subgroups; and 3) limited knowledge regarding the link between unusual consumption patterns and household consumers' socio-demographic characteristics. This paper addresses these practically important but technically challenging issues by applying subgroup discovery algorithms to a real smart electricity meter dataset. Subgroups whose patterns are unusual and whose sizes are large enough are discovered, and their descriptive and predictive models are generated. Furthermore, to enrich subgroup discovery algorithms, three new-quality measures for real-valued targets are proposed. The comparative studies empirically evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of subgroup discovery on classification accuracy, predictive power, and computational resources. The methodologies and algorithms presented are generic, and therefore applicable to a wider range of data mining problems.

J	Lu, N; Lin, H; Lu, J; Zhang, GQ				Lu, Ning; Lin, Hua; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Guangquan			A Customer Churn Prediction Model in Telecom Industry Using Boosting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Boosting; churn prediction; customer relationship management; digital marketing; logistic regression; telecommunication	DATA MINING APPROACH; MANAGEMENT	With the rapid growth of digital systems and associated information technologies, there is an emerging trend in the global economy to build digital customer relationship management (CRM) systems. This trend is more obvious in the telecommunications industry, where companies become increasingly digitalized. Customer churn prediction is a main feature of in modern telecomcommunication CRM systems. This research conducts a real-world study on customer churn prediction and proposes the use of boosting to enhance a customer churn prediction model. Unlike most research that uses boosting as a method to boost the accuracy of a given basis learner, this paper tries to separate customers into two clusters based on the weight assigned by the boosting algorithm. As a result, a higher risk customer cluster has been identified. Logistic regression is used in this research as a basis learner, and a churn prediction model is built on each cluster, respectively. The result is compared with a single logistic regression model. Experimental evaluation reveals that boosting also provides a good separation of churn data; thus, boosting is suggested for churn prediction analysis.

Currently available algorithms to detect dechallenge have limitations. Hence, there is a need to compare available new methods. To detect dechallenge in Spontaneous Reporting Systems, data-mining algorithms like Naive Bayes and Improved Naive Bayes were applied for comparing the performance of the algorithms in terms of accuracy and error. Analyzing the factors of dechallenge like outcome and disease category will help medical practitioners and pharmaceutical industries to determine the reasons for dechallenge in order to take essential steps toward drug safety. Materials and Methods: Adverse drug reactions of the year 2011 and 2012 were downloaded from the United States Food and Drug Administration's database. Results: The outcome of classification algorithms showed that Improved Naive Bayes algorithm outperformed Naive Bayes with accuracy of 90.11% and error of 9.8% in detecting the dechallenge. Conclusion: Detecting dechallenge for unknown samples are essential for proper prescription. To overcome the issues exposed by Naive Bayes algorithm, Improved Naive Bayes algorithm can be used to detect dechallenge in terms of higher accuracy and minimal error.	[Banu, A.

Examining the Twitter Use of Cancer Patients in Japan	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						communication; co-occurrence; Internet; leukemia; Web 2.0	SOCIAL MEDIA	Background: Twitter is an interactive, real-time media that could prove useful in health care. Tweets from cancer patients could offer insight into the needs of cancer patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to understand cancer patients' social media usage and gain insight into patient needs. Methods: A search was conducted of every publicly available user profile on Twitter in Japan for references to the following: breast cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. We then used an application programming interface and a data mining method to conduct a detailed analysis of the tweets from cancer patients. Results: Twitter user profiles included references to breast cancer (n=313), leukemia (n=158), uterine or cervical cancer (n=134), lung cancer (n=87), colon cancer (n=64), and stomach cancer (n=44). A co-occurrence network is seen for all of these cancers, and each cancer has a unique network conformation. Keywords included words about diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments for almost all cancers. Words related to social activities were extracted for breast cancer. Words related to vaccination and support from public insurance were extracted for uterine or cervical cancer. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that cancer patients share information about their underlying disease, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments, via Twitter. This information could prove useful to health care providers.

The resulting latitudinal pattern in species richness (SR) was asymmetric to the equator, with a peak at 35A degrees N in the Kuroshio area and a gradual decrease to a minimum at similar to 40A degrees S. Shannon's diversity index (H') showed a similar pattern, except that it plateaued between 20A degrees N and 35A degrees S. Regression analyses and structural equation models (SEMs) showed that temperature was the most important explanatory variable, both for SR and H'. The SEM also demonstrated that chlorophyll a concentration and mixed-layer depth were the second most effective variables for SR and H', respectively. On the basis of these results, models were constructed to estimate geographical variation in SR and H'. The estimated SR was high in coastal waters in tropical to subtropical areas, while H' was high at midlatitudes in the open ocean. The present data highlight the importance of the coastal waters of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, but also indicate that a gap still exists in this area, which necessitates further data mining as well as basic research.

Advanced predictive system using artificial intelligence for cleaning of steel coils	IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING			English	Article						Knowledge discovery and data mining; Steel industry; Flat products; Cleaning capability prediction; Pickling line improvement; Multi-agent system	RECOGNITION; BEHAVIOR; STRIP	This paper presents a system based on data mining and statistical modelling tools that permits the prediction of the development of oxide scale defects in high quality flat products after the steel industry's hot strip mill process (HSM), but before the coil becomes processed on the pickling line (PL). The economic impact of the improvement provided by such a system can be valued at several million US dollars per year, because it makes it possible to downgrade materials at an early stage, avoiding additional processes like coating, etc. It also enables the speed of the PL, which is usually seen as a bottleneck in these facilities, to be increased. The learning process of the model presented here is based on automatic surface-inspection systems, as well as processing parameters at the HSM and PL to capture the essentials of the cleaning process itself, and also the main factors in scale production. The system proposed currently which is configured as a multi-agent system, is the first for this particular purpose, although the steel industry uses many other models and systems to predict other properties (e.g., mechanical properties) or the best operating parameters (e.g., forces, temperatures) for processes.

Multiple customers who are auto manufacturers order from a large auto parts supplier. The auto manufacturers provide forecasts for future orders and update them before the due date. The supplier uses these forecasts to plan production in advance. The accuracy of the forecasts varies from customer to customer. We provide a framework to analyze the forecast performance of the customers. There are different complexities in forecasts that are captured from our data set. Daily flow analysis helps to transform data and obtain accuracy ratios of forecasts. Customers are then classified based on their forecast performances. We demonstrate the application of some recent developments in clustering and pattern recognition analysis to performance analysis of customers.

The considered approach is based on the weighted market graph model, which is used for identifying clusters of stocks according to a correlation-based criterion. The proposed techniques provide a new framework for selecting profitable diversified portfolios, which is verified by computational experiments on historical data over the past decade. In addition, the proposed approach can be used as a complementary tool for narrowing down a set of "candidate" stocks for a diversified portfolio, which can potentially be analyzed using other known portfolio selection techniques.

Particularly in large-scale data sets that are error-prone, cliques are overly restrictive and impractical. Quasi-clique detection has been accomplished using heuristic approaches in various applications of graph-based data mining in protein interaction networks, gene co-expression networks, and telecommunication networks. Quasi-cliques are not hereditary, in the sense that every subset of a quasi-clique need not be a quasi-clique. This lack of heredity introduces interesting challenges in the development of exact algorithms to detect maximum cardinality quasi-cliques. The only exact approaches for this problem are limited to two mixed integer programming formulations that were recently proposed in the literature. The main contribution of this article is a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum quasi-clique problem.

It is capable to discover important facts hidden in the data. Literature indicate the current rough set based approaches can't guarantee that classification of a decision table is credible and it is not able to generate robust decision rules when new attributes are incrementally added in. In this study, an incremental attribute oriented rule-extraction algorithm is proposed to solve this deficiency commonly observed in the literature related to decision rule induction. The proposed approach considers incremental attributes based on the alternative rule extraction algorithm (AREA), which was presented for discovering preference-based rules according to the reducts with the maximum of strength index (SI), specifically the case that the desired reducts are not necessarily unique since several reducts could include the same value of SI. Using the AREA, an alternative rule can be defined as the rule which holds identical preference to the original decision rule and may be more attractive to a decision-maker than the original one. Through implementing the proposed approach, it can be effectively operating with new attributes to be added in the database/information systems. It is not required to re-compute the updated data set similar to the first step at the initial stage. The proposed algorithm also excludes these repetitive rules during the solution search stage since most of the rule induction approaches generate the repetitive rules.

The sparse signomial classification and regression model	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Classification; Regression; Signomial function; Linear program; Column generation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TUTORIAL; SYSTEM	Kernel-based methods (KBMs) such as support vector machines (SVMs) are popular data mining tools for solving classification and regression problems. Due to their high prediction accuracy, KBMs have been successfully used in various fields. However, KBMs have three major drawbacks. First, it is not easy to obtain an explicit description of the discrimination (or regression) function in the original input space and to make a variable selection decision in the input space. Second, depending on the magnitude and numeric range of the given data points, the resulting kernel matrices may be ill-conditioned, with the possibility that the learning algorithms will suffer from numerical instability. Although data scaling can generally be applied to deal with this problem and related issues, it may not always be effective. Third, the selection of an appropriate kernel type and its parameters can be a complex undertaking, with the choice greatly affecting the performance of the resulting functions. To overcome these drawbacks, we present here the sparse signomial classification and regression (SSCR) model. SSCR seeks a sparse signomial function by solving a linear program to minimize the weighted sum of the l(1)-norm of the coefficient vector of the function and the l(1)-norm of violation (or loss) caused by the function. SSCR employs the signomial function in the original variables and can therefore explore the nonlinearity in the data. SSCR is also less sensitive to numerical values or numeric ranges of the given data and gives a sparse explicit description of the resulting function in the original input space, which will be useful for the interpretation purpose in terms of which original input variables and/or interaction terms are more meaningful than others. We also present column generation techniques to select important signomial terms in the classification and regression processes and explore a number of theoretical properties of the proposed formulation. Computational studies demonstrate that SSCR is at the very least competitive and can even perform better compared to other widely used learning methods for classification and regression.

Efficient computer experiment-based optimization through variable selection	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Computer experiments; False discovery rate; Large-scale optimization; Regression trees; Variable selection	DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; AIRLINE FLEET ASSIGNMENT; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; DESIGN; ALGORITHMS; MODELS	A computer experiment-based optimization approach employs design of experiments and statistical modeling to represent a complex objective function that can only be evaluated pointwise by running a computer model. In large-scale applications, the number of variables is huge, and direct use of computer experiments would require an exceedingly large experimental design and, consequently, significant computational effort. If a large portion of the variables have little impact on the objective, then there is a need to eliminate these before performing the complete set of computer experiments. This is a variable selection task. The ideal variable selection method for this task should handle unknown nonlinear structure, should be computationally fast, and would be conducted after a small number of computer experiment runs, likely fewer runs (N) than the number of variables (P). Conventional variable selection techniques are based on assumed linear model forms and cannot be applied in this "large P and small N" problem. In this paper, we present a framework that adds a variable selection step prior to computer experiment-based optimization, and we consider data mining methods, using principal components analysis and multiple testing based on false discovery rate, that are appropriate for our variable selection task. An airline fleet assignment case study is used to illustrate our approach.

Our motivating example is rooted in monitoring in a stamping process. A novel approach is proposed and examined in this paper. Our method consists of three stages: (1) A baseline of each class is estimated via convex optimization; (2) An "optimal interval" that maximizes the difference among the baselines is identified; (3) A classifier that is based on the "optimal interval" is constructed. We analyze the implementation strategy and properties of the derived algorithm. The derived classifier is named an interval based classifier (IBC) and can be computed via a low-order-of-complexity algorithm. Comparing to existing state-of-the-art classifiers, we illustrate the advantages of our approach. To showcase its usage in applications, we apply the IBC to a set of tonnage curves from stamping processes, and observed superior performance. This method can help identifying faulty situations in manufacturing. The computational steps of IBC take advantage of operations-research methodology. IBC can serve as a general data mining tool, when the features are based on single intervals.

Electricity price forecasting is necessary for all market participants to optimize their portfolios. In this paper we propose a hybrid method approach for short-term hourly electricity price forecasting. The paper combines statistical techniques for pre-processing of data and a multi-layer (MLP) neural network for forecasting electricity price and price spike detection. Based on statistical analysis, days are arranged into several categories. Similar days are examined by correlation significance of the historical data. Factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including historical price factors, load factors and wind production factors are discussed. A price spike index (CWI) is defined for spike detection and forecasting. Using proposed approach we created several forecasting models of diverse model complexity. The method is validated using the European Energy Exchange (EEX) electricity price data records. Finally, results are discussed with respect to price volatility, with emphasis on the price forecasting accuracy.

Recent studies show how communication capabilities should be supported by artificial intelligence systems capable of automating many of the decisions to be taken by emergency services, thereby adapting the rescue resources to the severity of the accident and reducing assistance time. To improve the overall rescue process, a fast and accurate estimation of the severity of the accident represent a key point to help emergency services better estimate the required resources. This paper proposes a novel intelligent system which is able to automatically detect road accidents, notify them through vehicular networks, and estimate their severity based on the concept of data mining and knowledge inference. Our system considers the most relevant variables that can characterize the severity of the accidents (variables such as the vehicle speed, the type of vehicles involved, the impact speed, and the status of the airbag). Results show that a complete Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, with an adequate selection of relevant features, allows generating estimation models that can predict the severity of new accidents. We develop a prototype of our system based on off-the-shelf devices and validate it at the Applus+ IDIADA Automotive Research Corporation facilities, showing that our system can notably reduce the time needed to alert and deploy emergency services after an accident takes place.

J	Hsieh, SM; Hsu, CC; Ti, YW; Kuo, CJ				Hsieh, Shu-Ming; Hsu, Chiun-Chieh; Ti, Yen-Wu; Kuo, Chi-Jung			Reducing the bottleneck of graph-based data mining by improving the efficiency of labeled graph isomorphism testing	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material						Data mining; Mining methods and algorithm; Isomorphism testing; Graph signature; Search state-space tree	ALGORITHM; SIMILARITY	Due to the complex nature of graph representations, the isomorphism testing between a pair of labeled graphs becomes one of the most time-consuming procedures during the process of graph-based data mining. In order to reduce this bottleneck, in this paper we propose a novel efficient algorithm to perform isomorphism testing of labeled graphs which in general performs less state-space tree searching. The proposed method uses graph signatures as the first-step filter, and it limits the backtracking occurring only between each pair of corresponding vertex classes, based on the proposed data structures and the vertex partition method. We compared the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods to verify its efficiency for several datasets each with different aspects of characteristics. The experimental results show that for irregular graphs, either labeled or unlabeled, the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in efficiency. For graphs with multiple labels but high regularity, the proposed method is still better than the compared methods. The result of this algorithm is directly applicable to those emerging applications related to graph-based data mining which need to perform isomorphism testing of labeled graphs in large databases.

They are extensively metabolized and excreted in urine, but limited human metabolism data are available. As there are no reports on the metabolism of RCS-8, a scheduled phenylacetylindole synthetic cannabinoid with an N-cyclohexylethyl moiety, we investigated metabolism of this new designer drug by human hepatocytes and high resolution MS. Methods: After human hepatocyte incubation with RCS-8, samples were analyzed on a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer with time-of-flight survey scan and information-dependent acquisition triggered product ion scans. Data mining of the accurate mass full scan and product ion spectra employed different data processing algorithms. Results & Conclusion: More than 20 RCS-8 metabolites were identified, products of oxidation, demethylation, and glucuronidation. Major metabolites and targets for analytical methods were hydroxyphenyl RCS-8 glucuronide, a variety of hydroxycyclohexyl-hydroxyphenyl RCS-8 glucuronides, hydroxyphenyl RCS-8, as well as the demethyl-hydroxycyclohexyl RCS-8 glucuronide.

Personalized medicine and gene therapy will confluence the days to come. This review highlights traditional approaches as well as current advancements in the analysis of the gene expression data from cancer perspective. Due to improvements in biometric instrumentation and automation, it has become easier to collect a lot of experimental data in molecular biology. Analysis of such data is extremely important as it leads to knowledge discovery that can be validated by experiments. Previously, the diagnosis of complex genetic diseases has conventionally been done based on the non-molecular characteristics like kind of tumor tissue, pathological characteristics, and clinical phase. The microarray data can be well accounted for high dimensional space and noise. Same were the reasons for ineffective and imprecise results. Several machine learning and data mining techniques are presently applied for identifying cancer using gene expression data. While differences in efficiency do exist, none of the well-established approaches is uniformly superior to others. The quality of algorithm is important, but is not in itself a guarantee of the quality of a specific data analysis.	[Jauhari, Shaurya; Rizvi, S. A.

Given an input string, the system generates the k most likely output strings corresponding to the input string. This paper proposes a novel and probabilistic approach to string transformation, which is both accurate and efficient. The approach includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the model, and an algorithm for generating the top k candidates, whether there is or is not a predefined dictionary. The log linear model is defined as a conditional probability distribution of an output string and a rule set for the transformation conditioned on an input string. The learning method employs maximum likelihood estimation for parameter estimation. The string generation algorithm based on pruning is guaranteed to generate the optimal top k candidates. The proposed method is applied to correction of spelling errors in queries as well as reformulation of queries in web search. Experimental results on large scale data show that the proposed approach is very accurate and efficient improving upon existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency in different settings.

It is observed that correlations may exist among adjacent edges in various probabilistic graphs. As one of the basic mining techniques, graph clustering is widely used in exploratory data analysis, such as data compression, information retrieval, image segmentation, etc. Graph clustering aims to divide data into clusters according to their similarities, and a number of algorithms have been proposed for clustering graphs, such as the pKwikCluster algorithm, spectral clustering, k-path clustering, etc. However, little research has been performed to develop efficient clustering algorithms for probabilistic graphs. Particularly, it becomes more challenging to efficiently cluster probabilistic graphs when correlations are considered. In this paper, we define the problem of clustering correlated probabilistic graphs. To solve the challenging problem, we propose two algorithms, namely the PEEDR and the CPGS clustering algorithm. For each of the proposed algorithms, we develop several pruning techniques to further improve their efficiency. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms and pruning methods through comprehensive experiments.

A new paradigm for serious games: Transmedia learning for more effective training and education	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Transmedia learning; Serious games; Transmedia campaigns; Storytelling; Social media; Data mining; xAPI; MOOC		Serious games present a relatively new approach to training and education for international organizations such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.

In the life sciences, interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving and collaboration are becoming increasingly important in facilitating knowledge discovery and integration. Web 2.0 technologies promise to have a profound impact - enabling reproducibility, aiding in discovery, and accelerating and transforming medical and healthcare research across the healthcare ecosystem. However, knowledge integration and discovery require a consistent foundation upon which to operate. A foundation should be capable of addressing some of the critical issues associated with how research is conducted within the ecosystem today and how it should be conducted for the future. This article will discuss a framework for enhancing collaborative knowledge discovery across the medical and healthcare research ecosystem. A framework that could serve as a foundation upon which ecosystem stakeholders can enhance the way data, information and knowledge is created, shared and used to accelerate the translation of knowledge from one area of the ecosystem to another.

For local bias of M-type star spectral characteristic lines contained in subspace, a late-type star spectra outlier data mining system is given in the present paper. Firstly, for the sample of M stellar spectral characteristic lines indices, its distribution characteristics in attribute spaces are measured by using the sparse factor and sparsity coefficient, and then this sample is discretized and dimension-reduced to the spectral subspace. Secondly, local outlier subspaces are extracted by PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm and identified. Additionally, the effects of sparse coefficient and sparse factor on the number of outliers are discussed by experiments on the sample of SDSS M stellar spectral line index set, and the outliers are compared with spectral type provided by SDSS. In this way, the feasibility and value of this system were validated.

An information technology platform for nursing records in medical institutions was then quickly established, which improved nursing information systems and electronic databases. The purpose of the present study was to explore the usability of the data mining techniques to enhance completeness and ensure consistency of nursing records in the database system. First, the study used a Chinese word-segmenting system on common and special terms often used by the nursing staff. We also used text-mining techniques to collect keywords and create a keyword lexicon. We then used an association rule and artificial neural network to measure the correlation and forecasting capability for keywords. Finally, nursing staff members were provided with an on-screen pop-up menu to use when establishing nursing records. Our study found that by using mining techniques we were able to create a powerful keyword lexicon and establish a forecasting model for nursing diagnoses, ensuring the consistency of nursing terminology and improving the nursing staff's work efficiency and productivity.

These data can be used in the assessment of students, instructors and the processes themselves. However, although this wealth of data exists, it is still difficult for those who teach (and interested stakeholders) to verify a hypothesis, extract conclusions, or make decisions based on the facts or situations that are discovered. This paper introduces an educational data analysis model based on visual analytics, learning analytics and academic analytics and using a software tool that allows performing confirmatory and exploratory data analysis through interaction with the information gathered from a typical Learning Management System. The main goal is to enable the discovery of knowledge on the specific learning process that, in turn, will permit its improvement.

The time-series data of stock price and the derived moving average, a class of well-known technical indicators, are used for the construction of complex episode events and rules. Our objective is to devise a profitable episode-based investment model to mine associated events in the stock market. Using Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX), the empirical results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the benchmark in terms of cumulative total returns. We also show that the level of the precision by our model is close to 60%, which is better than random guessing. Based upon the results obtained, we expect this novel episode-based methodology will advance the research in data mining for computational finance and provide an alternative to stock investment in practice.

Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory, a member of unsupervised neural networks, clusters data effectively because of applying operator AND of Fuzzy Logic. In previous studies, learning from data was ineffective when the surface of data is higher than the surface of weight vector of categories. In this paper, we propose an improved learning rule to learn from data better. In the proposed rule, the weights of wining category are decreased to adapt to each input. Each input shows the effect for categories by a learning parameter. The learning parameter is adjusted until the best stable state and performance of clustering results are achieved. We have conducted experiments on 10 benchmark datasets to prove the effectiveness of the proposed rule. The experiment results showed that Fuzzy ART learned with the improved rule (IFART-Improved Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory) performs better than existing models in complex small datasets.

In this paper, a knowledge engineering framework is proposed for data mining to identify key safety factors from a large number of consumer product safety cases. Data mining in the framework is performed in three steps. The first step is to collect consumer product safety cases, a case can be semistructured or unstructured, and cases can be collected either manually or automatically by a web spider crawling certain websites. The second step is to extract all safety factors from a number of consumer product safety cases. A new method based on linear chain conditional random field is developed to extract safety factors. The effectiveness of the method has been validated on product cases. The third step is to identify a set of key factors from all safety factors by knowledge reasoning. To illustrate the process of knowledge reasoning, a set of 3192 safety cases of electric products with electric shock accidents is chosen as the case study; a Bayesian network based model is developed to retrieve key safety factors relating to electric shock accidents. The performance of the reasoning model has been verified by a combination of experts' evaluation and experiments, and it has shown the proposed reasoning model can help identify key safety factors of electric shock accidents successfully. Overall, the proposed framework is capable of identifying key safety factors from a large number of consumer product safety cases. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Exploration of Compiler Optimization Sequences Using Clustering-Based Selection	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						Performance; Measurements; Algorithms; Phase-ordering problem; design space exploration; clustering; compilers	COMPILATION SEQUENCES	Due to the large number of optimizations provided in modern compilers and to compiler optimization specific opportunities, a Design Space Exploration (DSE) is necessary to search for the best sequence of compiler optimizations for a given code fragment (e. g., function). As this exploration is a complex and time consuming task, in this paper we present DSE strategies to select optimization sequences to both improve the performance of each function and reduce the exploration time. The DSE is based on a clustering approach which groups functions with similarities and then explore the reduced search space provided by the optimizations previously suggested for the functions in each group. The identification of similarities between functions uses a data mining method which is applied to a symbolic code representation of the source code. The DSE process uses the reduced set identified by clustering in two ways: as the design space or as the initial configuration. In both ways, the adoption of a pre-selection based on clustering allows the use of simple and fast DSE algorithms. Our experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach address the exploration of compiler optimization sequences considering 49 compilation passes and targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, and were performed aiming performance improvements for 41 functions. Experimental results reveal that the use of our new clustering-based DSE approach achieved a significant reduction on the total exploration time of the search space (18 x over a Genetic Algorithm approach for DSE) at the same time that important performance speedups (43% over the baseline) were obtained by the optimized codes.

This approach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app in a "stand-alone" fashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time to distill useful information. We discuss the desired properties of risk signals and relative risk scores for Android apps in order to generate another metric that users can utilize when choosing apps. We present a wide range of techniques to generate both risk signals and risk scores that are based on heuristics as well as principled machine learning techniques. Experimental results conducted using real-world data sets show that these methods can effectively identify malware as very risky, are simple to understand, and easy to use.

J	Akbar, RJ; Omori, T; Maruyama, K				Akbar, Rizky Januar; Omori, Takayuki; Maruyama, Katsuhisa			Mining API Usage Patterns by Applying Method Categorization to Improve Code Completion	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						sequential pattern mining; software repositories; recommendation; code completion	SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	Developers often face difficulties while using APIs. API usage patterns can aid them in using APIs efficiently, which are extracted from source code stored in software repositories. Previous approaches have mined repositories to extract API usage patterns by simply applying data mining techniques to the collection of method invocations of API objects. in these approaches, respective functional roles of invoked methods within API objects are ignored. The functional role represents what type of purpose each method actually achieves, and a method has a specific predefined order of invocation in accordance with its role. Therefore, the simple application of conventional mining techniques fails to produce API usage patterns that are helpful for code completion. This paper proposes an improved approach that extracts API usage patterns at a higher abstraction level rather than directly mining the actual method invocations. It embraces a multilevel sequential mining technique and uses categorization of method invocations based on their functional roles. We have implemented a mining tool and an extended Eclipse's code completion facility with extracted API usage patterns. Evaluation results of this tool show that our approach improves existing code completion.

VOCALIZATION DATA MINING FOR ESTIMATING SWINE STRESS CONDITIONS	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA			English	Article						sound intensity; sound attributes; animal welfare	DOMESTIC PIGS; WELFARE	This study aimed to identify differences in swine vocalization pattern according to animal gender and different stress conditions. A total of 150 barrow males and 150 females (Dalland (R) genetic strain), aged 100 days, were used in the experiment. Pigs were exposed to different stressful situations: thirst (no access to water), hunger (no access to food), and thermal stress (THI exceeding 74). For the control treatment, animals were kept under a comfort situation (animals with full access to food and water, with environmental THI lower than 70). Acoustic signals were recorded every 30 minutes, totaling six samples for each stress situation. Afterwards, the audios were analyzed by Praat (R) 5.1.19 software, generating a sound spectrum. For determination of stress conditions, data were processed by WEKA (R) 3.5 software, using the decision tree algorithm C4.5, known as J48 in the software environment, considering cross-validation with samples of 10% (10-fold cross-validation). According to the Decision Tree, the acoustic most important attribute for the classification of stress conditions was sound Intensity (root node). It was not possible to identify, using the tested attributes, the animal gender by vocal register. A decision tree was generated for recognition of situations of swine hunger, thirst, and heat stress from records of sound intensity, Pitch frequency, and Formant 1.

DECISION TREE FOR CLASSIFICATION OF SOYBEAN RUST OCCURENCE IN COMMERCIAL CROPS BASED ON WEATHER VARIABLES	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA			Portuguese	Article						Phakopsora pachyrhizi; data mining; plant disease forecast; epidemiology; decision support systems	PHAKOPSORA-PACHYRHIZI; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EPIDEMICS; TEMPERATURE; MODELS; GERMINATION; INFECTION; RAINFALL	Soybean rust is the most aggressive soybean disease in Brazil. Despite its epidemiology is known, there are few studies about factors that cause it based on field data. This paper aimed to report influence of weather variables on rust occurrence using the decision tree technique. The models were developed based on disease detection dataset during harvests (2007/08 to 2010/11), temperature and rainfall variables at varied time windows prior to disease detection. For each disease "occurrence" record, a corresponding "non-occurrence" was generated based on the assumption that disease was not present at the thirtieth day prior to the report date, due to unfavorable weather conditions. The training set for modeling consisted of 45 rainfall and temperature variables and 12,591 records. The chosen predictive model resulted in a decision tree with approximately 78% of accuracy and 108 rules, determined by cross-validation. The interpreted model, with 28 rules, considered the temperature variables as more important, of which temperatures below 15 degrees C and above 30 degrees C were related to events of non-occurrence, while temperatures within the favorable range have been associated with events of occurrence, showing consistency with the literature.

PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS TO PREDICT WATER RETENTION FOR SOILS OF THE HUMID TROPICS: A REVIEW	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO			English	Review						physical soil properties; soil hydraulic properties; tropical soils; data-mining techniques	SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DRIVEN MODELING TECHNIQUES; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR TECHNIQUE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BULK-DENSITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FRACTAL FRAGMENTATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS	Over the past three decades, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been widely used by soil scientists to estimate soils properties in temperate regions in response to the lack of soil data for these regions. Several authors indicated that little effort has been dedicated to the prediction of soil properties in the humid tropics, where the need for soil property information is of even greater priority. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date repository of past and recently published articles as well as papers from proceedings of events dealing with water-retention PTFs for soils of the humid tropics. Of the 35 publications found in the literature on PTFs for prediction of water retention of soils of the humid tropics, 91 % of the PTFs are based on an empirical approach, and only 9 % are based on a semi-physical approach. Of the empirical PTFs, 97 % are continuous, and 3 % (one) is a class PTF; of the empirical PTFs, 97 % are based on multiple linear and polynomial regression of nth order techniques, and 3 % (one) is based on the k-Nearest Neighbor approach; 84 % of the continuous PTFs are point-based, and 16 % are parameter-based; 97 % of the continuous PTFs are equation-based PTFs, and 3 % (one) is based on pattern recognition. Additionally, it was found that 26 % of the tropical water-retention PTFs were developed for soils in Brazil, 26 % for soils in India, 11 % for soils in other countries in America, and 11 % for soils in other countries in Africa.

We are in the era of the '-omics', wherein an individual's genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome can be scrutinized to the finest resolution to paint a personalized biochemical fingerprint that enables tailored treatments, prognoses, risk factors, etc. Digitization of this information parlays into 'big data' informatics-driven evidence-based medical practice. While individualized patient management is a key beneficiary of next-generation medical informatics, this data also harbors a wealth of novel therapeutic discoveries waiting to be uncovered. 'Big data' informatics allows for networks-driven systems pharmacodynamics whereby drug information can be coupled to cellular-and organ-level physiology for determining whole-body outcomes. Patient '-omics' data can be integrated for ontology-based data-mining for the discovery of new biological associations and drug targets. Here we highlight the potential of 'big data' informatics for clinical pharmacology.

A Multisite Survey To Identify the Scale of the 1,4-Dioxane Problem at Contaminated Groundwater Sites	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article							BIODEGRADATION; TRICHLOROETHYLENE; OXIDATION; BACTERIA; KINETICS	1,4-Dioxane (dioxane) is an emerging groundwater contaminant that has significant regulatory implications and potential remediation costs, but our current understanding of its occurrence and behavior is limited. This study used intensive data mining to identify and evaluate >2000 sites in California where groundwater has been impacted by chlorinated solvents and/or dioxane. Dioxane was detected at 194 of these sites, with 95% containing one or more chlorinated solvents. Dioxane frequently co-occurs with 1,1,1-trichloroethene (1,1,1-TCA) (76% of the study sites), but despite this, no dioxane analyses were conducted at 332 (67%) of the sites where 1,1,1-TCA was detected. At sites where dioxane has been identified, plumes are dilute but not large (median maximal concentration of 365 mu g/L; median plume length of 269 m) and have been delineated to a similar extent as typically co-occurring chlorinated solvents. Furthermore, at sites where dioxane and chlorinated solvents co-occur, dioxane plumes are frequently shorter than the chlorinated solvent plumes (62%). The results suggest that dioxane has not migrated beyond chlorinated solvent plumes and existing monitoring networks at the majority of sites, and that the primary risk is the large number of sites where dioxane is likely to be present but has yet to be identified.

J	Cheng, KH; Hou, HT; Wu, SY				Cheng, Kun-Hung; Hou, Huei-Tse; Wu, Sheng-Yi			Exploring students' emotional responses and participation in an online peer assessment activity: a case study	INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						emotional response; peer assessment; learning process; behavioural pattern	SELF-ASSESSMENT MANNEQUIN; MULTISOURCE FEEDBACK; BEHAVIORAL-PATTERNS; SCIENCE ACTIVITIES; HIGHER-EDUCATION; DISCUSSIONS; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; WORK	In the social interactions among individuals of learning communities, including those individuals engaged in peer assessment activities, emotion may be a key factor in learning. However, research regarding the emotional response of learners in online peer assessment activities is relatively scarce. Detecting learners' emotion when they make comments and responses to peers may be helpful to better understand their learning and participation behaviours. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the emotional responses and participation of university students in online peer assessment. The self-assessment manikin (SAM) (Lang, P.J. (1985). The cognitive psychophysiology of emotion: Fear and anxiety, In A.H. Tuma & J.D. Maser (Eds.), Anxiety and the anxiety disorder (pp. 131-170). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.) measurement was integrated into the online peer assessment system to measure learners' emotional responses, and a cluster analysis was implemented to identify various features of the different groups. The results show that response behaviours may reflect a learner's participation and status of emotional response during an online peer assessment process. Using cluster analysis, the groups were divided into three clusters; each cluster's representation of emotional response patterns was then analysed and discussed. Finally, this study proposed technical mechanisms in online peer assessment systems (i.e. data mining or RSS feeds) for improving learners' participation and supporting teachers or researchers to intervene to provide relevant assistance and guidance when necessary.

Objective Definition of Rosette Shape Variation Using a Combined Computer Vision and Data Mining Approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; LEAF GROWTH; MODEL-PLANT; ARCHITECTURE; GROWSCREEN; ACCESSIONS; PLATFORM; TRAITS; CROPS	Computer-vision based measurements of phenotypic variation have implications for crop improvement and food security because they are intrinsically objective. It should be possible therefore to use such approaches to select robust genotypes. However, plants are morphologically complex and identification of meaningful traits from automatically acquired image data is not straightforward. Bespoke algorithms can be designed to capture and/or quantitate specific features but this approach is inflexible and is not generally applicable to a wide range of traits. In this paper, we have used industry-standard computer vision techniques to extract a wide range of features from images of genetically diverse Arabidopsis rosettes growing under non-stimulated conditions, and then used statistical analysis to identify those features that provide good discrimination between ecotypes. This analysis indicates that almost all the observed shape variation can be described by 5 principal components. We describe an easily implemented pipeline including image segmentation, feature extraction and statistical analysis. This pipeline provides a cost-effective and inherently scalable method to parameterise and analyse variation in rosette shape. The acquisition of images does not require any specialised equipment and the computer routines for image processing and data analysis have been implemented using open source software. Source code for data analysis is written using the R package. The equations to calculate image descriptors have been also provided.

Aim: The aim of the study was to develop a data analysis strategy capable of discovering the genetic background of radiosensitivity in the case of small sample size studies. Results: Among many indirect measures of radiosensitivity known, the level of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations was used in the study. Mathematical modelling allowed the transformation of the yield-time curve of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations into the exponential curve with limited number of parameters, while Gaussian mixture models applied to the distributions of these parameters provided the criteria for mouse strain classification. A detailed comparative analysis of genotypes between the obtained subpopulations of mice followed by functional validation provided a set of candidate polymorphisms that might be related to radiosensitivity. Among 1857 candidate relevant SNPs, that cluster in 28 genes, eight SNPs were detected nonsynonymous (nsSNP) on protein function. Two of them, rs48840878 (gene Msh3) and rs5144199 (gene Cc2d2a), were predicted as having increased probability of a deleterious effect. Additionally, rs48840878 is capable of disordering phosphorylation with 14 PKs. In silico analysis of candidate relevant SNP similarity score distribution among 60 CGD mouse strains allowed for the identification of SEA/GnJ and ZALENDE/EiJ mouse strains (95.26% and 86.53% genetic consistency respectively) as the most similar to radiosensitive subpopulation Conclusions: A complete step-by-step strategy for seeking the genetic signature of radiosensitivity in the case of small sample size studies conducted on mouse models was proposed. It is shown that the strategy, which is a combination of mathematical modelling, statistical analysis and data mining methodology, allows for the discovery of candidate polymorphisms which might be responsible for radiosensitivity phenomena.

Most of the current approaches address this problem by using consensus models that operate at the prediction level. We explore the possibility to directly combine these sources at the knowledge level, with the aim to harvest potentially increased synergy at an earlier stage. Our goal is to design a general methodology to facilitate knowledge discovery and produce accurate and interpretable models. Results: To combine models at the knowledge level, we propose to decouple the learning phase from the knowledge application phase using a pivot representation (lingua franca) based on the concept of hypothesis. A hypothesis is a simple and interpretable knowledge unit. Regardless of its origin, knowledge is broken down into a collection of hypotheses. These hypotheses are subsequently organised into hierarchical network. This unification permits to combine different sources of knowledge into a common formalised framework. The approach allows us to create a synergistic system between different forms of knowledge and new algorithms can be applied to leverage this unified model. This first article focuses on the general principle of the Self Organising Hypothesis Network (SOHN) approach in the context of binary classification problems along with an illustrative application to the prediction of mutagenicity. Conclusion: It is possible to represent knowledge in the unified form of a hypothesis network allowing interpretable predictions with performances comparable to mainstream machine learning techniques. This new approach offers the potential to combine knowledge from different sources into a common framework in which high level reasoning and meta-learning can be applied; these latter perspectives will be explored in future work.

Differential privacy offers provable privacy against attackers who have auxiliary information, and can be applied to data mining models (for example, logistic regression). However, differentially private methods sometimes introduce too much noise and make outputs less useful. Given available public data in medical research (e. g. from patients who sign open-consent agreements), we can design algorithms that use both public and private data sets to decrease the amount of noise that is introduced. Methodology: In this paper, we modify the update step in Newton-Raphson method to propose a differentially private distributed logistic regression model based on both public and private data. Experiments and results: We try our algorithm on three different data sets, and show its advantage over: (1) a logistic regression model based solely on public data, and (2) a differentially private distributed logistic regression model based on private data under various scenarios. Conclusion: Logistic regression models built with our new algorithm based on both private and public datasets demonstrate better utility than models that trained on private or public datasets alone without sacrificing the rigorous privacy guarantee.

J	Jones, GRD				Jones, Graham Ross Dallas			Validating common reference intervals in routine laboratories	CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Common reference intervals; Assay quality standards; Population result variation		Common reference intervals for numerical pathology tests have been proposed for many years as an improvement over the common situation where individual laboratories establish or select and validate their own intervals. However it is important that any intervals that are developed for common use are themselves validated for use in individual laboratories. There are three main aspects to consider, the appropriateness of the interval, methodological factors and population factors. Techniques for assessing method biases are reasonably straightforward with the use of shared samples and appropriate external quality assurance schemes. Validating the local population, which also encompasses the laboratory's method, can be done using a number of healthy subjects, the more the better, or by various "data mining" techniques using the results of tests performed on routine patients. In any of these methods there is the need to consider the selection of subjects, the statistical approach and the acceptance criteria. Only if a proposed common reference interval can be shown to be appropriate in routine laboratories can it become widely adopted and become truly "common". (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Adaptive algorithms; Data mining; Decision support systems; Classification algorithms; Industry applications; Labelling	MANAGEMENT	Customer profiles are, by definition, made up of factual and transactional data. It is often the case that due to reasons such as high cost of data acquisition and/or protection, only the transactional data are available for data mining operations. Transactional data, however, tend to be highly sparse and skewed due to a large proportion of customers engaging in very few transactions. This can result in a bias in the prediction accuracy of classifiers built using them. The problem is even more so when identifying and classifying changing customer profiles whose classification may change either due to a concept drift or due to a change in buying behaviour. This paper presents a comparative investigation of 4 approaches for classifying dynamic customer profiles built using evolving transactional data over time. The changing class values of the customer profiles were analysed together with the challenging problem of deciding whether to change the class label or adapt the classifier. The results from the experiments we conducted on a highly sparse and skewed real-world transactional data show that adapting the classifiers leads to more stable classification of customer profiles in the shorter time windows; while relabelling the changed customer profile classes leads to more accurate and stable classification in the longer time windows.

We identified a novel function for lansoprazole, as an inducer of anti-oxidative stress responses in the liver. Gastric administration of lansoprazole (10-100 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats produced a dose-dependent increase in hepatic mRNA levels of nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, - like 2 (Nrf2), a redox-sensitive transcription factor, at 3 h and Nrf2 immunoreactivity (IR) in whole hepatic lysates at 6 h. Conversely, the levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), which sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm under un-stimulated conditions, were unchanged. Translocation of Nrf2 into the nuclei of hepatocytes was observed using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Expression of mRNAs for Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and phase II enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD (P) H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (Nqo1), glutathione S-transferase A2 (Gsta2), UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A6 (Ugt1a6), were dose-dependently up-regulated at 3 h. Furthermore, the levels of HO-1 IR were dose-dependently increased in hepatocytes at 6 h. Subcutaneous administration of lansoprazole (30 mg/kg/day) for 7 successive days resulted in up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 IR in hepatocytes and up-regulation of HO-1 IR in the liver. Pretreatment with lansoprazole attenuated thioacetamide (500 mg/kg)-induced acute hepatic damage via both HO-1-dependent and -independent pathways. Up-stream networks related to Nrf2 expression were investigated using microarray analysis, followed by data mining with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Up-regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) pathway was associated with up-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA. In conclusion, lansoprazole might have an alternative indication in the prevention and treatment of oxidative hepatic damage through the induction of both phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing systems, i.e. the AhR/Cyp1a1/Nrf2 pathway in hepatocytes.

Therefore, improvements to model selection are beneficial. Results: Forty-nine human tumor xenografts at in vivo passages 1, 4 and 10 were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis yielding a dataset of 823 Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. To illustrate mining strategies supporting therapeutic studies, transcript expression was determined: 1) relative to other models, 2) with successive in vivo passage, and 3) during the in vitro to in vivo transition. Ranking models according to relative transcript expression in vivo has the potential to improve initial model selection. For example, combining p53 tumor expression data with mutational status could guide selection of tumors for therapeutic studies of agents where p53 status purportedly affects efficacy (e.g., MK-1775). The utility of monitoring changes in gene expression with extended in vivo tumor passages was illustrated by focused studies of drug resistance mediators and receptor tyrosine kinases. Noteworthy observations included a significant decline in HCT-15 colon xenograft ABCB1 transporter expression and increased expression of the kinase KIT in A549 with serial passage. These trends predict sensitivity to agents such as paclitaxel (ABCB1 substrate) and imatinib (c-KIT inhibitor) would be altered with extended passage. Given that gene expression results indicated some models undergo profound changes with in vivo passage, a general metric of stability was generated so models could be ranked accordingly. Lastly, changes occurring during transition from in vitro to in vivo growth may have important consequences for therapeutic studies since targets identified in vitro could be over-or under-represented when tumor cells adapt to in vivo growth. A comprehensive list of mouse transcripts capable of cross-hybridizing with human probe sets on the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array was generated. Removal of the murine artifacts followed by pairwise analysis of in vitro cells with respective passage 1 xenografts and GO analysis illustrates the complex interplay that each model has with the host microenvironment. Conclusions: This study provides strategies to aid selection of xenograft models for therapeutic studies. These data highlight the dynamic nature of xenograft models and emphasize the importance of maintaining passage consistency throughout experiments.

IWS is forming a database, derived from archived ionospheric wave records to assist the ionosphere and Space Weather research, and to answer the following questions: How can the data of earlier ionospheric missions be reprocessed with current algorithms to gain more profitable results? How could the scientific community be provided with a new insight on wave processes that take place in the ionosphere? The answer is a specific and unique data mining service accessing a collection of topical catalogs that characterize a huge number of recorded occurrences of Whistler-like Electromagnetic Wave Phenomena, Atmosphere Gravity Waves, and Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances. IWS online service (http://popdat.cbk.waw.pl) offers end users to query optional set of predefined wave phenomena, their detailed characteristics. These were collected by target specific event detection algorithms in selected satellite records during database buildup phase. Result of performed wave processing thus represents useful information on statistical or comparative investigations of wave types, listed in a detailed catalog of ionospheric wave phenomena. The IWS provides wave event characteristics, extracted by specific software systems from data records of the selected satellite missions. The end-user can access targets by making specific searches and use statistical modules within the service in their field of interest. Therefore the IWS opens a new way in ionosphere and Space Weather research.

Cytochrome P450 site of metabolism prediction from 2D topological fingerprints using GPU accelerated probabilistic classifiers	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Cytochrome P450; Metabolism; Probabilistic; Classification; GPU; CUDA; 2D	DRUG-METABOLISM; XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM; ACTIVATION-ENERGIES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RS-PREDICTOR; TOOL; REGIOSELECTIVITY; ALGORITHM; SMARTCYP; ENZYMES	Background: The prediction of sites and products of metabolism in xenobiotic compounds is key to the development of new chemical entities, where screening potential metabolites for toxicity or unwanted side-effects is of crucial importance. In this work 2D topological fingerprints are used to encode atomic sites and three probabilistic machine learning methods are applied: Parzen-Rosenblatt Window (PRW), Naive Bayesian (NB) and a novel approach called RASCAL (Random Attribute Subsampling Classification ALgorithm). These are implemented by randomly subsampling descriptor space to alleviate the problem often suffered by data mining methods of having to exactly match fingerprints, and in the case of PRW by measuring a distance between feature vectors rather than exact matching. The classifiers have been implemented in CUDA/C++ to exploit the parallel architecture of graphical processing units (GPUs) and is freely available in a public repository. Results: It is shown that for PRW a SoM (Site of Metabolism) is identified in the top two predictions for 85%, 91% and 88% of the CYP 3A4, 2D6 and 2C9 data sets respectively, with RASCAL giving similar performance of 83%, 91% and 88%, respectively. These results put PRW and RASCAL performance ahead of NB which gave a much lower classification performance of 51%, 73% and 74%, respectively. Conclusions: 2D topological fingerprints calculated to a bond depth of 4-6 contain sufficient information to allow the identification of SoMs using classifiers based on relatively small data sets. Thus, the machine learning methods outlined in this paper are conceptually simpler and more efficient than other methods tested and the use of simple topological descriptors derived from 2D structure give results competitive with other approaches using more expensive quantum chemical descriptors. The descriptor space subsampling approach and ensemble methodology allow the methods to be applied to molecules more distant from the training data where data mining would be more likely to fail due to the lack of common fingerprints. The RASCAL algorithm is shown to give equivalent classification performance to PRW but at lower computational expense allowing it to be applied more efficiently in the ensemble scheme.

Methods: The selection cascade used for the triaging of hits from the chemical library started with a robust thre-estep in vitro assay followed by an in silico analysis of the resulting confirmed hits. Upon reaching the predefined requirements for selectivity and potency, the set of hits was subjected to computational analysis to assess chemical properties and diversity. Furthermore, known marketed anti-malarial drugs were co-clustered acting as 'signposts' in the chemical space defined by the hits. Then, in cerebro evaluation of the chemical structures was performed to identify scaffolds that currently are or have been the focus of anti-malarial medicinal chemistry programmes. Next, prioritization according to relaxed physicochemical parameters took place, along with the search for structural analogues. Ultimately, synthesis of novel chemotypes with desired properties was performed and the resulting compounds were subsequently retested in a P. falciparum growth inhibition assay. Results: This screening campaign led to a 1.25% primary hit rate, which decreased to 0.77% upon confirmatory repeat screening. With the predefined potency (EC50 < 1 mu M) and selectivity (SI > 10) criteria, 178 compounds progressed to the next steps where chemical diversity, physicochemical properties and novelty assessment were taken into account. This resulted in the selection of 15 distinct chemical series. Conclusion: A selection cascade was applied to prioritize hits resulting from the screening of a medium-sized chemical library against blood-stage P. falciparum. Emphasis was placed on chemical novelty whereby computational clustering, data mining of known anti-malarial chemotypes and the application of relaxed physicochemical filters, were key to the process. This led to the selection of 15 chemical series from which ten confirmed their activity when newly synthesized sample were tested.

To detect such weak associations, one needs a study with a very large sample size (the number of subjects, n). The n of a study can be increased but unfortunately only to an extent. Here, we propose a novel method which hinges on increasing sample size in a different direction-the total number of variables (p). We construct a p-based `multiple perturbation test', and conduct power calculations and computer simulations to show that it can achieve a very high power to detect weak associations when p can be made very large. As a demonstration, we apply the method to analyze a genome-wide association study on age-related macular degeneration and identify two novel genetic variants that are significantly associated with the disease. The p-based method may set a stage for a new paradigm of statistical tests.

This paper focuses on gray-sheep users problem responsible for the increased error rate in collaborative filtering based recommender systems. This paper makes the following contributions: we show that (1) the presence of gray-sheep users can affect the performance - accuracy and coverage - of the collaborative filtering based algorithms, depending on the data sparsity and distribution; (2) gray-sheep users can be identified using clustering algorithms in offline fashion, where the similarity threshold to isolate these users from the rest of community can be found empirically. We propose various improved centroid selection approaches and distance measures for the K-means clustering algorithm; (3) content-based profile of gray-sheep users can be used for making accurate recommendations. We offer a hybrid recommendation algorithm to make reliable recommendations for gray-sheep users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a formal solution for gray-sheep users problem. By extensive experimental results on two different datasets (MovieLens and community of movie fans in the FilmTrust website), we showed that the proposed approach reduces the recommendation error rate for the gray-sheep users while maintaining reasonable computational performance.

Clustering and classification of time series has the potential to analyze large volumes of data. Most of the traditional time series clustering and classification algorithms deal only with univariate time series data. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised learning algorithm for bivariate time series. The initial clusters are found using K-means algorithm and the model parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. The learning algorithm is developed by utilizing component maximum likelihood and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated using real time data collected from a pollution centre. A comparative study of the proposed algorithm is made with the existing data mining algorithm that uses univariate autoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)) model. It is observed that the proposed algorithm out performs the existing algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On-shelf utility mining with negative item values	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Utility mining; On-shelf utility mining; High on-shelf utility itemset; Negative profit	ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; DATABASES	On-shelf utility mining has recently received interest in the data mining field due to its practical considerations. On-shelf utility mining considers not only profits and quantities of items in transactions but also their on-shelf time periods in stores. Profit values of items in traditional on-shelf utility mining are considered as being positive. However, in real-world applications, items may be associated with negative profit values. This paper proposes an efficient three-scan mining approach to efficiently find high on-shelf utility itemsets with negative profit values from temporal databases. In particular, an effective itemset generation method is developed to avoid generating a large number of redundant candidates and to effectively reduce the number of data scans in mining. Experimental results for several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach has good performance in pruning effectiveness and execution efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a distributed, scalable and robust layered overlay (L-overlay) to index and manage multidimensional data in a dynamic P2P network. The proposed method distinguishes between the data and peer layers, with efficient mapping between the two. The data is organized such that semantically similar data objects are accessed hastily. Grid and tree structures are proposed for the peer layer. As application examples of L-overlay in query processing and data mining, k-nearest neighbors query processing and distributed Na < ve Bayes classification algorithms, are proposed. We show the effectiveness of our scheme in static and dynamic environments using simulation. L-overlay is shown to be more efficient than SSW, an available semantic overly, in terms of maintenance and query processing costs.

Density-based clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and OPTICS are one kind of widely used clustering algorithms. As there is an increasing trend of applications to deal with vast amounts of data, clustering such big data is a challenging problem. Recently, parallelizing clustering algorithms on a large cluster of commodity machines using the MapReduce framework have received a lot of attention. In this paper, we first propose the new density-based clustering algorithm, called DBCURE, which is robust to find clusters with varying densities and suitable for parallelizing the algorithm with MapReduce. We next develop DBCURE-MR, which is a parallelized DBCURE using MapReduce. While traditional density-based algorithms find each cluster one by one, our DBCURE-MR finds several clusters together in parallel. We prove that both DBCURE and DBCURE-MR find the clusters correctly based on the definition of density-based clusters. Our experimental results with various data sets confirm that DBCURE-MR finds clusters efficiently without being sensitive to the clusters with varying densities and scales up well with the MapReduce framework.

Production of high quality fruits and monitoring postharvest changes during storage and transport are thus primary concerns for exporters to ensure the premium value of fresh mango fruit after distribution. This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of Random Forests (RF) for estimating the internal qualities of mango based on peel colour. Two cultivars, namely Nam Dokmai and Irwin, having different fruit properties and grown in intensively managed orchards in Thailand and Japan, respectively, were used in this study. Postharvest changes in peel colour and fruit quality were observed under three storage conditions with respect to temperature. RF models were applied to establish a relationship between peel colour and fruit quality, and then tested the applicability based on model accuracy and variable importance computed by the RF. Specifically, this work demonstrates how the variable importance can be used to interpret the model results. The high accuracy and the information retrieved by the RF models suggest the applicability and practicality as a non-destructive assessment method for the quality of fresh mango fruit.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computer Vision Techniques were conducted on hams throughout their processing. Physico-chemical parameters were also measured in these products. Information from these analyses was integrated in a database. First, deductive techniques of data mining were applied to these data. Multiple linear regression allows for the estimation of information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Computer Vision Techniques and physico-chemical analysis. This enables the completion of the initial database. Then, predictive techniques of data mining were applied. Both, multiple linear regression and isotonic regression achieved the prediction of weight, moisture and lipid content of hams as a function of features obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computer Vision Techniques. Thus, data mining, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computer Vision Techniques could be used to estimate the quality traits of Iberian hams. This allows for the improvement of the process control without destroying any piece. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The raw mixed anuran vocalization samples are first filtered by noise removal, high frequency compensation, and discrete wavelet transform techniques in order. An adaptive end-point detection segmentation algorithm is proposed to effectively separate the individual syllables from the noise. Six features, including spectral centroid, signal bandwidth, spectral roll-off, threshold-crossing rate, spectral flatness, and average energy, are extracted and served as the input parameters of the classifier. Meanwhile, a decision tree is constructed based on several parameters obtained during sample collection in order to narrow the scope of identification targets. Then fast learning neural-networks are employed to classify the anuran species based on feature set chosen by wrapper feature selection method. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the outcome performance of the proposed work. Experimental results exhibit that the recognition rate of the proposed identification system can achieve up to 93.4%. The effectiveness of the proposed identification system for anuran vocalizations is thus verified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performance based analysis between k-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms for connection oriented telecommunication data	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						k-Means algorithm; Fuzzy C-Means algorithm; Data clustering; Data analysis; Telecommunication data	SYSTEMS	Data mining is the process of discovering meaningful new correlation, patterns and trends by sifting through large amounts of data, using pattern recognition technologies as well as statistical and mathematical techniques. Cluster analysis is often used as one of the major data analysis technique widely applied for many practical applications in emerging areas of data mining. Two of the most delegated, partition based clustering algorithms namely k-Means and Fuzzy C-Means are analyzed in this research work. These algorithms are implemented by means of practical approach to analyze its performance, based on their computational time. The telecommunication data is the source data for this analysis. The connection oriented broad band data is used to find the performance of the chosen algorithms. The distance (Euclidian distance) between the server locations and their connections are rearranged after processing the data. The computational complexity (execution time) of each algorithm is analyzed and the results are compared with one another. By comparing the result of this practical approach, it was found that the results obtained are more accurate, easy to understand and above all the time taken to process the data was substantially high in Fuzzy C-Means algorithm than the k-Means.

The collaborative annotating technique is based on collaborative annotations made by peers while the data mining technique is used to identify the learning bottlenecks suffered by most students on a formative assessment. The ASIFA system combines these two techniques, deemed as scaffolding learning, to furnish students with adequate annotations to clarify their confused concepts on formative assessments and to further improve their learning achievements on summative assessments. Finally, some experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system and investigate the effects of the students' behaviors of inputting and reviewing annotations on learning achievements.

J	Debeljak, M; Poljanec, A; Zenko, B				Debeljak, Marko; Poljanec, Ales; Zenko, Bernard			Modelling forest growing stock from inventory data: A data mining approach	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Forest growing stock; Ecological indicator; Forest inventory data; Data mining; Trend prediction	FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; SCENARIO ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; BIOMASS	Growing stock is an ecological indicator of forest ecosystem response to natural and anthropogenic impacts that may result from forest management measures or environmental impacts. Information on growing stock is thus essential to understand dynamics of forest stands, their productive capacity and to manage their use within limits of sustainability. Dynamic changes of forest growing stock, as well as predictions of their future development, are usually estimated from the data gathered by national forest inventories using some mechanistic modelling approach. The resulting models are informative, but include many parameters, some of which are difficult to set or estimate. Due to the demanding parameterisation of mechanistic models, it is hard to achieve stability of their output accuracy, which can lower their predictive power. This paper presents an alternative and complementary approach of constructing models with machine learning and data mining methods. We applied these methods to the Silva-SI database and used the resulting interpretable models in order to find explanations for structural changes in Slovenian forests over the period from year 1970 to 2010. In addition, we developed predictive models for growing sock in the decade from year 2010 to 2020. The structure of the models describing temporal dynamics of growing stock shows that trends of growing stock are increasing for the entire studied period, while accumulation of growing stock is much more intensive after 1990. Forests with a lower growing stock are located either in the areas with non-favorable site conditions for forest growth, or at lower altitudes, where they are more exposed to human exploitation due to their vicinity to more densely populated regions. Predictions of growing stock for the decade 2010-2020 suggest that Slovenian forests will continue to accumulate their growing stock (private owned forests to 327 m(3)/ha and state owned forests to 343 m(3)/ha in 2020). The presented data mining approach that was here applied to the growing stock can also be used for investigating other ecological indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Background Classification and regression tree analysis is an exploratory research method used to illustrate associations between variables not suited to traditional regression analysis. Complex interactions are demonstrated between covariates and variables of interest in inverted tree diagrams. Design Discussion paper. Data sources English language literature was sourced from eBooks, Medline Complete and CINAHL Plus databases, Google and Google Scholar, hard copy research texts and retrieved reference lists for terms including classification and regression tree* and derivatives and recursive partitioning from 1984-2013. Discussion Classification and regression tree analysis is an important method used to identify previously unknown patterns amongst data. Whilst there are several reasons to embrace this method as a means of exploratory quantitative research, issues regarding quality of data as well as the usefulness and validity of the findings should be considered. Implications for Nursing Research Classification and regression tree analysis is a valuable tool to guide nurses to reduce gaps in the application of evidence to practice. With the ever-expanding availability of data, it is important that nurses understand the utility and limitations of the research method. Conclusion Classification and regression tree analysis is an easily interpreted method for modelling interactions between health-related variables that would otherwise remain obscured. Knowledge is presented graphically, providing insightful understanding of complex and hierarchical relationships in an accessible and useful way to nursing and other health professions.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how IPA can be used with market segmentation to develop customer retention strategies for different market segments. For this purpose, a new framework have been proposed that uses self-organizing maps for customers' segmentation and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for implicity drive the importance of service attributes based on their effect on customers' loyalty in each segment. Then, individual IPA matrixes are developed for each market segment. Also, an example case is presented to demonstrate the implementation and application of the proposed framework. The results of the proposed framework compared with a conventional BPNN-IPA approach indicated that it can increase reliability and applicability of IPA results.

The acquired data are meant to constitute a corpus for training robust and reliable language models and thus the framework needs to also incorporate algorithms for appropriate text processing and duplicity detection in order to secure quality and consistency of the data. As we expect the resulting corpus to be very large, we have also implemented topic detection algorithms that allow us to automatically select subcorpora for domain-specific language models. The description of the framework architecture and the implemented algorithms is complemented with a detailed evaluation section. It analyses the basic properties of the gathered Czech corpus containing more than one billion text tokens collected using the described framework, shows the results of the topic detection methods and finally also describes the design and outcomes of the automatic speech recognition experiments with domain-specific language models estimated from the collected data.

J	Yen, SJ; Lee, YS; Wang, CK				Yen, Show-Jane; Lee, Yue-Shi; Wang, Chiu-Kuang			An efficient algorithm for incrementally mining frequent closed itemsets	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Frequent itemsets; Closed itemsets; Transaction database	ASSOCIATION RULES; PATTERN TREE	The purpose of mining frequent itemsets is to identify the items in groups that always appear together and exceed the user-specified threshold of a transaction database. However, numerous frequent itemsets may exist in a transaction database, hindering decision making. Recently, the mining of frequent closed itemsets has become a major research issue because sets of frequent closed itemsets are condensed yet complete representations of frequent itemsets. Therefore, all frequent itemsets can be derived from a group of frequent closed itemsets. Nonetheless, the number of transactions in a transaction database can increase rapidly in a short time period, and a number of the transactions may be outdated. Thus, frequent closed itemsets may be changed with the addition of new transactions or the deletion of old transactions from the transaction database. Updating previously closed itemsets when transactions are added or removed from the transaction database is challenging. This study proposes an efficient algorithm for incrementally mining frequent closed itemsets without scanning the original database. The proposed algorithm updates closed itemsets by performing several operations on the previously closed itemsets and added/deleted transactions without searching the previously closed itemsets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms previous methods, which require a substantial length of time to search previously closed itemsets.

Users can fluidly interact with an entire collection of cortical surfaces using only their mouse. In addition, users can cluster and group brains according in multiple ways for subsequent comparison using graphical data mining tools. In this article, we illustrate the utility of INVIZIAN for simultaneous exploration and mining a large collection of extracted cortical surface data arising in clinical neuroimaging studies of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment, as well as healthy control subjects. Alzheimer's Disease is particularly interesting due to the wide-spread effects on cortical architecture and alterations of volume in specific brain areas associated with memory. We demonstrate INVIZIAN's ability to render multiple brain surfaces from multiple diagnostic groups of subjects, showcase the interactivity of the system, and showcase how INVIZIAN can be employed to generate hypotheses about the collection of data which would be suitable for direct access to the underlying raw data and subsequent formal statistical analysis. Specifically, we use INVIZIAN show how cortical thickness and hippocampal volume differences between group are evident even in the absence of more formal hypothesis testing. In the context of neurological diseases linked to brain aging such as AD, INVIZIAN provides a unique means for considering the entirety of whole brain datasets, look for interesting relationships among them, and thereby derive new ideas for further research and study.

To reduce the casualty and damages, an effective and accurate method of assessing landslide susceptibility is necessary. Object-based data mining methods were applied to a case study of landslide susceptibility assessment on the Guojiaba Town of the Three Gorges. The study area was partitioned into object mapping units derived from 30 m resolution Landsat TM images using multi-resolution segmentation algorithm based on the landslide factors of engineering rock group, homogeneity, and reservoir water level. Landslide locations were determined by interpretation of Landsat TM images and extensive field surveys. Eleven primary landslide-related factors were extracted from the topographic and geologic maps, and satellite images. Those factors were selected as independent variables using significance testing and correlation coefficient analysis, including slope, profile curvature, engineering rock group, slope structure, distance from faults, land cover, tasseled cap transformation wetness index, reservoir water level, homogeneity, and first and second principal components of the images. Decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) models with the optimal parameters were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility, respectively. The analytical results were validated by comparing them with known landslides using the success rate and prediction rate curves and classification accuracy.

Continuous Preference Trend Mining for Optimal Product Design With Multiple Profit Cycles	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article						continuous preference trend mining; product and design analytics; design for multiple profit cycles; model tree	REVIEWS; SERIES; TREES; POWER	Product and design analytics is emerging as a promising area for the analysis of large-scale data and usage of the extracted knowledge for the design of optimal system. The continuous preference trend mining (CPTM) algorithm and application proposed in this study address some fundamental challenges in the context of product and design analytics. The first contribution is the development of a new predictive trend mining technique that captures a hidden trend of customer purchase patterns from accumulated transactional data. Unlike traditional, static data mining algorithms, the CPTM does not assume stationarity but dynamically extracts valuable knowledge from customers over time. By generating trend embedded future data, the CPTM algorithm not only shows higher prediction accuracy in comparison with well-known static models but also provides essential properties that could not be achieved with previously proposed models: utilizing historical data selectively, avoiding an over-fitting problem, identifying performance information of a constructed model, and allowing a numeric prediction. The second contribution is the formulation of the initial design problem which can reveal an opportunity for multiple profit cycles. This mathematical formulation enables design engineers to optimize product design over multiple life cycles while reflecting customer preferences and technological obsolescence using the CPTM algorithm. For illustration, the developed framework is applied to an example of tablet PC design in leasing market and the result shows that the determination of optimal design is achieved over multiple life cycles.

J	Yan, Y; Rosales, R; Fung, G; Subramanian, R; Dy, J				Yan, Yan; Rosales, Romer; Fung, Glenn; Subramanian, Ramanathan; Dy, Jennifer			Learning from multiple annotators with varying expertise	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Multiple labelers; Crowdsourcing; Opinion aggregation; Graphical models; Classification; Adversarial annotators		Learning from multiple annotators or knowledge sources has become an important problem in machine learning and data mining. This is in part due to the ease with which data can now be shared/collected among entities sharing a common goal, task, or data source; and additionally the need to aggregate and make inferences about the collected information. This paper focuses on the development of probabilistic approaches for statistical learning in this setting. It specially considers the case when annotators may be unreliable, but also when their expertise vary depending on the data they observe. That is, annotators may have better knowledge about different parts of the input space and therefore be inconsistently accurate across the task domain. The models developed address both the supervised and the semi-supervised settings and produce classification and annotator models that allow us to provide estimates of the true labels and annotator expertise when no ground-truth is available. In addition, we provide an analysis of the proposed models, tasks, and related practical problems under various scenarios. In particular, we address how to evaluate annotators and how to consider cases where some ground-truth may be available. We show experimentally that annotator expertise can indeed vary in real tasks and that the presented approaches provide clear advantages over previously introduced multi-annotator methods, which only consider input-independent annotator characteristics, and over alternative approaches that do not model multiple annotators.

To search for molecular mechanisms of this diversity, transcriptomic response to cold was studied in two inbred lines of contrasting cold-tolerance. Microarray analysis was followed by extensive statistical elaboration of data, literature data mining, and gene ontology-based classification. The lines used had been bred earlier specifically for determination of QTLs for cold-performance of photosynthesis. This allowed direct comparison of present transcriptomic data with the earlier QTL mapping results. Cold-treated (14 h at 8/6 A degrees C) maize seedlings of cold-tolerant ETH-DH7 and cold-sensitive ETH-DL3 lines at V3 stage showed strong, consistent response of the third leaf transcriptome: several thousand probes showed similar, statistically significant change in both lines, while only tens responded differently in the two lines. The most striking difference between the responses of the two lines to cold was the induction of expression of ca. twenty genes encoding membrane/cell wall proteins exclusively in the cold-tolerant ETH-DH7 line. The common response comprised mainly repression of numerous genes related to photosynthesis and induction of genes related to basic biological activity: transcription, regulation of gene expression, protein phosphorylation, cell wall organization. Among the genes showing differential response, several were close to the QTL regions identified in earlier studies with the same inbred lines and associated with biometrical, physiological or biochemical parameters. These transcripts, including two apparently non-protein-coding ones, are particularly attractive candidates for future studies on mechanisms determining divergent cold-tolerance of inbred maize lines.

In order to generate an adequate predictive model from a data set, a data analyst has to assess the predictive quality of the decision trees derived from several combinations of working parameters. Except in very simple cases, this may be a tedious and error prone supervised task, since the parameter space is frequently huge. Analysts rely on their intuition and usually test just a few different parameter settings. In this work we present an interactive approach to facilitate the comprehension of the predictive power of large collections of decision trees by exploring large portions of the parameter space. For this, we developed novel views that allow us to visualize and analyze the predictive quality of hundreds of trees, working together with coordinated multiple views of tree representations (needed to understand the tree shapes and actual information herein), and aggregates of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and lift curves for assessing the predictive quality of the models. We developed a worked example using a data set from a Telecommunications company, showing how easy and natural it is to gain insight into the behavior of the data within our exploration tool, as compared with the traditional and widespread common practice of data analysts.

However, the extent of this type of regulation in the control of mitochondria functionality is just beginning to be discovered, aided by the availability of high-resolution mass spectrometers and bioinformatic tools. Data mining from literature on protein acetylation profiling focused on mitochondria isolated from tissues retrieved more than 1395 distinct proteins, corresponding to more than 4858 acetylation sites. ClueGo analysis of identified proteins highlighted oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism as the biological processes more prone to regulation through acetylation. This review also examines the physiological relevance of protein acetylation on the molecular pathways harbored in mitochondria under distinct pathophysiological conditions as caloric restriction and alcohol-induced liver damage. This integrative perspective will certainly help to envisage future studies targeting the regulation of mitochondrial functionality.

Linked with a large number of disease registries, these data infrastructures became laboratories for the development of both information technology and epidemiological studies. Denmark's system of population registries had been centralized in 1924 and was further automated in the 1960s, with individual identification numbers (CPR-numbers) introduced in 1968. The ubiquitous presence of CPR-numbers in administrative routines and everyday lives created a continually growing data archive of the entire population. The resulting national-level database made possible unprecedented record linkage, a feature epidemiologists and biomedical scientists used as a resource for population health research. The specific assemblages that emerged with their practices of data mining were constitutive of registry-based epidemiology as a style of thought and of a distinct relationship between science, citizens, and the state that emerged as Scandinavian.

In this paper, we show that the CC framework can be very helpful to improve the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) on clustering high-dimensional datasets. Based on CC framework, the original partitional clustering problem is first decomposed to several subproblems, each of which is then evolved by an optimizer independently. We employ a very simple but efficient optimization algorithm, namely bare-bone particle swarm optimization (BPSO), as the optimizer to solve each subproblem cooperatively. In addition, we design a new centroid-based encoding schema for each particle and apply the Chernoff bounds to decide a proper population size. The experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the BPSO and CC framework. The comparisons show the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms five EA-based clustering algorithms, i.e., PSO, SRPSO, ACO, ABC and DE, and K-means on most of the datasets.

J	David, JM; Balakrishnan, K				David, Julie M.; Balakrishnan, Kannan			Learning disability prediction tool using ANN and ANFIS	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						ANN; ANFIS; Closest fit; Data mining; Learning disability; PCA		Learning Disability (LD) is a neurological condition that affects a child's brain and impairs his ability to carry out one or many specific tasks. LD affects about 15 % of children enrolled in schools. The prediction of LD is a vital and intricate job. The aim of this paper is to design an effective and powerful tool, using the two intelligent methods viz., Artificial Neural Network and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, for measuring the percentage of LD that affected in school-age children. In this study, we are proposing some soft computing methods in data preprocessing for improving the accuracy of the tool as well as the classifier. The data preprocessing is performed through Principal Component Analysis for attribute reduction and closest fit algorithm is used for imputing missing values. The main idea in developing the LD prediction tool is not only to predict the LD present in children but also to measure its percentage along with its class like low or minor or major. The system is implemented in Mathworks Software MatLab 7.10. The results obtained from this study have illustrated that the designed prediction system or tool is capable of measuring the LD effectively.

Periodontitis has recently been recognised as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed upregulation of molecules in the AD pathway including amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP), a key gene in AD, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and complement component 1 (q subcomponent, A chain) (C1QA) in periodontitis compared to healthy tissues. Here, we quantitatively analysed the expression levels of APP, IL-1 beta, and C1QA and determined the localisation of APP in gingival tissues. Design: Fourteen chronic periodontitis patients and 14 healthy participants were enrolled. Six samples of total RNA from two distinct sites of healthy and periodontitis-affected gingival tissues from three randomly selected patients were used for microarray analyses, and significant biological pathways in periodontitis were identified. Differential gene expression of APP, IL-1 beta, and C1QA, which belong to the AD pathway, were analysed with quantitative reverse transcription real-time polyrnerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using samples from these 14 chronic periodontitis patients and 14 healthy controls. APP localisation was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Results: APP, IL-1 beta, and C1QA mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in periodontitis-affected gingival tissues. APP was mainly localised in macrophages in gingival connective tissues underneath the epithelial layers. Conclusions: An association between AD and periodontitis was detected with microarray and computer-aided data mining analyses. qRT-PCR identified differential gene expression in periodontitis-affected gingival tissue that maybe related to AD pathogenesis. Elevated APP, IL-1 beta, and C1QA transcripts and APP-expressing macrophages in periodontitis-affected gingival tissues were observed, suggesting a relationship between periodontitis and AD pathogenesis.

Refining gold from existing data	CURRENT OPINION IN ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						big data; data mining; data sharing; observational research	TRIALS	Purpose of reviewThe purpose is to review the arguments for increasing use of existing data in health research.Recent findingsThe reuse of data in observational, exploratory and outcome studies, as well as in confirming other findings, is being justified on epistemological grounds as the major path to new knowledge and to the generalizing of findings to real world' populations. It is also justified on the grounds of cost, power, and efficiency, even though data reuse comes with real informatics, scientific culture, societal, and regulatory issues.SummaryData reuse is becoming more compelling.

J	Sohrabi, M; Javidi, MM; Hashemi, S				Sohrabi, Mina; Javidi, Mohammad M.; Hashemi, Sattar			Detecting intrusion transactions in database systems:a novel approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intrusion detection; Malicious transactions; Data mining; Data dependency; K-optimal rule discovery		The security of computers and their networks is of crucial concern in the world today. One mechanism to safeguard information stored in database systems is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The purpose of intrusion detection in database systems is to detect malicious transactions that corrupt data. Recently researchers are working on using data mining techniques for detecting such malicious transactions in database systems. Their approach concentrates on mining data dependencies among data items. However, the transactions not compliant with these data dependencies are identified as malicious transactions. Algorithms that these approaches use for designing their data dependency miner have limitations. For instance, they need to experimentally determine appropriate settings for minimum support and related constraints, which does not necessarily lead to strong data dependencies. In this paper we propose a new data mining algorithm, called the Optimal Data Access Dependency Rule Mining (ODADRM), for designing a data dependency miner for our database IDS. ODADRM is an extension of k-optimal rule discovery algorithm, which has been improved to be suitable in database intrusion detection domain. ODADRM avoids many limitations of previous data dependency miner algorithms. As a result, our approach is able to track normal transactions and detect malicious ones more effectively than existing approaches.

Receiving such great attention has led to the development of many detection methods, most of which pertain to either the distance-based approach or the density-based approach. However, each approach has intrinsic weaknesses. The former hardly detects local outliers, while the latter has the low density patterns problem. To overcome these weaknesses, we proposed a new detection method that introduces the instability factor of a data point by utilizing the concept of the center of gravity. The proposed method can be flexibly used for both local and global detection of outliers by controlling its parameter. In addition, it offers the instability plot containing useful information about the number and size of clusters in data. Numerical experiments based on artificial and real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Porat, A; Strahilevitz, LJ				Porat, Ariel; Strahilevitz, Lior Jacob			PERSONALIZING DEFAULT RULES AND DISCLOSURE WITH BIG DATA	MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW			English	Article							PATIENT PREFERENCE PREDICTOR; CONTRACT INTERPRETATION; INCAPACITATED PATIENTS; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; LAW; PRIVACY; TRAITS; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; INHERITANCE	This Article provides the first comprehensive account of personalized default rules and personalized disclosure in the law. Under a personalized approach to default rules, individuals are assigned default terms in contracts or wills that are tailored to their own personalities, characteristics, and past behaviors. Similarly, disclosures by firms or the state can be tailored so that only information likely to be relevant to an individual is disclosed and information likely to be irrelevant to her is omitted. The Article explains how the rise of Big Data makes the effective personalization of default rules and disclosure far easier than it would have been during earlier eras. The Article then shows how personalization might improve existing approaches to the law of consumer contracts, medical malpractice, organ donation, inheritance, landlord tenant relations, and labor law. The paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, it shows how data mining can be used to identify particular personality traits in individuals, and these traits may in turn predict preferences for particular packages of legal rights. Second, it proposes a regime whereby a subset of the population ("guinea pigs") is given a lot of information about various contractual terms and plenty of time to evaluate their desirability, with the choices of particular guinea pigs becoming the default choices for those members of the general public who have similar personalities, demographic characteristics, and patterns of observed behavior. Third, we assess a lengthy list of drawbacks to the personalization of default rules and disclosure, including cross subsidization, strategic behavior, uncertainty, stereotyping, privacy, and institutional-competence concerns. Finally, we explain that the most trenchant critiques of the disclosure strategy for addressing social ills are really criticisms of impersonal disclosure. Personalized disclosure not only offers the potential to cure the ills associated with impersonal disclosure strategies, but it can also ameliorate many of the problems associated with the use of personalized default rules.

Therefore, accurate detection of intrusion is very essential to secure information in computer and network systems of any organization such as private, public, and government. Several intrusion detection approaches are available but the main problem is their performance, which can be enhanced by increasing the detection rates and reducing false positives. This issue of the existing techniques is the focus of research in this paper. The poor performance of such techniques is due to raw dataset which confuse the classifier and results inaccurate detection due to redundant features. The recent approaches used principal component analysis (PCA) for feature subset selection which is based on highest eigenvalues, but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier due to ignoring many sensitive features. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues such as PCA, this research applied a genetic algorithm to search the genetic principal components that offers a subset of features with optimal sensitivity and the highest discriminatory power. The support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification purpose. This research work used the knowledge discovery and data mining cup dataset for experimentation. The performance of this approach was analyzed and compared with existing approaches. The results show that proposed method enhances SVM performance in intrusion detection that outperforms the existing approaches and has the capability to minimize the number of features and maximize the detection rates.

Bioinformatic Approach to the Genetics of Preeclampsia	OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Article							KAPPA-STATISTICS; MULTIPLE SAMPLES; FETAL; RISK; COHORT; COMPONENTS; GENES	OBJECTIVE: To identify candidate genes and genetic variants for preeclampsia using a bioinformatic approach to extract and organize genes and variants from the published literature. METHODS: Semantic data-mining and natural language processing were used to identify articles from the published literature meeting criteria for potential association with preeclampsia. Articles were manually reviewed by trained curators. Cluster analysis was used to aggregate the extracted genes into gene sets associated with preeclampsia or severe preeclampsia, early or late preeclampsia, maternal or fetal tissue sources, and concurrent conditions (ie, fetal growth restriction, gestational hypertension, or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP]). Gene ontology was used to organize this large group of genes into ontology groups. RESULTS: From more than 22 million records in PubMed, with 28,000 articles on preeclampsia, our data-mining tool identified 2,300 articles with potential genetic associations with preeclampsia-related phenotypes. After curation, 729 articles were "accepted" that contained "statistically significant" associations with 535 genes. We saw distinct segregation of these genes by severity and timing of pre-eclampsia, by maternal or fetal source, and with associated conditions (eg, gestational hypertension, fetal growth restriction, or HELLP syndrome). CONCLUSION: The gene sets and ontology groups identified through our systematic literature curation indicate that preeclampsia represents several distinct phenotypes with distinct and overlapping maternal and fetal genetic contributions.

Data mining reveals a network of early-response genes as a consensus signature of drug-induced in vitro and in vivo toxicity	PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL			English	Article						compound-induced toxicity; early-response genes; gene signature; TG-GATEs; toxicogenomics	GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-3; LIVER-INJURY; SUPERFAMILY MEMBER; EXPRESSION PROFILES; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; RAT-LIVER; ATF3; EGR-1; SYSTEMS	Gene signatures of drug-induced toxicity are of broad interest, but they are often identified from small-scale, single-time point experiments, and are therefore of limited applicability. To address this issue, we performed multivariate analysis of gene expression, cell-based assays, and histopathological data in the TG-GATEs (Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation system) database. Data mining highlights four genes EGR1, ATF3, GDF75 and FGF27 that are induced 2 h after drug administration in human and rat primary hepatocytes poised to eventually undergo cytotoxicity-induced cell death. Modelling and simulation reveals that these early stress-response genes form a functional network with evolutionarily conserved structure and intrinsic dynamics. This is underlined by the fact that early induction of this network in vivo predicts drug-induced liver and kidney pathology with high accuracy. Our findings demonstrate the value of early gene-expression signatures in predicting and understanding compound-induced toxicity. The identified network can empower first-line tests that reduce animal use and costs of safety evaluation.	[Zhang, J.

The classification of land cover by the supervised method requires training areas, these areas must be representative of each class of land cover. For the classification decision tree (DT) algorithm, the complexity of DT, results in different values of accuracies for thematic maps. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the minimum sample density in a DT model which would allow to discriminate land cover classes, evaluate the size of the generated DT model, as well as, identify the more difficult land cover class to be mapped. Satellite images from RESOURCESAT-1as well as spectral indices were used in the study. The minimum sample density varied between 0.15 and 0.30% of the total area for each class, this sampling interval allowed better results than 80% for kappa index. The smallest grouping of observations in the same terminal leaf was 45 observations. In this study the most difficult land use classes to be mapped were forest and rice crops due to spectral similarity of shaded forests with irrigated rice crops.

A Portuguese retail bank was addressed, with data collected from 2008 to 2013, thus including the effects of the recent financial crisis. We analyzed a large set of 150 features related with bank client, product and social-economic attributes. A semi-automatic feature selection was explored in the modeling phase, performed with the data prior to July 2012 and that allowed to select a reduced set of 22 features. We also compared four DM models: logistic regression, decision trees (DTs), neural network (NN) and support vector machine. Using two metrics, area of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and area of the LIFT cumulative curve (ALIFT), the four models were tested on an evaluation set, using the most recent data (after July 2012) and a rolling window scheme. The NN presented the best results (AUC=0.8 and ALIFT=0.7), allowing to reach 79% of the subscribers by selecting the half better classified clients. Also, two knowledge extraction methods, a sensitivity analysis and a DT, were applied to the NN model and revealed several key attributes (e.g., Euribor rate, direction of the call and bank agent experience). Such knowledge extraction confirmed the obtained model as credible and valuable for telemarketing campaign managers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Buildings are becoming not only energy-intensive, but also information-intensive. Data mining (DM) is an emerging powerful technique with great potential to discover hidden knowledge in large data sets. This study investigates the use of DM for analyzing the large data sets in BAS with the aim of improving building operational performance. An applicable framework for mining BAS database is proposed. The framework is implemented to mine the BAS database of the tallest building in Hong Kong. After data preparation, clustering analysis is performed to identify the typical power consumption patterns of the building. Then, association rule mining is adopted to unveil the associations among power consumptions of major components in each cluster. Lastly, post-mining is conducted to interpret the rules. 457 rules are obtained in association rule mining, of which the majority can be easily deduced from domain knowledge and hence be ignored in this study. Four of the rules are used for improving building performance. This study shows that DM techniques are valuable for knowledge discovery in BAS database; however, solid domain knowledge is still needed to apply the knowledge discovered to achieve better building operational performance.

Specific quality control programs are mandatory in many countries, including EU and USA, to protect consumers from involuntary mistakes occurring during production, as well as to narrow the possibilities for illegal adulteration practices. The rapid introduction of advanced analytical techniques, employed for the measurement of trace compounds or the simultaneous determination of a wide array of analytes, has been accompanied with the development of more comprehensive approaches for data mining, and data analysis. The prior has lead to improving the means for wine traceability, and discrimination and classification of grapes and wines (mainly in terms of grape varieties, geographical origin and processing conditions). Some of the recent findings on wine typification and authentication herein reviewed, highlight that several challenges need to be solved in order to improve the assessment of wine authenticity and confirm potential mistakes or product adulteration.

Assuring the authenticity of northwest Spain white wine varieties using machine learning techniques	FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Galician white wine varieties; Volatile composition; Assuring authenticity; Machine learning techniques; Feature selection; Model comparison	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPERVISED PATTERN-RECOGNITION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; RED WINES; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; SENSORY EVALUATION; CHEMOMETRIC TECHNIQUES; PHENOLIC COMPOSITION	Classification of wine represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem characterized by great complexity, non-linearity and lack of objective information regarding the quality of the desired final product. Volatile compounds of wines elaborated from four Galician (NW Spain) autochthonous white Vitis vinifera from four consecutive vintages were analysed by gas chromatography (F1D, FPD and MS detectors), and several aroma compounds were used for correctly classifying autochthonous white grape varieties (Albarifio, Treixadura, Loureira and Dona Branca). The objective of the work is twofold: to find a classification model able to precisely differentiate between existing grape varieties (i.e. assuring the authenticity), and to assess the discriminatory power of different family compounds over well-known classifiers (i.e. guaranteeing the typicality). From the experiments carried out, and given the fact that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was not able to accurately separate all the wine varieties, this work investigates the suitability of applying different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e.: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes) for classification purposes. Perfect classification accuracy is obtained by the Random Forest algorithm, whilst the other alternatives achieved promising results using only part of the available information.

This paper introduces a commuter route optimized energy management system, where the bulk of the computations are performed on a server. The idea is to identify commuter routes from historical driving data, using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and then pre-compute an optimal solution to the energy management control problem with dynamic programming; the obtained solution can then be transmitted to the vehicle in the form of a lookup table. To investigate the potential of such a system, a simulation study is performed using a detailed vehicle model implemented in the Autonomie simulation environment for MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle indicate that the average fuel consumption along the commuter route(s) can be reduced by 4%-9% and battery usage by 10%-15%.

In this paper, we propose a nonlinear DR approach enforcing projection constraints resulting from an a priori knowledge about the structure of the data in multivariate periodical time series. We then propose several ways of exploiting this constrained projection to extract user-relevant information, such as the nominal behavior of a periodical dynamical system or the deviant behaviors which may occur at different time scales. The techniques are demonstrated on both a synthetic dataset composed of simulated multivariate data exhibiting a periodical behavior, and a real dataset corresponding to six months of sensor data acquisitions and recordings inside experimental buildings.(1)	[Blanchart, Pierre; Depecker, Marine] CEA, LIST, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France	Blanchart, P (reprint author), CEA, LIST, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.	pierre.blanchart@gmail.com; marine.depecker@cea.fr						38	0	0	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	PISCATAWAY	445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA	2162-237X	2162-2388		IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR	IEEE Trans.

Here we report the most comprehensive exploration of genetic loci influencing human metabolism thus far, comprising 7,824 adult individuals from 2 European population studies. We report genome-wide significant associations at 145 metabolic loci and their biochemical connectivity with more than 400 metabolites in human blood. We extensively characterize the resulting in vivo blueprint of metabolism in human blood by integrating it with information on gene expression, heritability and overlap with known loci for complex disorders, inborn errors of metabolism and pharmacological targets. We further developed a database and web-based resources for data mining and results visualization. Our findings provide new insights into the role of inherited variation in blood metabolic diversity and identify potential new opportunities for drug development and for understanding disease.

Hybrid Method Inference for the Construction of Cooperative Regulatory Network in Human	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Cancer; ensemble methods; gene regulatory network (GRN); linear regression	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SELECTION; RECONSTRUCTION; LASSO; FOXM1	Reconstruction of large scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs in the following) is an important step for understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms within the cell. Many modeling approaches have been introduced to find the causal relationship between genes using expression data. However, they have been suffering from high dimensionality-large number of genes but a small number of samples, overfitting, heavy computation time and low interpretability. We have previously proposed an original Data Mining algorithm LICORN, that infers cooperative regulation network from expression datasets. In this work, we present an extension of LICORN to a hybrid inference method H-LICORN that uses search in both discrete and real valued spaces. LICORN's algorithm, using the discrete space to find cooperative regulation relationships fitting the target gene expression, has been shown to be powerful in identifying cooperative regulation relationships that are out of the scope of most GRN inference methods. Still, as many of related GRN inference techniques, LICORN suffers from a large number of false positives. We propose here an extension of LICORN with a numerical selection step, expressed as a linear regression problem, that effectively complements the discrete search of LICORN. We evaluate a bootstrapped version of H-LICORN on the in silico DREAM5 dataset and show that H-LICORN has significantly higher performance than LICORN, and is competitive or outperforms state of the art GRN inference algorithms, especially when operating on small data sets. We also applied H-LICORN on a real dataset of human bladder cancer and show that it performs better than other methods in finding candidate regulatory interactions. In particular, solely based on gene expression data, H-LICORN is able to identify experimentally validated regulator cooperative relationships involved in cancer.

The concepts of isosterism stretch back over a century, but only recently have systematic and data-intensive methods been used to explore appropriate replacements. Here, a summary of the history of bioisosterism is presented to provide context to the methods applied. Molecular similarity and data mining methods are introduced as approaches to introduce these replacements to rationalise the space of synthetic targets to consider in a medicinal chemistry project. Lastly, an outlook of the field is given of potential future improvements and areas of focus that should be considered to anyone interested in the field.

However, it also brings the problem of sensitive information leaking in disregard of privacy, especially when it is executed in distributed environment. In this paper, we propose a cryptography-based framework to realize privacy-preserving document clustering among the users under the distributed environment; there are two parties, each having his private document database, want to collaboratively execute agglomerative document clustering without disclosing their private contents. We provide two implementations of such a framework, one is with more precision and stronger security but requires more computational resources. The other is a simplified version with less computational complexity and achieves higher processing speed. Additionally, we provide the security proofs and experimental analysis of precision and scalability of our proposal. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This is justified by the practicality and necessity of divulging the decision algorithm hidden in the recorded relay event report using computational intelligence-based data mining. Thus, this paper studies the detailed modeling and simulation of an industrial AREVA MiCOM P441 distance relay, accommodated together with its own simulated event report recording facility. The idea is to provide the flexibility of allowing the simulated event report to have sufficiently significant depth and breadth for data mining purposes. The modeled relay has operated correctly and discriminatively in deciding circuit breaker pole(s) to be tripped in stipulated assertion times as per the Malaysian licensee's requirements for various faults and protected zones along a transmission line. It has subsequently been validated successfully by the performance of the real field AREVA MiCOM P441 distance relay belonging to the Malaysian licensee. With the successful modeling and simulation of the AREVA MiCOM P441 distance relay and its recording facility, such subsequent works as data extraction and preparation, computational intelligence-based data mining for relay decision algorithm discovery and finally a relay analysis expert system development can certainly be executed. These subsequent applications are briefly explored as a demonstration of the benefit offered after the successful modeling of the relay.

Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Classifier Parameter Tuning for Automatic Ovarian Cancer Tissue Characterization and Classification	ULTRASCHALL IN DER MEDIZIN			English	Article						cervix; 3D ultrasound; neural networks	3-DIMENSIONAL POWER DOPPLER; NEURAL-NETWORK; ADNEXAL MASSES; ULTRASOUND; MALIGNANCY; DIAGNOSIS; TUMORS; SONOGRAPHY; MODEL; COLOR	Purpose: Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecological cancers in women. It is difficult to accurately and objectively diagnose benign and malignant ovarian tumors using ultrasound and other tests. Hence, there is an imperative need to develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for ovarian tumor classification in order to reduce patient anxiety and the cost of unnecessary biopsies. In this paper, we present an automatic CAD system for the detection of benign and malignant ovarian tumors using advanced image processing and data mining techniques. Materials and Methods: In the proposed system, Hu's invariant moments, Gabor transform parameters and entropies are first extracted from the acquired ultrasound images. Significant features are then used to train a probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier for classifying the images into benign and malignant categories. The model parameter (sigma) for which the PNN classifier performs the best is identified using a genetic algorithm (GA). Results: The proposed system was validated using 1300 benign images and 1300 malignant images, obtained from 10 patients with a benign disease and 10 with a malignant disease. We used 23 statistically significant (p < 0.0001) features. By evaluating the classifier using a ten-fold cross-validation technique, we were able to achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.8 %, sensitivity of 99.2 % and specificity of 99.6 % with a s of 0.264. Conclusion: The proposed system is automated and hence is more objective, can be easily deployed in any computer, is fast and accurate and can act as an adjunct tool in helping physicians make a confident call about the nature of the ovarian tumor under evaluation.

Persistent Pursuit of Personal Information: A Historical Perspective on Digital Advertising Strategies	CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Digital Advertising; Consumer Surveillance; History; Contemporary Concerns		While much about digital advertising appears revolutionary, it would be wrong to accept the notion that customer surveillance is a modern phenomenon. Although the internet's technological advances have taken advertising in new directions and the practice of "data-mining" to almost incomprehensible extremes, nearly all of what is transpiring reflects some of the basic methods developed by marketers beginning a hundred years ago. In this essay, I argue that the emerging nature of digital advertising has important consequences for how scholars think about internet policy issues as well as how media scholars think about the changing relationship of advertising to content production.

This paper proposes a measurement-focused study oriented to evaluate a new methodology for assessing fall risk using low-cost and off-the-shelf devices. The proposed methodology consists of a data acquisition system, a data analysis system, and a fall risk assessment system. The data acquisition system is composed by a standard notebook computer and video game input devices: a Kinect, a Wii balance board, and two Wii motion controllers. The data analysis system and the fall risk assessment system, in turn, use signal processing, data mining, and computational intelligence methods, in order to analyze the acquired data for determining the fall risk of the subject under analysis. This methodology includes six static and two dynamic tests. Experiments were conducted on a population of 37 subjects: 16 with falling background, and 21 with nonfalling background. These two groups have the same age distribution. As nonlinear binary classification techniques were used, methodologies based on confidence intervals are not applicable and then tenfold cross validation was used to estimate accuracy. Hence, such a methodology can classify the fall risk as high or low, with an accuracy of 89.2%. The proposed methodology allows the construction of low-cost, portable, replicable, objective, and reliable fall risk assessment systems.

Literature taxonomization plays a critical role in understanding a discipline's knowledge attributes and structure. The traditional research classification is a manual process which is considerably time consuming and may introduce inconsistent classifications by different experts. Aiming at aiding this classification issue, this study conducted three studies to seek the most effective and accurate method to classify accounting publications' attributes. We found results in the third study most rewarding in which the classification accuracy reached 87.27% with decision trees and rule-based algorithms applied. Findings in the first and second studies also provided valuable implications on automatic literature classifications, e.g. abstracts are better measures to use than keywords and balancing under-represented subclasses does not contribute to more accurate classifications. All three studies' results also suggest that expanding article sample size is a key to strengthen automatic classification accuracy. Overall, the potential path of this line of research seems to be very promising and would have several collateral benefits and applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adding formal definitions to MedDRA would allow retrieval of terms according to a case definition that may correspond to novel categories that are not currently available in the terminology. To achieve semantic reasoning with MedDRA, we have associated formal definitions to MedDRA terms in an OWL file named OntoADR that is the result of our first step for providing an "ontologized" version of MedDRA. MedDRA five-levels original hierarchy was converted into a subsumption tree and formal definitions of MedDRA terms were designed using several methods: mappings to SNOMED-CT, semi-automatic definition algorithms or a fully manual way. This article presents the main steps of OntoADR conception process, its structure and content, and discusses problems and limits raised by this attempt to "ontologize" MedDRA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental comparison of support vector machines with random forests for hyperspectral image land cover classification	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE			English	Article						Hyperspectral image; land cover; generalized reduced gradient; classifiers	ENDMEMBER EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS; SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS; REMOTELY SENSED DATA; ACCURACY; VEGETATION; MAPS	The performances of regular support vector machines and random forests are experimentally compared for hyperspectral imaging land cover classification. Special characteristics of hyperspectral imaging dataset present diverse processing problems to be resolved under robust mathematical formalisms such as image classification. As a result, pixel purity index algorithm is used to obtain endmember spectral responses from Indiana pine hyperspectral image dataset. The generalized reduced gradient optimization algorithm is thereafter executed on the research data to estimate fractional abundances in the hyperspectral image and thereby obtain the numeric values for land cover classification. The Waikato environment for knowledge analysis (WEKA) data mining framework is selected as a tool to carry out the classification process by using support vector machines and random forests classifiers. Results show that performance of support vector machines is comparable to that of random forests. This study makes a positive contribution to the problem of land cover classification by exploring generalized reduced gradient method, support vector machines, and random forests to improve producer accuracy and overall classification accuracy. The performance comparison of these classifiers is valuable for a decision maker to consider tradeoffs in method accuracy versus method complexity.	[Abe, B.

Power Outage Estimation for Tropical Cyclones: Improved Accuracy with Simpler Models	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; hurricanes; power outage predictions; reliability	HURRICANES	In this article, we discuss an outage-forecasting model that we have developed. This model uses very few input variables to estimate hurricane-induced outages prior to landfall with great predictive accuracy. We also show the results for a series of simpler models that use only publicly available data and can still estimate outages with reasonable accuracy. The intended users of these models are emergency response planners within power utilities and related government agencies. We developed our models based on the method of random forest, using data from a power distribution system serving two states in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. We also show that estimates of system reliability based on wind speed alone are not sufficient for adequately capturing the reliability of system components. We demonstrate that a multivariate approach can produce more accurate power outage predictions.

Multivariate statistical analysis of FORC-IV data classifies statistically significant behaviors and maps characteristic responses spatially. In particular, regions of grain, matrix, and grain boundary responses are clearly identified, k-Means and Bayesian demixing analysis suggest the characteristic response be separated into four components, with hysteretic-type behavior localized at the BFO-CFO tubular interfaces. The conditions under which Bayesian components allow direct physical interpretation are explored, and transport mechanisms at the grain boundaries and individual phases are analyzed. This approach conjoins multivariate statistical analysis with physics-based interpretation, actualizing a robust, universal, data-driven approach to problem solving, which can be applied to exploration of local transport and other functional phenomena in other spatially inhomogeneous systems.

The business leaders require characterizing the behavior of customers to build long-term profitable customers. It can be done by grouping or segmenting the customers according to their characteristics. The customers grouped together are described by rules to portray their behavior. These rules can be used by the marketing managers to predict the behavior of new customer by comparing with the characteristics of existing customer and to personalize the service. This paper focuses the rough set approach for customer segmentation and rule generation for customer behavior analysis. Real customer data have been collected from four different enterprises. The experimental results prove that our proposed clustering and rule induction algorithm is more efficient for customer behavior analysis.

To manage this process effectively, many information systems have been proposed. However, their performance in improving the efficiency and accuracy of patient triage is not satisfactory. This paper is concerned with the development of a mobile-based system for supporting emergency triage in the emergency care process for mass casualty incidents. This system collects the patient's emergency data throughout the whole emergency care process through a mobile application and data transfer mechanism. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, the system has the capacity to present the survival curve to the triage officer, helping him/her to make triage and transportation decisions. This system offers an alternative injury assessment tool based on the vital signs data of the injury patient. With the help of this system, the triage officer can more directly and comprehensively learn about each patient's situation and deterioration without additional operations at the incident site.

Various statistical models and data mining techniques have been developed in the recent years and applied to stock market forecasting. A review of the relevant literature shows that only a very few studies have applied high frequency data to forecast the stock market and among these studies, only one or two have applied data mining techniques. There are no studies on forecasting high frequency data of stock index using multivariate adaptive regression splines. In this paper we study the applicability of the following four data mining techniques: backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and Markov chain incorporated into fuzzy stochastic (MF), for one-step-ahead forecast of S&P CNX Nifty index of India and Nasdaq composite index of USA with every sixtieth minute data. The results of the study shows that SVR is better than the others for forecasting high frequency data of both indices with an accuracy of 99.7 %.	[Arasu, B.

J	Chen, JK; Li, GQ				Chen, Jikai; Li, Guoqing			Tsallis Wavelet Entropy and Its Application in Power Signal Analysis	ENTROPY			English	Article						Tsallis entropy; transient signal; wavelet entropy; data mining; feature extraction	INFORMATION; STATISTICS; POTENTIALS	As a novel data mining approach, a wavelet entropy algorithm is used to perform entropy statistics on wavelet coefficients (or reconstructed signals) at various wavelet scales on the basis of wavelet decomposition and entropy statistic theory. Shannon wavelet energy entropy, one kind of wavelet entropy algorithm, has been taken into consideration and utilized in many areas since it came into being. However, as there is wavelet aliasing after the wavelet decomposition, and the information set of different-scale wavelet decomposition coefficients (or reconstructed signals) is non-additive to a certain extent, Shannon entropy, which is more adaptable to extensive systems, couldn't do accurate uncertainty statistics on the wavelet decomposition results. Therefore, the transient signal features are extracted incorrectly by using Shannon wavelet energy entropy. From the two aspects, the theoretical limitations and negative effects of wavelet aliasing on extraction accuracy, the problems which exist in the feature extraction process of transient signals by Shannon wavelet energy entropy, are discussed in depth. Considering the defects of Shannon wavelet energy entropy, a novel wavelet entropy named Tsallis wavelet energy entropy is proposed by using Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy, and it is applied to the feature extraction of transient signals in power systems. Theoretical derivation and experimental result prove that compared with Shannon wavelet energy entropy, Tsallis wavelet energy entropy could reduce the negative effects of wavelet aliasing on accuracy of feature extraction and extract transient signal feature of power system accurately.

Clinical evaluation is based on the visual detection of symptoms during epileptic seizures. This work aims at developing a fully automatic classifier of epileptic types and their localization using ictal symptoms and machine learning methods. Methods: We present the results achieved by using two machine learning methods. The first is an ontology-based classification that can directly incorporate human knowledge, while the second is a genetics-based data mining algorithm that learns or extracts the domain knowledge from medical data in implicit form. Results: The developed methods are tested on a clinical dataset of 129 patients. The performance of the methods is measured against the performance of seven clinicians, whose level of expertise is high/very high, in classifying two epilepsy types: temporal lobe epilepsy and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy. When comparing the performance of the algorithms with that of a single clinician, who is one of the seven clinicians, the algorithms show a slightly better performance than the clinician on three test sets generated randomly from 99 patients out of the 129 patients. The accuracy obtained for the two methods and the clinician is as follows: first test set 65.6% and 75% for the methods and 56.3% for the clinician, second test set 66.7% and 76.2% for the methods and 61.9% for the clinician, and third test set 77.8% for the methods and the clinician. When compared with the performance of the whole population of clinicians on the rest 30 patients out of the 129 patients, where the patients were selected by the clinicians themselves, the mean accuracy of the methods (60%) is slightly worse than the mean accuracy of the clinicians (61.6%). Results show that the methods perform at the level of experienced clinicians, when both the methods and the clinicians use the same information. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the developed methods form important ingredients for realizing a fully automatic classification of epilepsy types and can contribute to the definition of signs that are most important for the classification.

High resolution and sensitivity large-scale radio surveys of the Milky Way are critical in the discovery of very low surface brightness supernova remnants (SNRs), which may constitute a significant portion of the Galactic SNRs still unaccounted for (ostensibly the "missing SNR problem"). Aims. The overall purpose here is to present the results of a systematic, deep data-mining of the Canadian Galactic plane Survey (CGPS) for faint, extended non-thermal and polarized emission structures that are likely the shells of uncatalogued SNRs. Methods. We examine 5 x 5 degree mosaics from the entire 1420 MHz continuum and polarization dataset of the CGPS after removing unresolved "point" sources and subsequently smoothing them. Newly revealed extended emission objects are compared to similarly prepared CGPS 408 MHz continuum mosaics, as well as to source-removed mosaics from various existing radio surveys at 4.8 GHz, 2.7 GHz, and 327 MHz, to identify candidates with non-thermal emission characteristics. We integrate flux densities at each frequency to characterise the radio spectra behaviour of these candidates. We further look for mid-and high-frequency (1420 MHz, 4.8 GHz) ordered polarized emission from the limb brightened "shell"-like continuum features that the candidates sport. Finally, we use IR and optical maps to provide additional backing evidence. Results. Here we present evidence that five new objects, identified as filling all or some of the criteria above, are strong candidates for new SNRs. These five are designated by their Galactic coordinate names G108.5+11.0, G128.5+2.6, G149.5+3.2, G150.8+3.8, and G160.1-1.1. The radio spectrum of each is presented, highlighting their steepness, which is characteristic of synchrotron radiation. CGPS 1420 MHz polarization data and 4.8 GHz polarization data also provide evidence that these objects are newly discovered SNRs. These discoveries represent a significant increase in the number of SNRs known in the outer Galaxy second quadrant of longitude (90 degrees < l < 180 degrees), and suggests that deep mining of other current and future Milky Way surveys will find even more objects and help to reconcile the difference between expected numbers of Galactic SNRs and the smaller number of currently known SNRs.

Accumulated evidence has shown that histone modifications mediate biological processes such as transcription cooperatively. This has led to the hypothesis of 'histone code' which suggests that combinations of different histone modifications correspond to unique chromatin states and have distinct functions. In this paper, we propose a framework based on association rule mining to discover the potential regulatory relations between histone modifications and gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum. Our approach can output rules with statistical significance. Some of the discovered rules are supported by literature of experimental results. Moreover, we have also discovered de novo rules which can guide further research in epigenetic regulation of transcription. Based on our association rules we build a model to predict gene expression, which outperforms a published Bayesian network model for gene expression prediction by histone modifications. The results of our study reveal mechanisms for histone modifications to regulate transcription in large-scale. Among our findings, the cooperation among histone modifications provides new evidence for the hypothesis of histone code. Furthermore, the rules output by our method can be used to predict the change of gene expression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results are used to generate a network of water management institutions that reflect public perceptions of water management and the structure of water management in these areas. This structure can be highly centralized or fragmented; in the latter case, multiple peer institutions exist that may cooperate or be in conflict. This is reflected in the public discourse of the water consumers in these areas and can, we contend, impact the potential responses of management agencies to challenges of water supply and quality and, in some cases, limit their effectiveness. Flagstaff, AZ, Tucson, AZ, Las Vegas, NV, and the Grand Valley, CO, are examined, including more than 110,000 articles from 2004-2012. Documents are scored by association with water topics, and phrases likely to be institutions are extracted via custom NLP and NER algorithms; those institutions associated with water-related documents are used to form networks via document co-location. The Grand Valley is shown to have a markedly different structure, which we contend reflects the different historical trajectory of its development and its current state, which includes multiple institutions of roughly equal scope and size. These results demonstrate the utility of using NLP and NER methods to understanding the structure and variation of water management systems.

A Machine Learning Approach to Improving Dynamic Decision Making	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						dynamic decision making; process control; data mining; process mining; machine learning; simulation; healthcare	DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS; CLINICAL INERTIA; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; MODEL; CARE	Decision strategies in dynamic environments do not always succeed in producing desired outcomes, particularly in complex, ill-structured domains. Information systems often capture large amounts of data about such environments. We propose a domain-independent, iterative approach that (a) applies data mining classification techniques to the collected data in order to discover the conditions under which dynamic decision-making strategies produce undesired or suboptimal outcomes and (b) uses this information to improve the decision strategy under these conditions. In this paper, we formally develop this approach and illustrate it by providing detailed examples of its application to a chronic disease care problem in a healthcare management organization, specifically the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, the proposed iterative approach is used to improve treatment strategies by predicting and eliminating treatment failures, i.e., insufficient or excessive treatment actions, based on information that is available in electronic medical record systems. We also apply the proposed approach to a manufacturing task, resulting in substantial decision strategy improvements, which further demonstrates the generality and flexibility of the proposed approach.

Terminal operators need to estimate the actual time of arrival in port in order to determine the daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay in a previous port and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools. Specific models should be adopted, in a daily planning scenario, to provide a useful support tool in TCTs. In this study, we discuss an exploratory analysis of the data affecting delays registered at a Mediterranean TCT. We present some preliminary results obtained using data mining techniques and propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model to reduce the range of uncertainty of ship arrivals in port. This approach is compulsory to manage vast amounts of unstructured data involved in estimating of vessel arrivals.

J	Ghoshal, A; Sarkar, S				Ghoshal, Abhijeet; Sarkar, Sumit			Association Rules for Recommendations with Multiple Items	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; disjunctive rules; personalization; bounce rate; collaborative filtering; matrix factorization		In Web-based environments, a site has the ability to recommend multiple items to a customer in each interaction. Traditionally, rules used to make recommendations either have single items in their consequents or have conjunctions of items in their consequents. Such rules may be of limited use when the site wishes to maximize the likelihood of the customer being interested in at least one of the items recommended in each interaction (with a session comprising multiple interactions). Rules with disjunctions of items in their consequents and conjunctions of items in their antecedents are more appropriate for such environments. We refer to such rules as disjunctive consequent rules. We have developed a novel mining algorithm to obtain such rules. We identify several properties of disjunctive consequent rules that can be used to prune the search space when mining such rules. We demonstrate that the pruning techniques drastically reduce the proportion of disjunctive rules explored, with the pruning effectiveness increasing rapidly with an increase in the number of items to be recommended. We conduct experiments to compare the use of disjunctive rules with that of traditional (conjunctive) association rules on several real-world data sets and show that the accuracies of recommendations made using disjunctive consequent rules are significantly higher than those made using traditional association rules. We also compare the disjunctive consequent rules approach with two other state-of-the-art recommendation approaches-collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. Its performance is generally superior to both these techniques on two transactional data sets. The relative performance on a very sparse click-stream data set is mixed. Its performance is inferior to that of collaborative filtering and superior to that of matrix factorization for that data set.

Leon			Effective Active Learning Strategies for the Use of Large-Margin Classifiers in Semantic Annotation: An Optimal Parameter Discovery Perspective	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						active learning; machine learning; data mining; optimization; business intelligence	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONDITIONAL RANDOM-FIELDS; CLASSIFICATION; WEB; ACQUISITION; EXTRACTION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; VARIABLES; SEARCH	Classical supervised machine learning techniques have been explored for semantically annotating unstructured textual data such as consumers' comments archived at social media websites to extract business intelligence. However, these techniques often require a large number of manually labeled training examples to produce accurate annotations. Several active learning approaches that are designed based on probabilistic sequence models have been explored to minimize the number of labeled training examples for semantic annotation tasks. Recent research has shown that large-margin classifiers are viable alternatives to automated semantic annotation, given their strong generalization capabilities and the ability to process high-dimensional data. However, the existing active learning methods that are designed for probabilistic sequence models cannot be easily adapted and applied to large-margin classifiers. The main contribution of this paper is the development of novel active learning methods for large-margin classifiers to fill the aforementioned research gap. In particular, we propose an innovative perspective of taking active learning as a search of optimal parameters for large-margin classifiers. A rigorous evaluation involving two benchmark tests and an empirical test based on real-world data extracted from Amazon.com reveals that the proposed active learning methods can train effective classifiers with significantly fewer training examples while achieving similar annotation performance, compared to a typical state-of-the-art classifier that only uses several labeled training examples. More specifically, one of our proposed active learning methods can reduce the number of training examples by 19.74% at the 68% level of F 1 when compared to the best baseline method, as evaluated based on the Amazon data set.

Providing a balanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that directly addresses the trade-off between the ability to detect new attack types and providing low false detection rate is a fundamental challenge. Many of the proposed methods perform well in one of the two aspects, and concentrate on a subset of system requirements. There are many non-functional requirements for an applicable and practical IDS. The process should be online, incremental and adaptive to ever changing behaviors of normal users and attackers. Moreover providing comprehensive and interactive IDS could both, enhance the performance of the system and extend the knowledge of domain experts. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule-based classification system using a hierarchical rule learning method. In each stage of the hierarchy, a set of rules with certain length of antecedent are investigated: A novel rule weighting method, based on the entropy measure, determines the appropriateness of each rule. The experimental results on KDD99 intrusion detection dataset show the effectiveness of he proposed method in tackling the tradeoff between accuracy and comprehensibility of fuzzy rule-based systems. Although the dimension of antecedents is not limited, the resultant rule-base contains a small number of complex rules, which are essential to reach the desired accuracy.	[Moosavi, M. R.; Javan, M.

A determination of critical factors that influence performance in such courses is critical to designing class instructions. Instructors teaching these classes agonize over the fact that these courses are amongst the most difficult to teach as they encompass relatively harder concepts transformed into analytical skill sets with real applications to business operations that students struggle to grasp. This study employs a machine learning-based approach to determine critical success factors by analyzing the dataset of a focus course and provides some guidelines to educators for improving their teaching effectiveness. Information fusion-based sensitivity analyses on the data mining models provide an unbiased weighting scheme for the rank order of the variables that help predict the students' comprehension level.

This article presents an in-depth study of commenting and comment rating behavior on a sample of more than 10 million user comments on YouTube and Yahoo! News. In this study, comment ratings are considered first-class citizens. Their dependencies with textual content, thread structure of comments, and associated content (e.g., videos and their metadata) are analyzed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the community commenting behavior. Furthermore, this article explores the applicability of machine learning and data mining to detect acceptance of comments by the community, comments likely to trigger discussions, controversial and polarizing content, and users exhibiting offensive commenting behavior.

Multiparameter genome analysis and information self-determination	MEDIZINISCHE GENETIK			German	Article						Genome; Genetic counseling; Data mining; Data protection; Prenatal screening		The forthcoming option of whole-genome analysis through next-generation sequencing at moderate costs means a paradigm shift in genetic laboratory diagnosis. The power of genetic testing is not limited anymore by the amount of analysed genomic sequences, but rather by the choice of meaningful parameters to evaluate large sequence datasets involving nearly all genes and regulatory regions within the human genome. This change brings about new practical challenges for communication with patients seeking advice. Furthermore, regulatory gaps need to be closed with respect to data protection in the wake of globalized medicine.

For example, in traffic monitoring, every incoming event, such as a packet's entering a router or a car's entering an intersection, should ideally have an immediate outgoing counterpart. We propose a new class of constraints-Conservation Rules-that express the semantics and characterize the data quality of such applications. We give confidence metrics that quantify how strongly a conservation rule holds and present approximation algorithms (with error guarantees) for the problem of discovering a concise summary of subsets of the data that satisfy a given conservation rule. Using real data, we demonstrate the utility of conservation rules and we show order-of-magnitude performance improvements of our discovery algorithms over naive approaches.

On the Use of Side Information for Mining Text Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; clustering	CATEGORIZATION	In many text mining applications, side-information is available along with the text documents. Such side-information may be of different kinds, such as document provenance information, the links in the document, user-access behavior from web logs, or other non-textual attributes which are embedded into the text document. Such attributes may contain a tremendous amount of information for clustering purposes. However, the relative importance of this side-information may be difficult to estimate, especially when some of the information is noisy. In such cases, it can be risky to incorporate side-information into the mining process, because it can either improve the quality of the representation for the mining process, or can add noise to the process. Therefore, we need a principled way to perform the mining process, so as to maximize the advantages from using this side information. In this paper, we design an algorithm which combines classical partitioning algorithms with probabilistic models in order to create an effective clustering approach. We then show how to extend the approach to the classification problem. We present experimental results on a number of real data sets in order to illustrate the advantages of using such an approach.

In spatial network activity summarization (SNAS), we are given a spatial network and a collection of activities (e. g., pedestrian fatality reports, crime reports) and the goal is to find k shortest paths that summarize the activities. SNAS is important for applications where observations occur along linear paths such as roadways, train tracks, etc. SNAS is computationally challenging because of the large number of k subsets of shortest paths in a spatial network. Previous work has focused on either geometry or subgraph-based approaches (e. g., only one path), and cannot summarize activities using multiple paths. This paper proposes a K-Main Routes (KMR) approach that discovers k shortest paths to summarize activities. KMR generalizes K-means for network space but uses shortest paths instead of ellipses to summarize activities. To improve performance, KMR uses network Voronoi, divide and conquer, and pruning strategies. We present a case study comparing KMR's network-based output (i.e., shortest paths) to geometry-based outputs (e. g., ellipses) on pedestrian fatality data. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that KMR with our performance-tuning decisions yields substantial computational savings without reducing summary path coverage.

Both methods rely on the aggregation and analysis of a large set of single-shot screening data for a number of biological assays, with the goal to reveal natural-product chemical motifs. One of them is an established method based on the data-driven clustering of compounds using a wide range of descriptors, 1 whereas the other method partitions and hierarchically clusters the data to identify chemical cores. 2,3 Both methods successfully find structural scaffolds that significantly hit different groups of discrete drug targets, compared with their relative frequency of demonstrating inhibitory activity in a large number of screens. We describe how these methods can be applied to unveil hidden information in large single-shot HTS data sets. Applied prospectively, this type of information could contribute to the design of new chemical templates for drug-target classes and guide synthetic efforts for lead optimization of tractable hits that are based on natural-product chemical motifs. Relevant findings for 7TM receptors (7TMRs), ion channels, class-7 transferases (protein kinases), hydrolases, and oxidoreductases will be discussed.

This retrovirus infects five-10 million individuals throughout the world. Previously, we developed a database that annotates sequence data from GenBank and the present study aimed to describe the clinical, molecular and epidemiological scenarios of HTLV-1 infection through the stored sequences in this database. A total of 2,545 registered complete and partial sequences of HTLV-1 were collected and 1,967 (77.3%) of those sequences represented unique isolates. Among these isolates, 93% contained geographic origin information and only 39% were related to any clinical status. A total of 1,091 sequences contained information about the geographic origin and viral subtype and 93% of these sequences were identified as subtype "a". Ethnicity data are very scarce. Regarding clinical status data, 29% of the sequences were generated from TSP/HAM and 67.8% from healthy carrier individuals. Although the data mining enabled some inferences about specific aspects of HTLV-1 infection to be made, due to the relative scarcity of data of available sequences, it was not possible to delineate a global scenario of HTLV-1 infection.

Jeffrey			Comparative Sensor Fusion Between Hyperspectral and Multispectral Satellite Sensors for Monitoring Microcystin Distribution in Lake Erie	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Harmful algal bloom; image fusion; machine learning; microcystin; remote sensing	LANDSAT SURFACE REFLECTANCE; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS	Urban growth and agricultural production have caused an influx of nutrients into Lake Erie, leading to eutrophication in the water body. These conditions result in the formation of algal blooms, some of which are toxic due to the presence of Microcystis (a cyanobacteria), which produces the hepatotoxin microcystin. The hepatotoxin microcystin threatens human health and the ecosystem, and it is a concern for water treatment plants using the lake water as a tap water source. This study demonstrates the prototype of a near real-time early warning system using integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) techniques with the aid of both hyperspectral (MERIS) and multispectral (MODIS and Landsat) satellite sensors to determine spatiotemporal microcystin concentrations in Lake Erie. In the proposed IDFM, the MODIS images with high temporal resolution are fused with the MERIS and Landsat images with higher spatial resolution to create synthetic images on a daily basis. The spatiotemporal distributions of microcystin within western Lake Erie were then reconstructed using the band data from the fused products with machine learning or data mining techniques such as genetic programming (GP) models. The performance of the data mining models derived using fused hyperspectral and fused multispectral sensor data are quantified using four statistical indices. These data mining models were further compared with traditional two-band models in terms of microcystin prediction accuracy. This study confirmed that GP models outperformed traditional two-band models, and additional spectral reflectance data offered by hyperspectral sensors produces a noticeable increase in the prediction accuracy especially in the range of low microcystin concentrations.

Tetris Is a Foldback Transposon that Provided the Building Blocks for an Emerging Satellite DNA of Drosophila virilis	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						repetitive DNA; transposable elements; satellite DNA; fiber-FISH; beta-heterochromatin; polytene chromosomes	TERMINAL INVERTED-REPEATS; TANDEM REPEATS; REPETITIVE DNA; EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; SPECIES GROUP; GENOME SIZE; CHROMOSOMAL DISTRIBUTION; EUKARYOTIC GENOMES; UNEQUAL CROSSOVER; BUZZATII CLUSTER	Transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNAs (satDNAs) are abundant components of most eukaryotic genomes studied so far and their impact on evolution has been the focus of several studies. A number of studies linked TEs with satDNAs, but the nature of their evolutionary relationships remains unclear. During in silico analyses of the Drosophila virilis assembled genome, we found a novel DNA transposon we named Tetris based on its modular structure and diversity of rearranged forms. We aimed to characterize Tetris and investigate its role in generating satDNAs. Data mining and sequence analysis showed that Tetris is apparently nonautonomous, with a structure similar to foldback elements, and present in D. virilis and D. americana. Herein, we show that Tetris shares the final portions of its terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) with DAIBAM, a previously described miniature inverted transposable element implicated in the generation of chromosome inversions. Both elements are likely to be mobilized by the same autonomous TE. Tetris TIRs contain approximately 220-bp internal tandem repeats that we have named TIR-220. We also found TIR-220 repeats making up longer (kb-size) satDNA-like arrays. Using bioinformatic, phylogenetic and cytogenomic tools, we demonstrated that Tetris has contributed to shaping the genomes of D. virilis and D. americana, providing internal tandem repeats that served as building blocks for the amplification of satDNA arrays. The beta-heterochromatic genomic environment seemed to have favored such amplification. Our results imply for the first time a role for foldback elements in generating satDNAs.

We illustrate the re-engineering process needed to improve the data quality of a web-based, multicentric stroke registry by proposing a knowledge-based data entry support able to help users to homogeneously interpret data items, and to prevent and detect treacherous errors. The re-engineering also improves stroke units coordination and networking, through ancillary tools for monitoring patient enrollments, calculating stroke care indicators, analyzing compliance with clinical practice guidelines, and entering stroke units profiles. Finally we report on some statistics, such as calculation of indicators for assessing the quality of stroke care, data mining for knowledge discovery, and process mining for comparing different processes of care delivery. The most important results of the re-engineering are an improved user experience with data entry, and a definitely better data quality that guarantees the reliability of data analyses.

Sleep-related problems are common issues with older adults, including shifts in circadian rhythms. A detection method is proposed to identify progressive changes in sleeping activity using a three-step process: partitioning, mining, and measuring. Specifically, the original spatiotemporal representation of each sleeping activity instance was first transformed into a sequence of equal-sized segments, or symbols, via a partitioning process. A data-mining-based algorithm was proposed to find symbols that are not present in all instances of a sleeping activity. Finally, a measuring process was responsible for evaluating the changes in these symbols. Experimental evaluation conducted on a group of datasets of older adults showed that the proposed method is able to identify progressive changes in sleeping activity.

Smart grids are one of these modern systems that have attracted many research activities in recent years. Before utilizing the next generation of smart grids, we should have a comprehensive understanding of the interdependent energy networks and processes. Next-generation energy systems networks cannot be effectively designed, analyzed, and controlled in isolation from the social, economic, sensing, and control contexts in which they operate. In this article, we present a novel framework to support charging and storage infrastructure design for electric vehicles. We develop coordinated clustering techniques to work with network models of urban environments to aid in placement of charging stations for an electrical vehicle deployment scenario. Furthermore, we evaluate the network before and after the deployment of charging stations, to recommend the installation of appropriate storage units to overcome the extra load imposed on the network by the charging stations. We demonstrate the multiple factors that can be simultaneously leveraged in our framework to achieve practical urban deployment. Our ultimate goal is to help realize sustainable energy system management in urban electrical infrastructure by modeling and analyzing networks of interactions between electric systems and urban populations.

J	Ying, JJC; Kuo, WN; Tseng, VS; Lu, EHC				Ying, Josh Jia-Ching; Kuo, Wen-Ning; Tseng, Vincent S.; Lu, Eric Hsueh-Chan			Mining User Check-In Behavior with a Random Walk for Urban Point-of-Interest Recommendations	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Design; Algorithms; Performance; Point-of-interest recommendation; urban computing; data mining; location-based social network; user preference mining	MODEL	In recent years, research into the mining of user check-in behavior for point-of-interest (POI) recommendations has attracted a lot of attention. Existing studies on this topic mainly treat such recommendations in a traditional manner-that is, they treat POIs as items and check-ins as ratings. However, users usually visit a place for reasons other than to simply say that they have visited. In this article, we propose an approach referred to as Urban POI-Walk (UPOI-Walk), which takes into account a user's social-triggered intentions (SI), preference-triggered intentions (PreI), and popularity-triggered intentions (PopI), to estimate the probability of a user checking-in to a POI. The core idea of UPOI-Walk involves building a HITS-based random walk on the normalized check-in network, thus supporting the prediction of POI properties related to each user's preferences. To achieve this goal, we define several user-POI graphs to capture the key properties of the check-in behavior motivated by user intentions. In our UPOI-Walk approach, we propose a new kind of random walk model-Dynamic HITS-based Random Walk-which comprehensively considers the relevance between POIs and users from different aspects. On the basis of similitude, we make an online recommendation as to the POI the user intends to visit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on urban POI recommendations that considers user check-in behavior motivated by SI, PreI, and PopI in location-based social network data. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on two real datasets, the proposed UPOI-Walk is shown to deliver excellent performance.

However, no conclusive evidence exists that a particular statin is more likely to be associated with sleep disturbances versus others. It remains uncertain whether different statins produce different risks for sleep disturbance. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of sleep disturbances, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor (Japan Medical Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan). Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. Data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were included in this study. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. For the ROR, a signal was detected if the lower limit of 95 % two-sided confidence interval (95 % CI) was > 1. Additionally, signal detection using the IC was conducted using the IC025 metric, a lower limit of the 95 % CI of the IC, where a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds 0. In addition, symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of insomnia after using statins over the period of January 2006 to August 2013. In the analyses of the FAERS database, significant signals for sleep disturbances including disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep disorders NEC, sleeping disorders due to a general medical condition, and parasomnias were found. In the prescription sequence symmetry analysis, a significant association between statin use and hypnotic drug use was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.14 (1.03-1.26), 1.20 (1.11-1.29), and 1.18 (1.11-1.25) at intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, respectively. Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases strongly suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for sleep disturbances including insomnia.

Recently, granular association rules have been proposed for cold-start recommendation, where a customer or a product has just entered the system. The current research considers only nominal data. In this paper, we study the impact of discretization approaches on mining semantically richer and stronger rules from numerical data. Specifically, the equal width, the equal frequency, and the k-means approaches are adopted and compared. The setting of interval numbers is a key issue in discretization approaches. Therefore, different settings are compared through experiments on a well-known real life data set. Experimental results show that: 1) discretization is an effective preprocessing technique in mining stronger rules; 2) the appropriate settings of interval numbers are critical to obtaining more rules; 3) the equal frequency approach outperforms the equal width and the k-means approaches; and 4) the recommendation accuracy and the number of recommendations are improved significantly through the discretization approaches.

Matroids are based on linear algebra and graph theory, and have a variety of applications in many fields. Both rough sets and matroids are closely related to lattices. For a serial and transitive relation on a universe, the collection of all the regular sets of the generalized rough set is a lattice. In this paper, we use the lattice to construct a matroid and then study relationships between the lattice and the closed-set lattice of the matroid. First, the collection of all the regular sets based on a serial and transitive relation is proved to be a semimodular lattice. Then, a matroid is constructed through the height function of the semimodular lattice. Finally, we propose an approach to obtain all the closed sets of the matroid from the semimodular lattice. Borrowing from matroids, results show that lattice theory provides an interesting view to investigate rough sets.

The classifiers under consideration include linear discriminate analysis classifier, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors classifier, and the separability indexes include the Davies-Bouldin index and a mutual information based index. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantages and usefulness of the proposed method in high-dimensional feature subset selection.

Such high-dimensional data is by its very nature often quite difficult to handle by conventional machine-learning algorithms. This is considered to be an aspect of the well known curse of dimensionality. Consequently, high-dimensional data needs to be processed with care, which is why the design of machine-learning algorithms needs to take these factors into account. Furthermore, it was observed that some of the arising high-dimensional properties could in fact be exploited in improving overall algorithm design. One such phenomenon, related to nearest-neighbor learning methods, is known as hubness and refers to the emergence of very influential nodes (hubs) in k-nearest neighbor graphs. A crisp weighted voting scheme for the k-nearest neighbor classifier has recently been proposed which exploits this notion. In this paper we go a step further by embracing the soft approach, and propose several fuzzy measures for k-nearest neighbor classification, all based on hubness, which express fuzziness of elements appearing in k-neighborhoods of other points. Experimental evaluation on real data from the UCI repository and the image domain suggests that the fuzzy approach provides a useful measure of confidence in the predicted labels, resulting in improvement over the crisp weighted method, as well as the standard kNN classifier.

By now, many techniques have been developed to detect outliers. However, most existing research focus on numerical data. And they can not directly apply to categorical data because of the difficulty of defining a meaningful similarity measure for categorical data. In this paper, a weighted density definition is given firstly, which takes account of the density and uncertainty of objects in every attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, a simple and effective outlier detection algorithm for categorical data based on the given weighted density is proposed. The corresponding time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed as well. Experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

The HIVToolbox 2 Web System Integrates Sequence, Structure, Function and Mutation Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; HIV-1 REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; METAL-LINKED DIMER; JURKAT T-CELLS; TAT PROTEIN; VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE; HELICAL INTERACTIONS; INHIBITORY-ACTIVITY; VIRAL INFECTIVITY; GP41 PEPTIDES	There is enormous interest in studying HIV pathogenesis for improving the treatment of patients with HIV infection. HIV infection has become one of the best-studied systems for understanding how a virus can hijack a cell. To help facilitate discovery, we previously built HIVToolbox, a web system for visual data mining. The original HIVToolbox integrated information for HIV protein sequence, structure, functional sites, and sequence conservation. This web system has been used for almost 40,000 searches. We report improvements to HIVToolbox including new functions and workflows, data updates, and updates for ease of use. HIVToolbox2, is an improvement over HIVToolbox with new functions. HIVToolbox2 has new functionalities focused on HIV pathogenesis including drug-binding sites, drug-resistance mutations, and immune epitopes. The integrated, interactive view enables visual mining to generate hypotheses that are not readily revealed by other approaches. Most HIV proteins form multimers, and there are posttranslational modification and protein-protein interaction sites at many of these multimerization interfaces. Analysis of protease drug binding sites reveals an anatomy of drug resistance with different types of drug-resistance mutations regionally localized on the surface of protease. Some of these drug-resistance mutations have a high prevalence in specific HIV-1 M subtypes. Finally, consolidation of Tat functional sites reveals a hotspot region where there appear to be 30 interactions or posttranslational modifications. A cursory analysis with HIVToolbox2 has helped to identify several global patterns for HIV proteins. An initial analysis with this tool identifies homomultimerization of almost all HIV proteins, functional sites that overlap with multimerization sites, a global drug resistance anatomy for HIV protease, and specific distributions of some DRMs in specific HIV M subtypes. HIVToolbox2 is an open-access web application available at [http://hivtoolbox2.bio-toolkit.com].

Owing to the emerging drug resistance and the inability of current drugs to prevent re-infection, identification of novel vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents against Taenia solium and related helminth pathogens is a public health priority. The T. solium genome and the predicted proteome were reported recently, providing a wealth of information from which new interventional targets might be identified. In order to characterize and classify the entire repertoire of protease-encoding genes of T. solium, which act fundamental biological roles in all life processes, we analyzed the predicted proteins of this cestode through a combination of bioinformatics tools. Functional annotation was performed to yield insights into the signaling processes relevant to the complex developmental cycle of this tapeworm and to highlight a suite of the proteases as potential intervention targets. Results: Within the genome of this helminth parasite, we identified 200 open reading frames encoding proteases from five clans, which correspond to 1.68% of the 11,902 protein-encoding genes predicted to be present in its genome. These proteases include calpains, cytosolic, mitochondrial signal peptidases, ubiquitylation related proteins, and others. Many not only show significant similarity to proteases in the Conserved Domain Database but have conserved active sites and catalytic domains. KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) analysis indicated that similar to 60% of these proteases share strong sequence identities with proteins of the KEGG database, which are involved in human disease, metabolic pathways, genetic information processes, cellular processes, environmental information processes and organismal systems. Also, we identified signal peptides and transmembrane helices through comparative analysis with classes of important regulatory proteases. Phylogenetic analysis using Bayes approach provided support for inferring functional divergence among regulatory cysteine and serine proteases. Conclusion: Numerous putative proteases were identified for the first time in T. solium, and important regulatory proteases have been predicted. This comprehensive analysis not only complements the growing knowledge base of proteolytic enzymes, but also provides a platform from which to expand knowledge of cestode proteases and to explore their biochemistry and potential as intervention targets.

We aimed to analyze health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subgroups of eating disorder (ED) patients by using the brief version of WHOQoL questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF) before treatment administration. Moreover, in order to compare our findings with other published data, we carried out a comprehensive review of the literature on HRQoL in ED patients. Methods: Our review was carried out by means of an accurate data mining of PsychInfo and Medline databases and other available sources. In our cross-sectional study, eighty female ED patients (26 with bulimia nervosa, 33 with anorexia nervosa, 7 with binge eating disorder and 14 with ED not otherwise specified) completed the WHOQoL-BREF. HRQoL scores were compared among ED subgroups and clinical information (presence of previous contacts, length of illness, psychiatric comorbidity) was considered in the analysis. Results: Our review shows that with few exceptions ED patients have a poorer HRQoL than the healthy population of control and sometimes the mental component of HRQoL is the most involved dimension. Moreover, there are no differences in the HRQoL among ED groups, even if AN patients in some studies have a lower HRQoL scores. Furthermore, BED patients have a poorer HRQoL than obese patients who do not have binge episodes. Finally, all treatments were positively correlated with an improvement on general and specific QoL dimensions. In our sample, ED subgroups differed only for Psychological Health HRQoL scores (F = 4.072, df = 3; p = 0.01). No differences were found between inpatients and outpatients, treatment naive and previously treated patients and patients with or without psychiatric comorbidity. Moreover, HRQoL scores were not correlated to length of illness within each ED subgroup. Conclusions: The analysis of the literature adds some relevant information on HRQoL in ED and may address the future research toward the exploration of specific questions. One of these may be the prominent role of Psychological Health domain in HRQoL, since our study confirms that this component is able to differentiate eating disorders.

Interestingly, children with developmental dyslexia-a learning disability that affects reading acquisition despite normal intelligence and adequate education-have a poor rhythmic perception. It has been suggested that an accurate perception of rhythmical/metrical structure,, that requires accurate perception of rise time, may be critical for phonological development and subsequent literacy. This hypothesis is mostly based on results showing a high degree of correlation between phonological awareness and metrical skills, using a very specific metrical task. We present new findings from the analysis of a sample of 48 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without comorbidities. These children were assessed with neuropsychological tests, as well as specifically-devised psychoacoustic and musical tasks mostly testing temporal abilities. Associations were tested by multivariate analyses including data mining strategies, correlations and most importantly logistic regressions to understand to what extent the different auditory and musical skills can be a robust predictor of reading and phonological skills. Results show a strong link between several temporal skills and phonological and reading abilities. These findings are discussed in the framework of the neuroscience literature comparing music and language processing,	[Flaugnacco, Elena; Zoia, Stefania] IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Pediat Inst, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Child Neurol & Psychiat Ward, Trieste, Italy; [Flaugnacco, Elena; Sila, Alessandra] Ctr Child Hlth Onlus, Trieste, Italy; [Lopez, Luisa; Terribili, Chiara; Buda, Sonia; Tilli, Sara] Villaggio Eugenio Litta, Dev Neuropsychiat Ward, Rome, Italy; [Monasta, Lorenzo; Montico, Marcella] IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Pediat Inst, Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Epidemiol & Biostat Unit, Trieste, Italy; [Schoen, Daniele] Aix Marseille Univ, Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Schoen, Daniele] INSERM, U1106, F-13258 Marseille, France	Schon, D (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Med Timone, Inst Neurosci Syst, UMR 1106, Aile Rouge 5eme Etage,27 Bd Jean Moulin, F-13005 Marseille, France.	daniele.schon@univ-amu.fr	Ronfani, Luca/B-6668-2013; Schon, Daniele/B-2484-2013; Montico, Marcella/B-5290-2013; Monasta, Lorenzo/B-1388-2012	Ronfani, Luca/0000-0001-5710-3914; Montico, Marcella/0000-0003-0377-8232; Monasta, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7774-548X	Mariani Foundation [R-11-85]	This work was funded by the Mariani Foundation, grant no.

The problem is analogous to cluster analysis in data mining, a field rich in metric space-based methods. Common to these methods is a geometric, distance-based definition of clusters or communities. Here we propose a new geometric approach to graph community detection based on graph Voronoi diagrams. Our method serves as proof of principle that the definition of appropriate distance metrics on graphs can bring a rich set of metric space-based clustering methods to network science. We employ a simple edge metric that reflects the intra- or inter-community character of edges, and a graph density-based rule to identify seed nodes of Voronoi cells. Our algorithm outperforms most network community detection methods applicable to large networks on benchmark as well as real-world networks.

By creating dummy variables and identifying important variables, not only is the prediction performance increased without increasing investment in equipment, but also important variables are obtained concerning the important locations of equipment in order to effectively assist public transit agencies with system maintenance. The experimental results for a segment of 36.1 km of National Freeway No. 1, Taiwan, with non-recurrent congestion show that, whether or not the data generated by the Electronic Toll Collection (etc) system is used as input variables, the travel time prediction method developed in this study is able to improve the prediction performance. Meanwhile, the proposed approach also reduces the percentage of samples with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) > 20%. Furthermore, in this study, important variables are extracted from the decision tree in order to predict the travel time. Finally, the prediction models constructed in accordance with six scenarios are highly accurate due to the low MAPE values, which are from 6% to 9%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This algorithm employs a niche technique combined with a population archive in order to identify the rules that are more suitable for classifying items amongst classes of a given data set. The algorithm is implemented in such a way that the user can choose the function set that is more adequate for a given application. This feature makes the proposed approach virtually applicable to any kind of data set classification problem. Besides, the classification problem is modeled as a multi-objective one, in which the maximization of the accuracy and the minimization of the classifier complexity are considered as the objective functions. A set of different classification problems, with considerably different data sets and domains, has been considered: wines, patients with hepatitis, incipient faults in power transformers and level of development of cities. In this last data set, some of the attributes are geographical, and they are expressed as points, lines or polygons. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been compared with three other methods, widely employed for classification: Decision Tree (C4.5), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Statistical comparisons have been conducted employing one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests, in order to provide reliable comparison of the methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieved better classification effectiveness in all tested instances, what suggests that it is suitable for a considerable range of classification applications.

Data mining for rapid prediction of facility fit and debottlenecking of biomanufacturing facilities	JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Biopharmaceutical manufacture; Stochastic discrete-event simulation; Decision tree classification; Multivariate data analysis; Data mining	FED-BATCH; CROSS-VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; TOOL; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; TREES	Higher titre processes can pose facility fit challenges in legacy biopharmaceutical purification suites with capacities originally matched to lower titre processes. Bottlenecks caused by mismatches in equipment sizes, combined with process fluctuations upon scale-up, can result in discarding expensive product. This paper describes a data mining decisional tool for rapid prediction of facility fit issues and debottlenecking of biomanufacturing facilities exposed to batch-to-batch variability and higher titres. The predictive tool comprised advanced multivariate analysis techniques to interrogate Monte Carlo stochastic simulation datasets that mimicked batch fluctuations in cell culture titres, step yields and chromatography eluate volumes. A decision tree classification method, CART (classification and regression tree) was introduced to explore the impact of these process fluctuations on product mass loss and reveal the root causes of bottlenecks. The resulting pictorial decision tree determined a series of if-then rules for the critical combinations of factors that lead to different mass loss levels. Three different debottlenecking strategies were investigated involving changes to equipment sizes, using higher capacity chromatography resins and elution buffer optimisation. The analysis compared the impact of each strategy on mass output, direct cost of goods per gram and processing time, as well as consideration of extra capital investment and space requirements.

Lack of relevant, accurate and timely data for research to inform policy may negatively impact public health. The aim of this study was to test if the careful removal of items from two community nutrition surveys guided by a data mining technique called feature selection, can (a) identify a reduced dataset, while (b) not damaging the signal inside that data. Methods: The Nutrition Environment Measures Surveys for stores (NEMS-S) and restaurants (NEMS-R) were completed on 885 retail food outlets in two counties in West Virginia between May and November of 2011. A reduced dataset was identified for each outlet type using feature selection. Coefficients from linear regression modeling were used to weight items in the reduced datasets. Weighted item values were summed with the error term to compute reduced item survey scores. Scores produced by the full survey were compared to the reduced item scores using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Feature selection identified 9 store and 16 restaurant survey items as significant predictors of the score produced from the full survey. The linear regression models built from the reduced feature sets had R-2 values of 92% and 94% for restaurant and grocery store data, respectively. Conclusions: While there are many potentially important variables in any domain, the most useful set may only be a small subset. The use of feature selection in the initial phase of data collection to identify the most influential variables may be a useful tool to greatly reduce the amount of data needed thereby reducing cost.

Methods: Serum total under-O-glycosylated IgA1 levels were quantified in 32 IgAN patients by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with Helix aspersa (HAA) lectin. Serum under-O-glycosylated polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1) was selectively measured by an original method using mouse Fc alpha/mu receptor (mFc alpha/mu R) transfectant and flow cytometry (pIgA1 trap). The percentage area of IgA deposition in the whole glomeruli (Area-IgA) was quantified by image analysis on the immunofluorescence of biopsy specimens. Correlations were assessed between the Area-IgA and data from HAA-ELISA or pIgA1 trap. The relationships between clinical parameters and data from HAA-ELISA or pIgA1 trap were analyzed by data mining approach. Results: While the under-O-glycosylated IgA1 levels in IgAN patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls when measured (p < 0.05), there was no significant difference in under-O-glycosylated pIgA1. There was neither a correlation observed between the data from HAA-ELISA and pIgA1 trap (r(2) = 0.09) in the IgAN patients (r(2) = 0.005) nor was there a linear correlation between Area-IgA and data from HAA-ELISA or the pIgA1 trap (r(2) = 0.005, 0.03, respectively). Contour plots of clinical parameters versus data from HAA-ELISA and the pIgA1 trap revealed that patients with a high score in each clinical parameter concentrated in specific areas, showing that patients with specific O-glycan profiles of IgA1 have similar clinical parameters. A decision tree analysis suggested that dominant immune complexes in glomeruli were consisted of: 1) IgA1-IgG and complements, 2) pIgA1 and complements, and 3) monomeric IgA1-IgA or aggregated monomeric IgA1. Conclusions: Serum under-O-glycosylated IgA1 levels are not correlated with glomerular IgA deposition based upon heterogeneity in the composition of glomerular immune complexes in IgAN patients.

Previous studies have suggested that arsenic vacuole compartmentalization may play an important role in the arsenic-hyperaccumulation in P. vittata, but the mechanism(s) of arsenic transport to vacuole are largely unknown. We obtained tonoplast isolated from fronds of P. vittata sporophyte grown under minus and 1 mM arsenate for 3 weeks by iodixanol step gradient centrifugation method, and then used TMPP protein labeling technology followed by liquid chromatography a linear ion trap-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer analysis for the quantitative detection of proteins. And we designed and used an "artificial" database for database searching. In total, 56 tonoplast proteins were identified; more than 70% of them were transport proteins. Under arsenate treatment, one TDT transporter protein, a member of the TerC family and a PDR-like protein were upregulated differentially. While V-ATPase subunits c, E, and G, and V-PPase, were downregulated. Additionally, the identified tonoplast proteins in our present study provide an informative basis for arsenic carriers or channels and help to clarify the regulation of tonoplast arsenic transport processes in P. vittata. Biological significance Vacuole compartmentalization is crucial to As hyperaccumulator P. vittata, while there is limited known arsenic transport proteins involved in vacuole compartmentalization. In this paper, we obtained tonoplast of P. vittata fronds by iodixanol step gradient centrifugation method and then used TMPP protein labeling proteome technology for the quantitative detection of fronds tonoplast proteins. Our findings are the first challenge to the tonoplast proteins data mining of P. vittata which provide an informative basis for As carriers or channels. The proteomic approach in our study is suited for detecting alterations tonoplast protein and help to clarify the regulation of tonoplast transport processes.

Due to multifactorial nature of secondary injury and subsequent complex cellular responses, much of the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study used an adult zebrafish cerebellum injury model to investigate the phenotypes and the secondary injury responses for recovery mechanisms of injured brain. Using the time course microarray analysis, a candidate protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was refined as cerebellar wound healing PPI network by dynamic modeling and big data mining. Pathway enrichment and ontological analysis were incorporated into the refined network to highlight the main molecular scheme of cerebellar wound healing. Several significant pathways, including chemokine, Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases, and axon guidance signaling pathway and their cross-talks through PI3K, PAK2, and PLXNA3 were identified to coordinate for neurogenesis and angiogenesis, which are essential for the restoration of the injured brain. Our finding provides an insight into the molecular restoration mechanisms after traumatic brain injury, and open up new opportunity to devise the treatment for traumatic brain injury in human.

Recently, mining high utility itemsets has emerged as one of the most significant research issues due to a huge range of real world applications such as retail market data analysis and stock market prediction. Although many relevant algorithms have been proposed in recent years, they incur the problem of generating a large number of candidate itemsets, which degrade mining performance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MU-Growth (Maximum Utility Growth) with two techniques for pruning candidates effectively in mining process. Moreover, we suggest a tree structure, named MIQ-Tree (Maximum Item Quantity Tree), which captures database information with a single-pass. The proposed data structure is restructured for reducing overestimated utilities. Performance evaluation shows that MU-Growth not only decreases the number of candidates but also outperforms state-of-the-art tree-based algorithms with overestimated methods in terms of runtime with a similar memory usage.

This study proposes an optimized hybrid artificial intelligence model to integrate a fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA) with a support vector machine (SVM). The fmGA-based SVM (GASVM) is used for early prediction of dispute propensity in the initial phase of public-private partnership projects. Particularly, the SVM mainly provides learning and curve fitting while the fmGA optimizes SVM parameters. Measures in term of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve and synthesis index are used for performance evaluation of proposed hybrid intelligence classification model.

Thus, in order to control noise sound level in urban areas, it is very important to develop methods for modelling the road traffic noise. As observed in the literature, the models that deal with this issue are mainly based on regression analysis, while other approaches are very rare. In this paper a novel approach for modelling traffic noise that is based on optimization is presented. Four optimization techniques were used in simulation in this work: genetic algorithms, Hooke and Jeeves algorithm, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. Two different scenarios are presented in this paper. In the first scenario the optimization methods use the whole measurement dataset to find the most suitable parameters, whereas in the second scenario optimized parameters were found using only some of the measurement data, while the rest of the data was used to evaluate the predictive capabilities of the model. The goodness of the model is evaluated by the coefficient of determination and other statistical parameters, and results show agreement of high extent between measured data and calculated values in both scenarios. In addition, the model was compared with classical statistical model, and superior capabilities of proposed model were demonstrated. The simulations were done using the originally developed user friendly software package. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Merrill, from China, Japan, and Korea was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The profiles of 12 isoflavones identified from the grains were subjected to data-mining processes, including partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Pearson's correlation analysis, and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Although PLS-DA did not reveal significant differences among extracts of soybean from 3 countries, the results clearly show that the variation between varieties was low. The CS02554 variety was separate from the others in the first 2 principal components of PLS-DA. HCA of these phytochemicals resulted in clusters derived from closely related biochemical pathways. Daidzin, genistin, and glycitin contents were significantly correlated with their respective malonyl glycoside contents. Daidzein content correlated positively with genistein content (r = 0.8189, P < 0.0001). The CS02554 variety appears to be a good candidate for future breeding programs, as it contains high levels of isoflavone compounds. These results demonstrate the use of metabolite profiling combined with chemometrics as a tool for assessing the quality of food and identifying metabolic links in biological systems.

BioPlat: a software for human cancer biomarker discovery	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							UPDATE; GEO	Development of effective tools such as oligo-microarrays and next-generation sequencing methods for monitoring gene expression on a large scale has resulted in the discovery of gene signatures with prognostic/predictive value in various malignant neoplastic diseases. However, with the exponential growth of gene expression databases, biologists are faced with the challenge of extracting useful information from these repositories. Here, we present a software package, BioPlat (Biomarkers Platform), which allows biologists to identify novel prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers based on the data mining of gene expression signatures and gene expression profiling databases. BioPlat has been designed as an easy-to-use and flexible desktop software application, which provides a set of analytical tools related to data extraction, preprocessing, filtering, gene expression signature calculation, in silico validation, feature selection and annotation that leverage the integration and reuse of gene expression signatures in the context of follow-up data.

It showed the highest activity toward an aliphatic beta-keto ester, ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE), but much lower activity toward bulkier alpha-keto esters with an aromatic group, such as methyl ortho-chlorobenzoylformate (CBFM) and ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (OPBE). By rational design of the active pocket, the substrate specificity of the reductase was significantly altered and this tailor-made reductase showed a much higher activity toward aromatic alpha-keto esters (similar to 7-fold increase in k(cat)/K-m toward CBFM) and lower activity toward aliphatic keto esters (similar to 12-fold decrease in k(cat)/K-m toward COBE). Meanwhile, the thermostability of the reductase was enhanced by a consensus approach.

Nevertheless, with the dramatic increase in data volume, the current approaches prove inefficient when dealing with large input datasets, a large number of different symbols and low minimum supports. In this paper, we propose a new sequential pattern mining algorithm, which follows a pattern-growth scheme to discover sequential patterns. Unlike most pattern growth algorithms, our approach does not build a data structure to represent the input dataset, but instead accesses the required sequences through pseudo-projection databases, achieving better runtime and reducing memory requirements. Our algorithm traverses the search space in a depth-first fashion and only preserves in memory a pattern node linkage and the pseudo-projections required for the branch being explored at the time. Experimental results show that our new approach, the Node Linkage Depth-First Traversal algorithm (NLDFT), has better performance and scalability in comparison with state of the art algorithms.

We present a data-mining approach to identify suitable substrates for the growth of two-dimensional materials and apply the method to the recently predicted two-dimensional III-V compounds. We identify several lattice-matched substrates for their epitaxial growth, stabilization, and functionalization. Density-functional calculations show that these substrates sufficiently reduce the formation energies of the metastable two-dimensional materials to make them thermodynamically stable. We show that chemical interactions of the two-dimensional materials with the substrates shift the Fermi level of these materials, resulting in doping. The large adsorption energies and strong doping indicate that these metals should provide good electrical contact to enable transport measurements and electronic applications.

In this paper, we propose a new approach which constructs a low-dimensional MBR by directly transforming a high-dimensional MBR (called MBR-transformation) bounding the high-dimensional sequences. This approach significantly reduces the number of lower-dimensional transformations needed in similar sequence matching. However, it poses a risk that some transformed sequences may fall outside the transformed lowdimensional MBR. We thus propose safe MBR-transformation which has the property that every possible transformed sequence is inside a safe MBR-transformed MBR. Then, considering the discrete Fourier transform (DM) and the discrete Cosine transform (DCT), we prove that they are not safe as MBR-transformations, and modify them to become safe MBR-transformations (called mbrDFT if DFF-based and mbrDCT if DCT-based). Then, we prove the safeness and optimality of mbrDFT and mbrDCT. Analyses and experiments show that the mbrDFF and mbrDCT reduce the execution time by several orders of magnitude due to the reduction in the number of lower-dimensional transformations. The proposed safe MBR-transformation provides a useful framework for a variety of applications that require a direct transformation of a high-dimensional MBR to a low-dimensional MBR.

Most of discretization methods mainly concentrate on discretizing low-dimensional data. In this paper, we focus on discretizing high-dimensional data that frequently present the nonlinear structures. Firstly, we present a novel supervised dimension reduction algorithm to map high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space, which ensures to keep intrinsic correlation structure of the original data. This algorithm overcomes the deficiency that the geometric topology of the data is easily distorted when mapping data that present an uneven distribution in high-dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data discretization with a dimension reduction technique. Secondly, we propose a supervised area-based chi-square discretization algorithm to effectively discretize each continuous dimension in the low-dimensional space. This algorithm overcomes the deficiency that existing methods do not consider the possibility of being merged for each interval pair from the view of probability. Finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method achieves higher classification accuracy and yields a more concise knowledge of the data especially for high-dimensional datasets than existing discretization methods. In addition, our discretization method has also been successfully applied to computer vision and image classification. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reactome is a manually curated open-source resource of human pathways. It is accessible via a website, available as downloads in standard reusable formats and via Representational State Transfer (REST)-ful and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) application programming interfaces (APIs). We have devised a controlled vocabulary (CV) that creates concise, unambiguous and unique names for reactions (pathway events) and all the molecular entities they involve. The CV could be reapplied in any situation where names are used for pathway entities and events. Adoption of this CV would significantly improve naming consistency and readability, with consequent benefits for searching and data mining within and between databases.

Identification of host-microbe interaction factors in the genomes of soft rot-associated pathogens Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 with supervised machine learning	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Data mining; Plant pathogen; Genome scale analysis; Enterobacteria	BACTERIUM ERWINIA-CHRYSANTHEMI; PROTEIN SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; HORIZONTAL GENE-TRANSFER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; SUBSP CAROTOVORA; CODON USAGE; PHYSICOCHEMICAL FEATURES; FEATURE-SELECTION	Background: A wealth of genome sequences has provided thousands of genes of unknown function, but identification of functions for the large numbers of hypothetical genes in phytopathogens remains a challenge that impacts all research on plant-microbe interactions. Decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. Computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. The former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. The latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction. Result: In this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. The soft rot Enterobacteriaceae strains Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 were used for development of this tool, because these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the Enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. Our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests. Conclusion: Application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. These lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens.

Global analysis of ZNF217 chromatin occupancy in the breast cancer cell genome reveals an association with ERalpha	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Breast cancer; ZNF217; ERalpha; GATA3; FOXA1; ChIP-seq; RNA-seq; Endocrine resistance	ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR BINDING; GENE-EXPRESSION; RNA-SEQ; HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; FOXA1; PROGNOSIS; ONCOGENE; COMPLEX; DIFFERENTIATION	Background: The ZNF217 gene, encoding a C2H2 zinc finger protein, is located at 20q13 and found amplified and overexpressed in greater than 20% of breast tumors. Current studies indicate ZNF217 drives tumorigenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms of ZNF217 are largely unknown. Because ZNF217 associates with chromatin modifying enzymes, we postulate that ZNF217 functions to regulate specific gene signaling networks. Here, we present a large-scale functional genomic analysis of ZNF217, which provides insights into the regulatory role of ZNF217 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Results: ChIP-seq analysis reveals that the majority of ZNF217 binding sites are located at distal regulatory regions associated with the chromatin marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1. Analysis of ChIP-seq transcription factor binding sites shows clustering of ZNF217 with FOXA1, GATA3 and ERalpha binding sites, supported by the enrichment of corresponding motifs for the ERalpha-associated cis-regulatory sequences. ERalpha expression highly correlates with ZNF217 in lysates from breast tumors (n = 15), and ERalpha co-precipitates ZNF217 and its binding partner CtBP2 from nuclear extracts. Transcriptome profiling following ZNF217 depletion identifies differentially expressed genes co-bound by ZNF217 and ERalpha; gene ontology suggests a role for ZNF217-ERalpha in expression programs associated with ER+ breast cancer studies found in the Molecular Signature Database. Data-mining of expression data from breast cancer patients correlates ZNF217 with reduced overall survival. Conclusions: Our genome-wide ZNF217 data suggests a functional role for ZNF217 at ERalpha target genes. Future studies will investigate whether ZNF217 expression contributes to aberrant ERalpha regulatory events in ER+ breast cancer and hormone resistance.

They are synthesized on modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme complexes by a conserved thiotemplate mechanism. Here, we report thewidespread occurrence of NRPS and PKS genetic machinery across the three domains of life with the discovery of 3,339 gene clusters from 991 organisms, by examining a total of 2,699 genomes. These gene clusters display extraordinarily diverse organizations, and a total of 1,147 hybrid NRPS/PKS clusters were found. Surprisingly, 10% of bacterial gene clusters lacked modular organization, and instead catalytic domains were mostly encoded as separate proteins. The finding of common occurrence of nonmodular NRPS differs substantially from the current classification. Sequence analysis indicates that the evolution of NRPS machineries was driven by a combination of common descent and horizontal gene transfer. We identified related siderophore NRPS gene clusters that encoded modular and nonmodular NRPS enzymes organized in a gradient. A higher frequency of the NRPS and PKS gene clusters was detected from bacteria compared with archaea or eukarya. They commonly occurred in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria in bacteria and the phylum of Ascomycota in fungi. The majority of these NRPS and PKS gene clusters have unknown end products highlighting the power of genome mining in identifying novel genetic machinery for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

Reconstruction of biological networks from measured data of different components is a significant challenge in systems biology. Results: We use an information theoretic approach to reconstruct phosphoprotein-cytokine networks in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Cytokines are secreted upon activation of a wide range of regulatory signals transduced by the phosphoprotein network. Identifying these components can help identify regulatory modules responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. The information theoretic approach is based on estimation of mutual information of interactions by using kernel density estimators. Mutual information provides a measure of statistical dependencies between interacting components. Using the topology of the network derived, we develop a data-driven parsimonious input-output model of the phosphoprotein-cytokine network. Conclusions: We demonstrate the applicability of our information theoretic approach to reconstruction of biological networks. For the phosphoprotein-cytokine network, this approach not only captures most of the known signaling components involved in cytokine release but also predicts new signaling components involved in the release of cytokines. The results of this study are important for gaining a clear understanding of macrophage activation during the inflammation process.

Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) has shown promise in resolving the dynamics of living cells at the individual level and to uncover population heterogeneities in comparison to established approaches such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Given that the number of single-cells would be massive in any experiment, the power of Raman profiling technique for single-cell analysis would be fully utilized only when coupled with a high-throughput and intelligent process control and data analysis system. In this work, we established QSpec, an automatic system that supports high-throughput Raman-based single-cell phenotyping. Additionally, a single-cell Raman profile database has been established upon which data-mining could be applied to discover the heterogeneity among single-cells under different conditions. To test the effectiveness of this control and data analysis system, a sub-system was also developed to simulate the phenotypes of single-cells as well as the device features.

J	Mavroeidis, D; Marchiori, E				Mavroeidis, Dimitrios; Marchiori, Elena			Feature selection for k-means clustering stability: theoretical analysis and an algorithm	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Sparse PCA; Stability; Feature selection; Clustering	CANCER	Stability of a learning algorithm with respect to small input perturbations is an important property, as it implies that the derived models are robust with respect to the presence of noisy features and/or data sample fluctuations. The qualitative nature of the stability property enhardens the development of practical, stability optimizing, data mining algorithms as several issues naturally arise, such as: how "much" stability is enough, or how can stability be effectively associated with intrinsic data properties. In the context of this work we take into account these issues and explore the effect of stability maximization in the continuous (PCA-based) k-means clustering problem. Our analysis is based on both mathematical optimization and statistical arguments that complement each other and allow for the solid interpretation of the algorithm's stability properties. Interestingly, we derive that stability maximization naturally introduces a tradeoff between cluster separation and variance, leading to the selection of features that have a high cluster separation index that is not artificially inflated by the features variance. The proposed algorithmic setup is based on a Sparse PCA approach, that selects the features that maximize stability in a greedy fashion. In our study, we also analyze several properties of Sparse PCA relevant to stability that promote Sparse PCA as a viable feature selection mechanism for clustering. The practical relevance of the proposed method is demonstrated in the context of cancer research, where we consider the problem of detecting potential tumor biomarkers using microarray gene expression data. The application of our method to a leukemia dataset shows that the tradeoff between cluster separation and variance leads to the selection of features corresponding to important biomarker genes. Some of them have relative low variance and are not detected without the direct optimization of stability in Sparse PCA based k-means. Apart from the qualitative evaluation, we have also verified our approach as a feature selection method for -means clustering using four cancer research datasets. The quantitative empirical results illustrate the practical utility of our framework as a feature selection mechanism for clustering.

A utility concession curve data fitting model for quantitative analysis of negotiation styles	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Utility concession curve; Negotiation style; Reciprocal function; Data fitting; Data mining; Negotiations	AUTOMATED NEGOTIATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AGENTS; INFORMATION; SOFTWARE; SUPPORT; DESIGN	A reciprocal function is proposed for defining the utility concession curve of a negotiation participant. The curve has only one free parameter and can fit the complete range of negotiation styles from extremely competitive to extremely collaborative. Various equations are derived, including the definition of a utility concession curve center which permits intuitive quantifying of a utility concession curve. Subsequently, an optimization model is proposed to fit the curve to a set of offers. Using the proposed model, a set of negotiations is mined for utility concession curves which are then used for clustering and hypothesis testing. Three negotiations styles seem to emerge from the data; slightly collaborative, neutral and quite competitive. It is also shown quantitatively that the level of competitiveness of the counterpart is negatively correlated with the agreement rate, and this is validated against the experimental treatment. Additionally, by the use of an experimental treatment, it is shown that the level of competitiveness of the counterpart has a positive causal impact on the negotiator's style, causing him to become more competitive or collaborative. The data fitting model can also be used for incrementally fitting the curve in real-time during a negotiation to provide an estimate of the negotiation style which may help in the negotiation process.

J	Beiranvand, V; Mobasher-Kashani, M; Abu Bakar, A				Beiranvand, Vahid; Mobasher-Kashani, Mohamad; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza			Multi-objective PSO algorithm for mining numerical association rules without a priori discretization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Multi-objective optimization; Association rules; Evolutionary algorithms	ANT COLONY SYSTEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DATABASES; TAIWAN	In the domain of association rules mining (ARM) discovering the rules for numerical attributes is still a challenging issue. Most of the popular approaches for numerical ARM require a priori data discretization to handle the numerical attributes. Moreover, in the process of discovering relations among data, often more than one objective (quality measure) is required, and in most cases, such objectives include conflicting measures. In such a situation, it is recommended to obtain the optimal trade-off between objectives. This paper deals with the numerical ARM problem using a multi-objective perspective by proposing a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (i.e., MOPAR) for numerical ARM that discovers numerical association rules (ARs) in only one single step. To identify more efficient ARs, several objectives are defined in the proposed multi-objective optimization approach, including confidence, comprehensibility, and interestingness. Finally, by using the Pareto optimality the best ARs are extracted. To deal with numerical attributes, we use rough values containing lower and upper bounds to show the intervals of attributes. In the experimental section of the paper, we analyze the effect of operators used in this study, compare our method to the most popular evolutionary-based proposals for ARM and present an analysis of the mined ARs. The results show that MOPAR extracts reliable (with confidence values close to 95%), comprehensible, and interesting numerical ARs when attaining the optimal trade-off between confidence, comprehensibility and interestingness.

J	Kim, JS				Kim, Jin Sung			Development of a Composite Knowledge Manipulation Tool: K-Expert	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Database (DB); Data mining (DM); Decision support; Expert systems (ES); Knowledge base (KB); Knowledge management systems (KMS)	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; PERSPECTIVE; DIAGNOSIS	A goal of this study is to develop a Composite Knowledge Manipulation Tool (CKMT). Some of traditional medical activities are rely heavily on the oral transfer of knowledge, with the risk of losing important knowledge. Moreover, the activities differ according to the regions, traditions, experts' experiences, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an integrated and consistent knowledge manipulation tool. By using the tool, it will be possible to extract the tacit knowledge consistently, transform different types of knowledge into a composite knowledge base (KB), integrate disseminated and complex knowledge, and complement the lack of knowledge. For the reason above, I have developed the CKMT called as K-Expert and it has four advanced functionalities as follows. Firstly, it can extract/import logical rules from data mining (DM) with the minimum of effort. I expect that the function can complement the oral transfer of traditional knowledge. Secondly, it transforms the various types of logical rules into database (DB) tables after the syntax checking and/or transformation. In this situation, knowledge managers can refine, evaluate, and manage the huge-sized composite KB consistently with the support of the DB management systems (DBMS). Thirdly, it visualizes the transformed knowledge in the shape of decision tree (DT). With the function, the knowledge workers can evaluate the completeness of the KB and complement the lack of knowledge. Finally, it gives SQL-based backward chaining function to the knowledge users. It could reduce the inference time effectively since it is based on SQL query and searching not the sentence-by-sentence translation used in the traditional inference systems. The function will give the young researchers and their fellows in the field of knowledge management (KM) and expert systems (ES) more opportunities to follow up and validate their knowledge. Finally, I expect that the approach can present the advantages of mitigating knowledge loss and the burdens of knowledge transformation and complementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Huang, SY; Tsaih, RH; Yu, F				Huang, Shin-Ying; Tsaih, Rua-Huan; Yu, Fang			Topological pattern discovery and feature extraction for fraudulent financial reporting	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Unsupervised learning; Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map; Data mining; Fraudulent financial reporting	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GHSOM; SEGMENTATION; PREDICTION; DISTRESS; TAIWAN; RISK; SOM	Fraudulent financial reporting (FFR) involves conscious efforts to mislead others regarding the financial condition of a business. It usually consists of deliberate actions to deceive regulators, investors or the general public that also hinder systematic approaches from effective detection. The challenge comes from distinguishing dichotomous samples that have their major attributes falling in the same distribution. This study pioneers a novel dual GHSOM (Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map) approach to discover the topological patterns of FFR, achieving effective FFR detection and feature extraction. Specifically, the proposed approach uses fraudulent samples and non-fraudulent samples to train a pair of dual GHSOMs under the same training parameters and examines the hypotheses for counterpart relationships among their subgroups taking advantage of unsupervised learning nature and growing hierarchical structures from GHSOMs. This study further presents (1) an effective classification rule to detect FFR based on the topological patterns and (2) an expert-competitive feature extraction mechanism to capture the salient characteristics of fraud behaviors. The experimental results against 762 annual financial statements from 144 public-traded companies in Taiwan (out of which 72 are fraudulent and 72 are non-fraudulent) reveal that the topological pattern of FFR follows the non-fraud-central spatial relationship, as well as shows the promise of using the topological patterns for FFR detection and feature extraction.

Raw data faces various challenges that make traditional method improper for knowledge extraction. Data mining is supposed to be able to handle various data types in all formats. Relevance of this paper is emphasized by the fact that data mining is an object of research in different areas. In this paper, we review previous works in the context of knowledge extraction from medical data. The main idea in this paper is to describe key papers and provide some guidelines to help medical practitioners. Medical data mining is a multidisciplinary field with contribution of medicine and data mining. Due to this fact, previous works should be classified to cover all users' requirements from various fields. Because of this, we have studied papers with the aim of extracting knowledge from structural medical data published between 1999 and 2013. We clarify medical data mining and its main goals. Therefore, each paper is studied based on the six medical tasks: screening, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, monitoring and management. In each task, five data mining approaches are considered: classification, regression, clustering, association and hybrid. At the end of each task, a brief summarization and discussion are stated. A standard framework according to CRISP-DM is additionally adapted to manage all activities. As a discussion, current issue and future trend are mentioned. The amount of the works published in this scope is substantial and it is impossible to discuss all of them on a single work. We hope this paper will make it possible to explore previous works and identify interesting areas for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A framework for cost-based feature selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Cost-based feature selection; Machine learning; Filter methods	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION	Over the last few years, the dimensionality of datasets involved in data mining applications has increased dramatically. In this situation, feature selection becomes indispensable as it allows for dimensionality reduction and relevance detection. The research proposed in this paper broadens the scope of feature selection by taking into consideration not only the relevance of the features but also their associated costs. A new general framework is proposed, which consists of adding a new term to the evaluation function of a filter feature selection method so that the cost is taken into account. Although the proposed methodology could be applied to any feature selection filter, in this paper the approach is applied to two representative filter methods: Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and Minimal-Redundancy-Maximal-Relevance (mRMR), as an example of use. The behavior of the proposed framework is tested on 17 heterogeneous classification datasets, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The results of the experimental study show that the approach is sound and that it allows the user to reduce the cost without compromising the classification error. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, CH				Chen, Chien-Hsing			A hybrid intelligent model of analyzing clinical breast cancer data using clustering techniques with feature selection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Breast cancer diagnoses; Feature selection; Cluster analysis; Filter model; Wrapper model	MUTUAL INFORMATION; SEPARATION; DIAGNOSIS	Models based on data mining and machine learning techniques have been developed to detect the disease early or assist in clinical breast cancer diagnoses. Feature selection is commonly applied to improve the performance of models. There are numerous studies on feature selection in the literature, and most of the studies focus on feature selection in supervised learning. When class labels are absent, feature selection methods in unsupervised learning are required. However, there are few studies on these methods in the literature. Our paper aims to present a hybrid intelligence model that uses the cluster analysis techniques with feature selection for analyzing clinical breast cancer diagnoses. Our model provides an option of selecting a subset of salient features for performing clustering and comprehensively considers the use of most existing models that use all the features to perform clustering. In particular, we study the methods by selecting salient features to identify clusters using a comparison of coincident quantitative measurements. When applied to benchmark breast cancer datasets, experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several benchmark filter- and wrapper-based methods in selecting features used to discover natural clusters, maximizing the between-cluster scatter and minimizing the within-cluster scatter toward a satisfactory clustering quality.

J	Wang, SJ; Eick, CF				Wang, Sujing; Eick, Christoph F.			A polygon-based clustering and analysis framework for mining spatial datasets	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Spatial data mining; Dissimilarity functions for polygons; Polygon clustering; Polygon analysis; Mining related spatial datasets		Polygons provide natural representations for many types of geospatial objects, such as countries, buildings, and pollution hotspots. Thus, polygon-based data mining techniques are particularly useful for mining geospatial datasets. In this paper, we propose a polygon-based clustering and analysis framework for mining multiple geospatial datasets that have inherently hidden relations. In this framework, polygons are first generated from multiple geospatial point datasets by using a density-based contouring algorithm called DCONTOUR. Next, a density-based clustering algorithm called Poly-SNN with novel dissimilarity functions is employed to cluster polygons to create meta-clusters of polygons. Finally, post-processing analysis techniques are proposed to extract interesting patterns and user-guided summarized knowledge from meta-clusters. These techniques employ plug-in reward functions that capture a domain expert's notion of interestingness to guide the extraction of knowledge from meta-clusters. The effectiveness of our framework is tested in a real-world case study involving ozone pollution events in Texas. The experimental results show that our framework can reveal interesting relationships between different ozone hotspots represented by polygons; it can also identify interesting hidden relations between ozone hotspots and several meteorological variables, such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed.

Existing works have demonstrated several techniques to study the required permissions declared by the developers, but little attention has been paid towards used permissions. Besides, no specific permission combination is identified to be effective for malware detection. To fill these gaps, we have proposed a novel pattern mining algorithm to identify a set of contrast permission patterns that aim to detect the difference between clean and malicious applications. A benchmark malware dataset and a dataset of 1227 clean applications has been collected by us to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Valuable findings are obtained by analyzing the returned contrast permission patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temporal representation for mining scientific data provenance	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						Provenance; Temporal representation; Data mining	E-SCIENCE	Provenance of digital scientific data is a distinct piece of metadata about a data object. It can serve as a "ground-truth" for determining the cause of execution failure for instance, or can explain a particular result to a researcher intending to reuse a data object. Provenance can quickly grow voluminous and be quite feature rich, requiring new structure and concepts that support data mining. We propose a representation of data provenance using logical time that reduces the feature space of the provenance. The temporal representation supports clustering, classification and association rule mining. This paper studies the full utility of the temporal representation through an empirical evaluation and identification of the data mining algorithms that are most effective in application to the proposed representation. The evaluation is carried out against a multi-gigabyte semi-synthetic provenance dataset built from a range of scientific workflows, and against a real one month provenance dataset gathered from a satellite instrument. Through analysis of the results via clustering metrics-purity and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we determine that the k-means algorithm gives the best clustering with the proposed temporal representation, while still yielding provenance-useful information.

In this study, a data mining approach was used to predict the miscibility of a drug and several excipients, using Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) as the data set. The K-means clustering algorithm was applied to predict the miscibility of indomethacin with a set of more than 30 compounds based on their partial solubility parameters [dispersion forces (delta(d)), polar forces (delta(p)) and hydrogen bonding (delta(h))]. The miscibility of the compounds was determined experimentally, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in a separate study. The results of the K-means algorithm and DSC were compared to evaluate the K-means clustering prediction performance using the HSPs three-dimensional parameters, the two-dimensional parameters such as volume-dependent solubility (delta(v)) and hydrogen bonding (delta(h)), and selected single (one-dimensional) parameters. Using HSPs, the prediction of miscibility by the K-means algorithm correlated well with the DSC results, with an overall accuracy of 94%. The prediction accuracy was the same (94%) when the two-dimensional parameters or the hydrogen-bonding (one-dimensional) parameter were used. The hydrogen-bonding parameter was thus a determining factor in predicting miscibility in such set of compounds, whereas the dispersive and polar parameters had only a weak correlation. The results show that data mining approach is a valuable tool for predicting drug-excipient miscibility because it is easy to use, is time and cost-effective, and is material sparing.

However, RGAs isolation and RGA-based marker development have not been conducted in radish. In this study, two prevalent approaches, PCR amplification with degenerate primers and data-mining of radish EST databases, were used to isolate radish resistance gene candidate sequences. A total of 26 RsRGAs with high homology to known R-genes or RGAs were obtained by PCR amplification. Meanwhile, 257 R-gene-like unigenes/ESTs were identified using data-mining method. In total, 115 out of 124 designed RGA-specific primer pairs can successfully amplified the target bands. To explore the RGA genetic variability, 32 radish accessions were genotyped and 269 RGA loci were successfully identified. It was found that 44 RGA primers only generated monomorphic band and the remaining 71 RGA primers generated 225 RGA polymorphic bands among the 32 radish accessions. Based on RGA marker analysis, 32 radish accessions were clustered into four main groups at the similarity index of 0.68, which was in a high accordance with disease index from a downy mildew evaluation. This study might be the first report on candidate R-genes identification and RGA-based markers development in radish. These findings will facilitate the disease resistance identification and speed up the genetic improvement of DM resistances in radish breeding programs.

An exact algorithm for the maximum probabilistic clique problem	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Maximum clique problem; Probabilistic programming; Probabilistic clique; Branch-and-bound	BOUND ALGORITHM; PROGRAMS; GRAPH; DECOMPOSITION; OPTIMIZATION; MODELS	The maximum clique problem is a classical problem in combinatorial optimization that has a broad range of applications in graph-based data mining, social and biological network analysis and a variety of other fields. This article investigates the problem when the edges fail independently with known probabilities. This leads to the maximum probabilistic clique problem, which is to find a subset of vertices of maximum cardinality that forms a clique with probability at least , which is a user-specified probability threshold. We show that the probabilistic clique property is hereditary and extend a well-known exact combinatorial algorithm for the maximum clique problem to a sampling-free exact algorithm for the maximum probabilistic clique problem. The performance of the algorithm is benchmarked on a test-bed of DIMACS clique instances and on a randomly generated test-bed.

J	He, JR; Ding, LX; Jiang, L; Li, ZK; Hu, QH				He, Jinrong; Ding, Lixin; Jiang, Lei; Li, Zhaokui; Hu, Qinghui			Intrinsic dimensionality estimation based on manifold assumption	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						Intrinsic dimension estimation; Dimensionality reduction; Graph distance; Geodesic distance; Manifold assumption; Geometric relation; Local neighborhood; Data analysis	REDUCTION; ATTRACTORS; EIGENMAPS	Dimensionality reduction is an important tool and has been widely used in many fields of data mining and machine learning. Intrinsic dimension of data sets is a key parameter for dimensionality reduction. In this paper, a new intrinsic dimension estimation method based on geometrical relationship between manifold intrinsic dimension and data neighborhood geodesic distances is presented. The estimator is derived by manifold sampling assumption. On a densely sampled manifold, the number of samples that fall into a ball is equal to the volume times the density of the ball. The radius of the ball is calculated by graph distance which is approximation of geodesic distance on manifold. Then the intrinsic dimension is estimated on each sample.

Statistical considerations on the formation of circular photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes from Rhodopseudomonas palustris	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH			English	Article						Bacterial photosynthesis; Light-harvesting; Heterogeneous; Oligomer; Diversity; Simulation; Self-assembly	DYNAMIC COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES; ANTENNA COMPLEXES; VIRTUAL LIBRARIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PURPLE BACTERIA; GROWN CELLS; ACIDOPHILA; LH2; B800-850; BACTERIOCHLOROPHYLL	Depending on growth conditions, some species of purple photosynthetic bacteria contain peripheral light-harvesting (LH2) complexes that are heterogeneous owing to the presence of different protomers (containing different alpha beta-apoproteins). Recent spectroscopic studies of Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown under low-light conditions suggest the presence of a C (3)-symmetric LH2 nonamer comprised of two distinct protomers. The software program Cyclaplex, which enables generation and data-mining of virtual libraries of molecular rings formed upon combinatorial reactions, has been used to delineate the possible number and type of distinct nonamers as a function of numbers of distinct protomers. The yield of the C (3)-symmetric nonamer from two protomers (A and B in varying ratios) has been studied under the following conditions: (1) statistical, (2) enriched (preclusion of the B-B sequence), and (3) seeded (pre-formation of an A-B-A block). The yield of C (3)-symmetric nonamer is at most 0.98 % under statistical conditions versus 5.6 % under enriched conditions, and can be dominant under conditions of pre-seeding with an A-B-A block. In summary, the formation of any one specific nonamer even from only two protomers is unlikely on statistical grounds but must stem from enhanced free energy of formation or a directed assembly process by as-yet unknown factors.

J	Hu, HJ; Sha, CF; Wang, XL; Zhou, AY				Hu, Haoji; Sha, Chaofeng; Wang, Xiaoling; Zhou, Aoying			A unified framework for semi-supervised PU learning	WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Semi-supervised learning; PU learning		Traditional supervised classifiers use only labeled data (features/label pairs) as the training set, while the unlabeled data is used as the testing set. In practice, it is often the case that the labeled data is hard to obtain and the unlabeled data contains the instances that belong to the predefined class but not the labeled data categories. This problem has been widely studied in recent years and the semi-supervised PU learning is an efficient solution to learn from positive and unlabeled examples. Among all the semi-supervised PU learning methods, it is hard to choose just one approach to fit all unlabeled data distribution. In this paper, a new framework is designed to integrate different semi-supervised PU learning algorithms in order to take advantage of existing methods. In essence, we propose an automatic KL-divergence learning method by utilizing the knowledge of unlabeled data distribution. Meanwhile, the experimental results show that (1) data distribution information is very helpful for the semi-supervised PU learning method; (2) the proposed framework can achieve higher precision when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

DISTROD is able to effectively detect the so-called global outliers from distributed databases that are consistent with those produced by the centralized detection paradigm. DISTROD is equipped with a number of optimization/boosting strategies which empower it to significantly enhance its speed performance and reduce its communication overhead. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the good performance of DISTROD in terms of speed and communication overhead.

However, data analysis techniques are very limited, especially for processing massive multiple physiological streams that may only be understood by medical experts. The state-of-the-art techniques only allow multiple medical devices to independently monitor different physiological parameters for the patient's status, thus they signal too many false alarms, creating unnecessary noise, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). An effective solution which has been recently studied is to integrate information from multiple physiologic parameters to reduce alarms. But it is a challenge to detect abnormalities from high frequently changed physiological streams data, since abnormalities occur gradually due to the complex situation of patients. An analysis of ICU physiological data streams shows that many vital physiological parameters are changed periodically (such as heart rate, arterial pressure, and respiratory impedance) and thus abnormalities are generally abnormal period patterns. In this paper, we develop a Mining Abnormal Period Patterns from Multiple Physiological Streams (MAPPMPS) method to detect and rank abnormalities in medical sensor streams. The efficiency and effectiveness of the MAPPMPS method is demonstrated by a real-world massive database of multiple physiological streams sampled in ICU, comprising 250 patients' streams (each stream involving over 1.3 million data points) with a total size of 28 GB data.

The differential expression genes were identified by the BRB-array tools and the pathway was analyzed by DAVID online tools. The class comparison analysis showed that there were 376 differential expression genes. These genes involved in many tumor-related pathways. What is more, these pathways had common genes. As a conclusion, it was helpful to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous carcinoma using data mining and bioinformatics analysis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Interpretation of the SUM enabled nine characteristic or prototype states to be identified. As expected, the dominant forcing mechanisms were freshwater input via riverine discharge and input from oceanic waters. While these mechanisms are well understood, subtle features associated with the interaction of the two forcing mechanisms and the transitions between meta-stable states, were revealed by visualizing the SOM output. Further investigation was undertaken to determine how effective the SOM would be in identifying these prototype states given sensor data from a sensor network being designed for future deployment within the region. This research has demonstrated that SOM analysis can be a useful tool for identifying and interpreting patterns in large oceanographic datasets. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of the existing fuzzy decision tree algorithms do not systematically consider the impact of the non-linear characteristics of the membership degree of fuzzy sets; they are therefore unable to integrate uncertainty processing preferences into the selection of extended attributes. This paper initially offers a generalized Hartley metric model and calculation method. We then introduce a fuzzy consciousness function and further provide generalized fuzzy partition entropy for the attribute-selecting heuristic of a fuzzy decision tree. We subsequently propose a generalized fuzzy partition entropy-based fuzzy ID3 algorithm (abbreviated as GFID3) that can support decision making and analyze the performance of the GFID3 through several case-based examples. The experimental results show that the GFID3 algorithm demonstrates better structural characteristics and operability in practical applications and has high computational precision. It ameliorates the deficiencies of existing fuzzy decision tree algorithms and can be used in fields such as complex systems optimization, data mining and intelligent systems. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A key environmental factor is temperature, but temperature-sensing mechanisms are not fully understood despite intense research. We investigated proteomic responses to temperature shocks (15min cold or heat treatments) with and without exogenous applications of cytokinin in Arabidopsis. Image and mass spectrometric analysis of the two-dimensionally separated proteins detected 139 differentially regulated spots, in which 148 proteins were identified, most of which have not been previously linked to temperature perception. More than 70% of the temperature-shock response proteins were modulated by cytokinin, mostly in a similar manner as heat shock. Data mining of previous transcriptomic datasets supported extensive interactions between temperature and cytokinin signalling. The biological significance of this finding was tested by assaying an independent growth response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress: hypocotyl elongation. This response was strongly inhibited in mutants with deficiencies in cytokinin signalling or endogenous cytokinin levels. Thus, cytokinins may directly participate in heat signalling in plants. Finally, large proportions of both temperature-shock and cytokinin responsive proteomes co-localize to the chloroplast, which might therefore host a substantial proportion of the temperature response machinery.

Thus, the need to identify and characterize new protein targets in these parasites can aid to design novel therapeutic strategies to combat malaria. Recently, the conserved FK506-binding protein family members with molecular weight of 35 kDa from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax (referred to as PfFKBP35 and PvFKBP35, respectively) were identified for drug targeting. Further data mining revealed a 25-kDa FKBP (FKBP25) family member present in the parasites. FKBP25 belongs to a unique class of FKBP, because it is a nuclear FKBP with multiple protein-binding partners. Apart from immune regulation, it is also known for its chaperoning role in various cellular processes such as transcription regulation and trafficking. Here, we present the biochemical characterization and 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of an N-terminal truncated FKBP25 from P. vivax (PvFKBP25(72-209)). The protein reveals the noncanonical nature with unique structural changes observed in the loops flanking the active site, concealing the binding pocket. Further, a potential calmodulin-binding domain, which is absent in human FKBP25, is observed in this protein. Although the functional implication of Plasmodium FKBP25 in malaria still remains elusive, we speculate that the notable conformational changes in its structure might serve as an overture in understanding its molecular mechanism.

To date, no data mining procedures have been applied to explore the differential role of personality variables in this population. Methods: The personality profile of 336 drug-dependent patients was compared with that of a sample of community participants in the context of a decision tree learning approach using the Alternative Five Factor Model. The resulting discriminant model was cross-validated. Results: Neuroticism and impulsivity were the most relevant variables in the resulting model, but their association appeared to be hierarchically organized. In the personality characterization of these patients, neuroticism became the main discriminant dimension, whereas impulsivity played a differential role, explained by means of an interaction effect. Decision tree learning models appear to be a heuristic theoretical and empirical approximation to the study of relevant variables, such as personality traits, in drug-dependency research.

A formal ontology is a human-and computer-interpretable set of terms and relations that represent entities in a specific domain and how these terms relate to each other. Several community-based ontologies (including Vaccine Ontology, Ontology of Adverse Events and Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events) have been developed to support vaccine and adverse event representation, classification, data integration, literature mining of host-vaccine interaction networks, and analysis of vaccine adverse events. The author further proposes minimal vaccine information standards and their ontology representations, ontology-based linked open vaccine data and meta-analysis, an integrative One Network ('OneNet') Theory of Life, and ontology-based approaches to study and apply the OneNet theory. In the Big Data era, these proposed strategies provide a novel framework for advanced data integration and analysis of fundamental biological networks including vaccine immune mechanisms.

Many existing distributed frequent itemset mining algorithms do not allow users to express the itemsets to be mined according to their intention via the use of constraints. Consequently, these unconstrained mining algorithms can yield numerous itemsets that are not interesting to users. Moreover, due to inherited measurement inaccuracies and/or network latencies, the data are often riddled with uncertainty. These call for both constrained mining and uncertain data mining. In this journal article, we propose a data-intensive computer system for tree-based mining of frequent itemsets that satisfy user-defined constraints from a distributed environment such as a wireless sensor network of uncertain data.

The basic task is to classify network activities (in the network log as connection records) as normal or abnormal while minimizing misclassification. Although different classification models have been developed for network intrusion detection, each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, including the most commonly applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and the Clustering based on Self-Organized Ant Colony Network (CSOACN). Our new approach combines the SVM method with CSOACNs to take the advantages of both while avoiding their weaknesses. Our algorithm is implemented and evaluated using a standard benchmark KDD99 data set. Experiments show that CSVAC (Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony) outperforms SVM alone or CSOACN alone in terms of both classification rate and run-time efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the running mobile networks that generate huge data can be the best social sensor for these studies. This paper investigates a practical case of mobile network aided social sensing which uncovers some features of users' behaviors in mobile networks by intelligently processing the big data. The paper studies the users' behaviors with regard to communication, movement, and consumption based on large user data sets. The main contribution of the study is some findings on the relations among these behavior features. We find that the users' calling behaviors are different despite their monthly expenditures being similar, though different consumption level users may have similar communication behaviors. We also find that statistically users with the higher mobility contribute more ARPU than those with lower mobility. Additionally, we also find that the top consumption level users are the most "lonely" ones by exploring the movement clustering patterns of users. These findings are significant to instruct marketing strategies for telecommunication industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent attacks on SCADA systems highlight the need for stronger SCADA security. Thus, sharing SCADA traffic data has become a vital requirement in SCADA systems to analyze security risks and develop appropriate security solutions. However, inappropriate sharing and usage of SCADA data could threaten the privacy of companies and prevent sharing of data. In this paper, we present a privacy preserving strategy-based permutation technique called PPFSCADA framework, in which data privacy, statistical properties and data mining utilities can be controlled at the same time. In particular, our proposed approach involves: (i) vertically partitioning the original data set to improve the performance of perturbation; (ii) developing a framework to deal with various types of network traffic data including numerical, categorical and hierarchical attributes; (iii) grouping the portioned sets into a number of clusters based on the proposed framework; and (iv) the perturbation process is accomplished by the alteration of the original attribute value by a new value (clusters centroid). The effectiveness of the proposed PPFSCADA framework is shown through several experiments on simulated SCADA, intrusion detection and network traffic data sets. Through experimental analysis, we show that PPFSCADA effectively deals with multivariate traffic attributes, producing compatible results as the original data, and also substantially improving the performance of the five supervised approaches and provides high level of privacy protection.

Attribute reduction of formal contexts based on the granules and dominance relation are first reviewed in this paper. Relations between granular reduts and dominance reducts are investigated with the aim to establish a bridge between the two reduction approaches. We obtain meaningful results showing that granule-based and dominance-relation-based attribute reducts and attribute characteristics are identical. Utilizing dominance reducts and attribute characteristics, we can obtain all granular reducts and attribute characteristics by the proposed approach. In addition, we establish relations between dominance classes and irreducible elements, and present some judgment theorems with respect to the irreducible elements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report comprehensive profiling of 840 metabolites and a further metabolic genome-wide association study based on similar to 6.4 million SNPs obtained from 529 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa. We identified hundreds of common variants influencing numerous secondary metabolites with large effects at high resolution. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the natural variation of metabolites and their underlying genetic architectures among different subspecies of rice. Data mining identified 36 candidate genes modulating levels of metabolites that are of potential physiological and nutritional importance. As a proof of concept, we functionally identified or annotated five candidate genes influencing metabolic traits. Our study provides insights into the genetic and biochemical bases of rice metabolome variation and can be used as a powerful complementary tool to classical phenotypic trait mapping for rice improvement.

Different types of seacoast, such as sandy, silty, and biological coast, have different indicators of interpretation. It is very difficult to develop a universal method for interpreting all shorelines. Therefore, the sandy, the silty, and the biological coast are regarded as research objects, and with data mining technology, found the rules of interpretation of those three types of coastlines. Then, an intelligent coastline interpretation method based on rules was proposed. Firstly, the rules for extracting the waterline in Landsat TM/ETM+ (Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery were discovered. Then, through analyzing the features of sandy, silty and biological coast, the indicators of interpreting different types of shoreline were determined. According to the indicators, the waterline could be corrected to the real coastline. In order to verify the validity of the proposed algorithms, three Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were selected for case studies. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods could interpret the coastlines of sandy, silty, and biological coasts with high precision and without human intervention, which exceeded three pixels.

This problem can be described as follows: given a subject sequence, a pre-specified threshold, and a variable gap-length with wildcards between each two consecutive letters. The task is to gain all frequent patterns with periodic wildcard gaps. State-of-the-art mining algorithms which use matrices or other linear data structures to solve the problem not only consume a large amount of memory but also run slowly. In this study, we use an Incomplete Nettree structure (the last layer of a Nettree which is an extension of a tree) of a sub-pattern P to efficiently create Incomplete Nettrees of all its super-patterns with prefix pattern P and compute the numbers of their supports in a one-way scan. We propose two new algorithms, MAPB (Mining sequentiAl Pattern using incomplete Nettree with Breadth first search) and MAPD (Mining sequentiAl Pattern using incomplete Nettree with Depth first search), to solve the problem effectively with low memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a heuristic algorithm MAPBOK (MAPB for tOp-K) based on MAPB to deal with the Top-K frequent patterns for each length. Experimental results on real-world biological data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in running time and space consumption and also show that the pattern matching approach can be employed to mine special frequent patterns effectively.

Fifty-four coffee samples (20 organic and 34 non-organic) were evaluated according to their macro and microelement contents to establish reference ranges and identify differences in patterns of chemical elements in both crop procedures. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of thirty-eight chemical elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Eu, Er, Gd, Ge, Ho, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sm, Sr, Yb, W, U, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, Ti, Zr and Zn). In general, higher levels of chemical elements were found in conventional coffee compared with organic samples. The classification of samples was performed by using three well known data mining algorithms, named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). When all analyzed variables were considered, a 96.3% accuracy level was obtained with the three algorithms. The level of accuracy remained at 96.3% for SVM and MLP and rose to 98.2 for NB when only eight of the investigated minerals - i.e. Zn, Se, Ba, U, Dy, Ti, Th, Mo - were used for chemometric analysis. This level of accuracy provides a strong foundation to propose the combination of trace element spectral fingerprints with data mining techniques as a valuable tool to evaluate the authenticity of organic coffee samples.

Patient-Reported and Actionable Safety Events in CKD	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; RENAL-INSUFFICIENCY; HYPERKALEMIA; ADVERSE; FREQUENCY; OUTCOMES; ANEMIA; ALPHA; TRIAL	Patients with CKD are at high risk for adverse safety events because of the complexity of their care and impaired renal function. Using data from our observational study of predialysis patients with CKD enrolled in the Safe Kidney Care study, we estimated the baseline frequency of adverse safety events and determined to what extent these events co-occur. We examined patient-reported adverse safety incidents (class I) and actionable safety findings (class II), conditioned on participant use of drugs that might cause such an event, and we used association analysis as a data-mining technique to identify co-occurrences of these events. Of 267 participants, 185(69.3%) had at least one class I or II event, 102 (38.2%) had more than one event, and 48 (18.0%) had at least one event from both classes. The adjusted conditional rates of class I and class II events ranged from 2.9 to 57.6 per 100 patients and from 2.2 to 8.3 per 100 patients, respectively. The most common conditional class I and II events were patient-reported hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia (serum potassium>5.5 mEq/L), respectively. Reporting of hypoglycemia (in patients with diabetes) and falling or severe dizziness (in patients without diabetes) were most frequently paired with other adverse safety events. We conclude that adverse safety events are common and varied in CKD, with frequent association between disparate events. Further work is needed to define the CKD "safety pheno-type" and identify patients at highest risk for adverse safety events.

Designing rules and probabilistic weighting for fast materials discovery in the Perovskite structure	MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						materials design; perovskites; data mining; bandgap; stability	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CAPTURE	High-throughput electronic-structure calculations are becoming increasingly popular in materials science and in the design of new compounds. Electronic-structure theory, for example, in the form of density-functional theory, can be used to calculate stabilities and electronic properties as bandgaps of new compounds. However, in practice, the methods are often limited to rather small atomic-scale systems or periodic crystals with only a limited number of atoms in the unit cell. It is therefore of interest to be able to derive generally useful information from simple systems to be applied in other, more complex, crystals. Here, we consider a large database of calculated stabilities and bandgaps of oxides and oxynitrides in the perovskite structure. We use the database as a testing ground for existing ideas about the behavior of these types of compounds and we derive some new simple chemical-based rules which combine structural information, like the ionic radii of the chemical elements, with electronic data, like the number of electrons and the valences of the pure elements. The rules extracted from the ABO(3) cubic perovskite are then tested using the ABO(2)N and A(2)BO(4) stoichiometry in the cubic and layered perovskite structure, respectively. These rules allow a saving in computer time of around 80%.	[Castelli, I. E.; Jacobsen, K.

We constructed a framework for co-location pattern mining using the transaction-based approach, which employs maximal cliques as a transaction-type dataset; we first define transaction-type data and verify that the definition satisfies the requirements, and we also propose an efficient way to generate all transaction-type data. The constructed framework can play a role as a theoretical methodology of co-location pattern mining, which supports geographic context awareness of ubiquitous GIS.

Since most existing data mining frameworks deal with structured input data, many limitations are faced in analyzing unstructured scientific literature and extracting new information. This study proposes a scientific-knowledge processing framework, which offers high performance by using grid computing technology for extracting important entities and their relations from the scientific literature. Since the grid computing provides a large volume of data storage and high-speed computing, the proposed framework can efficiently analyze the massive body of scientific literature and process knowledge. The workflow tool that we have developed for the proposed framework enables users to easily design and execute complicated applications that consist of complicated scientific-knowledge processes. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework reduced working time by approximately 83 % when the number of running nodes was assigned in accordance with the workload ratio of each step in scientific-knowledge processes. As a result, it is possible to effectively process a large volume of scientific literature by flexibly adjusting the number of computing nodes that constitute the grid environment as the number of documents for processing increases.

Categorization for grouping associative items using data mining in item-based collaborative filtering	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Collaborative filtering; Categorization; Associative items; Recommendation system; Data mining	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM	Recommendation systems have been investigated and implemented in many ways. In particular, in the case of a collaborative filtering system, the most important issue is how to manipulate the personalized recommendation results for better user understandability and satisfaction. A collaborative filtering system predicts items of interest for users based on predictive relationships discovered between each item and others. This paper proposes a categorization for grouping associative items discovered by mining, for the purpose of improving the accuracy and performance of item-based collaborative filtering. It is possible that, if an associative item is required to be simultaneously associated with all other groups in which it occurs, the proposed method can collect associative items into relevant groups. In addition, the proposed method can result in improved predictive performance under circumstances of sparse data and cold-start initiation of collaborative filtering starting from a small number of items. In addition, this method can increase prediction accuracy and scalability because it removes the noise generated by ratings on items of dissimilar content or level of interest. The approach is empirically evaluated by comparison with k-means, average link, and robust, using the MovieLens dataset. The method was found to outperform existing methods significantly.

And on the other hand, many data are often represented by multiple views which are of importance to learning. However, little work has been done for it. In this paper, we explored to leverage the multi-view information across different domains for knowledge transfer. We proposed a novel transfer learning model which integrates the domain distance and view consistency into a 2-view support vector machine framework, namely DV2S. The objective of DV2S is to find the optimal feature mapping such that under the projections the classification margin is maximized, while both the domain distance and the disagreement between multiple views are minimized simultaneously. Experiments showed that DV2S outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms.

Assessment of validity and predictability of the FiO(2)-SpO(2) transfer-function in preterm infants	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						oximetry; oxygen inhalational therapy; clustering algorithms; artificial neural networks; data mining	POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; ARTERIAL OXYGEN; INSPIRED OXYGEN; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; APNEA; CROSSOVER; FRACTION	In this paper an investigation of the gain, delay, and time-constant parameters of the transfer function describing the relation between fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) and oxygen saturation in the blood (SpO(2)) in preterm infants is presented. The parameters were estimated following FiO(2) adjustments and goodness of fit was used to assess the validity of the model when using an assumed first-order transfer function. For responses identified to be first-order, the estimated parameters were then clustered to identify areas where they tended to be concentrated. Each group described an operating region of the transfer function; thus, predicting the right operating region could potentially assist a range-based robust inspired oxygen controller to provide more optimal control by adapting itself to different clusters. Accordingly, the samples were assigned labels based on their cluster associations and 14 features available at the time of each adjustment were used as inputs to an artificial neural network to classify the clustered samples. The validity study suggested that 37% of the adjustments were followed by first-order responses. Prediction studies on the first-order responses indicated that the clusters could be predicted with an average accuracy of 64% when the parameters were divided into two groups.	[Fathabadi, O.

THE SPIRAL ARMS OF THE MILKY WAY: THE RELATIVE LOCATION OF EACH DIFFERENT ARM TRACER WITHIN A TYPICAL SPIRAL ARM WIDTH	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: individual (Milky Way); ISM: general	ANTICENTRE STAR-CLUSTERS; GHZ METHANOL MASERS; GALACTIC DISTRIBUTION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; FORMING REGIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; VVV SURVEY; GALAXY; ABSORPTION; TANGENT	From the Sun's location in the Galactic disk, different arm tracers (CO, HI, hot dust, etc.) have been employed to locate a tangent to each spiral arm. Using all various and different observed spiral arm tracers (as published elsewhere), we embark on a new goal, namely the statistical analysis of these published data (data mining) to statistically compute the mean location of each spiral arm tracer. We show for a typical arm cross-cut, a separation of 400 pc between the mid-arm and the dust lane (at the inner edge of the arm, toward the Galactic center). Are some arms major and others minor? Separating arms into two sets, as suggested by some, we find the same arm widths between the two sets. Our interpretation is that we live in a multiple (four-arm) spiral (logarithmic) pattern (around a pitch angle of 12 degrees) for the stars and gas in the Milky Way, with a sizable interarm separation (around 3 kpc) at the Sun's location and the same arm width for each arm (near 400 pc from mid-arm to dust lane).

Although previous studies have shown the applicability of determining learner behaviors from an LMS, most investigated datasets are not assembled from online learning courses or from whole learning activities undertaken on courses that can be analyzed to evaluate students' academic achievement. Previous studies generally focus on the construction of predictors for learner performance evaluation after a course has ended, and neglect the practical value of an "early warning" system to predict at-risk students while a course is in progress. We collected the complete learning activities of an online undergraduate course and applied data-mining techniques to develop an early warning system. Our results showed that, time-dependent variables extracted from LMS are critical factors for online learning. After students have used an LMS for a period of time, our early warning system effectively characterizes their current learning performance. Data-mining techniques are useful in the construction of early warning systems; based on our experimental results, classification and regression tree (CART), supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifier for the evaluation of learning performance investigated by this study.

Modeling eutrophication and risk prevention in a reservoir in the Northwest of Spain by using multivariate adaptive regression splines analysis	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Statistical learning techniques; Eutrophication; Chlorophyll; Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); Regression analysis	CROSS-VALIDATION; LAKE; CYLINDROSPERMOPSIN; CLIMATE; QUALITY; SYSTEMS; CANADA; WATERS	The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of eutrophication using as predictors the chlorophyll concentration of the previous days. In this research work, the evolution of chlorophyll in the Trasona reservoir (Principality of Asturias, Northern Spain) was studied with success using the data mining methodology based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique. For this purpose, some biological parameters (phytoplankton species expressed in biovolume) in addition to the most important physical-chemical parameters are considered. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the eutrophication in the reservoir is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting eutrophication is obtained. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. Finally, conclusions of this innovative research work are exposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Alonso Fernandez, J.

With the emergence of new data collection technologies, advanced data mining and analytics support, there seems to be fundamental changes that are occurring with the research questions we can ask, and the research methods we can apply. The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prevalence of Heart Failure Signs and Symptoms in a Large Primary Care Population Identified Through the Use of Text and Data Mining of the Electronic Health Record	JOURNAL OF CARDIAC FAILURE			English	Article						Heart failure; electronic health records; natural language processing	DIAGNOSIS; RISK; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE	Background: The electronic health record (EHR) contains a tremendous amount of data that if appropriately detected can lead to earlier identification of disease states such as heart failure (HF). Using a novel text and data analytic tool we explored the longitudinal EHR of over 50,000 primary care patients to identify the documentation of the signs and symptoms of HF in the years preceding its diagnosis. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis consisted of 4,644 incident HF cases and 45,981 group-matched control subjects. Documentation of Framingham HF signs and symptoms within encounter notes were carried out with the use of a previously validated natural language processing procedure. A total of 892,805 affirmed criteria were documented over an average observation period of 3.4 years. Among eventual HF cases, 85% had >= 1 criterion within 1 year before their HF diagnosis, as did 55% of control subjects. Substantial variability in the prevalence of individual signs and symptoms were found in both case and control subjects. Conclusions: HF signs and symptoms are frequently documented in a primary care population as identified through automated text and data mining of EHRs. Their frequent identification demonstrates the rich data available within EHRs that will allow for future work on automated criterion identification to help develop predictive models for HF.

J	Williams, TP; Gong, J				Williams, Trefor P.; Gong, Jie			Predicting construction cost overruns using text mining, numerical data and ensemble classifiers	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction cost; Data mining; Text mining; Prediction	MANAGEMENT	This paper discusses how text describing a construction project can be combined with numerical data to produce a prediction of the level of cost overrun using data mining classification algorithms. Modeling results found that a stacking model that combined the results from several classifiers produced the best results. The stacking ensemble model had an average accuracy of 43.72% for five model runs. The model performed best in predicting projects completed with large cost overruns and projects near the original low bid amount. It was found that a stacking model that used only numerical data produced predictions with lower precision and recall. A potential application of this research is as an aid in budgeting sufficient funds to complete a construction project. Additionally, during the planning stages of a project the research can be used to identify a project that requires increased scrutiny during construction to avoid cost overruns.

A systematic analysis of the dark matter of the human proteome for druggability and biomarker discovery is crucial to mining the genome. Numerous data mining tools are available to mine these ORFs to develop a comprehensive knowledge base for future target discovery and validation. Materials and Methods: Using the Genetic Association Database, the ORFs of the human dark matter proteome were screened for evidence of association with neoplasms. The Phenome-Genome Integrator tool was used to establish phenotypic association with disease traits including cancer. Batch analysis of the tools for protein expression analysis, gene ontology and motifs and domains was used to characterize the ORFs. Results: Sixty-two ORFs were identified for neoplasm association. The expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis identified thirteen ORFs related to cancer traits. Protein expression, motifs and domain analysis and genome-wide association studies verified the relevance of these OncoORFs in diverse tumors. The OncoORFs are also associated with a wide variety of human diseases and disorders. Conclusions: Our results link the OncoORFs to diverse diseases and disorders. This suggests a complex landscape of the uncharacterized proteome in human diseases. These results open the dark matter of the proteome to novel cancer target research.

Many rough set algorithms for feature selection have been developed, most of which are essentially dependent on the definite information contained within the lower approximation. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Unbalanced binary tree based feature selection (UBT-FS), which utilizes the indefinite information contained within rough set. boundary region for reduction. UBT-FS designs the underlying mechanism for obtaining the boundary region from the unbalanced binary tree and adopts the boundary region based significance for determining the optimal search path as well as the boundary region based evaluation criterion for identifying feature subsets. These allow UBT-FS to have considerable ability in finding an optimal or suboptimal reduct whilst simultaneously achieving obviously better computational efficiency than other available algorithms, which is also supported by the experimental results.

Instead of performing a number of circuit simulations, data mining employs mathematical search algorithm directly into the model, which can save significant analyzed time and improve the efficiency. An optimized mining flow is presented for large scale data set, where the data processing and data mining are performed simultaneously, and thus it is unnecessary to save large extracted data. The proposed data mining method consider both the interconnect structure and the stimulated pattern of a MIMO system, which can perform thoughtful analysis and optimization with high efficiency. Two examples, signal-integrity analysis of two coupled microstrip lines and noise coupling among multiple signal vias through a power-ground plane pair, are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data mining method in signal-integrity optimization design.

Cognitive and physical training for the elderly: Evaluating outcome efficacy by means of neurophysiological synchronization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Age-related intervention; Cognitive & physical training; Dementia; Electroencephalography; Relative wavelet entropy; Resting-state synchronization	DECREASED EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN PLASTICITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; OLDER-ADULTS; IMPAIRMENT; MEMORY; NETWORK; CORTEX; INTERVENTION	Recent neuroscientific research has demonstrated that both healthy and pathological aging induces alterations in the co-operative capacity of neuronal populations in the brain. Both compensatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms contribute to neurophysiological synchronization patterns, which provide a valuable marker for age-related cognitive decline. In this study, we propose that neuroplasticity-based training may facilitate coherent interaction of distant brain regions and consequently enhance cognitive performance in elderly people. If this is true, this would make neurophysiological synchronization a valid outcome measure to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay age-related cognitive decline. The present study aims at providing an objective, synchronization-based tool to assess cognitive and/or physical interventions, adopting the notion of Relative Wavelet Entropy. This mathematical model employs a robust and parameter-free synchronization metric. By using data mining techniques, a distance value was computed for all participants so as to quantify the proximity of their individual profile to the mean group synchronization increase. In support of our hypothesis, results showed a significant increase in synchronization, for four electrode pairs, in the intervention group as compared to the active control group.

Reflectance measurements in the VIS-NIR band (400-2500 nm) show that chert displays low reflectance in the IR wavelengths that are operated by several commercial TLS. To develop and test a recognition method an outcrop of limestone with chert nodules was scanned with an IR (1541 nm) TLS. The intensity information, after proper distance correction, was coupled with geometric and intensity descriptors for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) to separate vegetation from rock and limestone from chert. Results, cross inspected in the field and with reference pictures, demonstrate that TLS data can be efficiently exploited to map chert when the monochromatic information of the intensity is integrated with feature descriptors and SVM classifiers.

Information bottleneck theory-based clustering method is suitable for dealing with complicated clustering problems because that its information loss metric can measure arbitrary statistical relationships between samples. It has been widely applied to many kinds of areas. With the development of information technology, the electronic data scale becomes larger and larger. Classical information bottleneck theory-based clustering method is out of work to deal with large-scale dataset because of expensive computational cost. Parallel clustering method based on MapReduce model is the most efficient method to deal with large-scale data-intensive clustering problems. A parallel clustering method based on MapReduce model is developed in this paper. In the method, parallel information bottleneck theory clustering method based on MapReduce is proposed to determine the initial clustering center. An objective method is proposed to determine the final number of clusters automatically. Parallel centroid-based clustering method is proposed to determine the final clustering result. The clustering results are visualized with interpolation MDS dimension reduction method. The efficiency of the method is illustrated with a practical DNA clustering example.

The accumulated knowledge from large-scale genome sequencing projects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates is being used to study the mechanisms that explain such relations. Our objective was to undertake genetic characterization of 172 S. cerevisiae strains from different geographical origins and technological groups, using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, and computationally relate these data with the results of 30 phenotypic tests. Genetic characterization revealed 280 alleles, with the microsatellite ScAAT1 contributing most to intrastrain variability, together with alleles 20, 9 and 16 from the microsatellites ScAAT4, ScAAT5 and ScAAT6. These microsatellite allelic profiles are characteristic for both the phenotype and origin of yeast strains. We confirm the strength of these associations by construction and cross-validation of computational models that can predict the technological application and origin of a strain from the microsatellite allelic profile. Associations between microsatellites and specific phenotypes were scored using information gain ratios, and significant findings were confirmed by permutation tests and estimation of false discovery rates. The phenotypes associated with higher number of alleles were the capacity to resist to sulphur dioxide (tested by the capacity to grow in the presence of potassium bisulphite) and the presence of galactosidase activity. Our study demonstrates the utility of computational modelling to estimate a strain technological group and phenotype from microsatellite allelic combinations as tools for preliminary yeast strain selection.

For Power, we compare our model to a preceding operational model in which we found a flaw. To do so, we define an operational model that we show equivalent to our axiomatic model. We also propose a model for ARM. Our testing on this architecture revealed a behaviour later acknowledged as a bug by ARM, and more recently, 31 additional anomalies. We offer a new simulation tool, called herd, which allows the user to specify the model of his choice in a concise way. Given a specification of a model, the tool becomes a simulator for that model. The tool relies on an axiomatic description; this choice allows us to outperform all previous simulation tools. Additionally, we confirm that verification time is vastly improved, in the case of bounded model checking. Finally, we put our models in perspective, in the light of empirical data obtained by analysing the C and C++ code of a Debian Linux distribution. We present our new analysis tool, called mole, which explores a piece of code to find the weak memory idioms that it uses.

J	Li, SN; Zhang, ZH; Duan, JQ				Li, Shining; Zhang, Zhenhai; Duan, Jiaqi			An Ensemble Multi-Label Feature Selection Algorithm Based on Information Entropy	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; ensembles; feature extraction; feature selection; information entropy; multi-label classification		In multi-label classification, feature selection is able to remove redundant and irrelevant features, which makes the classifiers faster and improves the prediction performance of the classifiers. Currently, most of feature selection algorithms in multi-label classification are dependent on the concrete classifier, which leads to high computation complexity. Hence this paper proposes an Ensemble Multi-label Feature Selection algorithm based on Information Entropy (EMFSIE), which is independent on any concrete classifiers. Its core idea consists of Employing the information gain to evaluate the correlation between the feature and the label set, and filtering out useful features more effectively. We calculate the information gain in an ensemble framework and filter out useful features according to the threshold value determined by the effective factor. We validate EMFSIE on four datasets from two domains using four different multi-label classifiers. The experimental results and their analysis show preliminarily that EMFSIE can not only remove more than 70% of original features, which makes the classifiers faster, but also keep the prediction performance of the classifiers as good as before, even enhance the prediction performance on three datasets underthe two-tailed paired t-tests at 0.05 significance level.

Healthcare workers interpretation of organizational relations mined from electronic health records	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electronic health records; Organizational modeling; Data mining; Survey	PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MEANINGFUL USE; UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; MEDICAL RECORDS; SYSTEMS; ALERTS; ACCESS; ERRORS; IMPLEMENTATION	Objective: Models of healthcare organizations (HCOs) are often defined up front by a select few administrative officials and managers. However, given the size and complexity of modern healthcare systems, this practice does not scale easily. The goal of this work is to investigate the extent to which organizational relationships can be automatically learned from utilization patterns of electronic health record (EHR) systems. Method: We designed an online survey to solicit the perspectives of employees of a large academic medical center. We surveyed employees from two administrative areas: (1) Coding & Charge Entry and (2) Medical Information Services and two clinical areas: (3) Anesthesiology and (4) Psychiatry. To test our hypotheses we selected two administrative units that have work-related responsibilities with electronic records; however, for the clinical areas we selected two disciplines with very different patient responsibilities and whose accesses and people who accessed were similar. We provided each group of employees with questions regarding the chance of interaction between areas in the medical center in the form of association rules (e.g., Given someone from Coding & Charge Entry accessed a patient's record, what is the chance that someone from Medical Information Services access the same record?). We compared the respondent predictions with the rules learned from actual EHR utilization using linear-mixed effects regression models. Results: The findings from our survey confirm that medical center employees can distinguish between association rules of high and non-high likelihood when their own area is involved. Moreover, they can make such distinctions between for any HCO area in this survey. It was further observed that, with respect to highly likely interactions, respondents from certain areas were significantly better than other respondents at making such distinctions and certain areas' associations were more distinguishable than others. Conclusions: These results illustrate that EHR utilization patterns may be consistent with the expectations of HCO employees. Our findings show that certain areas in the HCO are easier than others for employees to assess, which suggests that automated learning strategies may yield more accurate models of healthcare organizations than those based on the perspectives of a select few individuals.

Alkemio: association of chemicals with biomedical topics by text and data mining	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IMPROVE; DRUGS; TOOL	The PubMed (R) database of biomedical citations allows the retrieval of scientific articles studying the function of chemicals in biology and medicine. Mining millions of available citations to search reported associations between chemicals and topics of interest would require substantial human time. We have implemented the Alkemio text mining web tool and SOAP web service to help in this task. The tool uses biomedical articles discussing chemicals (including drugs), predicts their relatedness to the query topic with a naive Bayesian classifier and ranks all chemicals by P-values computed from random simulations. Benchmarks on seven human pathways showed good retrieval performance (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 73.6 to 94.5%). Comparison with existing tools to retrieve chemicals associated to eight diseases showed the higher precision and recall of Alkemio when considering the top 10 candidate chemicals. Alkemio is a high performing web tool ranking chemicals for any biomedical topics and it is free to non-commercial users.

By searching in Oncomine which is a cancer microarray database and web-based data mining platform, we found Glut1 and LDHA were upregulated in human chondrosarcoma patient samples. In this study, we reported total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and phosphorylated EGFR were highly activated in human chondrosarcoma cell lines. In addition, overexpression of EGFR contributed to cisplatin resistance. EGFR promoted glucose metabolism of chondrosarcoma cells through the upregulation of glycolysis key enzymes. Interestingly, cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma cells showed upregulated glucose metabolism and EGFR signaling pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that the combination of either EGFR inhibitor or anaerobic glycolysis inhibitor with cisplatin showed synergistically inhibitory effects on cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma cells through the inducements of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Our project proposed a novel function of EGFR in the regulation of glucose metabolism in chondrosarcoma cells and contributed to the development of therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of chondrosarcoma patient.

Associated with cyclin-D, CDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family members and mediates progression through the G1- to the S-phase of the cell cycle. Amplification and overexpression of CDK4 has been identified in various human malignancies. However, its expression and amplification has never been systemically evaluated in NPC. This study aimed to evaluate the amplification and expression status, correlation with clinicopathological features, and prognostic implications of CDK4 based on public domain dataset and in our well-defined cohort of NPC patients. The association between CDK4 transcript level and gene dosage was explored by analysis of an independent public domain dataset. We retrospectively assessed CDK4 immunoexpression in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients devoid of initial distant metastasis and treated according to consistent guidelines. The results were correlated with clinicopathological features, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMeFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). High levels of CDK4 protein were positively correlated with the T 3, 4 status (p = 0.024); N 2, 3 status (p < 0.001); and the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3, 4 (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested high CDK4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of worse DMeFS (p = 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.226) and DSS (p = 0.037, HR = 1.838). Although CDK4 is frequently upregulated, its gene locus is very uncommonly amplified in NPC. CDK4 overexpression is mostly independent with gene amplification and represents a potential prognostic biomarker in NPC and may indicate tumor aggressiveness through cell cycle dysregulation.

Prediction of Periventricular Leukomalacia Occurrence in Neonates After Heart Surgery	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Classification; data mining; decision tree (DT); feature extraction; feature ranking; mutual information; periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; BALLOON ATRIAL SEPTOSTOMY; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; PRACTITIONER PERFORMANCE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; PATIENT OUTCOMES; SAMPLE ENTROPY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; GREAT-ARTERIES	This paper is concerned with predicting the occurrence of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) using vital and blood gas data which are collected over a period of 12 h after the neonatal cardiac surgery. A data mining approach has been employed to generate a set of rules for classification of subjects as healthy or PVL affected. In view of the fact that blood gas and vital data have different sampling rates, in this study we have divided the data into two categories: 1) high resolution (vital), and 2) low resolution (blood gas), and designed a separate classifier based on each data category. The developed algorithm is composed of several stages; first, a feature pool has been extracted from each data category and the extracted features have been ranked based on the data reliability and their mutual information content with the output. An optimal feature subset with the highest discriminative capability has been formed using simultaneous maximization of the class separability measure and mutual information of a set. Two separate decision trees (DTs) have been developed for the classification purpose and more importantly to discover hidden relationships that exist among the data to help us better understand PVL pathophysiology. The DT result shows that high amplitude 20 min variations and low sample entropy in the vital data and the defined out of range index as well as maximum rate of change in blood gas data are important factors for PVL prediction. Low sample entropy represents lack of variability in hemodynamic measurement, and constant blood pressure with small fluctuations is an important indicator of PVL occurrence. Finally, using the different time frames of data collection, we show that the first 6 h of data contain sufficient information for PVL occurrence prediction.

This study develops a novel morphology-based support vector machine for defective wafer detection. The experimental results demonstrate its usefulness in yield improvements on precision and computation cost. Note to Practitioners-Semiconductor manufacturing in complicated nanotechnology is facing tough challenge for quick response to yield excursion for shortening time to market and reducing the cost to maintain competitive advantages. Due to the increasing complexity of nanotechnology for wafer fabrication, increasingly high inspection costs and yield loss associated with defective wafers have become a critical concern of semiconductor manufacturers. Focused on real settings of practical industrial experiments, this study provides a novel approach to searching similar WBMs from huge wafer spatial data to quickly identify potential causes for yield enhancement. This approach was validated in real setting in Taiwan and the results showed its practical viability.

However, users who lack SQL expertise or familiarity with the database schema face great difficulties in performing this task. To aid these users, we developed the QueRIE system for personalized query recommendations. QueRIE continuously monitors the user's querying behavior and finds matching patterns in the system's query log, in an attempt to identify previous users with similar information needs. Subsequently, QueRIE uses these "similar" users and their queries to recommend queries that the current user may find interesting. In this work we describe an instantiation of the QueRIE framework, where the active user's session is represented by a set of query fragments. The recorded fragments are used to identify similar query fragments in the previously recorded sessions, which are in turn assembled in potentially interesting queries for the active user. We show through experimentation that the proposed method generates meaningful recommendations on real-life traces from the SkyServer database and propose a scalable design that enables the incremental update of similarities, making real-time computations on large amounts of data feasible. Finally, we compare this fragment-based instantiation with our previously proposed tuple-based instantiation discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

In this paper, we developed a Logistical Remote Association Repair Framework (LRARF) to aid repairmen in keeping the system available. LRARF includes four subsystems: smart mobile phones, a Database Management System (DBMS), a Maintenance Support Center (MSC) and wireless networks. The repairman uses smart mobile phones to capture QR-codes and the images of faulty circuit boards. The captured QR-codes and images are transmitted to the DBMS so the invalid modules can be recognized via the proposed algorithm. In this paper, the Linear Projective Transform (LPT) is employed for fast QR-code calibration. Moreover, the ANFIS-based data mining system is used for module identification and searching automatically for the maintenance manual corresponding to the invalid modules. The inputs of the ANFIS-based data mining system are the QR-codes and image features; the output is the module ID. DBMS also transmits the maintenance manual back to the maintenance staff. If modules are not recognizable, the repairmen and center engineers can obtain the relevant information about the invalid modules through live video. The experimental results validate the applicability of the Android-based platform in the recognition of invalid modules. In addition, the live video can also be recorded synchronously on the MSC for later use.

The data mining community has attempted to extract knowledge from the huge amount of data that they generate. However, previous mining work in WSNs has focused on supporting simple relational data structures, like one table per network, while there is a need for more complex data structures. This deficiency motivates XML, which is the current de facto format for the data exchange and modeling of a wide variety of data sources over the web, to be used in WSNs in order to encourage the interchangeability of heterogeneous types of sensors and systems. However, mining XML data for WSNs has two challenging issues: one is the endless data flow; and the other is the complex tree structure. In this paper, we present several new definitions and techniques related to association rule mining over XML data streams in WSNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first approach to mining XML stream data that generates frequent tree items without any redundancy.

When a network evolves, the results of data mining algorithms such as community detection need to be correspondingly updated. Furthermore, the specific kinds of changes to the structure of the network, such as the impact on community structure or the impact on network structural parameters, such as node degrees, also needs to be analyzed. Some dynamic networks have a much faster rate of edge arrival and are referred to as network streams or graph streams. The analysis of such networks is especially challenging, because it needs to be performed with an online approach, under the one-pass constraint of data streams. The incorporation of content can add further complexity to the evolution analysis process. This survey provides an overview of the vast literature on graph evolution analysis and the numerous applications that arise in different contexts.

Such contests offer an opportunity to bring the excitement and challenges of protocol design-one of the core intellectual elements of research and practice in networked systems-to a broader group of potential contributors, whose ideas may prove important. Moreover, it may lead to an increase in the number of students, especially undergraduates or those learning via online courses, interested in pursuing a career in the field. We describe the creation of the infrastructure and our experience with a protocol design contest conducted in MIT's graduate Computer Networks class. This contest involved the design and evaluation of a congestion-control protocol for paths traversing cellular wireless networks. One key to the success of a design contest is an unambiguous, measurable objective to compare protocols. In practice, protocol design is the art of trading off conflicting goals with each other, but in this contest, we specified that the goal was to maximize log (throughput = delay). This goal is a good match for applications such as video streaming or videoconferencing that care about high throughput and low interactive delays. Some students produced protocols whose performance was better than published protocols tackling similar goals. Furthermore, the convex hull of the set of all student protocols traced out a trade-off curve in the throughput-delay space, providing useful insights into the entire space of possible protocols. We found that student protocols diverged in performance between the training and testing traces, indicating that some students had overtrained ("overfitted") their protocols to the training trace. Our conclusion is that, if designed properly, such contests could benefit networking research by making new proposals more easily reproducible and amenable to such "gamification," improve networked systems, and provide an avenue for outreach.

While in Data Mining and classical Statistics the data to be analyzed usually presents one single value for each variable, that is no longer the case when the entities under analysis are not single elements, but groups gathered on the basis of some given criteria. Then, for each variable, variability inherent to each group should be taken into account. Also, when analysing concepts, such as botanic species, disease descriptions, car models, and so on, data entail intrinsic variability, which should be explicitly considered. To this purpose, new variable types have been introduced, whose realizations are not single real values or categories, but sets, intervals, or, more generally, distributions over a given domain. SDA provides methods for the (multivariate) analysis of such data, where the variability expressed in the data representation is taken into account, using various approaches.

J	Morrison, DA				Morrison, David A.			Phylogenetic networks: a new form of multivariate data summary for data mining and exploratory data analysis	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review							QUASI-MEDIAN NETWORKS; AGGLOMERATIVE METHOD; CONSENSUS NETWORKS; DISTANCE DATA; CONSTRUCTION; EVOLUTIONARY; TREES; COLLECTIONS; SPLITSTREE; ORDINATION	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involving both graphical displays and numerical summaries of data, is intended to evaluate the characteristics of the data as well as providing a form of data mining. For multivariate data, the best-known visual summaries include discriminant analysis, ordination, and clustering, particularly metric ordinations such as principal components analysis. However, these techniques have limiting mathematical assumptions that are not always realistic. Recently, network techniques have been developed in the biological field of phylogenetics that address some of these limitations. They are now widely used in biology under the name phylogenetic networks, but they are actually of general applicability to any multivariate dataset. Phylogenetic networks are fast and relatively easy to calculate, which makes them ideal as a tool for EDA. This review provides an overview of the field, with particular reference to the use of what are called splits graphs. There are several types of splits graph, which summarize the multivariate data in different ways. Example analyses are presented based on the neighbor-net graph, which seems to be the most generally useful of the available algorithms. This should encourage the more widespread use of these networks whenever a summary of a multivariate dataset is required. (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Kremer, J; Pedersen, KS; Igel, C				Kremer, Jan; Pedersen, Kim Steenstrup; Igel, Christian			Active learning with support vector machines	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review							TEXT CLASSIFICATION; ONLINE	In machine learning, active learning refers to algorithms that autonomously select the data points from which they will learn. There are many data mining applications in which large amounts of unlabeled data are readily available, but labels (e. g., human annotations or results coming from complex experiments) are costly to obtain. In such scenarios, an active learning algorithm aims at identifying data points that, if labeled and used for training, would most improve the learned model. Labels are then obtained only for the most promising data points. This speeds up learning and reduces labeling costs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are particularly well-suited for active learning due to their convenient mathematical properties. They perform linear classification, typically in a kernel-induced feature space, which makes expressing the distance of a data point from the decision boundary straightforward. Furthermore, heuristics can efficiently help estimate how strongly learning from a data point influences the current model. This information can be used to actively select training samples. After a brief introduction to the active learning problem, we discuss different query strategies for selecting informative data points and review how these strategies give rise to different variants of active learning with SVMs. (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A generic framework and methodology for extracting semantics from co-occurrences	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material						Cognitive models; Co-occurrence; Data mining; Text mining		Extracting semantic associations from text corpora is an important problem with several applications. It is well understood that semantic associations from text can be discerned by observing patterns of co-occurrences of terms. However, much of the work in this direction has been piecemeal, addressing specific kinds of semantic associations. In this work, we propose a generic framework, using which several kinds of semantic associations can be mined. The framework comprises a co-occurrence graph of terms, along with a set of graph operators. A methodology for using this framework is also proposed, where the properties of a given semantic association can be hypothesized and tested over the framework. To show the generic nature of the proposed model, four different semantic associations are mined over a corpus comprising of Wikipedia articles. The design of the proposed framework is inspired from cognitive science - specifically the interplay between semantic and episodic memory in humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we present an innovation to current VAA design which is based on the introduction of a social network element. We refer to this new type of online tool as a social voting advice application (SVAA). SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users' political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the first VAA-Choose4Greece-which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor. Evaluation of the proposed techniques is realized on a series of datasets collected from various VAAs, including Choose4Greece. The collection is made available online in order to promote research in the field.

AN IMPROVED ANT COLONY ALGORITHM FOR EFFECTIVE MINING OF FREQUENT ITEMS	JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING			English	Article						association rule mining; support; confidence; biologically inspiration; stigmergic communication; pheromone updation; transition probability		Data Mining involves discovery of required potentially qualified content from a heavy collection of heterogeneous data sources. Two decades passed, still it remains the interested area for researchers. It has become a flexible platform for mining engineers to analyse and visualize the hidden relationships among the data sources. Association rules have a strong place in representing those relationships by framing suitable rules. It has two powerful parameters namely support and confidence which helps to carry out framing of such rules. Frequent itemset mining is also termed to be frequent pattern mining. When the combination of items increases rapidly, we term it to be a pattern. The ultimate goal is to design rules over such frequent patterns in an effective manner i.e in terms of time complexity and space complexity. The count of evolutionary algorithms to achieve this goal is increasing day by day. Bio Inspired algorithms holds a strong place in machine learning, mining, evolutionary computing and so on. Ant Colony Algorithm is one such algorithm which is designed based on behaviour of biological inspired ants. This algorithm is adopted for its characteristic of parallel search and dynamic memory allocation. It works comparatively faster than basic Apriori algorithm, AIS, FP Growth algorithm. The two major parameters of this algorithm are pheromone updating rule and transition probability. The basic ant colony algorithm is improved by modifying the pheromone updating rule in such way to reduce multiple scan over data storage and reduced count of candidate sets. The proposed approach was tested using MATLAB along with WEKA toolkit. The experimental results prove that the stigmeric communication of improved ant colony algorithm helps in mining the frequent items faster and effectively than the above stated existing algorithms.

In the past few years data mining (clustering) has been of great help so as to assist website's owner to address the complexities related to owners' extracting their visitor's preferences and their coming to know their websites properly. In this line of literature, this paper contains several parts and features. First, with regard to the fact that SUM has been the popular algorithm in dealing with page clustering, a comparison between SUM and K-means (another popular clustering algorithm) were performed to show the superiority of SUM in dealing with the task of webpage clustering. Second, due to the clustering tasks' complication not being able to be tested (unlike Classification), this study aims at proposing a mind-set by which one before taking any other actions has to go through some steps in order to choose the best set of data. Thirdly, looking at the literature, one can see the question about the suitability of types of data (content, structure and usage) and the task they are being used for has never been raised. Using an Iranian website's data, a field study and SUM algorithm, we presented that the popular belief about the type of data and the task they are appropriate for should be open to doubt. It was also depicted that different sets of data in two chosen tasks webpage profiling and extracting visitors' preference - can influence the results tremendously. Last but not least, apart from observing the influence of different sets of data, both data mining tasks have been performed to the end and the results are presented in the paper. Additionally, using the second clustering task's results (the extraction of visitors' preferences) a novel recommendation system is presented. The recommendation system in question was installed in the website for more than a month and its influence on the whole website is observed and analysed.

Constructing a D-matrix from first principles and updating it using the domain knowledge is a labor intensive and time consuming task. Further, in-time augmentation of D-matrix through the discovery of new symptoms and failure modes observed for the first time is a challenging task. Here, we describe an ontology-based text mining method for automatically constructing and updating a D-matrix by mining hundreds of thousands of repair verbatim (typically written in unstructured text) collected during the diagnosis episodes. In our approach, we first construct the fault diagnosis ontology consisting of concepts and relationships commonly observed in the fault diagnosis domain. Next, we employ the text mining algorithms that make use of this ontology to identify the necessary artifacts, such as parts, symptoms, failure modes, and their dependencies from the unstructured repair verbatim text. The proposed method is implemented as a prototype tool and validated by using real-life data collected from the automobile domain.

Initially motivated by traffic safety, vehicles equipped with computing, communication and sensing capabilities will be organized into ubiquitous and pervasive networks with a significant Internet presence while on the move. Large amount of data can be generated, collected, and processed on the vehicular networks. Big data on vehicular networks include useful and sensitive information which could be exploited by malicious intruders. But intrusion detection in vehicular networks is challenging because of its unique features of vehicular networks: short range wireless communication, large amount of nodes, and high mobility of nodes. Traditional methods are hard to detect intrusion in such sophisticated environment, especially when the attack pattern is unknown, therefore, it can result unacceptable false negative error rates. As a novel attempt, the main goal of this research is to apply data mining methodology to recognize known attacks and uncover unknown attacks in vehicular networks. We are the first to attempt to adapt data mining method for intrusion detection in vehicular networks. The main contributions include: I) specially design a decentralized vehicle networks that provide scalable communication and data availability about network status; 2) applying two data mining models to show feasibility of automated intrusion detection system in vehicular networks; 3) find the detection patterns of unknown intrusions.

Although information technology can establish innocence an ability that will only improve with technological advance the fruits of mass surveillance have been used almost exclusively to convict.

The role of effective corporate decisions in the creation of efficient portfolios	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							DIVIDEND POLICY; RISK; EQUILIBRIUM; VALUATION; SELECTION; CHOICE; MARKET	Chief executive officers and chief financial officers seek to implement corporate financial decisions that maximize the stock price and stockholder wealth. Real assets may be tangible, such as machinery or factories, or intangible, such as technical expertise or patents. These real assets must be paid for. To finance the real assets, the financial manager makes decisions regarding the magnitude of common stock issuance and stock repurchases, long-term debt issuance, and debt repurchases. Cash flows are generated by real assets, and the stockholders receive dividend payments based on the net income generated by the corporation. Empirical evidence shows that the dividend payment decision and stock and debt repurchase decisions can increase stock prices and returns. A variable, denoted as corporate exports-which incorporates the amount of dividends, net stock issuances, and net debt repurchases-is used as an expected return to create an initial efficient frontier. A stock selection model is used as a constraint in the portfolio process in conjunction with the corporate exports variable to further increase returns. We use a data mining corrections test for establishing the statistical significance of our portfolio returns.	[Guerard, J.

Despite of the algorithm's timely performance to find a fairly good solution, it shows some drawbacks like its dependence on initial conditions and trapping in local minima. This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, comprised of K-means and a variation operator inspired by mutation in evolutionary algorithms, called Noisy K-means Algorithm (NKA). Previous research used K-means as one of the genetic operators in Genetic Algorithms. However, the proposed NKA is a kind of individual based algorithm that combines advantages of both K-means and mutation. As a result, proposed NKA algorithm has the advantage of faster convergence time, while escaping from local optima. In this algorithm, a probability function is utilized which adaptively tunes the rate of mutation. Furthermore, a special mutation operator is used to guide the search process according to the algorithm performance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the classical K-means, SOM Neural Network, Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm in a given set of data. Simulation results statistically demonstrate that NKA out-performs all others and it is prominently prone to real time clustering.

Despite some advancement, such architectures still suffer from physical network failures, which lead to critical service unavailability. As a remedy to this problem, an overlay-based parallel processing architecture, where nodes manage each other by employing the overlay network, can achieve higher service availability against small-scale failures. However, the overlay-based parallel processing architecture is not capable of providing data mining services in case large-scale network failures disrupt the overlay network. To deal with this issue, our article introduces a design methodology of an overlay-based parallel processing architecture based on integration of overlay and physical networks. Additionally, we introduce basic principles based on the design methodology. Through numerical calculation, we evaluate the effectiveness of an integration approach on the performance of parallel data processing in terms of higher service availability against physical network failures while minimizing traffic load.

However, in addition to the 3V challenges, the flourishing of big data also hinges on fully understanding and managing newly arising security and privacy challenges. If data are not authentic, new mined knowledge will be unconvincing; while if privacy is not well addressed, people may be reluctant to share their data. Because security has been investigated as a new dimension, "veracity," in big data, in this article, we aim to exploit new challenges of big data in terms of privacy, and devote our attention toward efficient and privacy-preserving computing in the big data era. Specifically, we first formalize the general architecture of big data analytics, identify the corresponding privacy requirements, and introduce an efficient and privacy-preserving cosine similarity computing protocol as an example in response to data mining's efficiency and privacy requirements in the big data era.

J	Chen, X; Vorvoreanu, M; Madhavan, K				Chen, Xin; Vorvoreanu, Mihaela; Madhavan, Krishna			Mining Social Media Data for Understanding Students' Learning Experiences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Education; computers and education; social networking; web text analysis	RELIABILITY	Students' informal conversations on social media (e. g., Twitter, Facebook) shed light into their educational experiences-opinions, feelings, and concerns about the learning process. Data from such uninstrumented environments can provide valuable knowledge to inform student learning. Analyzing such data, however, can be challenging. The complexity of students' experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students' Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students' college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students' problems. We then used the algorithm to train a detector of student problems from about 35,000 tweets streamed at the geo-location of Purdue University. This work, for the first time, presents a methodology and results that show how informal social media data can provide insights into students' experiences.

The former method includes glycan structure data mining, profiling analysis and recently Fingerprints, which is an application of cheminformatics techniques to glycans represented at the monosaccharide level. On the other hand, docking analysis for understanding the interactions between glycans and proteins require methods of the latter category. It has been shown that novel analytical techniques and new knowledge can be obtained by combining these independent methods focusing on glycans at the monosaccharide and atomic levels. In this manuscript, we describe the current trends in glycoinfomatics focusing on methods both at the monosaccharide and atomic levels, as well as provide perspectives for the future.

But CBR faces the challenge of assigning weights to the features to measure similarity between a current unsolved case and cases stored in the case base effectively and correctly. The concept of neural network's pruning is already used to sort out feature weighting problem in CBR. But it loses generality and actual elicited knowledge in the ANN's links. This work proposes a method to extract symbolic weights from a trained neural network by observing the whole trained neural network as an AND/OR graph and then finds solution for each node that becomes the weight of a corresponding node. The proposed feature weighting mechanism is used in CBR to build a hybrid expert system for classification task and the performance of the proposed hybrid system is compared with that with other feature weighting mechanisms. The performance is validated on swine flu dataset and ionosphere, sonar and heart datasets collected from UCI repository. From the empirical results it is observed that in all the experiments the proposed feature weighting mechanism outperforms most of the earlier weighting mechanisms extracted from trained neural network.

A Colombian toxicological database (TED) developed and maintained by the Center of Safety Information and Chemical Products (CISPROQUIM by its Spanish abbreviation in) is analyzed here using a demographic clustering technique. Data-quality processes were performed on the raw data (more than 170 variables) and as a result the database was reduced to 20 meaningful variables. The variables characterized by values with categories were selected for clustering analysis: gender, age, type of emergency, emergency location, means of poisoning, product use, and physical state of the toxic substance. Clustering analysis showed that there are three profiles that are prevalent in the TED database: Young Adult Suicidal Woman, Unsupervised Child, and Man at Work. These profiles could not be identified using traditional statistical analyses performed on the data collected by CISPROQUIM or defined a priori from the categorical variables. The identification of vulnerable populations and the cause of the toxicological events are critical in order to develop national prevention programs and policies. The analysis described provided a methodology for a critical analysis of toxicological databases that can be applied to other databases such as security databases.

A framework for bottom-up induction of oblique decision trees	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Oblique decision trees; Bottom-up induction; Clustering	CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN	Decision-tree induction algorithms are widely used in knowledge discovery and data mining, specially in scenarios where model comprehensibility is desired. A variation of the traditional univariate approach is the so-called oblique decision tree, which allows multivariate tests in its non-terminal nodes. Oblique decision trees can model decision boundaries that are oblique to the attribute axes, whereas univariate trees can only perform axis-parallel splits. The vast majority of the oblique and univariate decision-tree induction algorithms employ a top-down strategy for growing the tree, relying on an impurity-based measure for splitting nodes. In this paper, we propose BUTIF-a novel Bottom-Up Oblique Decision-Tree Induction Framework. BUTIF does not rely on an impurity-measure for dividing nodes, since the data resulting from each split is known a priori. For generating the initial leaves of the tree and the splitting hyperplanes in its internal nodes, BUTIF allows the adoption of distinct clustering algorithms and binary classifiers, respectively. It is also capable of performing embedded feature selection, which may reduce the number of features in each hyperplane, thus improving model comprehension. Different from virtually every top-down decision-tree induction algorithm, BUTIF does not require the further execution of a pruning procedure in order to avoid overfitting, due to its bottom-up nature that does not overgrow the tree. We compare distinct instances of BUTIF to traditional univariate and oblique decision-tree induction algorithms. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

J	Wu, S; Feng, XD; Zhou, WJ				Wu, Sen; Feng, Xiaodong; Zhou, Wenjun			Spectral clustering of high-dimensional data exploiting sparse representation vectors	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Spectral clustering; High-dimensional data; Weight matrix; Sparse representation	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; MULTILABEL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; MANIFOLD REGULARIZATION; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; FACE RECOGNITION; REDUCTION; MODEL; SELECTION; SYSTEMS	Clustering high-dimensional data has been a challenging problem in data mining and machining learning. Spectral clustering via sparse representation has been proposed for clustering high-dimensional data. A critical stepin spectral clustering is to effectively construct a weight matrix by assessing the proximity between each pair of objects. While sparse representation has proved its effectiveness for compressing high-dimensional signals, existing spectral clustering algorithms based on sparse representation use individual sparse coefficients directly. However, exploiting complete sparse representation vectors is expected to reflect more truthful similarity among data objects, since more contextual information is being considered. The intuition is that sparse representation vectors corresponding to two similar objects are expected to be similar, while those of two dissimilar objects are dissimilar. In particular, we propose two weight matrix constructions for spectral clustering based on the similarity of the sparse representation vectors. Experimental results on several real-world, high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that spectral clustering based on the proposed weight matrices outperforms existing spectral clustering algorithms, which use sparse coefficients directly.

J	Hinchliff, CE; Smith, SA				Hinchliff, Cody E.; Smith, Stephen Andrew			Some Limitations of Public Sequence Data for Phylogenetic Inference (in Plants)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; SPARSE SUPERMATRICES; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; TAXON COVERAGE; LAND PLANTS; ROGUE TAXA; GENES; LIFE; DIVERSIFICATION; LIKELIHOOD	The GenBank database contains essentially all of the nucleotide sequence data generated for published molecular systematic studies, but for the majority of taxa these data remain sparse. GenBank has value for phylogenetic methods that leverage data-mining and rapidly improving computational methods, but the limits imposed by the sparse structure of the data are not well understood. Here we present a tree representing 13,093 land plant genera-an estimated 80% of extant plant diversity-to illustrate the potential of public sequence data for broad phylogenetic inference in plants, and we explore the limits to inference imposed by the structure of these data using theoretical foundations from phylogenetic data decisiveness. We find that despite very high levels of missing data (over 96%), the present data retain the potential to inform over 86.3% of all possible phylogenetic relationships. Most of these relationships, however, are informed by small amounts of data-approximately half are informed by fewer than four loci, and more than 99% are informed by fewer than fifteen. We also apply an information theoretic measure of branch support to assess the strength of phylogenetic signal in the data, revealing many poorly supported branches concentrated near the tips of the tree, where data are sparse and the limiting effects of this sparseness are stronger. We argue that limits to phylogenetic inference and signal imposed by low data coverage may pose significant challenges for comprehensive phylogenetic inference at the species level. Computational requirements provide additional limits for large reconstructions, but these may be overcome by methodological advances, whereas insufficient data coverage can only be remedied by additional sampling effort. We conclude that public databases have exceptional value for modern systematics and evolutionary biology, and that a continued emphasis on expanding taxonomic and genomic coverage will play a critical role in developing these resources to their full potential.

Attrition is a major cause of potential bias in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Attrition rate above 20% raises concern of the reliability of the results. Few studies have looked at the factors behind attrition in follow-ups spanning decades. Methods. We analyzed attrition and associated factors of a 30-year follow-up cohort of subjects who were born with perinatal risks for neurodevelopmental disorders. Attrition rates were calculated at different stages of follow-up and differences between responders and non-responders were tested. To find combinations of variables influencing attrition and investigate their relative importance at birth, 5, 9, 16 and 30 years of follow-up we used the randomforest classification. Results. Initial loss of potential participants was 13%. Attrition was 16% at five, 24% at nine, 35% at 16 and 46% at 30 years. The only group difference that emerged between responders and non-responders was in socioeconomic status (SES). The variables identified by randomforest classification analysis were classified into Birth related, Development related and SES related. Variables from all these categories contributed to attrition, but SES related variables were less important than birth and development associated variables. Classification accuracy ranged between 0.74 and 0.96 depending on age. Discussion. Lower SES is linked to attrition in many studies. Our results point to the importance of the growth and development related factors in a longitudinal study. Parents' decisions to participate depend on the characteristics of the child. The same association was also seen when the child, now grown up, decided to participate at 30 years. In addition, birth related medical variables are associated with the attrition still at the age of 30. Our results using a data mining approach suggest that attrition in longitudinal studies is influenced by complex interactions of a multitude of variables, which are not necessarily evident using other multivariate techniques.

J	Quaroni, L; Zlateva, T				Quaroni, Luca; Zlateva, Theodora			Real-Time Metabolic Analysis of Living Cancer Cells with Correlated Cellular Spectro-microscopy	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSFORM INFRARED MICROSPECTROSCOPY; PROTEIN-PHOSPHORYLATION; SINGLE CELLS; SPECTROMICROSCOPY; PH; RECOGNITION; GLYCOLYSIS; C-13	In recent years, major efforts have been devoted to the application of microscopy with mid-infrared light to the study of living cells and tissue. Despite this interest, infrared (IR) microscopy has not realized its full potential in the molecular characterization of living systems. This is partly due to the fact that current approaches for data mining and analysis of IR absorption spectra have not evolved comparably to measurement technology and are not up to the interpretation of the complex spectra of living systems such as cells and tissue. In this work we show that the use of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy coupled to IR absorption spectro-microscopy allows us to extract the spectral components of individual metabolites from time-resolved IR spectra of living cells. We call this method correlated cellular spectro-microscopy, and we implement it in the study of the glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells. We show that the method can detect intermediates of the glycolytic pathway, quantify their rate of formation, and correlate this with variations in pH, all in a single measurement. We propose the method as a useful tool for the quantitative description of metabolic processes in living cells and for the validation of drug candidates aimed at suppressing glycolysis in cancer cells.

Robust Radiomics Feature Quantification Using Semiautomatic Volumetric Segmentation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CELL LUNG-CANCER; INTEROBSERVER VARIABILITY; TEXTURAL FEATURES; PET IMAGES; TUMOR; CT; REPRODUCIBILITY; HETEROGENEITY; PARAMETERS	Due to advances in the acquisition and analysis of medical imaging, it is currently possible to quantify the tumor phenotype. The emerging field of Radiomics addresses this issue by converting medical images into minable data by extracting a large number of quantitative imaging features. One of the main challenges of Radiomics is tumor segmentation. Where manual delineation is time consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, it has been shown that semi-automated approaches are fast and reduce inter-observer variability. In this study, a semiautomatic region growing volumetric segmentation algorithm, implemented in the free and publicly available 3D-Slicer platform, was investigated in terms of its robustness for quantitative imaging feature extraction. Fifty-six 3D-radiomic features, quantifying phenotypic differences based on tumor intensity, shape and texture, were extracted from the computed tomography images of twenty lung cancer patients. These radiomic features were derived from the 3D-tumor volumes defined by three independent observers twice using 3D-Slicer, and compared to manual slice-by-slice delineations of five independent physicians in terms of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and feature range. Radiomic features extracted from 3D-Slicer segmentations had significantly higher reproducibility (ICC = 0.85+/-0.15, p = 0.0009) compared to the features extracted from the manual segmentations (ICC = 0.77+/-0.17). Furthermore, we found that features extracted from 3D-Slicer segmentations were more robust, as the range was significantly smaller across observers (p = 3.819e-07), and overlapping with the feature ranges extracted from manual contouring (boundary lower: p = 0.007, higher: p = 5.863e-06). Our results show that 3D-Slicer segmented tumor volumes provide a better alternative to the manual delineation for feature quantification, as they yield more reproducible imaging descriptors. Therefore, 3D-Slicer can be employed for quantitative image feature extraction and image data mining research in large patient cohorts.

Previous studies have shown that directly observable information can be used in order to make reasonable predictions of customer attrition probabilities. However, these studies do not take full account of customer behavior information. In this paper, we demonstrate that efficient use of information can add value to financial services industry and improve the prediction of customer attrition. To achieve this, we apply an orthogonal polynomial approximation analysis to derive unobservable information, which is then used as explanatory variables in a probit-hazard rate model. Our results show that derived information can help our understanding of customer attrition behavior and give better predictions. We conclude that both researchers and the financial service industry should gather and use derived financial information in addition to directly observable information. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jamal, S; Scaria, V				Jamal, Salma; Scaria, Vinod		Open Source Drug Discovery Consort	Data-mining of potential antitubercular activities from molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines	PEERJ			English	Article						Tuberculosis; Traditional Chinese medicine; Cheminformatics; Virtual screening; Data-mining	RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; HERBAL MEDICINE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; HEPATOTOXICITY; ANTIBACTERIAL; RIFAMPICIN; DERIVATIVES; PREDICTION; INNOVATION	Background. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses a well established alternate system of medicine based on a broad range of herbal formulations and is practiced extensively in the region for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, several reports describe in depth studies of the molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines on the biological activities including anti-bacterial activities. The availability of a well-curated dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines and accurate in-silico cheminformatics models for data mining for antitubercular agents and computational filters to prioritize molecules has prompted us to search for potential hits from these datasets. Results. We used a consensus approach to predict molecules with potential antitubercular activities from a large dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines available in the public domain. We further prioritized 160 molecules based on five computational filters (SMARTSfilter) so as to avoid potentially undesirable molecules. We further examined the molecules for permeability across Mycobacterial cell wall and for potential activities against non-replicating and drug tolerant Mycobacteria. Additional in-depth literature surveys for the reported antitubercular activities of the molecular ingredients and their sources were considered for drawing support to prioritization. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that datasets of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines offer a new opportunity to mine for potential biological activities. In this report, we suggest a proof-of-concept methodology to prioritize molecules for further experimental assays using a variety of computational tools. We also additionally suggest that a subset of prioritized molecules could be used for evaluation for tuberculosis due to their additional effect against non-replicating tuberculosis as well as the additional hepato-protection offered by the source of these ingredients.

Intelligent Therapy Assistant (ITA) for cognitive rehabilitation in patients with acquired brain injury	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							CLINICAL DECISION-SUPPORT; HEALTH	Background: This paper presents the design, development and first evaluation of an algorithm, named Intelligent Therapy Assistant (ITA), which automatically selects, configures and schedules rehabilitation tasks for patients with cognitive impairments after an episode of Acquired Brain Injury. The ITA is integrated in "Guttmann, Neuro Personal Trainer" (GNPT), a cognitive tele-rehabilitation platform that provides neuropsychological services. Methods: The ITA selects those tasks that are more suitable for the specific needs of each patient, considering previous experiences, and improving the personalization of the treatment. The system applies data mining techniques to cluster the patients according their cognitive impairment profile. Then, the algorithm rates every rehabilitation task, based on its cognitive structure and the clinical impact of executions done by similar patients. Finally, it configures the most suitable degree of difficulty, depending on the impairment of the patient and his/her evolution during the treatment. Results: The ITA has been evaluated during 18 months by 582 patients. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ITA, a comparison between the traditional manual planning procedure and the one presented in this paper has been done, taking into account: a) the selected tasks assigned to rehabilitation sessions; b) the difficulty level configured for the sessions; c) and the improvement of their cognitive capacities after completing treatment. Conclusions: The obtained results reveal that the rehabilitation treatment proposed by the ITA is as effective as the one performed manually by therapists, arising as a new powerful support tool for therapists. The obtained results make us conclude that the proposal done by the ITA is very close to the one done by therapists, so it is suitable for real treatments.

Automatic medical diagnosis classification tools reduce financial burden on health care systems. In medical diagnosis, patterns consist of observable symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests, which have various associated costs and risks. In this paper, we have experimented and suggested an automated pattern classification method for classifying four diseases into two classes. In the literature on machine learning or data mining, regression and classification problems are typically viewed as two distinct problems differentiated by continuous or categorical dependent variables. There are endeavors to use regression methods to solve classification problems and vice versa. To regard a classification problem as a regression one, we propose a method based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) classification model as one of the powerful methods in intelligent field management. We apply the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a kind of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to find mapping points (MPs) for rounding a real-value to an integer one. Also, we employ the NSGA-II to find out and tune the SVR kernel parameters optimally so as to enhance the performance of our model and achieve better results. The results of the study are compared with the results of some previous studies focusing on the diagnoses of four diseases using the same UCI machine learning database. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields a superior and competitive performance in these four real-world datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many of them require the number of clusters as the input, which may not be practical when it is totally unknown. Several existing visual methods for cluster tendency assessment can be used to estimate the number of clusters by displaying the pairwise dissimilarity matrix into an intensity image where objects are reordered to reveal the hidden data structure as dark blocks along the diagonal. A major limitation of the existing methods is that they are not capable to highlight cluster structure with complex clusters. To address this problem, this paper proposes an effective approach by using Markov Random Fields, which updates each object with its local information dynamically and maximizes the global probability measure. The proposed method can be used to determine the cluster tendency and partition data simultaneously. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hence, the abilities to quantify specific protein sulfhydryl groups within complex biological samples and map disulfide bond structures are crucial to gaining greater insights into how proteins operate in human health and disease. Recent Advances: Many different molecular probes are now commercially available to label and track cysteine residues at great sensitivity. Coupled with mass spectrometry, stable isotope-labeled sulfhydryl-specific reagents can provide previously unprecedented molecular insights into the dynamics of cysteine modification. Likewise, the combined application of modern mass spectrometers with improved sample preparation techniques and novel data mining algorithms is beginning to routinize the analysis of complex protein disulfide structures. Critical Issues: Proper application of these modern tools and techniques, however, still requires fundamental understanding of sulfhydryl chemistry as well as the assumptions that accompany sample preparation and underlie effective data interpretation. Future Directions: The continued development of tools, technical approaches, and corresponding data processing algorithms will, undoubtedly, facilitate site-specific protein sulfhydryl quantification and disulfide structure analysis from within complex biological mixtures with ever-improving accuracy and sensitivity. Fully routinizing disulfide structure analysis will require an equal but balanced focus on sample preparation and corresponding mass spectral dataset reproducibility.

The typology was established on two concepts: the nature of the forces created within the water and the type of inter-limb coordination used. Thirty-eight participants were videotaped while treading water. Multivariate statistics were used to understand how the different behavioural types related to expertise. Three distinct groups of coordination patterns were adopted during treading water. A support vector machine procedure was used as a confirmatory procedure. The data mining process provides a methodological framework to analyse expertise in sports activities, and in this context suggests that a taxonomy can be established among the numerous coordination solutions that allow humans to create stabilising forces in the water.

The spectroscopic analysis has been performed in absorption and emission with femtosecond time resolution, and at pH 5.0 and 8.7 where doxycycline and oxytetracycline are present in their neutral-zwitterionic and monoanionic forms, respectively. The experimental data have been processed by sophisticated data mining methods such as global/target analysis and the maximum entropy method. The results unambiguously indicate that, when doxycycline and oxytetracycline are in their zwitterionic form, they are entrapped within the micelle, while when they are in their monoanionic form, they preferentially show a strong one-to-one interaction with the positively charged surfactant heads. Thus, the pH of the solution controls the inclusion of the investigated drugs into the micelle. When the drugs are entrapped inside the micelles, their spectroscopic and dynamical properties after photoexcitation change appreciably. Interestingly, the entrapped drugs are still able to strongly bind Mg2+ cations, crucial in determining the biological functioning of tetracyclines. The femtosecond resolved measurements reveal that the drugs are efficiently pulled out of the micelles by Mg2+. In fact, magnesium tetracycline complexes are detected in the aqueous phase. The present study suggests the potential promising use of ammonium surfactant micelles embedding doxycycline and oxytetracycline as "smart" drug delivery systems allowing their pH controlled inclusion and Mg2+ induced release.

Understanding CaM binding is complicated by the diversity of target proteins sequences. Data mining of the structures shows that one face of each of the eight CaM helices can contribute to binding, with little overall difference between the Ca2+ loaded N- and C-lobes and a clear prevalence of the C-lobe low Ca2+ conditions. The structures reveal a remarkable variety of configurations where CaM binds its targets in a preferred orientation that can be reversed and where CaM rotates upon Ca2+ binding, suggesting a highly dynamic metastable relation between CaM and its targets. Recent advances in structure function studies and the discovery of CaM mutations being responsible for human diseases, besides expanding the role of CaM in human pathophysiology, are opening new exciting avenues for the understanding of the how CaM decodes Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent signals.

This study examines clustering of factors associated with low fitness in adolescents in order to best target public health interventions for young people. Methods: 1147 children were assessed for fitness, had blood samples, anthropometric measures and all data were linked with routine electronic data to examine educational achievement, deprivation and health service usage. Factors associated with fitness were examined using logistic regression, conditional trees and data mining cluster analysis. Focus groups were conducted with children in a deprived school to examine barriers and facilitators to activity for children in a deprived community. Results: Unfit adolescents are more likely to be deprived, female, have obesity in the family and not achieve in education. There were 3 main clusters for risk of future heart disease/diabetes (high cholesterol/insulin); children at low risk (not obese, fit, achieving in education), children 'visibly at risk' (overweight, unfit, many hospital/GP visits) and 'invisibly at risk' (unfit but not overweight, failing in academic achievement). Qualitative findings show barriers to physical activity include cost, poor access to activity, lack of core physical literacy skills and limited family support. Conclusions: Low fitness in the non-obese child can reveal a hidden group who have high risk factors for heart disease and diabetes but may not be identified as they are normal weight. In deprived communities low fitness is associated with non-achievement in education but in non-deprived communities low fitness is associated with female gender. Interventions need to target deprived families and schools in deprived areas with community wide campaigns.

The main problem of these structures is that they both need to encode each node of a PPC-tree with pre-order and post-order code. This causes that they are memory-consuming and inconvenient to mine frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose Nodeset, a more efficient data structure, for mining frequent itemsets. Nodesets require only the pre-order (or post-order code) of each node, which makes it saves half of memory compared with N-lists and Node-lists. Based on Nodesets, we present an efficient algorithm called FIN to mining frequent itemsets. For evaluating the performance of FIN, we have conduct experiments to compare it with PrePost and FP-growth*, two state-of-the-art algorithms, on a variety of real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that FIN is high performance on both running time and memory usage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed methodology combines state-of-art data mining clustering techniques with a tuned sequence mining method to discover prominent customer behavior trajectories in data bases, which - when combined - represent the "behavior process" as it is followed by particular groups of customers. The framework is applied to a real-life case of an event organizer; it is shown how behavior trajectories can help to explain consumer decisions and to improve business processes that are influenced by customer actions.

J	Nguyen, D; Vo, B; Le, B				Dang Nguyen; Bay Vo; Bac Le			Efficient strategies for parallel mining class association rules	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Associative classification; Class association rule mining; Parallel computing; Data mining; Multi-core processor	INDUCTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS	Mining class association rules (CARs) is an essential, but time-intensive task in Associative Classification (AC). A number of algorithms have been proposed to speed up the mining process. However, sequential algorithms are not efficient for mining CARs in large datasets while existing parallel algorithms require communication and collaboration among computing nodes which introduces the high cost of synchronization. This paper addresses these drawbacks by proposing three efficient approaches for mining CARS in large datasets relying on parallel computing. To date, this is the first study which tries to implement an algorithm for parallel mining CARs on a computer with the multi-core processor architecture. The proposed parallel algorithm is theoretically proven to be faster than existing parallel algorithms. The experimental results also show that our proposed parallel algorithm outperforms a recent sequential algorithm in mining time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, most of the existing recommendation techniques were developed based only on geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending items for mobile users based on both the geographic and semantic features of users' trajectories. The core idea of our recommendation system is based on a novel cluster-based location prediction strategy, namely TrajUtiRec, to improve items recommendation model. Our proposed cluster-based location prediction strategy evaluates the next location of a mobile user based on the frequent behaviors of similar users in the same cluster determined by analyzing users' common behaviors in semantic trajectories. For each location, high utility itemset mining algorithm is performed for discovering high utility itemset. Accordingly, we can recommend the high utility itemset which is related to the location the user might visit. Through a comprehensive evaluation by experiments, our proposal is shown to deliver excellent performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dehkharghani, R; Mercan, H; Javeed, A; Saygin, Y				Dehkharghani, Rahim; Mercan, Hanefi; Javeed, Arsalan; Saygin, Yucel			Sentimental causal rule discovery from Twitter	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Data mining; Machine learning; Causal rules; Sentimental causal rules; Twitter		Social media, especially Twitter is now one of the most popular platforms where people can freely express their opinion. However, it is difficult to extract important summary information from many millions of tweets sent every hour. In this work we propose a new concept, sentimental causal rules, and techniques for extracting sentimental causal rules from textual data sources such as Twitter which combine sentiment analysis and causal rule discovery. Sentiment analysis refers to the task of extracting public sentiment from textual data. The value in sentiment analysis lies in its ability to reflect popularly voiced perceptions that are stated in natural language. Causal rules on the other hand indicate associations between different concepts in a context where one (or several concepts) cause(s) the other(s). We believe that sentimental causal rules are an effective summarization mechanism that combine causal relations among different aspects extracted from textual data as well as the sentiment embedded in these causal relationships. In order to show the effectiveness of sentimental causal rules, we have conducted experiments on Twitter data collected on the Kurdish political issue in Turkey which has been an ongoing heated public debate for many years. Our experiments on Twitter data show that sentimental causal rule discovery is an effective method to summarize information about important aspects of an issue in Twitter which may further be used by politicians for better policy making.

We also present a brief description of the commonly used classifiers in ultrasound based CAD systems. We then review the studies that used features based on the ultrasound images for thyroid nodule classification and highlight the limitations of such studies.

Prediction of Survival in Thyroid Cancer Using Data Mining Technique	TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT			English	Article						Data mining; Thyroid cancer; Artificial Neural Network; Logistic regression; Survival; Prediction	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BREAST-CANCER; TIME	Cancer is the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular diseases in the world. Health professionals are seeking ways for suitable treatment and quality of care in these groups of patients. Survival prediction is important for both physicians and patients in order to choose the best way of management. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the most efficient data mining methods. This technique is able to evaluate the relationship between different variables spontaneously without any prevalent data. In our study ANN and Logistic Regression were used to predict survival in thyroid cancer and compare these results. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result) data were got from SEER site(1). Effective features in thyroid cancer have been selected based on supervision by radiation oncologists and evidence. After data pruning 7706 samples were studied with 16 attributes. Multi Layer Prediction (MLP) was used as the chosen neural network and survival was predicted for 1-, 3- and 5-years. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were parameters to evaluate the model. The results of MLP and Logistic Regression models for one year are defined as for 1-year (92.9%, 92.8, 93%), (81.2%, 88.9%, 72.5%), for 3-year as (85.1%, 87.8%, 82.8%), (88.6%, 90.2%, 87.2%) and for 5-year as (86.8%, 96%, 74.3%), (90.7%, 95.9%, 83.7) respectively. According to our results ANN could efficiently represent a suitable method of survival prediction in thyroid cancer patients and the results were comparable with statistical models.

Revisiting the pseudo continuous pedotransfer function concept: Impact of data quality and data mining method	GEODERMA			English	Article						Neural network; Pseudo continuous PTF; Support vector machine; Water retention curve	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SOIL-WATER RETENTION	The pedotransfer function (PTF) concept has been widely used in recent years as an indirect way to predict soil hydraulic properties, particularly the water retention curve (WRC). The pseudo continuous (PC) approach allows us to predict water content at any predefined matric head, resulting in an almost continuous WRC When combined with powerful pattern recognition approaches, a PC-PTF can be trained to learn the shape of WRC from a discrete set of measured points, unlike traditional parametric PTFs which follow a predefined WRC shape dictated by the selected soil hydraulic equations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of two elements on the performance of a PC-PTF: (i) data mining method (neural network, NN, versus support vector machine, SVM) and (ii) distribution and density of the provided water retention data in the training phase. Two datasets from Turkey and Belgium, consisting of mainly fine and coarse-textured soils, respectively, were employed. Multiple scenarios containing different combinations of measured water retention points in the training phase were defined. The lower root mean square error (RMSE) on average (0.044 cm(3) cm(-3)) attained with the NN-based PTF shows that it is a better option than SVM (RMSE of 0.052 cm(3) cm(-3)) for deriving PC-PTFs. The accuracy of PC-PTF was firmly dependent on the presence of measured water retention points in the entire range of WRC. Applying different scenarios revealed that a well distributed set of measured water retention points in the training phase could result in up to 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) reduction in RMSE values.

Outlier detection in audit logs for application systems	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Systems audit; Outlier detection		An outlier is defined as an observation that is significantly different from the other data in its set. An auditor will employ many techniques, processes and tools to identify these entries, and data mining is one such medium through which the auditor can analyze information. The enormous amount of information contained within transactional processing systems' logs means that auditors must employ automated systems for anomalous data detection. Several data mining algorithms have been tested, especially those that deal specifically with classification and outlier detection. A group of these previously described algorithms was selected for use in designing and developing a process to assist the auditor in anomalous data detection within audit logs. We have been successful in creating and ratifying an outlier detection process that works in the alphanumeric fields of the audit logs from an information system, thus constituting a useful tool for system auditors performing data analysis tasks.

In fact, the success of later KDD phases largely depends on the data preparation stage. The use of mechanisms for automatically preparing data saves a lot of time and resources within the KDD process. These resources will then be available for use at later, less automatable stages, for example, during results interpretation. We have proposed a general-purpose mechanism applicable to multiple domains in order to improve the data preparation phase in the KDD process. This mechanism processes and automatically converts input data to a suitable format for the application of different data preparation techniques based on a known syntax. It is based on the use of description logic Taking a generic UML2 data model as a reference, this mechanism is able to check whether any XML data source whatsoever can be transformed and modelled as a subsumption or instance of the above UML2 model. Thus it automatically identifies a consistent, non-ambiguous and finite set of XLST transformations which are used to prepare the data for the application of data mining techniques, obviating the need to expend resources on the preliminary preparation and formatting stage. The proposed mechanism was applied on structurally complex data from four different domains. In order to test the validity of the proposal, we have applied data mining techniques to extract knowledge from the prepared data. The sound results of applying our proposal to several different domains confirm that it is applicable to any XML data source, as well as being correct, computationally efficient and saving time during the data preparation phase.

Discovering OLAP dimensions in semi-structured data	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (DOLAP)	2012	Maui, HI	ACM		Data warehousing; OLAP; Multidimensional data model; Semi-structured data	MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA	OLAP cubes enable aggregation-centric analysis of transactional data by shaping data records into measurable facts with dimensional characteristics. A multidimensional view is obtained from the available data fields and explicit relationships between them. This classical modeling approach is not feasible for scenarios dealing with semi-structured or poorly structured data. We propose to the data warehouse design methodology with a content-driven discovery of measures and dimensions in the original dataset. Our approach is based on introducing a data enrichment layer responsible for detecting new structural elements in the data using data mining and other techniques. Discovered elements can be of type measure, dimension, or hierarchy level and may represent static or even dynamic properties of the data. This paper focuses on the challenge of generating, maintaining, and querying discovered elements in OLAP cubes. We demonstrate the power of our approach by providing OLAP to the public stream of user-generated content on the Twitter platform. We have been able to enrich the original set with dynamic characteristics, such as user activity, popularity, messaging behavior, as well as to classify messages by topic, impact, origin, method of generation, etc. Knowledge discovery techniques coupled with human expertise enable structural enrichment of the original data beyond the scope of the existing methods for obtaining multidimensional models from relational or semi-structured data.

J	Gorecki, T				Gorecki, Tomasz			Using derivatives in a longest common subsequence dissimilarity measure for time series classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Longest common subsequence; Derivative longest common subsequence; Data mining; Time series	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CLASSIFIERS	Over recent years the popularity of time series has soared. Given the widespread use of modern information technology, a large number of time series may be collected. As a consequence there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of interest in querying and mining such data. A vital component in many types of time series analyses is the choice of an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with the most successful ones based on dynamic programming. One of such measures is longest common subsequence (LCSS). In this paper, we propose a parametrical extension of LCSS based on derivatives. In contrast to well-known measures from the literature, our approach considers the general shape of a time series rather than point-to-point function comparison. The new dissimilarity measure is used in classification with the nearest neighbor rule. In order to provide a comprehensive comparison, we conducted a set of experiments, testing effectiveness on 47 real time series. Experiments show that our method provides a higher quality of classification compared with LCSS on examined data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In the present study we experimentally investigate the combination of support vector clustering with a triangular alignment kernel by evaluating it on an artificial time series benchmark dataset. The experiments lead to meaningful segmentations of the data, thereby providing an example that clustering time series with specific kernels is possible without pre-processing of the data. We compare our approach and the results and learn that the clustering quality is competitive when compared to other approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four famous data-driven approaches, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and the multivariate linear regression (MLR), are applied to develop the prediction models. The persistent model is considered as a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. A procedure of selecting input parameters for solar power prediction models is addressed. Two modeling scenarios, including and excluding meteorological parameters as inputs, are assessed in the model development. A comparative analysis of the data-driven algorithms is conducted. The capability of data-driven models in multi-step ahead prediction is examined. The computational results indicate that none of the algorithms can outperform others in all considered prediction scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pest behaviour insights from quarantine surveillance of male Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae)	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Queensland fruit fly; Bactrocera tryoni; Surveillance; Lynfield trap; Cuelure; Data mining	DACUS-TRYONI; CUE-LURE; RANGE DISPERSAL; FLIES DIPTERA; TRAPS; POPULATION; CLIMATE; AUSTRALIA; PROTEIN; HOSTS	Fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) are a major problem for Australia's $6.9 billion horticultural industry. Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) is the most significant fruit fly pest in the eastern states of Australia. Catches of male B. tryoni from cuelure-baited Lynfield surveillance traps in towns bordering the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone in New South Wales, Australia, from November to May in 2001/2002-2007/2008 were analysed with respect to year, town, property type (urban/rural), and tree species/crop varieties in which the trap was placed (tree type). Average catches of all traps were highest in 2007/2008 and lowest in 2003/2004, and showed an overall positive correlation with rainfall (P < 0.05). More B. tryoni males were caught in Wagga Wagga and Lockhart than in other towns. There were no significant differences in catches of B. tryoni between urban and rurally located traps. With respect to tree type, traps placed in pomefruit trees caught significantly more flies than those in citrus, stonefruit, or nonfruit trees, with no significant differences among the latter three tree groups. Within the pomefruit group, traps in apples (Malus domestica Borkh.) and pears (Pyrus spp.) caught significantly more flies than those in cotoneasters (Cotoneaster spp). Within the citrus group, traps in orange trees (Citrus x sinensis (L) Osbeck) caught significantly more flies than those in mandarin trees (Citrus reticulata Blanco). No significant differences were detected in catches between any members of the stonefruit group. Within the nonfruit group, traps placed in kurrajongs (Brachychiton populneum (Schott & Endl.) R. Br.) caught significantly more flies than those placed on other tree species in the group. This study demonstrates that although surveillance programs conducted to establish and/or maintain area freedom from specific pests may not provide balanced datasets, careful analysis of the results of such programs can provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the species in question.

Analysis of Twitter data imposes new challenges because the data distribution is intrinsically sparse, due to a large number of messages post every day by using a wide vocabulary. Aimed at addressing this issue, generalized itemsets - sets of items at different abstraction levels - can be effectively mined and used to discover interesting multiple-level correlations among data supplied with taxonomies. Each generalized itemset is characterized by a correlation type (positive, negative, or null) according to the strength of the correlation among its items. This paper presents a novel data mining approach to supporting different and interesting targeted analysis - topic trend analysis, context-aware service profiling - by analyzing Twitter posts. We aim at discovering contrasting situations by means of generalized itemsets. Specifically, we focus on comparing itemsets discovered at different abstraction levels and we select large subsets of specific (descendant) itemsets that show correlation type changes with respect to their common ancestor. To this aim, a novel kind of pattern, namely the Strong Flipping Generalized Itemset (SFGI), is extracted from Twitter messages and contextual information supplied with taxonomy hierarchies. Each SFGI consists of a frequent generalized itemset X and the set of its descendants showing a correlation type change with respect to X. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discovering interesting and hidden knowledge from Twitter data.

A small number of these reported defects will be escalated by customers whose businesses are seriously impacted. Escalated defects must be resolved immediately and individually by the software vendors at a very high cost. The total costs can be even greater, including loss of reputation, satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat revenue. In this paper, we develop a Software defecT Escalation Prediction (STEP) system to mine historical defect report data and predict the escalation risk of current defect reports for maximum net profit. More specifically, we first describe a simple and general framework to convert the maximum net profit problem to cost-sensitive learning. We then apply and compare four well-known cost-sensitive learning approaches for STEP. Our experiments suggest that cost-sensitive decision trees (CSTree) is the best methods for producing the highest positive net profit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Explorative forecasting of air pollution	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Prediction; Air pollution forecasting; Fuzzy numbers; Data mining; Expert system	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS	In the paper a model to predict immission concentrations of PM10, SO2, O-3 for a selected number of forward time steps is proposed. The proposed model (e-APFM) is an extension of the Air Pollution Forecasting Model (APFM). APFM requires historical data for a large number of points in time, particularly weather forecast, meteorological and pollution data. e-APFM additionally requires information about the wind direction in sectors and meteorological station. This information also permits pollution at meteorological stations for which we do not have the necessary data (in particular the data about pollution) to be forecast. The experimental verification of the proposed model was conducted on the data from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Poland over a period of two years (between January 2011 and December 2012). Experiments show that the e-APFM method has lower deviations between the measured and predicted concentrations compared to the APFM method for the first day and similar deviations for the next two days (for hourly values) and for the first day and mostly worse for the second and third day (for daily values).

In the present study, we applied a PCR method by using degenerate oligonucleotide primers to isolate the reverse transcriptase (RT) region of gypsy-type retrotransposons in Jatropha curcas L., a biofuel crop. The analysis of 50 isolated PCR-amplified fragments showed a range of heterogeneity among predicted amino acid sequences. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of isolated RT fragments together with retrotransposon families from other plants allowed us to identify three families (Jg1-3) of gypsy-type retroelements in the jatropha genome. Jg1 and Jg2, having primer binding sites (PBS) complementary to tRNA(Arg), were found as jatropha-specific and belonged to the same lineage, which suggests that they arose during early evolution. On the other hand, Jg3 of a different lineage included elements of other species and had PBS complementary to tRNA(Met). The computer-based data mining of jatropha whole genome allowed us to identify a high-copy number gypsy-type family Jg4 of the same lineage as Jg1 and Jg2 which had PBS complementary to tRNA(Arg). Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated that these gypsy-type elements are located in the pericentromeric region of jatropha chromosomes. The data are discussed within the context of the distinct dynamics of the gypsy-type retrotransposon families, their evolution, and their value for phylogenetic and biodiversity studies.

Correlating structure topological metrics with bulk composite properties via neural network analysis	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Homology; Topology; Stiffness; Microstructure; Machine learning; Data mining	GRAIN-BOUNDARY NETWORKS; MULTIPHASE MATERIALS; MULTISCALE MODEL	Given a database of any quantifiable set of cause and effect, machine learning methods can be trained to predict future effects based upon an assumed set of causes. In this paper, neural networks are trained to predict the bulk Young's modulus and electrical conductivity of a two-phase composite with high material property contrast, based upon a sample's microstructure. Various structure metrics are used to quantify the topological connectivity and disorder of analytically generated heterogeneous samples. The neural network is trained to predict the Young's modulus and coefficient of electrical conductivity based upon values calculated for a training set of samples using a finite element model. By repeating the process with various subset of structure metrics we can determine which metrics-or combination of metrics have the strongest influence in accurately predicting bulk material properties. Not only are neural net predictions of bulk properties in good agreement with calculated values for the 2D two-phase composites, but the insights into which metrics most strongly correlate with these properties (in this case, the connectivity metrics) may help focus the development of improved structure-property relations.

However, as coupled carbon-climate models predicted, a positive feedback could be triggered if accelerated soil carbon decomposition offsets enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate. It is thus crucial to reveal whether and how soil carbon stock in forest ecosystems has changed over recent decades. However, large-scale changes in soil carbon stock across forest ecosystems have not yet been carefully examined at both regional and global scales, which have been widely perceived as a big bottleneck in untangling carbon-climate feedback. Using newly developed database and sophisticated data mining approach, here we evaluated temporal changes in topsoil carbon stock across major forest ecosystem in China and analysed potential drivers in soil carbon dynamics over broad geographical scale. Our results indicated that topsoil carbon stock increased significantly within all of five major forest types during the period of 1980s-2000s, with an overall rate of 20.0 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (95% confidence interval, 14.1-25.5). The magnitude of soil carbon accumulation across coniferous forests and coniferous/broadleaved mixed forests exhibited meaningful increases with both mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, soil carbon dynamics across these forest ecosystems were positively associated with clay content, with a larger amount of SOC accumulation occurring in fine-textured soils. In contrast, changes in soil carbon stock across broadleaved forests were insensitive to either climatic or edaphic variables. Overall, these results suggest that soil carbon accumulation does not counteract vegetation carbon sequestration across China's forest ecosystems. The combination of soil carbon accumulation and vegetation carbon sequestration triggers a negative feedback to climate warming, rather than a positive feedback predicted by coupled carbon-climate models.

Two numerical models designed to reproduce Saturn ring temperatures as measured by Cassini-CIRS	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn, rings; Planetary rings; Infrared observations	THERMAL INFRARED-EMISSION; DENSE PLANETARY RINGS; SELF-GRAVITY WAKES; MAIN RINGS; MULTILAYER MODEL; SOLAR ELEVATION; VIMS; SIMULATIONS; PARTICLES; DEPENDENCE	We present two numerical models designed to reproduce the temperatures of the illuminated Saturn rings as measured by the CASSINI-CIRS instrument. Our models are constrained by all available temperature measurements performed on the illuminated rings since SOI. Both models reproduce well the variations of temperature under any illumination and observation geometry. One model is derived from a purely numerical data mining approach, relying on the implementation of a Neural Network that treats the data set globally. This model is used as a test of coverage completeness of the observational parameter space, driving our ability to characterize the rings thermal response. The second (analytical) model is derived using simple physical considerations, by treating the rings as a surface rather than as a collection of individual particles, combined with an empirical anisotropy function to describe the temperature resulting from the Sun's and Saturn's heating. The thermal response of this ring-surface is parameterized by its Bond albedo and emissivity, thermal relaxation time and a set of geometrical parameters quantifying the anisotropy of the temperature measurements depending on azimuth and elevation of the observer with respect to the ring plane, as well as on the solar elevation. Both models provide formulae to predict the ring temperature, that will ease the benchmarking of future physical models against data. The physical model is applied to fit the temperature of tens of different radial slices, allowing us to constrain the combined emissivity and albedo, thermal relaxation time and anisotropy parameters of the ring slabs with the highest radial resolution achieved so far with CIRS. Using for the first time all observation geometries available for illuminated rings, we are confident that our values are as unbiased as possible against observation geometry. The thermal relaxation time appears to be short, a few tens of minutes, and independent of the radial distance across the whole ring. A study of the temperature anisotropy suggests inter-particle shadowing is important in the B ring and in the outer A ring regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mining SOTs and dispatching rules from RFID-enabled real-time shopfloor production data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Radio Frequency Identification (RFID); Real-time; Advanced Production Planning and Scheduling (APS); Data mining; Standard Operation Times (SOTs); Dispatching rules	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; OPERATIONS; INTEGRATION; ENTERPRISE; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; OBJECT	Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been widely used in manufacturing field and created a ubiquitous production environment, where advanced production planning and scheduling (APS) might be enabled. Within such environment, APS usually requires standard operation times (SOTs) and dispatching rules which have been obtained from time studies or based on past experiences. Wide variations exist and frequently cause serious discrepancies in executing plans and schedules. This paper proposes a data mining approach to estimate realistic SOTs and unknown dispatching rules from RFID-enabled shopfloor production data. The approach is evaluated by real-world data from a collaborative company which has been used RFID technology for supporting its shopfloor production over seven years. The key impact factors on SOTs are quantitatively examined. A reference table with the mined precise and practical SOTs is established for typical operations and suitable dispatching rules are labled as managerial implicities, aiming at improving the quality and stability of production plans and schedules.

While these data have a critical role in assisting physicians in the clinical practice, the information that can be extracted goes far beyond this utilization. This article proposes a platform capable of assembling multiple data sources within a medical imaging laboratory, through a network of intelligent sensors. The proposed integration framework follows a SOA hybrid architecture based on an information sensor network, capable of collecting information from several sources in medical imaging laboratories. Currently, the system supports three types of sensors: DICOM repository meta-data, network workflows and examination reports. Each sensor is responsible for converting unstructured information from data sources into a common format that will then be semantically indexed in the framework engine. The platform was deployed in the Cardiology department of a central hospital, allowing identification of processes' characteristics and users' behaviours that were unknown before the utilization of this solution.

Timetables of health centers are usually divided into time slots whose duration is equal to time required for clinical attendance. However doctors perform a series of tasks that are not always clinical in nature: issuing prescriptions or prescribing sick leave certificates. In this sense the time spent in attending a clinical or an administrative matter is different. This last required less time to attend the patient. This study is focused in the administrative task. A predictive model is generated to provide daily information on how many patients will go to the health center for an administrative issue. The accuracy of the model is less than 4,6 % absolute error and the improvement in scheduling appointments is a time saving of 21,73 %.

Characterization of electrolytic tinplate materials via combined finite element and regression models	JOURNAL OF STRAIN ANALYSIS FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN			English	Article						Finite element method; spring-back test; hardness test; electrolytic tinplate; regression models	SHEET-METAL; NEURAL-NETWORK; SPRINGBACK; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; STRESS	In this article, a new method that combines finite element method with data mining techniques is proposed to obtain the mechanical properties of electrolytic tinplate. Using information provided by two simple and economic tests (hardness and spring-back), already used in industries to classify tinplate, yield stress and tensile parameters of a generic electrolytic tinplate can be estimated. Initially, a group of finite element models based on these simple tests were built and validated against experimental data. The validated finite element models were then used to investigate the effect of different thicknesses and electrolytic tinplate plastic hardening parameters. With the convergent results obtained from these finite element simulations, a database was generated with the new electrolytic tinplate properties. Various types of regression models (model trees, artificial neural networks and support vector machines) based on data mining techniques were used to obtain the yield stress and plastic hardening parameters from a generic sample of electrolytic tinplate. The accuracy of the results demonstrates that this new method may be used to economically predict yield stress and plastic hardening parameters of a generic electrolytic tinplate.

A Novel Oncogenic Role of Inositol Phosphatase SHIP2 in ER-Negative Breast Cancer Stem Cells: Involvement of JNK/Vimentin Activation	STEM CELLS			English	Article						SHIP2; Breast cancer stem cells; JNK; Vimentin	ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; LIPID PHOSPHATASE; POLYPHOSPHATE 5-PHOSPHATASE; B-CELLS; C-JUN; PANCREATIC-CANCER; GENE-EXPRESSION; EPHA2 RECEPTOR; PROTEIN	Overexpression of SH2-containing-5'-inositol phosphatase-2 (SHIP2) correlates with poor survival in breast cancer. However, its role in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains unclear. Here, we showed that the percentage of SHIP2(+) cells was positively correlated with that of CD24(-)CD44(+) cells in 60 breast cancer specimens. Among 20 estrogen receptor (ER)-negative samples, 17 had greater SHIP2 expression in CD24(-)CD44(+) subpopulation than the remaining subpopulation. Data mining of microarray analysis of 295 breast tumors showed a significant correlation of higher SHIP2 expression with distant metastasis. Examination of patient-derived mouse xenografts revealed that SHIP2 protein and its tyrosine 1135 phosphorylation were significantly higher in BCSCs, identified as CD24(-)CD44(+) or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH(+)), than non-BCSCs. SHIP2 silencing or inhibitor of SHIP2 phosphatase significantly decreased mammosphere-forming efficiency, ALDH(+) subpopulation in vitro and tumorigenicity of BCSCs in vivo. Overexpression of SHIP2 enhanced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers including vimentin (VIM), which was mainly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells with higher level in mammospheres than monolayer culture. Ablation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), JNK2, or VIM diminished the increased ALDH(+) population and tumorigenicity, induced by SHIP2 overexpression. BCSCs displayed greater expression of phospho-JNK than non-BCSCs and silencing of JNK suppressed SHIP2-mediated upregulation of VIM. Furthermore, SHIP2 overexpression enhanced Akt activation, but Akt inhibition failed to influence SHIP2-induced phospho-JNK/VIM upregulation. In conclusion, SHIP2 plays a key role in BCSCs of ER-negative breast cancers through activation of Akt and JNK with upregulation of VIM and may serve as a target for therapy directed at BCSCs.

Endoparasitic nematodes complete their life cycle within the root vascular cylinder, inducing specialized feeding cells: giant cells for root-knot nematodes and syncytia for cyst nematodes. Both nematodes hijack parts of the transduction cascades involved in developmental processes, or partially mimic the plant responses to other interactions with microorganisms, but molecular evidence of their differences and commonalities is still under investigation. Transcriptomics has been used to describe global expression profiles of their interaction with Arabidopsis, generating vast lists of differentially expressed genes. Although these results are available in public databases and publications, the information is scattered and difficult to handle. Here, we present a rapid, visual, user-friendly and easy to handle spreadsheet tool, called NEMATIC (NEMatode-Arabidopsis Transcriptomic Interaction Compendium; http://www.uclm.es/grupo/gbbmp/english/nematic.asp). It combines existing transcriptomic data for the interaction between Arabidopsis and plant-endoparasitic nematodes with data from different transcriptomic analyses regarding hormone and cell cycle regulation, development, different plant tissues, cell types and various biotic stresses. NEMATIC facilitates efficient in silico studies on plant-nematode biology, allowing rapid cross-comparisons with complex datasets and obtaining customized gene selections through sequential comparative and filtering steps. It includes gene functional classification and links to utilities from several databases. This data-mining spreadsheet will be valuable for the understanding of the molecular bases subjacent to feeding site formation by comparison with other plant systems, and for the selection of genes as potential tools for biotechnological control of nematodes, as demonstrated in the experimentally confirmed examples provided.

J	Mohammad, RM; Thabtah, F; McCluskey, L				Mohammad, Rami M.; Thabtah, Fadi; McCluskey, Lee			Predicting phishing websites based on self-structuring neural network	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Web threat; Phishing; Information security; Neural network; Data mining		Internet has become an essential component of our everyday social and financial activities. Nevertheless, internet users may be vulnerable to different types of web threats, which may cause financial damages, identity theft, loss of private information, brand reputation damage and loss of customer's confidence in e-commerce and online banking. Phishing is considered as a form of web threats that is defined as the art of impersonating a website of an honest enterprise aiming to obtain confidential information such as usernames, passwords and social security number. So far, there is no single solution that can capture every phishing attack. In this article, we proposed an intelligent model for predicting phishing attacks based on artificial neural network particularly self-structuring neural networks. Phishing is a continuous problem where features significant in determining the type of web pages are constantly changing. Thus, we need to constantly improve the network structure in order to cope with these changes. Our model solves this problem by automating the process of structuring the network and shows high acceptance for noisy data, fault tolerance and high prediction accuracy. Several experiments were conducted in our research, and the number of epochs differs in each experiment. From the results, we find that all produced structures have high generalization ability.

This chaperone is up-regulated following stressful events and has been involved in many cellular processes. In Toxoplasma gondii, Hsp90 could be linked with many essential processes of the parasite such as host cell invasion, replication and tachyzoite-bradyzoite interconversion. A Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network approach of TgHsp90 has allowed inferring how these processes may be altered. In addition, data mining of T. gondii phosphoproteome and acetylome has allowed the generation of the phosphorylation and acetylation map of TgHsp90. This review focuses on the potential roles of TgHsp90 in parasite biology and the analysis of experimental data in comparison with its counterparts in yeast and humans.

For this purpose, a new divided k-means algorithm was constructed as a limit case of the known smoothed k-means algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm constructed in this way coincides with the k-means algorithm if during the iterative procedure no data points appear in the Voronoi diagram. If in the partition obtained by applying the divided k-means algorithm there are data points lying in the Voronoi diagram, it is shown that the obtained result can be improved further.

We aimed to investigate the independent risk factors and profiles associated with NBNC-HCC using a data-mining technique. Methods: We conducted a case-control study and enrolled 223 NBNC-HCC patients and 669 controls from a health checkup database (n = 176 886). Multivariate analysis, random forest analysis and a decision-tree algorithm were employed to examine the independent risk factors, factors distinguishing between the case and control groups, and to identify profiles for the incidence of NBNC-HCC, respectively. Results: In multivariate analysis, besides gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels and the Brinkman index, albumin level was an independent negative risk factor for the incidence of NBNC-HCC (odds ratio = 0.67; 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.70; P < 0.0001). In random forest analysis, serum albumin level was the highest-ranked variable for distinguishing between the case and control groups (98 variable importance). A decision-tree algorithm was created for albumin and GGT levels, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and the Brinkman index. The serum albumin level was selected as the initial split variable, and 82.5% of the subjects with albumin levels of less than 4.01 g/dL were found to have NBNC-HCC. Conclusion: Data-mining analysis revealed that serum albumin level is an independent risk factor and the most distinguishable factor associated with the incidence of NBNC-HCC. Furthermore, we created an NBNC-HCC profile consisting of albumin and GGT levels, the APRI and the Brinkman index. This profile could be used in the screening strategy for NBNC-HCC.

However, its quadratic time and space complexity is an obstacle to its applications in the large time series data mining. To address this problem, some lower-bound functions for DTW, fast methods to approximately measure the distance between time series, are used to prune the dissimilar objects from time series database so as to retain the candidates for further measuring their similarity with DTW. So far, the existing lower-bound functions for DTW have been widely accepted for time series similarity search and indexing. In this paper, we propose the extensions of two existing lower-bound functions and discuss the relationships among them. The extensions are improved with high tightness and without much time cost. At the same time, we theoretically prove that these extensions satisfy lower-bound requirement and are better than their old versions respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that in most cases the quality of the proposed extensions of lower-bound functions for DTW outperforms the original versions except for a slightly higher time cost.

J	Hadian, A; Shahrivari, S				Hadian, Ali; Shahrivari, Saeed			High performance parallel -means clustering for disk-resident datasets on multi-core CPUs	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Clustering; k-means; Parallel algorithms; Data mining; Big data	K-MEANS; NUMBER; MAPREDUCE	Nowadays, clustering of massive datasets is a crucial part of many data-analytic tasks. Most of the available clustering algorithms have two shortcomings when used on big data: (1) a large group of clustering algorithms, e.g. -means, has to keep the data in memory and iterate over the data many times which is very costly for big datasets, (2) clustering algorithms that run on limited memory sizes, especially the family of stream-clustering algorithms, do not have a parallel implementation to utilize modern multi-core processors and also they lack decent quality of results. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines parallel clustering with single-pass, stream-clustering algorithms. The aim is to make a clustering algorithm that utilizes maximum capabilities of a regular multi-core PC to cluster the dataset as fast as possible while resulting in acceptable quality of clusters. Our idea is to split the data into chunks and cluster each chunk in a separate thread. Then, the clusters extracted from chunks are aggregated at the final stage using re-clustering. Parameters of the algorithm can be adjusted according to hardware limitations. Experimental results on a 12-core computer show that the proposed method is much faster than its batch-processing equivalents (e.g. -means++) and stream-based algorithms. Also, the quality of solution is often equal to -means++, while it significantly dominates stream-clustering algorithms. Our solution also scales well with extra available cores and hence provides an effective and fast solution to clustering large datasets on multi-core and multi-processor systems.

J	Souam, F; Aitelhadj, A; Baba-Ali, R				Souam, Fatiha; Aitelhadj, Ali; Baba-Ali, Riadh			Dual modularity optimization for detecting overlapping communities in bipartite networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Overlapping community detection; Data mining; Edge partitioning; Global and local modularity optimization; Evolutionary algorithm; Bipartite graph	ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION	Many algorithms have been designed to discover community structure in networks. These algorithms are mostly dedicated to detecting disjoint communities. Very few of them are intended to discover overlapping communities, particularly the bipartite networks have hardly been explored for the detection of such communities. In this paper, we describe a new approach which consists in forming overlapping mixed communities in a bipartite network based on dual optimization of modularity. To this end, we propose two algorithms. The first one is an evolutionary algorithm dedicated for global optimization of the Newman's modularity on the line graph. This algorithm has been tested on well-known real benchmark networks and compared with several other existing methods of community detection in networks. The second one is an algorithm that locally optimizes the graph Mancoridis modularity, and we have adapted to a bipartite graph. Specifically, this second algorithm is applied to the decomposition of vertices, resulting from the evolutionary process, and also characterizes the overlapping communities taking into account their semantic aspect. Our approach requires a priori no knowledge on the number of communities searched in the network. We show its interest on two datasets, namely, a group of synthetic networks and real-world network whose structure is also difficult to understand.

In the USA, as in Europe, it is responsible for the highest mortality rate. Although the risk of coronary heart disease has been recognized, few studies have been conducted on this topic. On the other hand, computer science has become an important part of our lives. The use of medicine and medical science-related artificial intelligence facilitating the diagnosis and analysis of diseases and health problems is attracting considerable attention. The present study focuses on the determination of the optimum method for using artificial intelligence in a clinical decision support system in order to provide a solution and diagnosis regarding the research and medical issues related to the application of such a system. In the present study, we have developed a prediction model capable of the risk assessment of coronary heart disease by optimizing an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the basis of the dataset of Korean National Health and Nutrition Examinations Survey V. The ANFIS-LDA method, which is optimized using a hybrid method, exhibits a high prediction rate of 80.2 % and is more efficient and effective than the existing methods. We expect that our study to contribute to the prevention of coronary heart disease.

From the perspectives of product development and marketing, the opinions left by potential consumers in online social network can generate big ripple effects. This study analyzes the user opinions in online space to grasp preferences toward various products psychologically categorized by users. We also suggest an aspect of the market mentally configured by users using network modeling while following the framework of economic sociology. Existing analyses on online market place are mainly dealing with structural issues such as inter-actor relationships and status measurement. This study, however, analyzes complex preferences regarding diverse products and brands and derives a new model for inter-market connections. We expect that our study will provide important consequences on digital marketing and community design of corporations planning word of mouth effect in online space.

J	Robson, B				Robson, Barry			Hyperbolic Dirac Nets for medical decision support. Theory, methods, and comparison with Bayes Nets	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical inference; Decision support system; Expert system; Bayes Net; Dirac; Hyperbolic; Complex; Hyperbolic Dirac Net	INFORMATION; SET	We recently introduced the concept of a Hyperbolic Dirac Net (HDN) for medical inference on the grounds that, while the traditional Bayes Net (BN) is popular in medicine, it is not suited to that domain: there are many interdependencies such that any "node" can be ultimately conditional upon itself. A traditional BN is a directed acyclic graph by definition, while the HDN is a bidirectional general graph closer to a diffuse "field" of influence. Cycles require bidirectionality; the HDN uses a particular type of imaginary number from Dirac's quantum mechanics to encode it. Comparison with the BN is made alongside a set of recipes for converting a given BN to an HDN, also adding cycles that do not usually require reiterative methods. This conversion is called the P-method. Conversion to cycles can sometimes be difficult, but more troubling was that the original BN had probabilities needing adjustment to satisfy realism alongside the important property called "coherence". The more general and simpler K-method, not dependent on the BN, is usually (but not necessarily) derived by data mining, and is therefore also introduced. As discussed, BN developments may converge to an HDN-like concept, so it is reasonable to consider the HDN as a BN extension. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will begin operations in northern Chile in 2022, will generate a nearly 150 Petabyte imaging dataset of the southern hemisphere sky. The LSST will stream data at rates of 2 Terabytes per hour, effectively capturing an unprecedented movie of the sky. The LSST is expected not only to improve our understanding of time-varying astrophysical objects, but also to reveal a plethora of yet unknown faint and fast-varying phenomena. To cope with a change of paradigm to data-driven astronomy, the fields of astroinformatics and astrostatistics have been created recently. The new data-oriented paradigms for astronomy combine statistics, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to provide the automated and robust methods needed for the rapid detection and classification of known astrophysical objects as well as the unsupervised characterization of novel phenomena. In this article we present an overview of machine learning and computational intelligence applications to TDA. Future big data challenges and new lines of research in TDA, focusing on the LSST, are identified and discussed from the viewpoint of computational intelligence/machine learning. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be required to cope with the challenges posed by the deluge of astronomical data coming from the LSST.

Extracting Urban Occupational Plans Using Cultural Algorithms	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article								Cultural Algorithms can be used to evolve structural functional models of urban centers. The population of the Cultural Algorithm is a set of urban planning agents, each of whom competes to build up a high level model of the site from a set of building blocks. These building blocks are produced through the use of techniques from Data Mining and Complex Systems. The best model is compared with existing models of modern cities in order to identify the similarities and differences between ancient and modern cities. The resultant comparison suggests that early Monte Alban exhibited a sector-based model that is characteristic of some modern cities. In addition, the plan generated by the Cultural Algorithm is able to add insight into the plan generated by a site expert. This suggests that such an approach can be generalized to other urban sites and foster a new understanding of the urbanization process.

Many algorithms for automatically analyzing the structure of recorded music assume that a large change in one or another musical feature suggests a section boundary. However, this assumption has not been tested: while our understanding of how listeners segment melodies has advanced greatly in the past decades, little is known about how this process works with more complex, full-textured pieces of music, or how stable this process is across genres. Knowing how these factors affect how boundaries are perceived will help researchers to judge the viability of algorithmic approaches with different corpora of music. We present a statistical analysis of a large corpus of recordings whose formal structure was annotated by expert listeners. We find that the acoustic properties of boundaries in these recordings corroborate findings of previous perceptual experiments. Nearly all boundaries correspond to peaks in novelty functions, which measure the rate of change of a musical feature at a particular time scale. Moreover, most of these boundaries match peaks in novelty for several features at several time scales. We observe that the boundary-novelty relationship can vary with listener, time scale, genre, and musical feature. Finally, we show that a boundary profile derived from a collection of novelty functions correlates with the estimated salience of boundaries indicated by listeners.	[Smith, Jordan B.

However, most kmeans-type clustering algorithms rely on only intracluster compactness while overlooking intercluster separation. In this paper, a series of new clustering algorithms by extending the existing kmeans-type algorithms is proposed by integrating both intracluster compactness and intercluster separation. First, a set of new objective functions for clustering is developed. Based on these objective functions, the corresponding updating rules for the algorithms are then derived analytically. The properties and performances of these algorithms are investigated on several synthetic and real-life data sets. Experimental studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art kmeans-type clustering algorithms with respect to four metrics: accuracy, RandIndex, Fscore, and normal mutual information.

This type of cumulative effect makes it difficult to determine the machines that introduce product faults. In this paper; we develop a data mining approach to which large amounts of trace data are inputted to infer fault-introducing machines in the form of a L rule, where R contains the fault type and L contains a machine sequence that is the primary cause of the fault type. We tested our approach with industrial lot trace data collected from a PCB manufacturing line with 33 machines and six fault types. From the work-site experiment, we found 26 composite rules that showed a significant cumulative effect. The average fault detection accuracy of the rules was 87.2%. In addition, we found 13 rules that affected more than one fault type.

In this study, microarray analysis was performed to investigate the effects of recombinant Sj16 (rSj16) on the gene expression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs). Immature DCs were treated with LPS, LPS + recombinant Sj16 (rSj16), or rSj16 alone for 24 h, and the gene expression profiles were examined using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays. With the cutoff value of 2-fold change in the expression, 509 genes were affected, 226 genes upregulated, and 283 genes downregulated after adding rSj16. Analysis by functional annotation clustering tool showed that rSj16-affected genes mainly associated with inflammatory response, defense response, regulation of immune system process, apoptosis, and cell migration. The results revealed that rSj16 reduced the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes such as cytokines (e.g., IL6, IL18, IFN-gamma, IL12a, IL1b), chemokines, and receptors (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL9, CCL5, CCR5, CCR1, CCR2, CXCR3) and increased the anti-inflammatory gene IL-10. Further data mining of these genes by pathway analysis showed that genes regulated by rSj16 were significantly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis showed that rSj16 downregulated the expression of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-beta kinase subunit beta (IKK beta) and nuclear factor-kappa beta p65 (NF-kappa I-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) and inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK beta and the NF-kappa B p65 protein, which implied that rSj16 exerting immunomodulatory effects by suppressing NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These results provide useful information in further understanding of the immunoregulation mechanisms of Sj16, and it is indicated that Sj16 could be as a potential molecule for the immunosuppressant drug development.

J	Wewer, V; Brands, M; Dormann, P				Wewer, Vera; Brands, Mathias; Doermann, Peter			Fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism in the obligate biotrophic fungus Rhizophagus irregularis during mycorrhization of Lotus japonicus	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article						Lotus japonicus; Rhizophagus irregularis; Glomus intraradices; mass spectrometry; galactolipid; phospholipid; fatty acid de novo synthesis	GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; STEROL BIOSYNTHESIS; PLANT SPHINGOLIPIDS; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; CORTICAL-CELLS; SYMBIOSIS; ROOTS; GENES	Arbuscular mycorrhiza formation with fungi of the Glomeromycota represents a widespread symbiotic interaction of vascular plants. Different signaling events and metabolic adaptations are required for the close interaction between the two partners. Membrane lipid synthesis is a prerequisite for symbiosis, and membrane properties depend on lipid composition. Lipid profiling was performed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to study the role of triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, phospholipids, galactolipids, sterols and sphingolipids during the colonization of Lotus japonicus roots with Rhizophagus irregularis (syn. Glomus intraradices). Mycorrhization leads to an increased phosphate supply and suppresses the increase in galactolipids commonly observed in phosphate-deprived plants. In addition to free sterols and sterol esters, R. irregularis contains sterol glucosides and acylated sterol glucosides. Glycosylated sphingolipids (glucosylceramide, dihexosylceramide) and inositolphosphorylceramide were detected in the fungus. Lysophosphatidylcholine, a lipid previously implicated in mycorrhiza signaling, is present in low amounts in mock-infected and mycorrhized roots. The composition of fungal phospholipids changes after mycorrhization because molecular species with palmitvaccenic (di-16:1) or tetracosenoic (24: 1) acyl groups decrease in intraradical mycelium. This adaptation of lipid metabolism during intraradical growth is likely a prerequisite for symbiosis, achieving functional compatibility between the fungal and the periarbuscular membrane. Data mining in genomic and transcript databases revealed the presence of genes encoding enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in R. irregularis. However, no gene encoding multidomain fatty acid de novo synthase was detected in the genome sequence of this obligate biotrophic fungus.

To efficiently synthesize (S)-CHBE (> 99 % enantiomeric excess (ee)), the highly stereoselective bioreduction of COBE into (S)-CHBE with the whole cells of E. coli CCZU-Y10 was successfully demonstrated in a dibutyl phthalate-water biphasic system. The appropriate ratio of the organic phase to water phase was 1:1 (v/v). The optimum reaction temperature, reaction pH, cosubstrate, NAD(+), and cell dosage of the biotransformation of 100 mM COBE in this biphasic system were 30 A degrees C, 7.0, mannitol (2.5 mmol/mmol COBE), 0.1 mu mol/(mmol COBE), and 0.1 g (wet weight)/mL, respectively. Moreover, COBE at a high concentration of (1,000 mM) could be asymmetrically reduced to (S)-CHBE in a high yield (99.0 %) and high enantiometric excess value (> 99 % ee). Significantly, E. coli CCZU-Y10 shows high potential in the industrial production of (S)-CHBE (> 99 % ee).

Several statistical criteria were used to verify the validity of the model. Further, the contributions of the influencing variables to the prediction of the electricity demand were analyzed. Correlation coefficient, root mean squared error and mean absolute percent error were used to evaluate the performance of the model. In addition to its high accuracy, the derived model outperforms regression and other soft computing-based models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Koschke, R				Koschke, Rainer			Large-scale inter-system clone detection using suffix trees and hashing	JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS			English	Article						clone detection; code search; license violation detection	CODE CLONES; CCFINDER	Detecting a similar code between two systems has various applications such as comparing two software variants or versions or finding potential license violations. Techniques detecting suspiciously similar code must scale in terms of resources needed to very large code corpora and need to have high precision because a human needs to inspect the results. This paper demonstrates how suffix trees can be used to obtain a scalable comparison. The evaluation is carried out for very large code corpora. Our evaluation shows that our approach is faster than index-based techniques when the analysis is run only once. If the analysis is to be conducted multiple times, creating an index pays off. We report how much code can be filtered out from the analysis using an index-based filter. In addition to that, this paper proposes a method to improve precision through user feedback. A user validates a sample of the found clone candidates. An automated data mining technique learns a decision tree on the basis of the user decisions and different code metrics. We investigate the relevance of several metrics and whether criteria learned from one application domain can be generalized to other domains. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

First, AERS data must be intensively preprocessed to be converted into analyzable format. Second, application of the currently accepted disproportional reporting measures results in false positive signals. Methods We proposed a data mining strategy to improve hypothesis generation with respect to potential associations. Results By numerous examples, we illustrate that our strategy controls the false positive signals. We implemented a free online tool, AERS spider (www.chemoprofiling.org/AERS). Conclusions We believe that AERS spider would be a valuable tool for drug safety experts. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These crystals are then screened based on their elastic and thermodynamic stability resulting in a large database of 665 viable crystals. All the experimentally verified MAX phases passed the screening. Various correlations among and between them are fully explored. In particular, the key elements in the interdependence between the elastic properties together with mechanical parameter derived from them and the electronic structure are identified. Detailed analysis of various correlation plots shows that there is a clear correspondence between bulk modulus K and total bond order density (TBOD). Calculations show a marked difference between the carbides and nitrides. This database is also used to test the efficacy of data mining algorithms for materials genome. We further identified several thermodynamically stable new MAX phases with unusual mechanical parameters that have never been synthesized in the laboratory or theoretically investigated. The complete database on the elastic and electronic structure together with the mechanical parameters for these 665 MAX phases compounds are included in the Supplementary Materials and fully accessible.

It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in Taiwan. According to the well-known adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, the majority of CRC develops from colorectal adenomatous polyps. This concept provides the rationale for screening and prevention of CRC. Removal of colorectal adenoma could reduce the mortality and incidence of CRC. Mobile phones are now playing an ever more crucial role in people's daily lives. The latest generation of smartphones is increasingly viewed as hand-held computers rather than as phones, because of their powerful on-board computing capability, capacious memories, large screens, and open operating systems that encourage development of applications (apps). Subjects and Methods: If we can detect the potential CRC patients early and offer them appropriate treatments and services, this would not only promote the quality of life, but also reduce the possible serious complications and medical costs. In this study, an intelligent CRC screening app on Android (TM) (Google (TM), Mountain View, CA) smartphones has been developed based on a data mining approach using decision tree algorithms. For comparison, the stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression model and the fecal occult blood test were also used. Results: Compared with the stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression model and the fecal occult blood test, the proposed app system not only provides an easy and efficient way to quickly detect high-risk groups of potential CRC patients, but also brings more information about CRC to customer-oriented services. Conclusions: We developed and implemented an app system on Android platforms for ubiquitous healthcare services for CRC screening. It can assist people in achieving early screening, diagnosis, and treatment purposes, prevent the occurrence of complications, and thus reach the goal of preventive medicine.

The lack of effective therapy for advanced stages of melanoma emphasizes the importance of preventive measures and screenings of population at risk. Identifying individuals at high risk should allow targeted screenings and follow-up involving those who would benefit most. The aim of this study was to identify most significant factors for melanoma prediction in our population and to create prognostic models for identification and differentiation of individuals at risk. Methods. This case-control study included 697 participants (341 patients and 356 controls) that underwent extensive interview and skin examination in order to check risk factors for melanoma. Pairwise univariate statistical comparison was used for the coarse selection of the most significant risk factors. These factors were fed into logistic regression (LR) and alternating decision trees (ADT) prognostic models that were assessed for their usefulness in identification of patients at risk to develop melanoma. Validation of the LR model was done by Hosmer and Lemeshow test, whereas the ADT was validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUG for both models were calculated. The melanoma risk score (MRS) based on the outcome of the LR model was presented. Results. The LR model showed that the following risk factors were associated with melanoma: sunbeds (OR = 4.018; 95% CI 1.724-9.366 for those that sometimes used sunbeds), solar damage of the skin (OR = 8.274; 95% CI 2.661-25.730 for those with severe solar damage), hair color (OR = 3.222; 95% CI 1.984-5.231 for light brown/blond hair), the number of common naevi (over 100 naevi had OR = 3.57; 95% CI 1.427-8.931), the number of dysplastic naevi (from 1 to 10 dysplastic naevi OR was 2.672; 95% CI 1.572-4.540; for more than 10 naevi OR was 6.487; 95%; CI 1.993-21.119), Fitzpatricks phototype and the presence of congenital naevi. Red hair, phototype I and large congenital naevi were only present in melanoma patients and thus were strongly associated with melanoma. The percentage of correctly classified subjects in the LR model was 74.9%, sensitivity 71%, specificity 78.7% and AUG 0.805. For the ADT percentage of correctly classified instances was 71.9%, sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 79.4% and AUG 0.808. Conclusion. Application of different models for risk assessment and prediction of melanoma should provide efficient and standardized tool in the hands of clinicians. The presented models offer effective discrimination of individuals at high risk, transparent decision making and real-time implementation suitable for clinical practice. A continuous melanoma database growth would provide for further adjustments and enhancements in model accuracy as well as offering a possibility for successful application of more advanced data mining algorithms.

Data Mining for Significance in Yield-Defect Correlation Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Data mining; integrated circuit yield; kill ratio; probability; semiconductor device manufacture; statistics; yield; yield learning		A yield analysis method using basic yield and in-line defect information in a statistical model to determine root-causes of yield loss in semiconductor manufacturing is presented. The goal of this analysis method is to provide the fab process line management yield loss accounting for defects identified at inspected process layers. Quantifying these losses, in terms of yield loss percent and statistical confidence allows the fab to set priorities for defect reduction work to achieve maximum yield enhancement. Separation of killer defects from nuisance defects and inspection or pattern related noise is a constant challenge. This tool provides statistical techniques for identifying the most effective inspection tool or recipe for a given inspection layer. Enhanced statistical resolution can be achieved through data mining by defect size, classification, or electrical failure bin information. These die level analysis techniques may be combined with memory bit level correlation analysis and physical failure analysis to provide a comprehensive yield accounting assessment.

For that reason, fusion formalisms were a major concern in the belief function community. In this context, the Belief function theory allows information fusion thanks to its combinations tools that it integrates. Nevertheless, belief function theory highlights a limit in the merging of contradictory (conflictual) sources. Many authors tackled this problem offering contributions in this field. Unfortunately, no proposed operator has distinguished by its adequacy regardless the type of handled sources. In this paper, we demonstrate the limits of some referenced works and we diagnostic the issues origin. We propose a conflict management approach based on an extra-information that guides the treatment. We also integrate a generic associative base borrowed from the data mining domain in order to apply the adequate conflict management.

At the same time, it has recently seen a vast growth in publicly and instantly available information. As the available resources become more specialized, there is a growing need for multidisciplinary collaborations between biomedical researchers to address complex research questions. We present an application of a data mining algorithm to genomic data in a collaborative decision-making support environment, as a typical example of how multidisciplinary researchers can collaborate in analyzing and interpreting biomedical data. Through the proposed approach, researchers can easily decide about which data repositories should be considered, analyze the algorithmic results, discuss the weaknesses of the patterns identified, and set up new iterations of the data mining algorithm by defining other descriptive attributes or integrating other relevant data. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach facilitates users to set their research objectives and better understand the data and methodologies used in their research.

As a result of the recent advances in information technology and the government's push for the use of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, a large amount of medical data is collected and stored electronically. This data needs to be made available for analysis but at the same time patient privacy has to be protected through de-idefitification. Although biomedical researchers often describe their research plans when they-request anonymized data, most existing anonymization methods do not use this information when de-identifying the data. As a result, the anonymized data may not be useful for the planned research project. This paper proposes a data recipient centered approach to tailor the de-identification method based on input from the recipient of the data. We demonstrate our approach through an anonymization project for biomedical researchers with specific goals to improve the utility of the anonymized data for statistical models used for their research project. The selected algorithm improves a privacy protection method called Condensation by Aggarwal et al. Our methods were tested and validated on real cancer surveillance data provided by the Kentucky Cancer Registry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The processes of halos' birth and merging play a fundamental role in studying the evolution of large-scale cosmological structure. In this paper, a visual analysis system is developed to interactively identify and explore the evolution histories of thousands of halos. In this system, an intelligent structure-aware selection method in What You See Is What You Get manner is designed to efficiently define user's interesting region in 3D space with 2D hand-drawn lasso input. Then the exact information of halos within this 3D region is identified by data mining in the merger tree files. To avoid visual clutter, all the halos are projected in 2D space with MDS method. Through the linked view of 3D view and 2D graph, users can interactively explore these halos, including the tracing path and the evolution history tree.

Many challenges exist in how to analyze Weibo data. Most works focus on Weibo clustering and topic classification based on analyzing the text contents only. However, the traditional approaches do not work well because most messages on Weibo are very short Chinese sentences. This paper aims to propose a new approach to cluster the Weibo data by analyzing the users' reposting behavior data besides the text contents. To verify the proposed approach, a data set of users' real behaviors from the actual SNS platform is utilized. Experimental results show that the proposed method works better than previous works which depend on the text analysis only.

In this paper, we introduce an enhanced method for simulating high-dimensional time series and apply it to Icelandic fishing resource management data. The methodology can be used in many contexts, but is particularly appropriate for simulating the many complex interactions involved in natural resource management. The simulations can be used to explore the sensitivity of resource management policies to future changes using an affinity parameter. Affinity, qualitatively similar to correlation, is a ordinal measure between -1 and +1 that models one's belief how much the future might behave like, or different from, the past. The main appeal of the method is its reliance on data and relative independence from assumptions about that data. In the paper, we apply it on data on Icelandic cod with encouraging results.

The new panchromatic, synoptic sky surveys require advanced tools for discovering patterns and trends hidden behind data which are both complex and of high dimensionality. We present DAMEWARE (DAta Mining & Exploration Web Application REsource): a general purpose, web-based, distributed data mining environment developed for the exploration of large data sets, and finely tuned for astronomical applications. By means of graphical user interfaces, it allows the user to perform classification, regression, or clustering tasks with machine learning methods. Salient features of DAMEWARE include its ability to work on large datasets with minimal human intervention, and to deal with a wide variety of real problems such as the classification of globular clusters in the galaxy NGC1399; the evaluation of photometric redshifts; and, finally, the identification of candidate Active Galactic Nuclei in multiband photometric surveys. In all these applications, DAMEWARE allowed us to achieve better results than those attained with more traditional methods. With the aim of providing potential users with all needed information, in this paper we briefly describe the technological background of DAMEWARE, give a short introduction to some relevant aspects of data mining, followed by a summary of some science cases and, finally, provide a detailed description of a template use case.

Current platforms supporting AAL systems use database management systems (DBMSs) exclusively for data storage. Active databases employ database triggers to detect and react to events taking place inside or outside of the database. DBMSs can be extended with stored procedures and functions that enable in-database processing. This means that the data processing is integrated and performed within the DBMS. The feasibility and flexibility of the proposed approach were demonstrated with the implementation of three distinct AAL services. The active database was used to detect bed-exits and to discover common room transitions and deviations during the night. In-database machine learning methods were used to model early night behaviors. Consequently, active in-database processing avoids transferring sensitive data outside the database, and this improves performance, security and privacy. Furthermore, centralizing the computation into the DBMS facilitates code reuse, adaptation and maintenance. These are important system properties that take into account the evolving heterogeneity of users, their needs and the devices that are characteristic of smart homes and AAL systems. Therefore, DBMSs can provide capabilities to address requirements for scalability, security, privacy, dependability and personalization in applications of smart environments in healthcare.

Data Mining of Atherosclerotic Plaque Transcriptomes Predicts STAT1-Dependent Inflammatory Signal Integration in Vascular Disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						atherosclerosis; JAK-STAT signalling; IFN gamma; TLR4; diagnostic markers	NF-KAPPA-B; INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR-1; CREB-BINDING PROTEIN; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; IFN-GAMMA; TNF-ALPHA; GENE-EXPRESSION; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; SYNERGISTIC INDUCTION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX	Atherosclerotic plaque development involves multiple extra-and intra-cellular signals engaging cells from the immune system and from the vasculature. Pro-inflammatory pathways activated by interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands are profoundly involved in plaque formation and have been shown to involve cross-talk in all atheroma-interacting cell types leading to increased activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and elevated expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Here we demonstrate that in Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO) deposited microarray datasets, obtained from human coronary and carotid atherosclerotic plaques, a significant increase in expression of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes can be detected. Moreover, increased expression of multiple chemokines, adhesion molecules and matrix-remodeling molecules was commonly detected in both plaque types and correlated with the presence of putative STAT1 binding sites in their promoters, suggesting strong involvement of STAT1 in plaque development. We also provide evidence to suggest that STAT1-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF kappa B) or STAT1-interferon-regulated factor (IRF) regulatory modules are over-represented in the promoters of these inflammatory genes, which points to a possible contribution of IFN gamma and TLR4 cross-talk in the process of atherogenesis. Finally, a subset of these genes encodes for secreted proteins that could serve as a basis of a non-invasive diagnostic assay. The results of our in silico analysis in vitro provide potential evidence that STAT1-dependent IFN gamma-TLR4 cross-talk plays a crucial role in coronary and carotid artery plaque development and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene signature that could represent a novel diagnostic tool to monitor and diagnose plaque progression in human atherosclerosis.

Track Clustering Using Frechet Distance and Minimum Description Length	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Clustering of objects into similar groups that share some common attributes has been a problem of interest in the data-mining community. Applications of this sort include pattern recognition, data analysis, and image recognition. In one recent track data-mining application, a dataset of polygonal trajectories was analyzed to discover common subtrajectories. Recent approaches to the track data-mining problem have made use of either the principle of minimum description length or new metrics for computing the distance between objects with a polygonal shape. A new approach to the track clustering problem based on the Frechet distance metric and the minimum description length principle is proposed and tested with the GeoLife dataset. This approach can be generalized for clustering any dataset of shapes on a metric space.

Accurate photometric redshifts for large samples of galaxies are among the main products of modern multiband digital surveys. Over the last decade, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has become a sort of benchmark against which to test the various methods. Aims. We present an application of a new method to the estimation of photometric redshifts for the galaxies in the SDSS Data Release 9 (SDSS-DR9). Photometric redshifts for more than 143 million galaxies were produced. Methods. The Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton Algorithm (MLPQNA) model, provided within the framework of the DAta Mining and Exploration Web Application REsource (DAMEWARE), is an interpolative method derived from machine learning models. Results. The obtained redshifts have an overall uncertainty of sigma= 0.023 with a very small average bias of similar to 3 x 10 5, and a fraction of catastrophic outliers (vertical bar Delta z vertical bar > 2 sigma) of similar to 5%. This result is slightly better than what was already available in the literature in terms of the smaller fraction of catastrophic outliers as well.

These algorithms are implemented in a large-scale distributed environment to scale to massive data sets. To accelerate these large-scale graph-based iterative computations, we propose delta-based accumulative iterative computation (DAIC). Different from traditional iterative computations, which iteratively update the result based on the result from the previous iteration, DAIC updates the result by accumulating the "changes'' between iterations. By DAIC, we can process only the "changes'' to avoid the negligible updates. Furthermore, we can perform DAIC asynchronously to bypass the high-cost synchronous barriers in heterogeneous distributed environments. Based on the DAIC model, we design and implement an asynchronous graph processing framework, Maiter. We evaluate Maiter on local cluster as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The results show that Maiter achieves as much as 60x speedup over Hadoop and outperforms other state-of-the-art frameworks.

In the recent years, numerous studies have been done in this area. The breast cancer is a major concern among women, and physicians need to have access to a smart system for predicting the illness on time before it is too late to be treated. The C5.0 is one of the important algorithms in data mining area. In this paper, we present an approach to breast canser prediction using C5.0. We use of a database called 'wisconsin Breast Cancer database' containing 10 attributes and 699 instances. The method used is called CRISP-DM, the C5.0 algorithm is used to create a model by Clementine software for data and subsequently, to create the confusion matrix. The results have been evaluated using sensitivity and specificity measures. Moreover, by using BOOSTING method, the model will be more precised with less percentage of error.

Clinically, it remains a major challenge to predict therapeutic response and patient outcomes after CCRT. Annexin I (ANXA1), encoded by ANXA1, is a Ca2+/phospholipid-binding protein that mediates actin dynamics and cellular proliferation, as well as suggesting tumor aggressiveness and predicting therapeutic response in certain malignancies. However, expression of ANXA1 has never been reported in rectal cancer receiving CCRT. This study examined the predictive and prognostic impact of ANXA1 expression in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant CCRT. We identified ANXA1 as associated with resistance to CCRT through data mining from a published transcriptomic dataset. Its immunoexpression was retrospectively assessed using H scores on pre-treatment biopsies from 172 rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT followed by curative surgery. Results were correlated with clinicopathological features, therapeutic response, tumor regression grade (TRG), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS), as well as local recurrent-free survival (LRFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). High expression of ANXA1 was associated with advanced pre-treatment tumor status (T3, T4, p = 0.022), advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1, N2, p = 0.004), advanced post-treatment tumor status (T3, T4, p < 0.001), advanced post-treatment nodal status (N1, N2, p = 0.001) and inferior TRG (p = 0.009). In addition, high expression of ANXA1 emerged as an adverse prognosticator for DSS (p < 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0001) and MeFS (p = 0.0004). Moreover, high expression of ANXA1 also remained independently prognostic of worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.998; p = 0.007), LRFS (HR = 3.206; p = 0.028) and MeFS (HR = 3.075; p = 0.017). This study concludes that high expression of ANXA1 is associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT.

Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) was first identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which is a key enzyme for isometric conversion of fatty acids entering the beta-oxidation. Given the roles of AMACR in prognostication and frontline therapeutic regimen of common carcinomas, such as prostate cancer, we explored AMACR immunoexpression status and its clinical significance in NPC patients. AMACR immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score for biopsy specimens from 124 NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score larger than the median value were construed as featuring AMACR overexpression. The findings were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Endogenous AMACR protein expressions were assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting in NPC cells and non-neoplastic mucosal cells. AMACR overexpression was significantly associated with increment of primary tumor status (P = 0.009) and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS, DMFS, and LRFS. In the multivariate comparison, AMACR overexpression still remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (P = 0.006, hazard ratio = 2.129), DMFS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio = 2.795), and LRFS (P = 0.041, hazard ratio = 2.009), together with advanced American Joint of Cancer Committee (AJCC) stages III-IV. Compared with non-neoplastic cells, both HONE1 and TW01 NPC cells demonstrated markedly increased AMACR expression. AMACR overexpression was identified as an important prognosticator and a potential therapeutic target in the future.

It proposes a methodology for evaluating risk and safety and describes the main issues of aircraft accidents. We have a huge amount of knowledge and data collection in aviation companies. This paper focuses on different feature selectwindion techniques applied to the datasets of airline databases to understand and clean the dataset. CFS subset evaluator, consistency subset evaluator, gain ratio feature evaluator, information gain attribute evaluator, OneR attribute evaluator, principal components attribute transformer, ReliefF attribute evaluatoboundar and symmetrical uncertainty attribute evaluator are used in this study in order to reduce the number of initial attributes. The classification algorithms, such as DT, KNN, SVM, NN and NB, are used to predict the warning level of the component as the class attribute. We have explored the use of different classification techniques on aviation components data. For this purpose Weka software tools are used. This study also proves that the principal components attribute with decision tree classifier would perform better than other attributes and techniques on airline data. Accuracy is also very highly improved. This work may be useful for an aviation company to make better predictions. Some safety recommendations are also addressed to airline companies.

The use of multiple classifiers generally allows better predictive performance than that achievable with a single model. Several approaches exist in the literature that provide means to construct and aggregate such ensembles. However, these ensemble systems contain redundant members that, if removed, may further increase group diversity and produce better results. Smaller ensembles also relax the memory and storage requirements, reducing system's run-time overhead while improving overall efficiency. This paper extends the ideas developed for feature selection problems to support classifier ensemble reduction, by transforming ensemble predictions into training samples, and treating classifiers as features. Also, the global heuristic harmony search is used to select a reduced subset of such artificial features, while attempting to maximize the feature subset evaluation. The resulting technique is systematically evaluated using high dimensional and large sized benchmark datasets, showing a superior classification performance against both original, unreduced ensembles, and randomly formed subsets.

Recently, hashing-based approaches, for example, locality sensitive hashing (LSH), are proved to be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbor search. Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly, a large number of hash tables (i. e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hashing algorithm called density sensitive hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data, DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data. Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art hashing approaches.

However, the mechanisms driving injury-induced immune response and tissue repair remain poorly understood. For over 200 years, planarians have been a classical model for studies on tissue regeneration, but the planarian immune system and its potential role in repair is largely unknown. We found through comparative genomic analysis and data mining that planarians contain many potential homologs of the innate immune system that are activated during injury and repair of adult tissues. These findings support the notion that the relationship between adult tissue repair and the immune system is an ancient feature of basal Bilateria. Further analysis of the planarian immune system during regeneration could potentially add to our understanding of how the innate immune system and inflammatory responses interplay with regenerative signals to induce scar-less tissue repair in the context of the adult organism.

Without complex data pre-processing, delay data collected by the existing IATA delay coding system are inadequate to support advanced delay analytics, e.g. large-scale delay propagation tracing in an airline network. Consequently, we developed three new coding schemes aiming at improving the current IATA system. These schemes were tested with specific analysis tasks using simulated delay data and were bench-marked against the IATA system. It was found that a coding scheme with a well-designed reporting style can facilitate automated data analytics and data mining, and an improved grouping of delay codes can minimise potential confusion at the data entry and recording stages.

J	Chang, TP				Chang, Tsui-Ping			A Sliding-Window Method to Discover Recent Frequent Query Patterns from XML Query Streams	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						XML query pattern; XML stream mining; encoding scheme; database; data stream	TRANSACTIONAL DATA STREAMS; ITEMSETS; EFFICIENT; MODEL	Providing efficient mining algorithm to discover recent frequent XML user query patterns is crucial, as many applications use XML to represent data in their disciplines over the Internet. These recent frequent XML user query patterns can be used to design an index mechanism or cached and thus enhance XML query performance. Several XML query pattern stream mining algorithms have been proposed to record user queries in the system and thus discover the recent frequent XML query patterns over a stream. By using these recent frequent XML query patterns, the query performance of XML data stream is improved. In this paper, user queries are modeled as a stream of XML queries and the recent frequent XML query patterns are thus mined over the stream. Data-stream mining differs from traditional data mining since its input of mining is data streams, while the latter focuses on mining static databases. To facilitate the one-pass mining process, novel schemes (i.e. XstreamCode and XstreamList) are devised in the mining algorithm (i.e. X(2)StreamMiner) in this paper. X(2)StreamMiner not only reduces the memory space, but also improves the mining performance. The simulation results also show that X(2)StreamMiner algorithm is both efficient and scalable. There are two major contributions in this paper. First, the novel schemes are proposed to encode and store the information of user queries in an XML query stream. Second, based on the two schemes, an efficient XML query stream mining algorithm, X(2)StreamMiner, is proposed to discover the recent frequent XML query patterns.

An efficient algorithm for the computation of average mutual information: Validation and implementation in Matlab	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Mutual information; Numerical computation; Copula modeling; State-space reconstruction	INSTANCE THEORY; AUTOMATICITY; SELECTION; WEIBULL; TIME	Average mutual information (AMI) measures the dependence between pairs of random variables. It has been used in many applications including blind source separation, data mining, neural synchronicity assessment, and state space reconstruction in human movement studies. Presently, several algorithms and computational code exist to estimate AMI. However, most are difficult to use and/or understand the manner by which AMI is calculated. We offer a straightforward and implementable function in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.) for the computation of AMI in relatively modest sized data streams (N < similar to 15,000). Our algorithm incorporates some best practices for statistical estimation that improves accuracy over other readily available options. We present three validation tests: (i) recovery of a known theoretical expected mutual information in a bivariate Gaussian random variable, (ii) invariance with respect to marginal distribution characteristics, and (iii) optimum time-delay selection in state space reconstruction.

Nevertheless, AI applications have not been consolidated as standard solutions in the industry, and most common applications of AI still are case studies and pilot projects. In this work, an analysis of a survey conducted on a broad group of professionals related to several E&P operations and service companies is presented. This survey captures the level of AI knowledge in the industry, the most common application areas, and the expectations of the users from AI-based solutions. It also includes a literature review of technical papers related to AI applications and trends in the market and in research and development. The survey helped to verify that (a) data mining and neural networks are by far the most popular AI technologies used in the industry; (b) approximately 50% of respondents declared they were somehow engaged in applying workflow automation, automatic process control, rule-based case reasoning, data mining, proxy models, and virtual environments; (c) production is the area most affected by the applications of AI technologies; (d) the perceived level of available literature and public knowledge of AI technologies is generally low; and (e) although availability of information is generally low, it is not perceived equally among different roles. This work aims to be a guide for personnel responsible for production and asset management on how AI-based applications can add more value and improve their decision making. The results of the survey offer a guideline on which tools to consider for each particular oil and gas challenge. It also illustrates how AI techniques will play an important role in future developments of information-technology (IT) solutions in the E&P industry.

Cluster analysis, which identifies groups of similar data items in large datasets, is one of its recent beneficiaries. The increasing complexity and large amounts of data in the datasets have seen data clustering emerge as a popular focus for the application of optimization based techniques. Different optimization techniques have been applied to investigate the optimal solution for clustering problems. Swarm intelligence (SI) is one such optimization technique whose algorithms have successfully been demonstrated as solutions for different data clustering domains. In this paper we investigate the growth of literature in SI and its algorithms, particularly Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This paper makes two major contributions. Firstly, it provides a thorough literature overview focusing on some of the most cited techniques that have been used for PSO-based data clustering. Secondly, we analyze the reported results and highlight the performance of different techniques against contemporary clustering techniques. We also provide an brief overview of our PSO-based hierarchical clustering approach (HPSO-clustering) and compare the results with traditional hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), K-means, and PSO clustering.

Modern data complements event counts with many additional measurements (such as geographic, demographic, and others) that comprise high-dimensional covariates. This leads to an important challenge to detect a change that only occurs within a region, initially unspecified, defined by these covariates. Current methods used to handle covariate information are limited to low-dimensional data. The approach presented in this article transforms the problem to supervised learning, so that an appropriate learner and signal criteria can then be defined. A feature selection algorithm is used to identify covariates that contribute to a model (either individually or through interactions) and this is used to generate a signal based on formal statistical inference. A measure of statistical significance is also included to control false alarms. Graphical plots are used to isolate change locations in covariate space. Results on a variety of simulated examples are provided.

A Rb1 promoter variant with reduced activity contributes to osteosarcoma susceptibility in irradiated mice	MOLECULAR CANCER			English	Article						Tumor susceptibility; Germline polymorphism; Promoter activity; Radiation-induced; Bone tumor; Mouse model	GERM-LINE MUTATIONS; RETINOBLASTOMA GENE; HEREDITARY RETINOBLASTOMA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; BONE TUMORIGENESIS; CANCER SYNDROMES; RADIATION; FAMILY; PREDISPOSITION; MOUSE	Background: Syndromic forms of osteosarcoma (OS) account for less than 10% of all recorded cases of this malignancy. An individual OS predisposition is also possible by the inheritance of low penetrance alleles of tumor susceptibility genes, usually without evidence of a syndromic condition. Genetic variants involved in such a non-syndromic form of tumor predisposition are difficult to identify, given the low incidence of osteosarcoma cases and the genetic heterogeneity of patients. We recently mapped a major OS susceptibility QTL to mouse chromosome 14 by comparing alpha-radiation induced osteosarcoma in mouse strains which differ in their tumor susceptibility. Methods: Tumor-specific allelic losses in murine osteosacoma were mapped along chromosome 14 using microsatellite markers and SNP allelotyping. Candidate gene search in the mapped interval was refined using PosMed data mining and mRNA expression analysis in normal osteoblasts. A strain-specific promoter variant in Rb1 was tested for its influence on mRNA expression using reporter assay. Results: A common Rb1 allele derived from the BALB/cHeNhg strain was identified as the major determinant of radiation-induced OS risk at this locus. Increased OS-risk is linked with a hexanucleotide deletion in the promoter region which is predicted to change WT1 and SP1 transcription factor-binding sites. Both in-vitro reporter and in-vivo expression assays confirmed an approx. 1.5 fold reduced gene expression by this promoter variant. Concordantly, the 50% reduction in Rb1 expression in mice bearing a conditional hemizygous Rb1 deletion causes a significant rise of OS incidence following alpha-irradiation. Conclusion: This is the first experimental demonstration of a functional and genetic link between reduced Rb1 expression from a common promoter variant and increased tumor risk after radiation exposure. We propose that a reduced Rb1 expression by common variants in regulatory regions can modify the risk for a malignant transformation of bone cells after radiation exposure.

It allows for a more patient specific treatment plan as opposed to the "one size fits all"-approach, used by the pharmaceutical industry when producing fixed dose finished drug products. However, loss of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) powder during pharmaceutical capsule compounding can lead to under-dosed finished drug products and annul the beneficiary therapeutic effects for the patient. The amount and location of API loss was experimentally determined during capsule compounding of five different preparations: 10 and 20 mg hydrocortisone capsules, 4 mg triamcinolone capsules and 0.25 mg dexamethasone capsules, using a 10% m/m self-made or commercial trituration. The total API amount present in the five capsule preparations varied between 90.8% and 96.6%, demonstrating that for certain preparations, significant API mass loss occurred during the pharmaceutical compounding of capsules. Swabbing results of the different compounding equipment and working areas indicated the mortar surface as the largest API loss location. An agate mortar accounted for the least amount of API loss, whereas an extensively used porcelain mortar accounted for the highest amount of API loss. Optical microscopy and roughness (Ra) determination by profilometry of the different mortar surfaces revealed a significant influence of the mortar surface wear and tear on the observed API loss. This observation can be explained by physical deformation, or scratch formation, of the relatively soft porcelain mortar surface, in which the API particles can become adsorbed. Furthermore, a small effect of the capsulation device material on the API loss was also observed. The presence of a chemical molecule effect on the API loss was demonstrated through data mining using a set of assay results containing 17 different molecules and 1922 assay values. The 17 median assay values were modeled in function of corresponding molecular descriptors, using stepwise multiple linear regression. The obtained MLR model, containing RDF060m, R6e(+) and R3m(+) variables, explained 92.5% of the observed variability between the 17 median assay values. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A critical consideration for the processing of SWATH data is the quality of the ion library (or mass spectrometric reference map). As the availability of open spectral libraries that can be used to process SWATH data is limited, most users currently create their libraries in-house. Herein, we propose an approach to construct an expanded ion library using the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) data generated by fractionation proteomics. We identified three critical elements for achieving a satisfactory ion library during the iterative process of our ion library expansion, including a correction of the retention times (RTs) gained from fractionation proteomics, appropriate integrations of the fractionated proteomics into an ion library, and assessments of the impact of the expanded ion libraries to data mining in SWATH. Using a bacterial lysate as an evaluation material, we employed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to fractionate the lysate proteins and constructed the expanded ion library using the fractionation proteomics data. Compared with the ion library built from the unfractionated proteomics, approximately 20% more peptides were extracted from the expanded ion library. The extracted peptides, moreover, were acceptable for further quantitative analysis.

In an attempt to accurately and comprehensively predict this type of mass spectra, a framework named (MSPBPI)-P-2 is proposed. (MSPBPI)-P-2 first extracts fragment ions from large-scale MS/MS spectra data sets according to the peptide fragmentation pathways and uses binary trees to divide the obtained bulky data into tens to more than 1000 regions. For each adequate region, stochastic gradient boosting tree regression model is constructed. By constructing hundreds of these models, (MSPBPI)-P-2 is able to predict MS/MS spectra for unmodified and modified peptides with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, high consistency between predicted and experimental MS/MS spectra derived from different ion trap instruments with low and high resolving power is achieved. MS2PBPI outperforms existing algorithms MassAnalyzer and PeptideART.

Positive Darwinian selection in the singularly large taste receptor gene family of an 'ancient' fish, Latimeria chalumnae	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Coelacanth; Bitter taste; Pheromone; Phylogeny; Sarcopterygian; Evolution	BITTER TASTE; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; CODON ALIGNMENTS; EVOLUTION; VOMERONASAL; COELACANTH; ODORANT; REPERTOIRES; DIVERSIFICATION; COMBINATORIAL	Background: Chemical senses are one of the foremost means by which organisms make sense of their environment, among them the olfactory and gustatory sense of vertebrates and arthropods. Both senses use large repertoires of receptors to achieve perception of complex chemosensory stimuli. High evolutionary dynamics of some olfactory and gustatory receptor gene families result in considerable variance of chemosensory perception between species. Interestingly, both ora/v1r genes and the closely related t2r genes constitute small and rather conserved families in teleost fish, but show rapid evolution and large species differences in tetrapods. To understand this transition, chemosensory gene repertoires of earlier diverging members of the tetrapod lineage, i.e. lobe-finned fish such as Latimeria would be of high interest. Results: We report here the complete T2R repertoire of Latimeria chalumnae, using thorough data mining and extensive phylogenetic analysis. Eighty t2r genes were identified, by far the largest family reported for any species so far. The genomic neighborhood of t2r genes is enriched in repeat elements, which may have facilitated the extensive gene duplication events resulting in such a large family. Examination of non-synonymous vs. synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) suggests pronounced positive Darwinian selection in Latimeria T2Rs, conceivably ensuring efficient neo-functionalization of newly born t2r genes. Notably, both traits, positive selection and enrichment of repeat elements in the genomic neighborhood, are absent in the twenty v1r genes of Latimeria. Sequence divergence in Latimeria T2Rs and V1Rs is high, reminescent of the corresponding teleost families. Some conserved sequence motifs of Latimeria T2Rs and V1Rs are shared with the respective teleost but not tetrapod genes, consistent with a potential role of such motifs in detection of aquatic chemosensory stimuli. Conclusions: The singularly large T2R repertoire of Latimeria may have been generated by facilitating local gene duplication via increased density of repeat elements, and efficient neofunctionalization via positive Darwinian selection. The high evolutionary dynamics of tetrapod t2r gene families precedes the emergence of tetrapods, i.e. the water-to-land transition, and thus constitutes a basal feature of the lobe-finned lineage of vertebrates.

J	Yang, LS; Dacek, S; Ceder, G				Yang, Lusann; Dacek, Stephen; Ceder, Gerbrand			Proposed definition of crystal substructure and substructural similarity	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							PREDICTION; DESIGN	There is a clear need for a practical and mathematically rigorous description of local structure in inorganic compounds so that structures and chemistries can be easily compared across large data sets. Here a method for decomposing crystal structures into substructures is given, and a similarity function between those substructures is defined. The similarity function is based on both geometric and chemical similarity. This construction allows for large-scale data mining of substructural properties, and the analysis of substructures and void spaces within crystal structures. The method is validated via the prediction of Li-ion intercalation sites for the oxides. Tested on databases of known Li-ion-containing oxides, the method reproduces all Li-ion sites in an oxide with a maximum of 4 incorrect guesses 80% of the time.

It has been explored particularly in its relationship with the genome to identify correlations for diseases. The phenome has been also explored for drug repositioning with efforts focusing on the search space for the most similar candidate drugs. For a comprehensive analysis of the phenome, we assumed that all phenotypes (indications and side effects) were inter-connected with a probabilistic distribution and this characteristic may offer an opportunity to identify new therapeutic indications for a given drug. Correspondingly, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which introduces latent variables (topics) to govern the phenome distribution. Results: We developed our model on the phenome information in Side Effect Resource (SIDER). We first developed a LDA model optimized based on its recovery potential through perturbing the drug-phenotype matrix for each of the drug-indication pairs where each drug-indication relationship was switched to "unknown" one at the time and then recovered based on the remaining drug-phenotype pairs. Of the probabilistically significant pairs, 70% was successfully recovered. Next, we applied the model on the whole phenome to narrow down repositioning candidates and suggest alternative indications. We were able to retrieve approved indications of 6 drugs whose indications were not listed in SIDER. For 908 drugs that were present with their indication information, our model suggested alternative treatment options for further investigations. Several of the suggested new uses can be supported with information from the scientific literature. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the phenome can be further analyzed by a generative model, which can discover probabilistic associations between drugs and therapeutic uses. In this regard, LDA serves as an enrichment tool to explore new uses of existing drugs by narrowing down the search space.

Within the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells and Sertoli cells are surrounded by testicular fluid (TF), which probably contains most of the secreted proteins involved in crosstalk between these cells. It has already been established that germ cells can modulate somatic Sertoli cell function through the secretion of diffusible factors. We studied the germ cell secretome, which was previously considered inaccessible, by analyzing the TF collected by microsurgery in an "integrative omics'' strategy combining proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics and interactomics data. This approach identified a set of proteins preferentially secreted by Sertoli cells or germ cells. An interaction network analysis revealed complex, interlaced cell-cell dialog between the secretome and membranome of seminiferous cells, mediated via the TF. We then focused on germ cell-secreted candidate proteins, and we identified several potential interacting partners located on the surface of Sertoli cells. Two interactions, APOH/CDC42 and APP/NGFR, were validated in situ, in a proximity ligation assay (PLA). Our results provide new insight into the crosstalk between germ cells and Sertoli cells occurring during spermatogenesis. Our findings also demonstrate that this "integrative omics'' strategy is powerful enough for data mining and highlighting meaningful cell-cell communication events between different types of cells in a complex tissue, via a biological fluid. This integrative strategy could be applied more widely, to gain access to secretomes that have proved difficult to study whilst avoiding the limitations of in vitro culture.

J	Wang, LW; Jiang, GQ; Li, DC; Liu, HF				Wang, Liwei; Jiang, Guoqian; Li, Dingcheng; Liu, Hongfang			Standardizing adverse drug event reporting data	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article							PUBLIC VERSION; MEDICATION INFORMATION; CLINICAL-OBSERVATIONS; EXTRACTION SYSTEM; AERS; RXNORM; REPRODUCIBILITY; PROFILES	Background: The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is an FDA database providing rich information on voluntary reports of adverse drug events (ADEs). Normalizing data in the AERS would improve the mining capacity of the AERS for drug safety signal detection and promote semantic interoperability between the AERS and other data sources. In this study, we normalize the AERS and build a publicly available normalized ADE data source. The drug information in the AERS is normalized to RxNorm, a standard terminology source for medication, using a natural language processing medication extraction tool, MedEx. Drug class information is then obtained from the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) using a greedy algorithm. Adverse events are aggregated through mapping with the Preferred Term (PT) and System Organ Class (SOC) codes of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The performance of MedEx-based annotation was evaluated and case studies were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of our approaches. Results: Our study yields an aggregated knowledge-enhanced AERS data mining set (AERS-DM). In total, the AERS-DM contains 37,029,228 Drug-ADE records. Seventy-one percent (10,221/14,490) of normalized drug concepts in the AERS were classified to 9 classes in NDF-RT. The number of unique pairs is 4,639,613 between RxNorm concepts and MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) codes and 205,725 between RxNorm concepts and SOC codes after ADE aggregation. Conclusions: We have built an open-source Drug-ADE knowledge resource with data being normalized and aggregated using standard biomedical ontologies. The data resource has the potential to assist the mining of ADE from AERS for the data mining research community.

Canc Genome Atlas Res Network	Multiplatform Analysis of 12 Cancer Types Reveals Molecular Classification within and across Tissues of Origin	CELL			English	Article							CELL LUNG-CANCER; COMPREHENSIVE GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION; BREAST-CANCER; NECK-CANCER; MUTATIONS; CARCINOMA; GENES; PORTRAITS; CISPLATIN; MIGRATION	Recent genomic analyses of pathologically defined tumor types identify "within-a-tissue'' disease subtypes. However, the extent to which genomic signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We performed an integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-oforigin counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into common subtypes. Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by TP53 alterations, TP63 amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pancancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes. All data sets are available for data-mining from a unified resource to support further biological discoveries and insights into novel therapeutic strategies.

J	Fan, C; Xiao, F; Wang, SW				Fan, Cheng; Xiao, Fu; Wang, Shengwei			Development of prediction models for next-day building energy consumption and peak power demand using data Mining techniques	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Building energy prediction; Data mining; Feature extraction; Clustering analysis; Recursive feature elimination; Ensemble model	NEURAL-NETWORK	This paper presents a data mining (DM) based approach to developing ensemble models for predicting next-day energy consumption and peak power demand, with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy. This approach mainly consists of three steps. Firstly, outlier detection, which merges feature extraction, clustering analysis, and the generalized extreme studentized deviate (GESD), is performed to remove the abnormal daily energy consumption profiles. Secondly, the recursive feature elimination (RFE), an embedded variable selection method, is applied to select the optimal inputs to the base prediction models developed separately using eight popular predictive algorithms. The parameters of each model are then obtained through leave-group-out cross validation (LGOCV). Finally, the ensemble model is developed and the weights of the eight predictive models are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). The approach is adopted to analyze the large energy consumption data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The prediction accuracies of the ensemble models measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 2.32% and 2.85% for the next-day energy consumption and peak power demand respectively, which are evidently higher than those of individual base models. The results also show that the outlier detection method is effective in identifying the abnormal daily energy consumption profiles. The RFE process can significantly reduce the computation load while enhancing the model performance. The ensemble models are valuable for developing strategies of fault detection and diagnosis, operation optimization and interactions between buildings and smart grid. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is mainly divided into two steps. The first step is to generate a spare hyperplane and estimate the score of each instance in positive bags. For the second step, MI-NSVM seeks the "most positive" instance of each positive bag by the information obtained in the first step, and then generates the second hyperplane. MI-NSVM is a useful extension of twin SVM and has the same advantages as it. All experiments show that our method is superior to the traditional MI-SVM and MI-TSVM in both computation time and classification accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

First, we used ANOVA and PCA for a preliminary analysis. Then, machine-learning tools for identification and classification were applied to verify the feasibility of using data mining tools to find the region where M. tenacissima samples originated. The study clearly indicated that the support vector machine, the radial basis function neural network, and the random forest chemometric tools had the potential to identify the origins of M. tenacissima. The results revealed that the SVM-grid model was superior to all the other mathematical methods with an average discrimination rate of 98.875% for the training set and 100% for the test set. The order of successful identification rates is as follows: SVM-grid > SVM-ga > RF > RBF-NN > SVM-pso. Moreover, there have been few relevant studies about the application of these machine-learning tools combined with multi-element analysis for tracing the geographical source, so this paper can serve as a reference to identify the origin and perform quality assurance in the field of medicinal plants.

METHODS: The strategic tree algorithm was used to identify the main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health. The backpropogation artificial neural network was used to analyze the main manifestations of sub-healthy mental states of three different degrees. A sub-mental health evaluation model was then established to achieve predictive evaluation results. RESULTS: Using classifications from the Scale of Chinese Sub-healthy State, the main manifestations of sub-mental health selected using the strategic tree were F1101 (Do you lack peace of mind?), F1102 (Are you easily nervous when something comes up?), and F1002 (Do you often sigh?). The relative intensity of manifestations of sub-mental health was highest for F1101, followed by F1102, and then F1002. Through study of the neural network, better differentiation could be made between moderate and severe and between mild and severe states of sub-mental health. The differentiation between mild and moderate sub-mental health states was less apparent. Additionally, the sub-mental health state evaluation model, which could be used to predict states of sub-mental health of different individuals, was established using F1101, F1102, F1002, and the mental self-assessment total score. CONCLUSION: The main manifestations of the state of sub-mental health can be discovered using data mining methods to research and analyze the latent laws and knowledge hidden in research evidence on the state of sub-mental health. The state of sub-mental health of different individuals can be rapidly predicted using the model established here. This can provide a basis for assessment and intervention for sub-mental health. It can also replace the relatively outdated approaches to research on sub-health in the technical era of information and digitization by combining the study of states of sub-mental health with information techniques and by further quantifying the relevant information.

One of these models is the Multi-Criteria Optimization Classifier (MCOC). By finding a trade-off between overlapping of different classes and total distance from input points to the decision boundary, MCOC can derive a decision function from distinct classes of training data and subsequently use this function to predict the class label of an unseen sample. In many real world applications, however, owing to noise, outliers, class imbalance, nonlinearly separable problems and other uncertainties in data, classification quality degenerates rapidly when using MCOC. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-criteria optimization classifier based on kernel, fuzzification, and penalty factors (KFP-MCOC): Firstly a kernel function is used to map input points into a high-dimensional feature space, then an appropriate fuzzy membership function is introduced to MCOC and associated with each data point in the feature space, and the unequal penalty factors are added to the input points of imbalanced classes. Thus, the effects of the aforementioned problems are reduced. Our experimental results of credit risk evaluation and their comparison with MCOC, support vector machines (SVM) and fuzzy SVM show that KFP-MCOC can enhance the separation of different applicants, the efficiency of credit risk scoring, and the generalization of predicting the credit rank of a new credit applicant.

Ischemic cardiac events and other adverse events following ACAM2000 (R) smallpox vaccine in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System	VACCINE			English	Article						ACAM2000 (R); Ischemic cardiac events; Myocarditis; Pericarditis; Myo/pericarditis	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; JANUARY-OCTOBER 2003; UNITED-STATES; MILITARY; PROGRAM; SAFETY; EXPERIENCE	Background: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a passive reporting system, used for monitoring the safety of all US licensed vaccines. In March 2008, ACAM2000 (R) replaced Dryvax (R) as the only licensed smallpox vaccine and is administered to all persons entering military service and certain civilian researchers. In 2011, routine data mining of VAERS identified a vaccine safety concern resulting in acute ischemic cardiac events (ICE) following ACAM2000 (R). Methods: During March 1, 2008 through June 30, 2013, we reviewed all serious reports received following ACAM2000 (R) and classified them by diagnostic category. We identified possible ICE cases by searching the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA (R)) terms for "myocardial ischaemia," "acute myocardial infarction," "myocardial infarction," and "ischaemia," and applied standardized surveillance case definitions. Results: VAERS received 1149 reports following ACAM2000 (R) administration; 169 (14.7%) were serious (resulting in permanent disability, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness or death), including one death. The two most frequent diagnostic categories for serious reports were cardiovascular and other infectious conditions. The MedDRA (R) search found 31 reports of possible ICE after receipt of ACAM2000 (R) vaccine. Of a total 30 possible ICE cases with demographic information, all but one was male; the age range was 20-45 years (median 32) and median interval to onset of symptoms was 12 days. On clinical review there were 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis and 15 ICE cases. Conclusions: Our review of the data mining signal did not substantiate the concerns about ICE after ACAM2000 (R). Our study also suggests that with current pre-vaccination screening, cardiac morbidity in generally healthy vaccinated populations remains uncommon. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, because a symbol is mapped from the average value of a segment, the SAX ignores important information in a segment, namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot distinguish different time series with similar average values but different trends. In this paper, we firstly design a measure to compute the distance of trends using the starting and the ending points of segments. Then we propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.

We used the information available in the PDB to survey the structural features that are common among proteins, which bind to vanadate. The ability of vanadate to mimic phosphate and vice versa is presumably due to the structural similarity vanadate shares with phosphate. We analyze the geometries of the bound vanadate and the nature of its binding interfaces. We also compared structures of enzyme groups bound to both ligands. This data improves our understanding of vanadate recognition and will be useful in not only the evaluation of new structures but also in the development of new therapeutic agents based on structural recognition.

Tetracycline, an effective antibiotic that has been in use for many years, is becoming less successful in treating certain pathogens. To better understand the temporal patterns in the growth of antibiotic resistance, patient diagnostic test records can be analyzed. Methods: Data mining methods including frequent item set mining and association rules via the Apriori algorithm were used to analyze results from 80,241 Target Enriched Multiplex-PCR (TEM-PCR) reference laboratory tests. From the data mining results, five common respiratory pathogens and their co-detection rates with tetracycline resistance genes (TRG) were further analyzed and organized according to year, patient age, and geography. Results: From 2010, all five pathogens were associated with at least a 24% rise in co-detection rate for TRGs. Patients from 0-2 years old exhibited the lowest rate of TRG co-detection, while patients between 13-50 years old displayed the highest frequency of TRG co-detection. The Northeastern region of the United States recorded the highest rate of patients co-detected with a TRG and a respiratory pathogen. Along the East-west gradient, the relative frequency of co-detection between TRGs and respiratory pathogens decreased dramatically. Conclusions: Significant trends were uncovered regarding the co-detection frequencies of TRGs and respiratory pathogens over time. It is valuable for the field of public health to monitor trends regarding the spread of resistant infectious disease, especially since tetracycline continues to be utilized a treatment for various microbial infections. Analyzing large datasets containing TEM-PCR results for co-detections provides valuable insights into trends of antibiotic resistance gene expression so that the effectiveness of first-line treatments can be continuously monitored.

An intrinsic dimensionality of a data set is a key parameter in many dimensionality reduction algorithms. When the intrinsic dimensionality of a data set is known, it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing much information. To this end, it is reasonable to find out the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. In this paper, one of the global estimators of intrinsic dimensionality, the packing numbers estimator (PNE), is explored experimentally. We propose the modification of the PNE method that uses geodesic distances in order to improve the estimates of the intrinsic dimensionality by the PNE method.

We explored the performances of methods dedicated to big data analysis for detecting independent associations between exposures and a health outcome. Methods: We searched for associations between 303 covariates and influenza infection in 498 subjects (14% infected) sampled from a dedicated cohort. Independent associations were detected using two data mining methods, the Random Forests (RF) and the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT); the conventional logistic regression framework (Univariate Followed by Multivariate Logistic Regression - UFMLR) and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with penalty in multivariate logistic regression to achieve a sparse selection of covariates. We developed permutations tests to assess the statistical significance of associations. We simulated 500 similar sized datasets to estimate the True (TPR) and False (FPR) Positive Rates associated with these methods. Results: Between 3 and 24 covariates (1%-8%) were identified as associated with influenza infection depending on the method. The pre-seasonal haemagglutination inhibition antibody titer was the unique covariate selected with all methods while 266 (87%) covariates were not selected by any method. At 5% nominal significance level, the TPR were 85% with RF, 80% with BRT, 26% to 49% with UFMLR, 71% to 78% with LASSO. Conversely, the FPR were 4% with RF and BRT, 9% to 2% with UFMLR, and 9% to 4% with LASSO. Conclusions: Data mining methods and LASSO should be considered as valuable methods to detect independent associations in large epidemiologic datasets.

Airborne hyperspectral sensors with high spectral and spatial resolutions can be employed for detailed characterization of urban areas. This study aims to develop a procedure that is instrumental for automated knowledge discovery and mapping of urban surface materials from a large feature space of hyperspectral images. Two different images over Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia, were captured by using hyperspectral sensors with 20 and 128 bands. The images were used to explore the combined performance of a data mining (DM) algorithm and object-based image analysis (OBIA). A large number of attributes were discovered with the C4.5 DM algorithm, which also generated the classification model as a decision tree. The UPM and KL classified images achieved 93.42 and 88.36% overall accuracy. The high accuracy of object-based classification can be linked to the knowledge discovery produced by the DM algorithm. This algorithm increased the productivity of OBIA, expedited the process of attribute selection, and resulted in an easy-to-use representation of a knowledge model from a decision tree structure.

New method: To test this hypothesis, transgenic Huntington's disease (tgHD) rats were repeatedly screened within phenotyping home-cages (PhenoMaster and IntelliCage for rats), where spontaneous activity, feeding, drinking, temperature, and metabolic performance were continuously measured. Cognition and emotionality were evaluated within the same environment by means of operant learning procedures and refined analysis of the behavioral display under conditions of novelty. This investigator-independent approach was further correlated with behavioral display of the animals in classical behavioral assays. Multivariate analysis (MVA) including Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to explore correlation patterns of variables within and across the two genotypes. Results: The automated systems traced previously undetected aspects in the phenotype of tgHD rats (circadian activity, energy metabolism, rearing), and out of those spontaneous free rearing correlated with individual performance in the accelerod test. PCA revealed a segregation by genotype in juvenile tgHD rats that differed from adult animals, being further resolved by PLS-DA detecting "temperature" (juvenile) and "rearing" (adult) as phenotypic key variables in the tgHD model. Conclusions: Intra-home-cage phenotyping in combination with MVA, is capable of characterizing a complex phenotype by detecting novel physiological and behavioral markers with high sensitivity and standardization using fewer human resources. A broader application of automated systems for large-scale screening is encouraged. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Breast cancer is the second most leading cause of cancer related mortality in women. The main reason for mortality is chemoresistance and metastasis for which remnant stem cells are believed to be the cause. One of the natural ways to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women is early pregnancy. Unraveling the mechanism behind it would add to our knowledge and help in evolving newer paradigms for breast cancer prevention. The current study deals with investigating transcriptomic differences in putative stem cells in mammary epithelial cell population (MECs) in terms of genes and microRNAs. In silico tools were used to identify potential mechanisms. ALDH positive MECs represent a putative stem cell population in the mammary gland. Methods: MECs were extracted from the mammary gland of virgin and parous (one time pregnant) rats. ALDH positive MECs were sorted and used for transcriptional and translational analysis for genes and microRNAs. In silico analysis for target prediction and networking was performed through online portals of Target Scan and Metacore. Results: A total of 35 and 49 genes and microRNAs respectively were found to be differentially expressed within the two groups. Among the important genes were Lifr, Acvr1c, and Ppar. which were found to be targeted by microRNAs in our dataset like miR-143, miR-30, miR-140, miR-27b, miR-125a, miR-128ab, miR-342, miR-26ab, miR-181, miR-150, miR-23ab and miR-425. In silico data mining and networking also demonstrates that genes and microRNA interaction can have profound effects on stem cell renewal, cell cycle dynamics and EMT processes of the MEC population. Conclusions: Our data clearly shows that certain microRNAs play crucial role in the regulation of ALDH positive MECs and favor an anti-carcinogenic environment in the post-partum gland. Some of the potential interplaying mechanisms in the ALDH positive MEC population identified through this study are p21, Lifr and Ppar. mediated cell cycle regulation, regulation of metastasis and expansion of stem cell pool respectively.

The utilities of subsequences in sequences in the existing approach are difficult to be calculated due to the three kinds of utility calculations. To simplify the utility calculation, this work then presents a maximum utility measure, which is derived from the principle of traditional sequential pattern mining that the count of a subsequence in the sequence is only regarded as one. Hence, the maximum measure is properly used to simplify the utility calculation for subsequences in mining. Meanwhile, an effective upper-bound model is designed to avoid information losing in mining, and also an effective projection-based pruning strategy is designed as well to cause more accurate sequence-utility upper-bounds of subsequences. The indexing strategy is also developed to quickly find the relevant sequences for prefixes in mining, and thus unnecessary search time can be reduced. Finally, the experimental results on several datasets show the proposed approach has good performance in both pruning effectiveness and execution efficiency. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Garcia-Rudolph, A; Gibert, K				Garcia-Rudolph, Alejandro; Gibert, Karina			A data mining approach to identify cognitive NeuroRehabilitation Range in Traumatic Brain Injury patients	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Algorithms; Statistics	DECISION-TREE ANALYSIS; REHABILITATION; EXPERIENCE; PLASTICITY; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; VARIABLES	Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) treatment consists of hierarchically organized tasks that require repetitive use of impaired cognitive functions in a progressively more demanding sequence. Active monitoring of the progress of the subjects is therefore required, and the difficulty of the tasks must be progressively increased, always pushing the subjects to reach a goal just beyond what they can attain. There is an important lack of well-established criteria by which to identify the right tasks to propose to the patient. In this paper, the NeuroRehabilitation Range (NRR) is introduced as a means of identifying formal operational models. These are to provide the therapist with dynamic decision support information for assigning the most appropriate CR plan to each patient. Data mining techniques are used to build data-driven models for NRR. The Sectorized and Annotated Plane (SAP) is proposed as a visual tool by which to identify NRR, and two data-driven methods to build the SAP are introduced and compared. Application to a specific representative cognitive task is presented. The results obtained suggest that the current clinical hypothesis about NRR might be reconsidered. Prior knowledge in the area is taken into account to introduce the number of task executions and task performance into NRR models and a new model is proposed which outperforms the current clinical hypothesis. The NRR is introduced as a key concept to provide an operational model identifying when a patient is experiencing activities in his or her Zone of Proximal Development and, consequently, experiencing maximum improvement. For the first time, data collected through a CR platform has been used to find a model for the NRR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, MY; Lee, DH				Kim, Mi-Yeon; Lee, Dong Hoon			Data-mining based SQL injection attack detection using internal query trees	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection; SQL injection attack; Database; Data mining; SVM	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SVM	Detecting SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) is becoming increasingly important in database-driven web sites. Until now, most of the studies on SQLIA detection have focused on the structured query language (SQL) structure at the application level. Unfortunately, this approach inevitably fails to detect those attacks that use already stored procedure and data within the database system. In this paper, we propose a framework to detect SQLIAs at database level by using SVM classification and various kernel functions. The key issue of SQLIA detection framework is how to represent the internal query tree collected from database log suitable for SVM classification algorithm in order to acquire good performance in detecting SQLIAs. To solve the issue, we first propose a novel method to convert the query tree into an n-dimensional feature vector by using a multi-dimensional sequence as an intermediate representation. The reason that it is difficult to directly convert the query tree into an n-dimensional feature vector is the complexity and variability of the query tree structure. Second, we propose a method to extract the syntactic features, as well as the semantic features when generating feature vector. Third, we propose a method to transform string feature values into numeric feature values, combining multiple statistical models. The combined model maps one string value to one numeric value by containing the multiple characteristic of each string value. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposals in practical environments, we implement the SQUA detection system based on PostgreSQL, a popular open source database system, and we perform experiments. The experimental results using the internal query trees of PostgreSQL validate that our proposal is effective in detecting SQLIAs, with at least 99.6% of the probability that the probability for malicious queries to be correctly predicted as SQLIA is greater than the probability for normal queries to be incorrectly predicted as SQUA. Finally, we perform additional experiments to compare our proposal with syntax-focused feature extraction and single statistical model based on feature transformation. The experimental results show that our proposal significantly increases the probability of correctly detecting SQLIAs for various SQL statements, when compared to the previous methods.

Our method is composed of an online procedure used to efficiently map text into a low-dimensional feature space and a partition of this space into a set of regions for which the system extracts and keeps statistics used to predict multi-label text annotations. Documents are fed into the system as a sequence of words, mapped to a region of the partition, and annotated using the statistics computed from the labeled instances colliding in the same region. This approach is referred to as clashing. We illustrate the method in real-world text data, comparing the results with those obtained using other text classifiers. In addition, we provide an analysis about the effect of the representation space dimensionality on the predictive performance of the system. Our results show that the online embedding indeed approximates the geometry of the full corpus-wise TF and TF-IDF space. The model obtains competitive F measures with respect to the most accurate methods, using significantly fewer computational resources. In addition, the method achieves a higher macro-averaged F measure than methods with similar running time. Furthermore, the system is able to learn faster than the other methods from partially labeled streams. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Peters, G				Peters, Georg			Rough clustering utilizing the principle of indifference	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough k-means; Laplace's principle of indifference; Overlapping clusters	C-MEANS ALGORITHM; K-MEANS; IRIS DATA; FUZZY; SETS	Clustering is one of the most widely used method in data mining with applications in virtually any domain. Its main objective is to group similar objects into the same cluster, while dissimilar objects should belong to different clusters. In particular k-means clustering, as member of the partitioning clustering family, has obtained great popularity. The classic (hard) k-means assigns an object unambiguously to one and only one cluster. To address uncertainty soft clustering has been introduced using concepts like fuzziness, possibility or roughness. A decade ago Lingras and West introduced a k-means approach based on the interval interpretation of rough sets theory. In the past years their rough k-means has gained increasing attention. In our paper, we propose a refined rough k-means algorithm that utilizes Laplace's principle of indifference to calculate the means. As we will discuss this provides a sounder justification for the impacts of the objects in the approximations in comparison to established rough k-means algorithms. Furthermore, the weighting in the mean function is based on individual objects rather than on aggregated sub-means. In experiments, we compare the refined algorithm to related approaches.

J	Son, LH				Le Hoang Son			Enhancing clustering quality of geo-demographic analysis using context fuzzy clustering type-2 and particle swarm optimization	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Context clustering; Fuzzy clustering type-2; Geo-demographic analysis; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization	C-MEANS; ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; MORTALITY; ENGLAND	Geo-Demographic Analysis, which is one of the most interesting inter-disciplinary research topics between Geographic Information Systems and Data Mining, plays a very important role in policies decision, population migration and services distribution. Among some soft computing methods used for this problem, clustering is the most popular one because it has many advantages in comparison with the rests such as the fast processing time, the quality of results and the used memory space. Nonetheless, the state-of-the-art clustering algorithm namely FGWC has low clustering quality since it was constructed on the basis of traditional fuzzy sets. In this paper, we will present a novel interval type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm deployed in an extension of the traditional fuzzy sets namely Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets to enhance the clustering quality of FGWC. Some additional techniques such as the interval context variable, Particle Swarm Optimization and the parallel computing are attached to speed up the algorithm. The experimental evaluation through various case studies shows that the proposed method obtains better clustering quality than some best-known ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis based on grouped results indicated several significant differences between dietary and non-dietary participants across various core and peripheral areas of functioning. Results also indicated some disparity in individual responses to dietary modification potentially indicative of responder and non-responder differences. Further examination of the behavioural and psychometric data garnered from participants was undertaken, with a view to determining potential factors pertinent to response to dietary intervention. Participants with clinically significant scores indicative of inattention and hyperactivity behaviours and who had a significant positive changes to said scores were defined as responders to the dietary intervention. Analyses indicated several factors to be potentially pertinent to a positive response to dietary intervention in terms of symptom presentation. Chronological age was found to be the strongest predictor of response, where those participants aged between 7 and 9 years seemed to derive most benefit from dietary intervention. Further analysis based on the criteria for original study inclusion on the presence of the urine compound, trans-indolyl-3-acryloylglycine may also merit further investigation. These preliminary observations on potential best responder characteristics to a gluten-and casein-free diet for children with autism require independent replication.

Cutting Decision Tree (CDT) induction is an efficient mathematical programming based method that tries to discretize the data set on hand by using multiple separating hyperplanes. A new improvement to CDT model is proposed in this study by incorporating the second goal of maximizing the distance of the correctly classified instances to the misclassification region. Computational results show that developed model achieves better classification accuracy for Wisconsin Breast Cancer database and Japanese Banks data set when compared to existing piecewise-linear models in literature. Furthermore, remarkable results are obtained for the well-known benchmarking data sets (Buba Liver Disorders, Blood Tranfusion and Pima Indian Diabetes) when compared to the original CDT model.

J	Galbrun, E; Kimmig, A				Galbrun, Esther; Kimmig, Angelika			Finding relational redescriptions	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Redescription mining; Relational query mining; Inductive Logic Programming; Graph mining; Relational data mining	DISCOVERY; WEB	We introduce relational redescription mining, that is, the task of finding two structurally different patterns that describe nearly the same set of object pairs in a relational dataset. By extending redescription mining beyond propositional and real-valued attributes, it provides a powerful tool to match different relational descriptions of the same concept. We propose an alternating scheme for solving this problem. Its core consists of a novel relational query miner that efficiently identifies discriminative connection patterns between pairs of objects. Compared to a baseline Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approach, our query miner is able to mine more complex queries, much faster. We performed extensive experiments on three real world relational datasets, and present examples of redescriptions found, exhibiting the power of the method to expressively capture relations present in these networks.

Evaluation and optimization of frequent, closed and maximal association rule based classification	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Rule optimization; Interestingness measures; Statistical analysis	INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES; DISCOVERY; PATTERN; SETS	Real world applications of association rule mining have well-known problems of discovering a large number of rules, many of which are not interesting or useful for the application at hand. The algorithms for closed and maximal itemsets mining significantly reduce the volume of rules discovered and complexity associated with the task, but the implications of their use and important differences with respect to the generalization power, precision and recall when used in the classification problem have not been examined. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of the association rules discovered from frequent, closed and maximal itemset mining algorithms, combining common data mining and statistical interestingness measures, and outline an appropriate sequence of usage. The experiments are performed using a number of real-world datasets that represent diverse characteristics of data/items, and detailed evaluation of rule sets is provided as a whole and w.r.t individual classes. Empirical results confirm that with a proper combination of data mining and statistical analysis, a large number of non-significant, redundant and contradictive rules can be eliminated while preserving relatively high precision and recall. More importantly, the results reveal the important characteristics and differences between using frequent, closed and maximal itemsets for the classification task, and the effect of incorporating statistical/heuristic measures for optimizing such rule sets. With closed itemset mining already being a preferred choice for complexity and redundancy reduction during rule generation, this study has further confirmed that overall closed itemset based association rules are also of better quality in terms of classification precision and recall, and precision and recall on individual class examples. On the other hand maximal itemset based association rules, that are a subset of closed itemset based rules, show to be insufficient in this regard, and typically will have worse recall and generalization power. Empirical results also show the downfall of using the confidence measure at the start to generate association rules, as typically done within the association rule framework. Removing rules that occur below a certain confidence threshold, will also remove the knowledge of existence of any contradictions in the data to the relatively higher confidence rules, and thus precision can be increased by disregarding contradictive rules prior to application of confidence constraint.

We parameterized these three models with identical data from different regions of the world; one region undergoing extensive agricultural expansion (East Africa), another region where forests are re-growing (Muskegon River Watershed in the United States), and a third region where urbanization is prominent (South-Eastern Wisconsin in the United States). Independent training data and testing data were used to train and calibrate each model, respectively. Comparisons of simulated maps from the three kinds of land use change patterns were made using conventional goodness-of-fit metrics in land use change science. The results of temporal and spatial comparison of the data mining models show that the artificial neural network outperformed all other models in a short-time interval (East Africa; 5 years) and for coarse resolution data (East Africa; 1 km); however, the three data mining models obtained similar accuracies in a long-time interval (Muskegon River Watershed; 20 years) and for fine resolution data with large numbers of cells (Muskegon River Watershed; 30 m). Furthermore, the results showed that the probability of agriculture gain was more likely in locations closer to towns and large cities in East Africa, urbanization was more likely in locations closer to roads and urban areas in South-Eastern Wisconsin and the probability of forest gain was more likely in locations closer to the forest and shrub land cover and farther away from roads in Muskegon River Watershed.

These questions were used to determine the current state of the art in this particular strand of TM and suggest future directions in TM development to support cancer research. Methods: A review of the research on TM of cancer-related information was carried out. A literature search was conducted on the Medline database as well as IEEE Xplore and ACM digital libraries to address the interdisciplinary nature of such research. The search results were supplemented with the literature identified through Google Scholar. Results: A range of studies have proven the feasibility of TM for extracting structured information from clinical narratives such as those found in pathology or radiology reports. In this article, we provide a critical overview of the current state of the art for TM related to cancer. The review highlighted a strong bias towards symbolic methods, e.g. named entity recognition (NER) based on dictionary lookup and information extraction (IE) relying on pattern matching. The F-measure of NER ranges between 80% and 90%, while that of IE for simple tasks is in the high 90s. To further improve the performance, TM approaches need to deal effectively with idiosyncrasies of the clinical sublanguage such as non-standard abbreviations as well as a high degree of spelling and grammatical errors. This requires a shift from rule-based methods to machine learning following the success of similar trends in biological applications of TM. Machine learning approaches require large training datasets, but clinical narratives are not readily available for TM research due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. This issue remains the main bottleneck for progress in this area. In addition, there is a need for a comprehensive cancer ontology that would enable semantic representation of textual information found in narrative reports. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Associative classification has aroused significant research interest in recent years due to its superior accuracy. Traditional association rule mining algorithms often yield many redundant and sometimes conflicting class association rules. This paper presents a new, efficient associative classification approach. This new approach produces a compact classifier with a small number of association rules, yet with good classification performance. This approach is based on a novel rule quality metric, named as Principality, which measures an association rule's classification accuracy and coverage for a specific class. Heuristic methods utilizing the Principality metric are applied to rule pruning and associative classifier construction to produce a compact classifier. This Principal Association Mining (PAM) approach is confirmed to be effective at improving classification accuracy as well as decreasing classifier size by experiments conducted on 17 datasets.

However, very little research has considered a multi-granulation perspective. In this paper, we present a new feature selection method that selects distinguishing features by fusing neighborhood multi-granulation. We first use neighborhood rough sets as an effective granular computing tool, and analyze the influence of the granularity of neighborhood information. Then, we obtain all feature rank lists based on the significance of features in different granularities. Finally, we obtain a new feature selection algorithm by fusing all individual feature rank lists. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively select a discriminative feature subset, and performs as well as or better than other popular feature selection algorithms in terms of classification performance.

Instance selection as part of this data reduction task is one of the most relevant problems in current data mining research. Over the past decades, many different instance selection algorithms have been proposed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, as in the case of classification, it is unlikely that a single instance selection algorithm would be able to achieve good results across many different datasets and application fields. In classification, one of the most successful ways of consistently improving the performance of a single learner is the construction of ensembles using boosting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for instance selection based on boosting instance selection algorithms in the same way boosting is applied to classification. The proposed approach opens a new field of research in which to apply the many techniques developed for boosting classifiers, for instance selection and other data reduction techniques such as feature selection and simultaneous instance and feature selection. Using 60 datasets for balanced problems and 45 datasets for class-imbalanced problems, the experiments reported show a clear improvement in several state-of-the-art instance selection algorithms using the proposed methodology.

While many algorithms for clustering categorical data have been proposed, some have low clustering accuracy while others have high computational complexity. This research proposes mean gain ratio (MGR), a new information theory based hierarchical divisive clustering algorithm for categorical data. MGR implements clustering from the attributes viewpoint which includes selecting a clustering attribute using mean gain ratio and selecting an equivalence class on the clustering attribute using entropy of clusters. It can be run with or without specifying the number of clusters while few existing clustering algorithms for categorical data can be run without specifying the number of clusters. Experimental results on nine University of California at Irvine (UCI) benchmark and ten synthetic data sets show that MGR performs better as compared to baseline algorithms in terms of its performance and efficiency of clustering.

The sensory signals of material handling systems are nonlinear and have unique characteristics. It is very difficult to encode and classify these signals by using multipurpose methods. In this study, performances of multiple generic methods were studied for the diagnostic of the pneumatic systems of the material handling systems. Diffusion Map (DM), Local Linear Embedding (LLE) and AutoEncoder (AE) algorithms were used for future extraction. Encoded signals were classified by using the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) and k-medoids algorithms. The accuracy of the estimations was better than 90% when the LLE was used with GK algorithm.

Hence, providing advance failure warning and precise fault detection in such components are pivotal and cost-effective. The vast majority of past research has focused on signal processing and spectral analysis for fault diagnostics in rotating components. In this study, a data mining approach using a machine learning technique called anomaly detection (AD) is presented. This method employs classification techniques to discriminate between defect examples. Two features, kurtosis and Non-Gaussianity Score (NGS), are extracted to develop anomaly detection algorithms. The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing. Finally, the application of anomaly detection is compared with one of the popular methods called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of this approach and its ability to detect the anomalies in early stages.

We previously identified a Src-Tks5-Nck pathway which promotes invadopodium formation and ECM proteolysis in melanoma and breast cancer cells. We therefore sought to investigate the significance of Tks5 expression in human cancers. This was undertaken retrospectively through an immunohistochemical evaluation in tissue microarray cores and through data mining of the public database, Oncomine. Here we showed that Tks5 was expressed at higher levels in the microarray cores of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer tissues compared to the levels in normal tissues. Importantly, mining of Oncomine datasets revealed a strong correlation between Tks5 mRNA overexpression in a number of cancers with increased metastatic events and a poorer prognosis. Collectively, these findings suggest a clinical association of Tks5 expression in human cancers. It identifies the importance for further investigations in examining the full potential of Tks5 as a relevant prognostic marker in a select number of cancers which may have implications for future targeted therapies.

As opposed to its ancestors, our technique has the flexibility of generating a list of IF-THEN rules with unrestricted order. It makes the generated classification model more comprehensible and easily interpretable. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is statistically significantly better as compared with previous versions of AntMiner based on predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of the classification model.

MARS uses piecewise linear functions for local fit and apply an adaptive procedure to select the number and location of breaking points (called knots). The function estimation is basically generated via a two-stepwise procedure: forward selection and backward elimination. In the first step, a large number of local fits is obtained by selecting large number of knots via a lack-of-fit criteria; and in the latter one, the least contributing local fits or knots are removed. In conventional adaptive spline procedure, knots are selected from a set of all distinct data points that makes the forward selection procedure computationally expensive and leads to high local variance. To avoid this drawback, it is possible to restrict the knot points to a subset of data points. In this context, a new method is proposed for knot selection which bases on a mapping approach like self organizing maps. By this method, less but more representative data points are become eligible to be used as knots for function estimation in forward step of MARS. The proposed method is applied to many simulated and real datasets, and the results show that it proposes a time efficient forward step for the knot selection and model estimation without degrading the model accuracy and prediction performance.

Compared to well-known others, it performs better in many areas such as finance, informatics, technology and science. Many studies have been conducted on improving its performance. For this purpose, an alternative backward stepwise algorithm is proposed through Conic-MARS (CMARS) method which uses a penalized residual sum of squares for MARS as a Tikhonov regularization problem. Additionally, by modifying the forward step of MARS via mapping approach, a time efficient procedure has been introduced by S-FMARS. Inspiring from the advantages of MARS, CMARS and S-FMARS, two hybrid methods are proposed in this study, aiming to produce time efficient DM tools without degrading their performances especially for large datasets. The resulting methods, called SMARS and SCMARS, are tested in terms of several performance criteria such as accuracy, complexity, stability and robustness via simulated and real life datasets. As a DM application, the hybrid methods are also applied to an important field of finance for predicting interest rates offered by a Turkish bank to its customers. The results show that the proposed hybrid methods, being the most time efficient with competing performances, can be considered as powerful choices particularly for large datasets.

However, many MKL algorithms suffer from high computational cost. Moreover, standard MKL algorithms face the challenge of the rapid development of distributed computational environment such as cloud computing. In this study, a framework for parallel multiple kernel learning (PMKL) using hybrid alternating direction method of multipliers (H-ADMM) is developed to integrate the MKL algorithms and the multiprocessor system. The global problem with multiple kernel is divided into multiple local problems each of which is optimized in a local processor with a single kernel. An H-ADMM is proposed to make the local processors coordinate with each other to achieve the global optimal solution. The results of computational experiments show that PMKL exhibits high classification accuracy and fast computational speed.

They all share the ability to change microtubule properties. The profound effects of disrupted microtubule systems on cell physiology can be used in research as well as anticancer treatment and agricultural weed control. The activity of microtubule drugs generally depends on their binding to alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits. The microtubule drugs are often effective only in certain taxonomic groups, while other organisms remain resistant. Available information on the molecular basis of this selectivity is summarized. In addition to reviewing published data, we performed sequence data mining, searching for kingdom-specific signatures in plant, animal, fungal, and protozoan tubulin sequences. Our findings clearly correlate with known microtubule drug resistance determinants and add more amino acid positions with a putative effect on drug-tubulin interaction.

In Senegal, it is particularly felt in the Ferlo area where a strong presence of ponds shared by humans, cattle and vectors is noted. As part of the studies carried out on the environmental factors which favour its start and propagation, the focus of this paper is put on the decision making process to evaluate the impacts, the interactions and to make RVF monitoring easier. The present paper proposes a model based on data mining techniques and dedicated to trade experts. This model integrates all the involved data and the results of the analyses made on the characteristics of the surrounding ponds. This approach presents some advantage in revealing the relationship between environmental factors and RVF transmission vectors for space-time epidemiology monitoring purpose.

Different from traditional sequential pattern mining, this kind of mining considers different significances of items in real applications, such as cost or profit. Most of the related studies adopt the maximum weighted upper-bound model to find weighted sequential patterns, but they generate a large number of unpromising candidate subsequences. In this study, we thus propose an efficient approach for finding weighted sequential patterns from sequence databases. In particular, a tightening strategy in the proposed approach is proposed to obtain more accurate weighted upper-bounds for subsequences in mining. Through the experimental evaluation, the results also show the proposed approach has good performance in terms of pruning effectiveness and execution efficiency.

These days, diverse and far-reaching information is being rapidly produced and distributed instantly in digitized format. Studies are continuously seeking to develop more efficient methods of delivering information to a greater number of users. Image filtering, which extracts features of interest from images, was developed to address the weakness of collaborative filtering, which is limited to superficial data analysis. However, image filtering has its own weakness of requiring complicated calculations to obtain the similarity between images. In this study, to resolve these problems, we propose associative image filtering based on the mining method utilizing the harmonic mean. Using data mining's Apriori algorithm, this study investigated the association among preferred images from an associative image group and obtained a prediction based on user preference mean. In so doing, we observed a positive relationship between the various image preferences and the various distances between images' color histograms. Preference mean was calculated based on the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean. We found through performance analysis that the harmonic mean had the highest accuracy. In associative image filtering, we used the harmonic mean in order to anticipate preferences. In testing accuracy with MAE utilizing the proposed method, this study demonstrated an improvement of approximately 12 % on average compared to previous collaborative image filtering.

The proposed model uses a mining technique validated by medical experts to provide recommendations. FbACHD_PSM consists of three parts for heart disease risk prediction. First, a fuzzy membership function is constructed using medical guidelines and statistical methods. Then, a decision-tree rule induction technique creates mining-based rules that are subjected to validation by medical experts. As the rules may not be medically suitable, the experts add rules that have been verified and delete inappropriate rules. Thirdly, using fuzzy inference based on Mamdani's method, the model predicts the risk of heart disease. Based on this, final recommendations are provided to patients regarding normal living, nutrition control, exercise, and drugs. To implement our proposed model and evaluate its performance, we use a dataset from a single tertiary hospital.

Yet, data publishing and mining do not come without dangers, namely privacy invasion and also potential discrimination of the individuals whose data are published. Discrimination may ensue from training data mining models (e.g. classifiers) on data which are biased against certain protected groups (ethnicity, gender, political preferences, etc.). The objective of this paper is to describe how to obtain data sets for publication that are: (i) privacy-preserving; (ii) unbiased regarding discrimination; and (iii) as useful as possible for learning models and finding patterns. We present the first generalization-based approach to simultaneously offer privacy preservation and discrimination prevention. We formally define the problem, give an optimal algorithm to tackle it and evaluate the algorithm in terms of both general and specific data analysis metrics (i.e. various types of classifiers and rule induction algorithms). It turns out that the impact of our transformation on the quality of data is the same or only slightly higher than the impact of achieving just privacy preservation. In addition, we show how to extend our approach to different privacy models and anti-discrimination legal concepts.

J	Appice, A; Malerba, D				Appice, Annalisa; Malerba, Donato			Leveraging the power of local spatial autocorrelation in geophysical interpolative clustering	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Spatial autocorrelation; Clustering; Inverse distance weighting; Geophysical data stream	DATA STREAMS; ASSOCIATION; REGRESSION	Nowadays ubiquitous sensor stations are deployed worldwide, in order to measure several geophysical variables (e.g. temperature, humidity, light) for a growing number of ecological and industrial processes. Although these variables are, in general, measured over large zones and long (potentially unbounded) periods of time, stations cannot cover any space location. On the other hand, due to their huge volume, data produced cannot be entirely recorded for future analysis. In this scenario, summarization, i.e. the computation of aggregates of data, can be used to reduce the amount of produced data stored on the disk, while interpolation, i.e. the estimation of unknown data in each location of interest, can be used to supplement station records. We illustrate a novel data mining solution, named interpolative clustering, that has the merit of addressing both these tasks in time-evolving, multivariate geophysical applications. It yields a time-evolving clustering model, in order to summarize geophysical data and computes a weighted linear combination of cluster prototypes, in order to predict data. Clustering is done by accounting for the local presence of the spatial autocorrelation property in the geophysical data. Weights of the linear combination are defined, in order to reflect the inverse distance of the unseen data to each cluster geometry. The cluster geometry is represented through shape-dependent sampling of geographic coordinates of clustered stations. Experiments performed with several data collections investigate the trade-off between the summarization capability and predictive accuracy of the presented interpolative clustering algorithm.

Crowdsourcing allows us to outsource tasks to a number of workers. The results of tasks obtained in crowdsourcing are often low-quality due to the difference in the degree of skill. Therefore, we need quality control methods to estimate reliable results from low-quality results. In this paper, we point out privacy problems of workers in crowdsourcing. Personal information of workers can be inferred from the results provided by each worker. To formulate and to address the privacy problems, we define a worker-private quality control problem, a variation of the quality control problem that preserves privacy of workers. We propose a worker-private latent class protocol where a requester can estimate the true results with worker privacy preserved. The key ideas are decentralization of computation and introduction of secure computation. We theoretically guarantee the security of the proposed protocol and experimentally examine the computational efficiency and accuracy.

It is an important and general pre-processing technique, and a critical element of many data mining and data management tasks. The general goal is to obtain data that retains as much information in the continuous original as possible. In general, but in particular for exploratory tasks, a key open question is how to discretize multivariate data such that significant associations and patterns are preserved. That is exactly the problem we study in this paper. We propose IPD, an information-theoretic method for unsupervised discretization that focuses on preserving multivariate interactions. To this end, when discretizing a dimension, we consider the distribution of the data over all other dimensions. In particular, our method examines consecutive multivariate regions and combines them if (a) their multivariate data distributions are statistically similar, and (b) this merge reduces the MDL encoding cost. To assess the similarities, we propose , a novel interaction distance that does not require assuming a distribution and permits computation in closed form. We give an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal bin merge, as well as a fast well-performing heuristic. Empirical evaluation through pattern-based compression, outlier mining, and classification shows that by preserving interactions we consistently outperform the state of the art in both quality and speed.

This paper proposes a new representation of time series, which in contrast to existing approaches, decomposes a time-series dataset into latent patterns and membership weights of local segments to those patterns. The process is formalized as a constrained objective function and a tailored stochastic coordinate descent optimization is applied. The time-series are projected to a new feature representation consisting of the sums of the membership weights, which captures frequencies of local patterns. Features from various sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the interaction of patterns from different sizes. The derived representation offers a set of features that boosts classification accuracy. Finally, a large-scale experimental comparison against 11 baselines over 43 real life datasets, indicates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy results.

We summarize the results from six contributions to our Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 working group; these investigators applied MLMs and data mining to analyses of rare and common genetic variants measured in pedigrees. To develop risk profiles, group members analyzed blood pressure traits along with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and rare variant genotypes derived from sequence and imputation analyses in large Mexican American pedigrees. Supervised MLMs included penalized regression with varying penalties, support vector machines, and permanental classification. Unsupervised MLMs included sparse principal components analysis and sparse graphical models. Entropy-based components analyses were also used to mine these data. None of the investigators fully capitalized on the genetic information provided by the complete pedigrees. Their approaches either corrected for the nonindependence of the individuals within the pedigrees or analyzed only those who were independent. Some methods allowed for covariate adjustment, whereas others did not. We evaluated these methods using a variety of metrics. Four contributors conducted primary analyses on the real data, and the other two research groups used the simulated data with and without knowledge of the underlying simulation model. One group used the answers to the simulated data to assess power and type I errors. Although the MLMs applied were substantially different, each research group concluded that MLMs have advantages over standard statistical approaches with these high-dimensional data.

Ray			Evolutionary Dynamics of Information Diffusion Over Social Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Evolutionary game; game theory; information diffusion; information spreading; social networks	GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH; VIEW	Current social networks are of extremely large-scale generating tremendous information flows at every moment. How information diffuses over social networks has attracted much attention from both industry and academics. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdos-Renyi random network and the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large. To verify our theoretical analysis, we perform simulations for the information diffusion over synthetic networks and real-world Facebook networks. Moreover, we also conduct an experiment on a Twitter hashtags dataset, which shows that the proposed game theoretic model can well fit and predict the information diffusion over real social networks.

This paper presents a log-based usability evaluation system to analyze user behavior in a gaming environment. We explore the potential of input log data for automated usability evaluation and visualization of player behavior in a game. We traced the keyboard input value and mouse movement of users using a sequence data mining technique in a gaming environment. And we also constructed 3D body meshes for the behavior analysis using Kinect interface. We visualized the data obtained by tracing and automatically searched repetitive patterns in the game and analyzed them. The result obtained from the analysis can be used for user interface optimization, fun evaluation, and the bot-detection field.

Learning from the imbalance data is a remarkable challenge in the knowledge discovery and data mining field. In this paper, we propose a scaling kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach to deal with the multi-class imbalanced data classification problem. We first use standard SVM algorithm to gain an approximate hyperplane. Then, we present a scaling kernel function and calculate its parameters using the chi-square test and weighting factors. Experimental results on KEEL data sets show the proposed algorithm can resolve the classifier performance degradation problem due to data skewed distribution and has a good generalization.

Knowledge discovery and Leaf Spot dynamics of groundnut crop through wireless sensor network and data mining techniques	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Wireless sensor network; Precision farming; Pest/disease management at micro-scale level	WETNESS DURATION; TEMPERATURE; INFECTION; INDIA	Data driven precision agriculture aspects, particularly the dynamic disease management, require dynamic crop-weather-environment data at micro level. An experiment was conducted during four consecutive seasons (2009 Kharif, 2009-10 Rabi, 2010 Kharif and 2010-11 Rabi) in a semi-arid tropic region of India to understand the crop-weather-environment-disease relations using wireless sensory and field-level surveillance data on the groundnut crop for Leaf Spot (LS) disease, which is economically important yet more prone in the semi-arid tropic. Tailor-made various data mining techniques (Naive Bayes classification with Gaussian distribution, rapid association rule mining and multivariate regression mining) were developed and applied to turn the data into useful information/knowledge/relations/trends and correlation to understand crop-weather-environment-disease continuum. These dynamics obtained from the data mining techniques and trained through proposed multivariate regression (MVR) mathematical models were validated with ground level surveillance data as well as ARI model (derived from ongoing long term weather-based experiment with diversely pooled data experimented from 10 seasons in semi-arid and arid zones). It was found that LS disease infection is strongly influenced by minimum temperature (18-20 degrees C), prolonged duration of leaf wetness (7-10 h), high humidity (75% or more) and age of the crop. These findings have been used for development of prediction models (One week and cumulative predictions), which can assist the user community to take respective ameliorative measures and it has been found that cumulative prediction model has performed better than ARI model with respect to ground level observations in all 16 diverse dates of sowing experiments spanning for two model-years.

We have applied that algorithm to a number of pharmaceutically important compounds from the European Pharmacopoeia for which multiple crystal forms have not been reported. The survey suggested the possibility of polymorphism in at least two compounds, bufexamac and meglumine. The statistical analysis and the subsequent experimental search for polymorphism are reported here. While polymorphism was detected and characterized in both cases, the structural results were not necessarily compatible with the basis for the measure of the "risk of polymorphism".

Spatial Assessment of Soil Organic Carbon Density Through Random Forests Based Imputation	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Soil carbon; Random forests; Spatial imputation; SOC density	INDIAN SOILS; STOCK; SEQUESTRATION; WORLD; WALKLEY; POOLS; AREAS; GHATS	Regional estimates of soil carbon pool have been made using various approaches that combine soil maps with sample databases. The point soil organic carbon (SOC) densities are spatialized employing approaches like regression, spatial interpolation, polygon based summation, etc. The present work investigates a data mining based spatial imputation for spatial assessment of soil organic carbon density. The study area covers Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. Field sampling was done using stratified random sampling method with land cover/use, soil type, agro-ecological regions for defining strata. The spatial data at 1 km resolution on climate, NDVI, land cover, soil type, topography was used as input for modeling the top 30 cm Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) density. To model the SOC density, a Random Forest (RF) based model with optimal parameters and input variables has been adopted. Experiment results indicate that 500 number of trees with 5 variables at each split could explain the maximum variability of soil organic carbon density of the study area. Out of various input variables used to model SOC density, land use / cover was found to be the most significant factor that influences SOC density with a distinct importance score of 34.7 followed by NDVI with a score of 12.9. The predicted mean SOC densities range between 2.22 and 13.2 Kg m(-2) and the estimated pool size of SOC in top 30 cm depth is 923 Tg for Andhra Pradesh and 1,029 Tg for Karnataka. The predicted SOC densities using this model were in good agreement with the measured observations (R = 0.86).	[Sreenivas, K.; Sujatha, G.; Fyzee, M. A.; Ravisankar, T.; Dadhwal, V.

Certain single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the KLK locus have been linked to human disease. Next-generation sequencing of large human cohorts enables reexamination of genomic variation at the KLK locus. We aimed to identify all KLK-related SNVs and examine their impact on gene regulation and function. To this end, we mined KLK SNVs across Ensembl and Exome Variant Server, with exome-sequencing data from 6503 individuals. PolyPhen-2-based prediction of damaging SNVs and population frequencies of these SNVs were examined. Damaging SNVs were plotted on protein sequence and structure. We identified 4866 SNVs, the largest number of KLK-related SNVs reported. Fourteen percent of noncoding SNVs overlapped with transcription factor binding sites. We identified 602 missense coding SNVs, among which 148 were predicted to be damaging. Nine missense SNVs were common (>1% frequency) and displayed significantly different frequencies between European-American and African-American populations. SNVs predicted to be damaging appeared to alter tertiary structure of KLK1 and KLK6. Similarly, these missense SNVs may affect KLK function, resulting in disease phenotypes. Our study represents a mine of information for those studying KLK-related SNVs and their associations with diseases.

J	Fan, LY; Xiong, L				Fan, Liyue; Xiong, Li			An Adaptive Approach to Real-Time Aggregate Monitoring with Differential Privacy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Statistical databases; differential privacy; time series	DATA RELEASE; SENSITIVITY; ALGORITHMS; STATE	Sharing real-time aggregate statistics of private data is of great value to the public to perform data mining for understanding important phenomena, such as Influenza outbreaks and traffic congestion. However, releasing time-series data with standard differential privacy mechanism has limited utility due to high correlation between data values. We propose FAST, a novel framework to release real-time aggregate statistics under differential privacy based on filtering and adaptive sampling. To minimize the overall privacy cost, FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to the detected data dynamics. To improve the accuracy of data release per time stamp, FAST predicts data values at non-sampling points and corrects noisy observations at sampling points. Our experiments with real-world as well as synthetic data sets confirm that FAST improves the accuracy of released aggregates even under small privacy cost and can be used to enable a wide range of monitoring applications.

Feature selection is one main technique for dimensionality reduction that involves identifying a subset of the most useful features. In this paper, a novel unsupervised feature selection algorithm, named clustering-guided sparse structural learning (CGSSL), is proposed by integrating cluster analysis and sparse structural analysis into a joint framework and experimentally evaluated. Nonnegative spectral clustering is developed to learn more accurate cluster labels of the input samples, which guide feature selection simultaneously. Meanwhile, the cluster labels are also predicted by exploiting the hidden structure shared by different features, which can uncover feature correlations to make the results more reliable. Row-wise sparse models are leveraged to make the proposed model suitable for feature selection. To optimize the proposed formulation, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on 12 diverse benchmarks, including face data, handwritten digit data, document data, and biomedical data. The encouraging experimental results in comparison with several representative algorithms and the theoretical analysis demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for feature selection.

Mining Interaction Patterns among Brain Regions by Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Clustering; multivariate time series; interaction patterns	TIME-SERIES DATA; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; DISORDER; SEARCH; PAIN	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides the potential to study brain function in a non-invasive way. Massive in volume and complex in terms of the information content, fMRI data requires effective, and efficient data mining techniques. Recent results from neuroscience suggest a modular organization of the brain. To understand the complex interaction patterns among brain regions we propose a novel clustering technique. We model each subject as multivariate time series, where the single dimensions represent the fMRI signal at different anatomical regions. In contrast to previous approaches, we base our cluster notion on the interactions between the univariate time series within a data object. Our objective is to assign objects exhibiting a similar intrinsic interaction pattern to a common cluster. To formalize this idea, we define a cluster by a set of mathematical models describing the cluster-specific interaction patterns. Based on this novel cluster notion, we propose interaction K-means (IKM), an efficient algorithm for partitioning clustering. An extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark data demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The results on two real fMRI studies demonstrate the potential of IKM to contribute to a better understanding of normal brain function and the alternations characteristic for psychiatric disorders.

J	Meng, L; Tan, AH; Xu, D				Meng, Lei; Tan, Ah-Hwee; Xu, Dong			Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Fusion for Multimedia Data Co-Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; heterogeneous data co-clustering; multimedia data mining	IMAGE-TEXT ASSOCIATIONS; INTELLIGENCE	Co-clustering is a commonly used technique for tapping the rich meta-information of multimedia web documents, including category, annotation, and description, for associative discovery. However, most co-clustering methods proposed for heterogeneous data do not consider the representation problem of short and noisy text and their performance is limited by the empirical weighting of the multi-modal features. In this paper, we propose a generalized form of Heterogeneous Fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory, called GHF-ART, for co-clustering of large-scale web multimedia documents. By extending the two-channel Heterogeneous Fusion ART (HF-ART) to multiple channels, GHF-ART is designed to handle multimedia data with an arbitrarily rich level of meta-information. For handling short and noisy text, GHF-ART does not learn directly from the textual features. Instead, it identifies key tags by learning the probabilistic distribution of tag occurrences. More importantly, GHF-ART incorporates an adaptive method for effective fusion of multi-modal features, which weights the features of multiple data sources by incrementally measuring the importance of feature modalities through the intra-cluster scatters. Extensive experiments on two web image data sets and one text document set have shown that GHF-ART achieves significantly better clustering performance and is much faster than many existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

We implemented our proposed biometric sample extraction technique to test the usability across classifiers. Subjects in MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NSRDB) were used to validate the reliability and stability of the subject recognition methods. Discriminatory features extracted from the experimentations were later applied to different classifiers for performance measures based on the complexity of our proposed sample extraction method when compared to other related algorithms, the total execution time (TET) applied on different classifiers in various mobile devices and the classification accuracies when applied to various classification techniques. Experimentation results showed that our method simplifies biometric identification process by obtaining reduced computational complexity when compared to other related algorithms. This is evident when TET values were significantly low on mobile devices as compared to a non-mobile device while maintaining high accuracy rates ranging from 98.30% to 99.07% in different classifiers. Therefore, these outcomes support the usability of ECG based biometric identification in a mobile environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A meta-analysis of soil organic matter response to soil management practices: An approach to evaluate conservation indicators	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation Measurement Tool; cropping systems; soil management practices; soil organic carbon	CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; VALUATION; ILLINOIS; SERVICES; QUALITY; IMPACTS	Increased understanding of the influences of management practices on soil properties and associated ecosystem function is needed to improve tools used to administer conservation programs in the United States. This study used meta-analysis to assess the influence of cropping systems (conventional, conservation with minimum tillage, conservation with no-till, and organic systems) and management practices (nitrogen [N] fertility and rotation length) on soil organic carbon (SOC). These factors are considered by tools that evaluate conservation performance and provision of ecosystem services. We also reviewed the literature to determine whether this approach could be applied to other proxy variables (erosion rates, soil erodibility factor [K values], available phosphorus [P], and nitrous oxide [N2O]). Data mining was used to populate a database with variables representing practices used by the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Conservation Measurement Tool (CMT) to determine eligibility for the Conservation Stewardship Program. Data collected from 55 peer-reviewed studies was categorized based on sampling depth (0 to 10, 0 to 15, 0 to 20, and 0 to 30 cm [0 to 3.9, 0 to 5.9, 0 to 7.8, and 0 to 11.8 in]). The magnitude of the effect estimated by meta-analysis was then compared to scores assigned to practices in the soil quality module of the CMT. Meta-analysis of data from the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 7.8 in) depth suggested that rates of SOC accrual were similar in organic systems using diversified crop rotations and conservation systems using inorganic fertility sources, increasing SOC by 9% compared to the conventional control. In comparisons at the 0 to 30 cm (0 to 11.8 in) depth, results from conservation systems using no-till and organic systems diverged, with conservation systems relying on no-till producing no gains while organic systems produced a 29% increase in SOC. While the use of organic amendments generally increased SOC, the magnitude of the effect was more modest than suggested by current CMT weighting. In addition, our results suggested that quality of manure, which is not differentiated in the CMT, influences the magnitude of the effect and that addition of wet manure may decrease SOC. A comparison of rotation length showed cropping systems with rotations of 3 years or longer were better able to increase SOC than shorter rotations. These findings suggested that the CMT generally ranks practices appropriately and shows how meta-analysis could be used to adjust credits awarded for use of reduced or no-till practices or different fertility sources.

Statistical Contrast Analysis of Hydrochemical Parameters Upstream of the Tidal Influence in Two AMD-Affected Rivers	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Iberian Pyrite Belt; Metals; Pollution; Odiel River; Tinto River	ACID-MINE DRAINAGE; IBERIAN PYRITE BELT; DATA-MINING TECHNIQUES; HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION; TINTO-ODIEL ESTUARY; SOUTH-WEST SPAIN; SW SPAIN; SOUTHWESTERN SPAIN; HUELVA-SPAIN; FUZZY-LOGIC	The Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), SW Spain, has been exploited since ancient times, and previous studies have compared different parameters in the Tinto and Odiel Rivers, the principal rivers that cross the IPB. We used classical statistics to draw contrasts between the two rivers. Samples were collected at two sites, one in the Tinto River, and the other in the Odiel, immediately upstream of tidal influence. Both rivers are strongly contaminated by acid mine drainage (AMD). However, the results suggest a distinctive, although somewhat parallel, geochemical behavior. The pattern of affinity between parameters differs because in addition to AMD, the Odiel River receives important contributions from non-contaminated catchments, while the Tinto River is the main receptor of drainage from the Rio Tinto mine. The applied statistical approach revealed that pH and electrical conductivity present a similar temporal evolution, which point to an identical geochemical signature; this indicates that both systems are similarly affected by contamination from the same pyritic area.

This emphasizes the use of a wide arsenal of methods for processing and analyzing patient satisfaction surveys. Objective: The purpose of this study was to introduce the self-organizingmap (SOM) to nursing science and to illustrate the use of the SOM with patient satisfaction data. The SOM is a widely used artificial neural network suitable for clustering and exploring all kind of data sets. Methods: The study was partly a secondary analysis of data collected for the Attractive and Safe Hospital Study from four Finnish hospitals in 2008 and 2010 using the Revised Humane Caring Scale. The sample consisted of 5,283 adult patients. The SOM was used to cluster the data set according to (a) respondents and (b) questionnaire items. The SOM was also used as a preprocessor for multinomial logistic regression. An analysis of missing data was carried out to improve the data interpretation. Results: Combining results of the two SOMs and the logistic regression revealed associations between the level of satisfaction, different components of satisfaction, and item nonresponse. The common conception that the relationship between patient satisfaction and age is positive may partly be due to positive association between the tendency of item nonresponse and age. Discussion: The SOM proved to be a useful method for clustering a questionnaire data set even when the data set was low dimensional per se. Inclusion of empty responses in analyses may help to detect possible misleading noncausative relationships.

A central scientific challenge is the description and explanation of network dynamics, with a key test being the prediction of short and long term changes. For the problem of short-term link prediction, existing methods attempt to determine neighborhood metrics that correlate with the appearance of a link in the next observation period. Recent work has suggested that the incorporation of topological features and node attributes can improve link prediction. We provide an approach to predicting future links by applying the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize weights which are used in a linear combination of sixteen neighborhood and node similarity indices. We examine a large dynamic social network with over 10(6) nodes (Twitter reciprocal reply networks), both as a test of our general method and as a problem of scientific interest in itself. Our method exhibits fast convergence and high levels of precision for the top twenty predicted links. Based on our findings, we suggest possible factors which may be driving the evolution of Twitter reciprocal reply networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
