The Global Research in Paediatrics (GRiP)-Network of Excellence aims to develop pediatric-specific methods that can be applied to these data sources. A reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations is required. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a pediatric-specific reference set of positive and negative drug-event associations. Methods Considering user patterns and expert opinion, 16 drugs that are used in individuals aged 0-18 years were selected and evaluated against 16 events, regarded as important safety outcomes. A cross-table of unique drug-event pairs was created. Each pair was classified as potential positive or negative control based on information from the drug's Summary of Product Characteristics and Micromedex. If both information sources consistently listed the event as an adverse event, the combination was reviewed as potential positive control. If both did not, the combination was evaluated as potential negative control. Further evaluation was based on published literature. Results Selected drugs include ibuprofen, flucloxacillin, domperidone, methylphenidate, montelukast, quinine, and cyproterone/ethinylestradiol. Selected events include bullous eruption, aplastic anemia, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, acute kidney injury, psychosis, and seizure. Altogether, 256 unique combinations were reviewed, yielding 37 positive (17 with evidence from the pediatric population and 20 with evidence from adults only) and 90 negative control pairs, with the remainder being unclassifiable. Conclusion We propose a drug-event reference set that can be used to compare different signal detection methods in the pediatric population.

J	D'Oca, S; Hong, TZ				D'Oca, Simona; Hong, Tianzhen			Occupancy schedules learning process through a data mining framework	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Occupant behavior; Data mining; Occupancy schedule; Behavioral pattern; Office building; Building simulation	SIMULATION; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; OFFICES; MODELS	Building occupancy is a paramount factor in building energy simulations. Specifically, lighting, plug loads, HVAC equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10 min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules. The identified occupancy rules and schedules are representative as four archetypal working profiles that can be used as input to current building energy modeling programs, such as EnergyPlus or IDA-ICE, to investigate impact of occupant presence on design, operation and energy use in office buildings.

In order to reduce the updating cycle and cost, researchers have started to use user generated content (UGC) for updating road maps; however, the existing methods either rely heavily on manual labor or cannot extract enough information for road maps. In view of the above problems, this article proposes a UGC-based automatic road map inference method. In this method, data mining techniques and natural language processing tools are applied to trajectory data and geotagged data in social media to extract not only spatial information - the location of the road network - but also attribute information - road class and road name - in an effort to create a complete road map. A case study using floating car data, collected by the National Commercial Vehicle Monitoring Platform of China, and geotagged text data from Flickr and Google Maps/Earth, validates the effectiveness of this method in inferring road maps.

However, to ensure that the full potential of these techniques is realised it is important that decision makers understand there are Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDDM) processes that are mature enough to be adopted. This paper demonstrates the benefits of using a KDDM process to evaluate survey data for internet banking users in Jamaica which includes demographic as well as attitudinal and behavioral variables. The major benefits of following this process include the selection of a set of models, rather than a single model, which are more relevant to the business/research objectives and use of a more targeted knowledge discovery process as the data mining analyst is now directed to consider the effects the decisions in each phase will have on subsequent phases. This leads to more relevant knowledge being extracted from the data mining process.

Corrosion of these buried pipeline systems may cause pipeline failures with the attendant hazards of property loss and fatalities. Therefore, developing the capability to estimate the soil corrosivity is important for designing and preserving materials and for risk assessment. The deterioration rate of metal is highly influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of a material and the environment of its surroundings. In this study, the field data obtained from the southeast region of Mexico was examined using various data mining techniques to determine the usefulness of these techniques for clustering soil corrosivity level. Specifically, the soil was classified into different corrosivity level clusters by k-means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In terms of physical space, GMM shows better separability; therefore, the distributions of the material loss of the buried petroleum pipeline walls were estimated via the empirical density within GMM clusters. The soil corrosivity levels of the clusters were determined based on the medians of metal loss. The proposed clustering method was demonstrated to be capable of classifying the soil into different levels of corrosivity severity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Satellite remote sensing (RS) can offer an advancing scientific-based knowledge of the landslide problem that, directly and instantly adopt to present the disaster area. However, integrating the RS data into a decision system seems quite difficult. Therefore, this study is decided to develop unsupervised clustering techniques with an improved translation platform to extract some image knowledge on landslide occurrence. More specifically, this study used spatial information technology to attain the vegetation cover and landforms. Conditioning factors are also adopted to attain the further vegetation information. Then, two parallel spatial decision support systems are generated: (a) fuzzy c-means (FCM) is used to analyze the feature of their attributes; (b) the KPSO (k-means + Particle Swam Optimization) is used to approach a parallel study of FCM. Various levels of m values (different fuzzy degrees) are presented with regards to the accuracy of the image classification. While m = 2 the accuracy is 81 % which is lower than m = 3.6 the accuracy is 86 %. Similar results are obtained through KPSO and verifications are made. Finally, the EKTP (Expert Knowledge Translation Platform) is applied to enhance the performance of accuracy.

Many methods have been proposed to measure the similarity between time series, including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and dynamic time warping (DTW). In contrast, DTW has been suggested to allow more robust similarity measure and be able to find the optimal alignment in time series. However, due to its quadratic time and space complexity, DTW is not suitable for large time series datasets. Many improving algorithms have been proposed for DTW search in large databases, such as approximate search or exact indexed search. Unlike the previous modified algorithm, this paper presents a novel parallel scheme for fast similarity search based on DTW, which is called MRDTW (MapRedcue-based DTW). The experimental results show that our approach not only retained the original accuracy as DTW, but also greatly improved the efficiency of similarity measure in large time series.

What are incident reports telling us? A comparative study at two Australian hospitals of medication errors identified at audit, detected by staff and reported to an incident system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						medication error; incident reporting; safety; electronic prescribing; medication administration errors	PATIENT SAFETY; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY; EVENTS; INTERRUPTIONS; ATTITUDES; ADULTS	Objectives: To (i) compare medication errors identified at audit and observation with medication incident reports; (ii) identify differences between two hospitals in incident report frequency and medication error rates; (iii) identify prescribing error detection rates by staff. Design: Audit of 3291patient records at two hospitals to identify prescribing errors and evidence of their detection by staff. Medication administration errors were identified from a direct observational study of 180 nurses administering 7451 medications. Severity of errorswas classified. Those likely to lead to patient harm were categorized as 'clinically important'. Setting: Two major academic teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Main Outcome Measures: Rates of medication errors identified from audit and from direct observation were compared with reported medication incident reports. Results: A total of 12 567 prescribing errors were identified at audit. Of these 1.2/1000 errors (95% CI: 0.6-1.8) had incident reports. Clinically important prescribing errors (n = 539) were detected by staff at a rate of 218.9/1000 (95% CI: 184.0-253.8), but only 13.0/1000 (95% CI: 3.4-22.5) were reported. 78.1% (n = 421) of clinically important prescribing errors were not detected. A total of 2043 drug administrations (27.4%; 95% CI: 26.4-28.4%) contained >= 1 errors; none had an incident report. Hospital A had a higher frequency of incident reports than Hospital B, but a lower rate of errors at audit. Conclusions: Prescribing errors with the potential to cause harm frequently go undetected. Reported incidents do not reflect the profile of medication errors which occur in hospitals or the underlying rates. This demonstrates the inaccuracy of using incident frequency to compare patient risk or quality performance within or across hospitals. New approaches including data mining of electronic clinical information systems are required to support more effective medication error detection and mitigation.

Geo-located community detection in Twitter with enhanced fast-greedy optimization of modularity: the case study of typhoon Haiyan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						geo-located communities; fast-greedy optimization of modularity; Twitter; social media; spatial clustering	CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA; COMPLEX NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; CLUSTERS; INTEGRATION	As they increase in popularity, social media are regarded as important sources of information on geographical phenomena. Studies have also shown that people rely on social media to communicate during disasters and emergency situation, and that the exchanged messages can be used to get an insight into the situation. Spatial data mining techniques are one way to extract relevant information from social media. In this article, our aim is to contribute to this field by investigating how graph clustering can be applied to support the detection of geo-located communities in Twitter in disaster situations. For this purpose, we have enhanced the fast-greedy optimization of modularity (FGM) clustering algorithm with semantic similarity so that it can deal with the complex social graphs extracted from Twitter. Then, we have coupled the enhanced FGM with the varied density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise spatial clustering algorithm to obtain spatial clusters at different temporal snapshots. The method was experimented with a case study on typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and Twitter's different interaction modes were compared to create the graph of users and to detect communities. The experiments show that communities that are relevant to identify areas where disaster-related incidents were reported can be extracted, and that the enhanced algorithm outperforms the generic one in this task.

J	Sevenster, M; Bozeman, J; Cowhy, A; Trost, W				Sevenster, Merlijn; Bozeman, Jeffrey; Cowhy, Andrea; Trost, William			A natural language processing pipeline for pairing measurements uniquely across free-text CT reports	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; RECIST; Radiology report; Oncologic measurement; Information correlation	RADIOLOGY PRACTICE; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION	Objective: To standardize and objectivize treatment response assessment in oncology, guidelines have been proposed that are driven by radiological measurements, which are typically communicated in free-text reports defying automated processing. We study through inter-annotator agreement and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm development the task of pairing measurements that quantify the same finding across consecutive radiology reports, such that each measurement is paired with at most one other ("partial uniqueness"). Methods and materials: Ground truth is created based on 283 abdomen and 311 chest CT reports of 50 patients each. A pre-processing engine segments reports and extracts measurements. Thirteen features are developed based on volumetric similarity between measurements, semantic similarity between their respective narrative contexts and structural properties of their report positions. A Random Forest classifier (RF) integrates all features. A "mutual best match" (MBM) post-processor ensures partial uniqueness. Results: In an end-to-end evaluation, RF has precision 0.841, recall 0.807, F-measure 0.824 and AUC 0.971; with MBM, which performs above chance level (P < 0.001), it has precision 0.899, recall 0.776, F-measure 0.833 and AUC 0.935. RF (RF + MBM) has error-free performance on 52.7% (57.4%) of report pairs. Discussion: Inter-annotator agreement of three domain specialists with the ground truth (kappa > 0.960) indicates that the task is well defined. Domain properties and inter-section differences are discussed to explain superior performance in abdomen. Enforcing partial uniqueness has mixed but minor effects on performance. Conclusion: A combined machine learning-filtering approach is proposed for pairing measurements, which can support prospective (supporting treatment response assessment) and retrospective purposes (data mining).

The use of sequential pattern mining to predict next prescribed medications	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Sequential pattern mining; Data mining; Knowledge base; Clinical decision support; Diabetes	ASSOCIATIONS; ALGORITHM	Background: Therapy for certain medical conditions occurs in a stepwise fashion, where one medication is recommended as initial therapy and other medications follow. Sequential pattern mining is a data mining technique used to identify patterns of ordered events. Objective: To determine whether sequential pattern mining is effective for identifying temporal relationships between medications and accurately predicting the next medication likely to be prescribed for a patient. Design: We obtained claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas for patients prescribed at least one diabetes medication between 2008 and 2011, and divided these into a training set (90% of patients) and test set (10% of patients). We applied the CSPADE algorithm to mine sequential patterns of diabetes medication prescriptions both at the drug class and generic drug level and ranked them by the support statistic. We then evaluated the accuracy of predictions made for which diabetes medication a patient was likely to be prescribed next. Results: We identified 161,497 patients who had been prescribed at least one diabetes medication. We were able to mine stepwise patterns of pharmacological therapy that were consistent with guidelines. Within three attempts, we were able to predict the medication prescribed for 90.0% of patients when making predictions by drug class, and for 64.1% when making predictions at the generic drug level. These results were stable under 10-fold cross validation, ranging from 89.1%-90.5% at the drug class level and 63.5-64.9% at the generic drug level. Using 1 or 2 items in the patient's medication history led to more accurate predictions than not using any history, but using the entire history was sometimes worse. Conclusion: Sequential pattern mining is an effective technique to identify temporal relationships between medications and can be used to predict next steps in a patient's medication regimen. Accurate predictions can be made without using the patient's entire medication history. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Surveillance of the more diagnostically challenging invasive fungal diseases, specifically of the sino-pulmonary system, is not feasible for many hospitals because case finding is a costly and labour intensive exercise. We developed text classifiers for detecting such IFDs from free-text radiology (CT) reports, using machine-learning techniques. Method: We obtained free-text reports of CT scans performed over a specific hospitalisation period (2003-2011), for 264 IFD and 289 control patients from three tertiary hospitals. We analysed IFD evidence at patient, report, and sentence levels. Three infectious disease experts annotated the reports of 73 IFD-positive patients for language suggestive of IFD at sentence level, and graded the sentences as to whether they suggested or excluded the presence of IFD. Reliable agreement between annotators was obtained and this was used as training data for our classifiers. We tested a variety of Machine Learning (ML), rule based, and hybrid systems, with feature types including bags of words, bags of phrases, and bags of concepts, as well as report-level structured features. Evaluation was carried out over a robust framework with separate Development and Held-Out datasets. Results: The best systems (using Support Vector Machines) achieved very high recall at report- and patient-levels over unseen data: 95% and 100% respectively. Precision at report-level over held-out data was 71%; however, most of the associated false-positive reports (53%) belonged to patients who had a previous positive report appropriately flagged by the classifier, reducing negative impact in practice. Conclusions: Our machine learning application holds the potential for developing systematic IFD surveillance systems for hospital populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Correlated Gene Expression and Target Specificity Demonstrate Excitatory Projection Neuron Diversity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cortical cell type; in situ hybridization; projection neuron; retrograde labeling; target specificity	NEOCORTICAL GABAERGIC NEURONS; SUBTYPE-SPECIFIC GENES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BARREL CORTEX; ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES; CHEMICAL MARKERS; IN-VIVO; SUBPOPULATIONS; INTERNEURONS; RAT	The neocortex contains diverse populations of excitatory neurons segregated by layer and further definable by their specific cortical and subcortical projection targets. The current study describes a systematic approach to identify molecular correlates of specific projection neuron classes in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1), using a combination of in situ hybridization (ISH) data mining, marker gene colocalization, and combined retrograde labeling with ISH for layer-specific marker genes. First, we identified a large set of genes with specificity for each cortical layer, and that display heterogeneous patterns within those layers. Using these genes as markers, we find extensive evidence for the covariation of gene expression and projection target specificity in layer 2/3, 5, and 6, with individual genes labeling neurons projecting to specific subsets of target structures. The combination of gene expression and target specificity imply a great diversity of projection neuron classes that is similar to or greater than that of GABAergic interneurons. The covariance of these 2 phenotypic modalities suggests that these classes are both discrete and genetically specified.

However, few studies have analyzed which models are adequate for different types of fault data. In this paper, we define a FD model as an algorithm combining feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. We prepare six process data scenarios and collect data by simulating an etching tool. In total, 117 possible algorithm combinations are tested as FD models for the six datasets. With these test results, we conduct statistical analyses from two perspectives: 1) the algorithm perspective and 2) FD model perspective. From the algorithm perspective, we compare the performance of competing algorithms in the three model-building steps using multiple comparison methods and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of individual algorithms. From the model perspective, we determine which algorithm combinations are recommended for FD models of the semiconductor process and explain why some combinations do not exhibit the expected performance. In both analyses, we interpret some results using 3-D plots.

J	Zhu, TQ; Xiong, P; Li, G; Zhou, WL				Zhu, Tianqing; Xiong, Ping; Li, Gang; Zhou, Wanlei			Correlated Differential Privacy: Hiding Information in Non-IID Data Set	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Privacy preserving; differential privacy; correlated dataset; non-IID dataset		Privacy preserving on data mining and data release has attracted an increasing research interest over a number of decades. Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.

In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi- and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4-84x and 18-47x speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, running on the NVIDIA k20x GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.

For binary data, the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system, the logistic regression method, and the neural network method all feature high stability and accuracy. The Mahalanobis-Taguchi system differs from the other two methods in that models are developed through a measurement scale rather than from the learning of analytical data. We analyzed the audit quality of Taipei City Government public procurement from supply chains (hereafter abbreviated as public procurement) and applied the three feature selection methods to determine the items used in public procurement audit quality questionnaires. The results showed that the predictive powers of Mahalanobis-Taguchi system and logistic regression methods for the reduced question items were 93.8% and 92.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy rate of the neural network method was 100%, showing that the prediction model constructed using the feature selections to reduce the number of attributes can effectively lower the number of questionnaire items while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Using data for 607,948 postpaid customers of the German subsidiary of a multinational MNO, this study explores differences in contract-related, socio-demographic and service use behavior characteristics as well as in the stated primary cancellation reason between three subscriber groups: (1) customers withdrawing their termination and accepting a follow-up contract (full restoration group; n=276,488); (2) customers not revoking the cancellation of their postpaid contract, but accepting a prepaid offer of their MNO (partial restoration group; n=40,500); (3) churning customers sticking to their cancellation (loss group; n=290,960). The data reveal that compared to defecting customers, subscribers in the full restoration group were more likely (a) to try to cancel their agreement as a precautionary measure, (b) to be already in a tariff bundling mobile Internet and voice calling service provisioning, (c) to have a shorter overall length of contract relationship with their MNO and (d) to generate higher monthly revenues. Lost subscribers were much less inclined to name any reason at all for their defection notice than the two remaining groups. The share of subjects stating that a mismatch between their personal communication needs and their postpaid arrangement was the main driver to quit, was significantly higher in the partially restored group than in the rest of the sample. Overall, the characteristics of partially restored accounts were more similar to lost than to fully restored subscribers. Implications of the findings are discussed for regulators and customer restoration efforts of MNOs. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To explore, analyze, and extract useful information and knowledge from the deluge of personal data, one has to leverage these devices as the data-mining platforms in ubiquitous, pervasive, and big data environments. This study presents the personal ecosystem where all computational resources, communication facilities, storage and knowledge management systems are available in user proximity. An extensive review on recent literature has been conducted and a detailed taxonomy is presented. The performance evaluation metrics and their empirical evidences are sorted out in this paper. Finally, we have highlighted some future research directions and potentially emerging application areas for personal data mining using smartphones and wearable devices.

Metabolite identification has become critical to understanding the metabolic fate of drug candidates and to aid lead optimization with improved metabolic stability, toxicology and efficacy profiles. Ever since the introduction of atmospheric ionization techniques in the early 1990s, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has secured a central role as the predominant analytical platform for metabolite identification as LC and MS technologies continually advanced. In this review, we discuss the evolution of both MS technology and its applications over the past 50 years to meet the increasing demand of drug metabolism studies. These advances include ionization sources, mass analyzers, a wide range of MS acquisition strategies and data mining tools that have substantially accelerated the metabolite identification process and changed the overall drug metabolism landscape. Exemplary applications for characterization and identification of both small-molecule xenobiotics and biological macromolecules are described. In addition, this review discusses novel MS technologies and applications, including xenobiotic metabolomics that hold additional promise for advancing drug metabolism research, and offers thoughts on remaining challenges in studying the metabolism and disposition of drugs and other xenobiotics.

Grant applications are suitable for predicting research trends because these are research plans for the future, different from papers, which report research outcomes in the past. We investigated research trends in science focusing on research histories identified in grant application data of JSPS. Then we proposed a model for predicting research trends, assuming that breakthrough research encourages researchers to change from their current research field to an entirely new research field. Using breakthrough research, we aim to obtain higher precision in the prediction results. In our experimental results, we found that research fields in Informatics correlate well with actual scientific research trends. We also demonstrated that our prediction models are effective in actively interacting research areas, which include Informatics and Social Sciences.

J	Jeon, D; Kim, W				Jeon, Dongkyu; Kim, Wooju			Random Forest Algorithm for Linked Data Using a Parallel Processing Environment	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						linked data; random forests; parallel processing; semantic Web		In recent years, there has been a significant growth in the importance of data mining of graph-structured data due to this technology's rapid increase in both scale and application areas. Many previous studies have investigated decision tree learning on Semantic Web-based linked data to uncover implicit knowledge. In the present paper, we suggest a new random forest algorithm for linked data to overcome the underlying limitations of the decision tree algorithm, such as local optimal decisions and generalization error. Moreover, we designed a parallel processing environment for random forest learning to manage large-size linked data and increase the efficiency of multiple tree generation. For this purpose, we modified the previous candidate feature searching method of the decision tree algorithm for linked data to reduce the feature searching space of random forest learning and developed feature selection methods that are adjusted to linked data. Using a distributed index-based search engine, we designed a parallel random forest learning system for linked data to generate random forests in parallel. Our proposed system enables users to simultaneously generate multiple decision trees from distributed stored linked data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we performed experiments to compare the classification accuracy when using the single decision tree algorithm. The experimental results revealed that our random forest algorithm is more accurate than the single decision tree algorithm.

J	Taguchi, K; Finch, A; Yamamoto, S; Sumita, E				Taguchi, Keiko; Finch, Andrew; Yamamoto, Seiichi; Sumita, Eiichiro			Automatic Induction of Romanization Systems from Bilingual Corpora	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						romanization; transliteration; input method		In this article we present a novel corpus-based method for inducing romanization systems for languages through a bilingual alignment of transliteration word pairs. First, the word pairs are aligned using a non-parametric Bayesian approach, and then for each grapheme sequence to be romanized, a particular romanization is selected according to a user-specified criterion. As far as we are aware, this paper is the only one to describe a method for automatically deriving complete romanization systems. Unlike existing human-derived romanization systems, the proposed method is able to discover induced romanization systems tailored for specific purposes, for example, for use in data mining, or efficient user input methods. Our experiments study the romanization of four totally different languages: Russian, Japanese, Hindi and Myanmar. The first two languages already have standard romanization systems in regular use, Hindi has a large number of diverse systems, and Myanmar has no standard system for romanization. We compare our induced romanization system to existing systems for Russian and Japanese. We find that the systems so induced are almost identical to Russian, and 69% identical to Japanese. We applied our approach to the task of transliteration mining, and used Levenshtein distance as the romanization selection criterion. Our experiments show that our induced romanization system was able to match the performance of the human created system for Russian, and offer substantially improved mining performance for Japanese. We provide an analysis of the mechanism our approach uses to improve mining performance, and also analyse the differences in characteristics between the induced system for Japanese and the official Japanese Nihon-shiki system. In order to investigate the limits of our approach, we studied the romanization of Myanmar, a low-resource language with a large vocabulary of graphemes. We estimate the approximate corpus size required to effectively romanize the most frequency k graphemes in the language for all values of k up to 1800.

Fifty-six studies conducted between 2002 and 2012 were examined, to identify prominent themes and approaches. According to the content analysis, the new technological trends and approaches were grouped into seven categories: standardization, semantic web, modular frameworks, data mining, machine learning techniques, social web, and device adaptation. Furthermore, four challenges are suggested as explanation why adaptive systems are still not used on a large scale: inter-operability, open corpus knowledge, usage across a variety of delivery devices, and the design of meta-adaptive systems.

By handling oligonucleotide compositions in genomic sequences as high-dimensional data, we have previously modified the conventional SOM (self-organizing map) for genome informatics and established BLSOM for oligonucleotide composition, which can analyze more than ten million sequences simultaneously and is thus suitable for big data analyses. Oligonucleotides often represent motif sequences responsible for sequence-specific binding of proteins such as transcription factors. The distribution of such functionally important oligonucleotides is probably biased in genomic sequences, and may differ among genomic regions. When constructing BLSOMs to analyze pentanucleotide composition in 50-kb sequences derived from the human genome in this study, we found that BLSOMs did not classify human sequences according to chromosome but revealed several specific zones, which are enriched for a class of CG-containing pentanucleotides; these zones are composed primarily of sequences derived from pericentric regions. The biological significance of enrichment of these pentanucletides in pericentric regions is discussed in connection with cell type- and stage-dependent formation of the condensed heterochromatin in the chromocenter, which is formed through association of pericentric regions of multiple chromosomes.

However, early classification on MTS data largely remains a challenging problem. To address this problem without sacrificing the classification performance, we focus on discovering hidden knowledge from the data for early classification in an explainable way. At first, we introduce a method MCFEC (Mining Core Feature for Early Classification) to obtain distinctive and early shapelets as core features of each variable independently. Then, two methods are introduced for early classification on MTS based on core features. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets clearly show that our proposed methods can achieve effective early classification on MTS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang-Salomons, J; Salomons, G				Zhang-Salomons, Jina; Salomons, Greg			Determine the therapeutic role of radiotherapy in administrative data: a data mining approach	BMC Medical Research Methodology			English	Article						Role of radiotherapy; Treatment intent; Palliation; Administrative data; Missing data; Data quality; Classification; Decision tree	PALLIATIVE RADIOTHERAPY; NOVA-SCOTIA; CANCER; CARE	Background: Clinical data gathered for administrative purposes often lack sufficient information to separate the records of radiotherapy given for palliation from those given for cure. An absence, incompleteness, or inaccuracy of such information could hinder or bias the study of the utilization and outcome of radiotherapy. This study has three specific purposes: 1) develop a method to determine the therapeutic role of radiotherapy (TRR); 2) assess the accuracy of the method; 3) report the quality of the information on treatment "intent" recorded in the clinical data in Ontario, Canada. A general purpose is to use this study as a prototype to demonstrate and test a method to assess the quality of administrative data. Methods: This is a population based retrospective study. A random sample was drawn from the treatment records with "intent" assigned in treating hospitals. A decision tree is grown using treatment parameters as predictors and "intent" as outcome variable to classify the treatments into curative or palliative. The tree classifier was applied to the entire dataset, and the classification results were compared with those identified by "intent". A manual audit was conducted to assess the accuracy of the classification. Results: The following parameters predicted the TRR, from the strongest to the weakest: radiation dose per fraction, treated body-region, disease site, and time of treatment. When applied to the records of treatments given between 1990 and 2008 in Ontario, Canada, the classification rules correctly classified 96.1% of the records. The quality of the "intent" variable was as follows: 77.5% correctly classified, 3.7% misclassified, and 18.8% did not have an "intent" assigned. Conclusions: The classification rules derived in this study can be used to determine the TRR when such information is unavailable, incomplete, or inaccurate in administrative data. The study demonstrates that data mining approach can be used to effectively assess and improve the quality of large administrative datasets.

It is critical to understand the phenomenon of rockburst, focusing on the patterns of occurrence so these events can be avoided and/or managed saving costs and possibly lives. The failure mechanism of rockburst needs to be better understood. Laboratory experiments are undergoing at the Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering (SKLGDUE) of Beijing and the system is described. A large number of rockburst tests were performed and their information collected, stored in a database and analyzed. Data Mining (DM) techniques were applied to the database in order to develop predictive models for the rockburst maximum stress (sigma(RB)) and rockburst risk index (I-RB) that need the results of such tests to be determined. With the developed models it is possible to predict these parameters with high accuracy levels using data from the rock mass and specific project. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In such a study, mice and rats are exposed to a test agent at different dose levels for a period of two years and the incidence of neoplastic lesions is observed. However, this two-year study is also expensive, time-consuming, and burdensome to the experimental animals. Consequently, various alternatives have been proposed in the literature to assess carcinogenicity on basis of short-term studies. In this paper, we investigated if effects on the rodents' liver weight in short-term studies can be exploited to predict the incidence of liver tumors in long-term studies. A set of 138 paired short-and long-term studies was compiled from the database of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), more precisely, from (long-term) two-year carcinogenicity studies and their preceding (short-term) dose finding studies. In this set, data mining methods revealed patterns that can predict the incidence of liver tumors with accuracies of over 80%. However, the results simultaneously indicated a potential bias regarding liver tumors in two-year NTP studies. The incidence of liver tumors does not only depend on the test agent but also on other confounding factors in the study design, e.g., species, sex, type of substance. We recommend considering this bias if the hazard or risk of a test agent is assessed on basis of a NTP carcinogenicity study.

J	Yun, U; Kim, J				Yun, Unil; Kim, Jiwon			A fast perturbation algorithm using tree structure for privacy preserving utility mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Privacy preserving; Utility pattern mining; Perturbation; Frequent pattern mining; Data mining	ASSOCIATION RULES; FREQUENT PATTERNS; DATA STREAMS; SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE; ITEMSETS; INFORMATION; DATABASES	As one of the important approaches in privacy preserving data mining, privacy preserving utility mining has been studied to find more meaningful results while database privacy is ensured and to improve algorithm efficiency by integrating fundamental utility pattern mining and privacy preserving data mining methods. However, its previous approaches require a significant amount of time to protect the privacy of data holders because they conduct database scanning operations excessively many times until all important information is hidden. Moreover, as the size of a given database becomes larger and a userspecified minimum utility threshold becomes lower, their performance degradation may be so uncontrollable that they cannot operate normally. To solve this problem, we propose a fast perturbation algorithm based on a tree structure which more quickly performs database perturbation processes for preventing sensitive information from being exposed. We also present extensive experimental results between our proposed method and state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and synthetic datasets. They show the proposed method has not only outstanding privacy preservation performance that is comparable to the previous ones but also 5-10 times faster runtime than that of the existing approaches on average. In addition, the proposed algorithm guarantees better scalability than that of the latest ones with respect to databases with the characteristics of gradually increasing attributes and transactions.

J	Moro, S; Cortez, P; Rita, P				Moro, Sergio; Cortez, Paulo; Rita, Paulo			Business intelligence in banking: A literature analysis from 2002 to 2013 using text mining and latent Dirichlet allocation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Banking; Business intelligence; Data mining; Text mining; Decision support systems	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; SCORING MODEL; FINANCIAL SERVICES; VECTOR MACHINES; ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; ATTRIBUTES; CUSTOMERS; INDUSTRY; IMPACT	This paper analyzes recent literature in the search for trends in business intelligence applications for the banking industry. Searches were performed in relevant journals resulting in 219 articles published between 2002 and 2013. To analyze such a large number of manuscripts, text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains. Moreover, the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used in order to group articles in several relevant topics. The analysis was conducted using a dictionary of terms belonging to both banking and business intelligence domains. Such procedure allowed for the identification of relationships between terms and topics grouping articles, enabling to emerge hypotheses regarding research directions. To confirm such hypotheses, relevant articles were collected and scrutinized, allowing to validate the text mining procedure. The results show that credit in banking is clearly the main application trend, particularly predicting risk and thus supporting credit approval or denial. There is also a relevant interest in bankruptcy and fraud prediction. Customer retention seems to be associated, although weakly, with targeting, justifying bank offers to reduce churn. In addition, a large number of articles focused more on business intelligence techniques and its applications, using the banking industry just for evaluation, thus, not clearly acclaiming for benefits in the banking business. By identifying these current research topics, this study also highlights opportunities for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this three stage method, through a comprehensive investigation all possible features which can be effective on stocks risk and return are identified. Then, in the next stage risk and return are predicted by applying data mining techniques for the given features. Finally, we develop a hybrid algorithm, on the basis of filter and function-based clustering; the important features in risk and return prediction are selected then risk and return re-predicted. The results show that the proposed hybrid model is a proper tool for effective feature selection and these features are good indicators for the prediction of risk and return. To illustrate the approach as well as to train data and test, we apply it to Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) data from 2002 to 2011. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chemchem, A; Drias, H				Chemchem, Amine; Drias, Habiba			From data mining to knowledge mining: Application to intelligent agents	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Knowledge mining; Induction rules; Classification; Clustering; Cognitive agent		The last decade, the computers world became a huge wave of data. Data mining tasks were invoked to tackle this problem in order to extract the interesting knowledge. The recent emergence of some data mining techniques provide also many interesting induction rules. So, it is judicious now to process these induction rules in order to extract some new strong patterns called meta-rules. This work explores this concept by proposing a new support for induction rules clustering and classification. The approach invokes k-means and k-nn algorithms to mine induction rules using new designed similarity measures and gravity center computation. The developed module have been implemented in the core of the cognitive agent, in order to speed up its reasoning. This new architecture called the Miner Intelligent Agent (MIA) is tested and evaluated on four public benchmarks that contain 25,000 rules, and finally it is compared to the classical one. As foreseeable, the MIA outperforms clearly the classical cognitive agent performances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose a technique for modeling relationships between frequent itemsets through visually descriptive tree-like data structures. We define and discuss algorithms for forming these structures as well as suggest new measures for evaluating their informative value. We also present our visualization tool which implements proposed concepts and solutions. Finally, we apply our research on two different dataset types and discuss the results. The first dataset proves the applicability of our visualization technique for common market basket analysis. The second dataset is an example of a "dense" dataset, a troublesome type for frequent itemset mining since it commonly produces a significantly large number of frequent itemsets. We demonstrate a modified variant of our technique which allows efficient visual representation of such datasets as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This platform integrates anatomical, functional, and genetic knowledge produced by the scientific community. New method: The linkRbrain platform has two major components: (1) a data aggregation component that integrates multiple open databases into a single platform with a unified representation; and (2) a website that provides fast multi-scale integration and visualization of these data and makes the results immediately available. Results: LinkRbrain allows users to visualize functional networks or/and genetic expression over a standard brain template (MNI152). Interrelationships between these components based on topographical overlap are displayed using relational graphs. Moreover, linkRbrain enables comparison of new experimental results with previous published works. Comparison with existing methods: Previous tools and studies illustrate the opportunities of data mining across multiple tiers of neuroscience and genetic information. However, a global systematic approach is still missing to gather cognitive, topographical, and genetic knowledge in a common framework in order to facilitate their visualization, comparison, and integration. Conclusions: LinkR brain is an efficient open-access tool that affords an integrative understanding of human brain function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Besseris, GJ				Besseris, George J.			Concurrent multiresponse non-linear screening: Robust profiling of webpage performance	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Robust screening; Non-linear profiling; Non-parametric screening; Non-linear orthogonal array; Webpage performance	WEB SEARCH QUALITY; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TAGUCHI METHOD; DESIGN; ENHANCEMENT; INFORMATION; OPTIMIZATION; STATISTICS; FRAMEWORK	Profiling engineered data with robust mining methods continues attracting attention in knowledge engineering systems. The purpose of this article is to propose a simple technique that deals with non-linear multi-factorial multi-characteristic screening suitable for knowledge discovery studies. The method is designed to proactively seek and quantify significant information content in engineered mini-datasets. This is achieved by deploying replicated fractional-factorial sampling schemes. Compiled multi-response data are converted to a single master-response effectuated by a series of distribution-free transformations and multi-compresed data fusions. The resulting amalgamated master response is deciphered by non-linear multi-factorial stealth stochastics intended for saturated schemes. The stealth properties of our method target processing datasets which might be overwhelmed by a lack of knowledge about the nature of reference distributions at play. Stealth features are triggered to overcome restrictions regarding the data normality conformance, the effect sparsity assumption and the inherent collapse of the 'unexplainable error' connotation in saturated arrays. The technique is showcased by profiling four ordinary controlling factors that influence webpage content performance by collecting data from a commercial browser monitoring service on a large scale web host. The examined effects are: (1) the number of Cascading Style Sheets files, (2) the number of JavaScript files, (3) the number of Image files, and (4) the Domain Name System Aliasing. The webpage performance level was screened against three popular characteristics: (1) the time to first visual, (2) the total loading time, and (3) the customer satisfaction. Our robust multi-response data mining technique is elucidated for a ten-replicate run study dictated by an L-g(3(4)) orthogonal array scheme where any uncontrolled noise embedded contribution has not been necessarily excluded.

It is important to establish an effective early warning system for prediction of financial crisis for better corporate governance. This paper studies the phenomenon of financial distress for 107 Chinese companies that received the label 'special treatment' from 2001 to 2008 by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We use data mining techniques to build financial distress warning models based on 31 financial indicators and three different time windows by comparing these 107 firms to a control group of firms. We observe that the performance of neural networks is more accurate than other classifiers, such as decision trees and support vector machines, as well as an ensemble of multiple classifiers combined using majority voting. An important contribution of the paper is to discover that financial indicators, such as net profit margin of total assets, return on total assets, earnings per share, and cash flow per share, play an important role in prediction of deterioration in profitability. This paper provides a suitable method for prediction of financial distress for listed companies in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fungi harbor many cryptic gene clusters encoding for the biosynthesis of polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and terpenoids - which can all undergo extensive modifications by tailoring enzymes - thus potentially providing a large array of products from a single pathway. Elucidating the full chemical profile of a fungal species is a challenging exercise, even with elemental composition provided by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) used in combination with chemical databases (e.g., AntiBase) to dereplicate known compounds. This has led to a continuous effort to improve chromatographic separation in conjunction with improvement in HRMS detection. Major improvements have also occurred with 2D chromatography, ion-mobility, MS/MS and MS3, stable isotope labeling feeding experiments, classic UV/Vis, and especially automated data-mining and metabolomics software approaches as the sheer amount of data generated is now the major challenge. This review will focus on the development and implementation of dereplication strategies and will highlight the importance of each stage of the process from sample preparation to chromatographic separation and finally toward both manual and more targeted methods for automated dereplication of fungal natural products using state-of-the art MS instrumentation.

Uncovering the relationship between subducting bathymetric ridges and volcanic chains with significant earthquakes using geophysical data mining	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						seamount chains; bathymetric asperities; data mining; megathrust subduction earthquakes; aseismic ridges; fracture zones	GREAT EARTHQUAKES; FRACTURE-ZONE; RUPTURE; SEAMOUNT; SEISMICITY; SUMATRA; PLATE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DEFORMATION; MARGINS	The subduction of bathymetric asperities has been linked with the location and rupture characteristics of significant (moment magnitude > 5.0) thrust earthquakes in several regions, but a global analysis of these relationships is lacking. We carry out a global investigation of well-defined subducting bathymetric features including ridges, fracture zones and seamounts, and their spatial association with significant earthquakes. The NGDC global significant earthquake database has been filtered to include only those events occurring in the coupling zone between subducting and overriding plates, which includes the bulk of megathrust earthquakes. A statistical methodology is used to compare spatial associations between subducting linear asperities and significant earthquakes. Randomly sampled coupling zone locations are used to establish sensitivity/specificity relationships as a function of proximity, ruling out random effects and establishing meaningful spatial interpretations. In a previous study, we showed that there is a strong link between the largest earthquakes and proximity to fracture-zone subduction-zone intersections. Here, this analysis is extended using a game-formulation methodology, rigorously demonstrating that significant subduction-related earthquakes are more likely to be generated at, or very close to, the intersections between subduction zones and fracture zones, compared with arbitrary locations along subduction zones. A weaker, broader effect is exhibited by subducting volcanic ridges/seamount chains. Fracture zone associations are attributed to the large, localised, linear and mechanically strong bathymetric anomalies related to fracture zone ridges, leading to strong seismic coupling, whereas associations pertaining to volcanic ridges/seamount chains are explained by inherently broader, less elevated and poorly defined characteristics, combined with structural weaknesses that may reduce the long-term coupling effect.

However, it is difficult to apply traditional MST algorithms to a large dataset since the time complexity of the algorithms is quadratic. In this paper, we present a fast MST (FMST) algorithm on the complete graph of N points. The proposed algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer scheme to produce an approximate MST with theoretical time complexity of O(N-1.5), which is faster than the conventional MST algorithms with O(N-2). It consists of two stages. In the first stage, called the divide-and-conquer stage, K-means is employed to partition a dataset into root N clusters. Then an exact MST algorithm is applied to each cluster and the produced root N MSTs are connected in terms of a proposed criterion to form an approximate MST. In the second stage, called the refinement stage, the clusters produced in the first stage form root N - 1 neighboring pairs, and the dataset is repartitioned into root N - 1 clusters with the purpose of partitioning the neighboring boundaries of a neighboring pair into a cluster. With the root N - 1 clusters, another approximate MST is constructed. Finally, the two approximate MSTs are combined into a graph and a more accurate MST is generated from it. The proposed algorithm can be regarded as a framework, since any exact MST algorithm can be incorporated into the framework to reduce its running time. Experimental results show that the proposed approximate MST algorithm is computationally efficient, and the approximation is close to the exact MST so that in practical applications the performance does not suffer.

However, most real-world problems present a certain degree of imprecision. Various studies have been proposed to mine fuzzy association rules from imprecise data but they assume that the membership functions are known in advance and it is not an easy task to know a priori the most appropriate fuzzy sets to cover the domains of the variables. In this paper, we propose FARLAT-LQD, a new fuzzy data-mining algorithm to obtain both suitable membership functions and useful fuzzy association rules from databases with a wide range of types of uncertain data. To accomplish this, first we perform a genetic learning of the membership functions based on the 3-tuples linguistic representation model to reduce the search space and to learn the most adequate context for each fuzzy partition, maximizing the fuzzy supports and the interpretability measure GM3M in order to preserve the semantic interpretability of the obtained membership functions. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm based on the Fuzzy Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, called FFP-growth-LQD, to efficiently mine the fuzzy association rules from inaccurate data considering the learned membership functions in the genetic process. The results obtained over 3 databases of different sizes and kinds of imprecisions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Evolving data streams; Concept drift; Evaluation; Cost-sensitive adaptation; Utility of data mining	ALGORITHMS; DRIFT	Our digital universe is rapidly expanding, more and more daily activities are digitally recorded, data arrives in streams, it needs to be analyzed in real time and may evolve over time. In the last decade many adaptive learning algorithms and prediction systems, which can automatically update themselves with the new incoming data, have been developed. The majority of those algorithms focus on improving the predictive performance and assume that model update is always desired as soon as possible and as frequently as possible. In this study we consider potential model update as an investment decision, which, as in the financial markets, should be taken only if a certain return on investment is expected. We introduce and motivate a new research problem for data streams - cost-sensitive adaptation. We propose a reference framework for analyzing adaptation strategies in terms of costs and benefits. Our framework allows us to characterize and decompose the costs of model updates, and to asses and interpret the gains in performance due to model adaptation for a given learning algorithm on a given prediction task. Our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates how the framework can aid in analyzing and managing adaptation decisions in the chemical industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They can be either static or dynamic, dependently on whether the modeled interactions are fixed or changeable over time. Static networks have been extensively investigated in data mining, while fewer studies have focused on dynamic networks and how to discover complex patterns in large, evolving networks. In this paper we focus on the task of discovering changes in evolving networks and we overcome some limits of existing methods (i) by resorting to a relational approach for representing networks characterized by heterogeneous nodes and/or heterogeneous relationships, and (ii) by proposing a novel algorithm for discovering changes in the structure of a dynamic network over time. Experimental results and comparisons with existing approaches on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution and provide some insights on the effect of some parameters in discovering and modeling the evolution of the whole network, or a subpart of it.

For many applications, though, not only a specific product is of interest but also the properties that people consider important for the whole category of products. Understanding which product features influence a buyer's choice positively or negatively allows decision makers to make well-informed decisions on improving their products or marketing them properly. In this study, we propose OPINSTREAM, a framework for the discovery and polarity monitoring of implicit product features deemed important in the people's reviews on different products. Our framework encompasses stream clustering, extraction of product features from the clusters, cluster adaptation and semi-supervised sentiment learning inside each cluster. These components build upon our earlier work on product feature discovery and monitoring (M. Zimmermann, E. Ntoutsi, Z.F. Siddiqui, M. Spiliopoulou, H.-P.

The application of standard data mining tools in such data sets is not straightforward. Hence, a new class of scalable mining method that embraces the huge storage and processing capacity of cloud platforms is required. In this work, we propose a novel distributed partitioning methodology for prototype reduction techniques in nearest neighbor classification. These methods aim at representing original training data sets as a reduced number of instances. Their main purposes are to speed up the classification process and reduce the storage requirements and sensitivity to noise of the nearest neighbor rule. However, the standard prototype reduction methods cannot cope with very large data sets. To overcome this limitation, we develop a MapReduce-based framework to distribute the functioning of these algorithms through a cluster of computing elements, proposing several algorithmic strategies to integrate multiple partial solutions (reduced sets of prototypes) into a single one. The proposed model enables prototype reduction algorithms to be applied over big data classification problems without significant accuracy loss. We test the speeding up capabilities of our model with data sets up to 5.7 millions of instances. The results show that this model is a suitable tool to enhance the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier with big data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Confidence ratio affinity propagation in ensemble selection of neural network classifiers for distributed privacy-preserving data mining	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Neural networks; Ensemble selection; Distributed computing; Privacy-preserving; Data mining	DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; DATABASES	We consider distributed privacy-preserving data mining in large decentralized data locations which can build several neural networks to form an ensemble. The best neural network classifiers are selected via the proposed confidence ratio affinity propagation in an asynchronous distributed and privacy-preserving computing cycle. Existing methods usually need a shared to all classifiers dataset, in order to examine the classification accuracy of each pair of classifiers. This process is neither distributed nor privacy-preserving. On the other hand in the proposed distributed privacy-preserving solution the classifiers validate each other in a local way. The training set of one classifier becomes the validation set of the other and vice versa and only partial sums of confidences for the correctly and the falsely classified examples are collected. By locally defining a confidence ratio between each pair of classifiers the well known affinity propagation algorithm finds the most representative ones. The construction is parallelizable and the cost is O(LN) for L classifiers and N examples. A-priori knowledge for the number of best classifiers is not required since in affinity propagation algorithm this number emerges automatically. Experimental simulations on benchmark datasets and comparisons with other pairwise diversity based measures and other existing pruning methods are promising. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

LoCH: A neighborhood-based multidimensional projection technique for high-dimensional sparse spaces	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Local multidimensional projection; High-dimensional sparse space; Visual data mining	VISUALIZATION; EXPLORATION; REDUCTION; ALGORITHM; MDS	On the last few years multidimensional projection techniques have advanced towards defining faster and user-centered approaches. However, most of existing methods are designed as generic tools without considering particular features of the data under processing, such as the distance distribution when the data is embedded into a certain metric space. In this paper we split the projection techniques into two groups, global and local techniques, conduct an analysis of them, and present a novel local technique specially designed for projecting heavy tail distance distributions, such as the one produced by high-dimensional sparse spaces. This novel approach, called Local Convex Hull (LoCH), relies on an iterative process that seeks to place each point close to the convex hull of its nearest neighbors. The accuracy, in terms of neighborhood preservation, is confirmed by a set of comparisons and tests, showing that LoCH is capable of successfully segregating groups of similar instances embedded in high-dimensional sparse spaces and of defining the borders between them, significantly better than most projection techniques.

Obtaining precise information on the chemical composition of complex natural extracts (metabolomes) that are primarily obtained from plants or microorganisms is a challenging task that requires sophisticated, advanced analytical methods. In this respect, significant advances in hyphenated chromatographic techniques (LC-MS, GC-MS and LC-NMR in particular), as well as data mining and processing methods, have occurred over the last decade. Together, these tools, in combination with bioassay profiling methods, serve an important role in metabolomics for the purposes of both peak annotation and dereplication in natural product research. In this review, a survey of the techniques that are used for generic and comprehensive profiling of secondary metabolites in natural extracts is provided. The various approaches (chromatographic methods: LC-MS, GC-MS, and LC-NMR and direct spectroscopic methods: NMR and DIMS) are discussed with respect to their resolution and sensitivity for extract profiling. In addition the structural information that can be generated through these techniques or in combination, is compared in relation to the identification of metabolites in complex mixtures. Analytical strategies with applications to natural extracts and novel methods that have strong potential, regardless of how often they are used, are discussed with respect to their potential applications and future trends.

Transcriptomic analysis and 3D bioengineering of astrocytes indicate ROCK inhibition produces cytotrophic astrogliosis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						astrocyte; cytotrophic phenotype; Rho kinase; transcriptome; cell culture; bioengineering	RHO KINASE INHIBITOR; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; CULTURED ASTROCYTES; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; NEURITE INFILTRATION; REACTIVE ASTROCYTES	Astrocytes provide trophic, structural and metabolic support to neurons, and are considered genuine targets in regenerative neurobiology, as their phenotype arbitrates brain integrity during injury. Inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK) cause stellation of cultured 2D astrocytes, increased L-glutamate transport, augmented G-actin, and elevated expression of BDNF and anti-oxidant genes. Here we further explored the signposts of a cytotrophic, "healthy" phenotype by data-mining of our astrocytic transcriptome in the presence of Fasudil. Gene expression profiles of motor and autophagic cellular cascades and inflammatory/angiogenic responses were all inhibited, favoring adoption of an anti-migratory phenotype. Like ROCK inhibition, tissue engineered bioscaffolds can influence the extracellular matrix. We built upon our evidence that astrocytes maintained on 3D poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) electrospun scaffolds adopt a cytotrophic phenotype similar to that produced by Fasudil. Using these procedures, employing mature 3D cultured astrocytes, Fasudil (100 mu M) or Y27632 (30 mu M) added for the last 72 h of culture altered arborization, which featured numerous additional minor processes as shown by GFAP and AHNAK immunolabelling. Both ROCK inhibitors decreased F-actin, but increased G-actin labeling, indicative of disassembly of actin stress fibers. ROCK inhibitors provide additional beneficial effects for bioengineered 3D astrocytes, including enlargement of the overall arbor. Potentially, the combined strategy of bio-compatible scaffolds with ROCK inhibition offers unique advantages for the management of glial scarring. Overall these data emphasize that manipulation of the astrocyte phenotype to achieve a "healthy biology" offers new hope for the management of inflammation in neuropathologies.

In this paper, a decision support tool is presented for setting insulin therapy in new-onset type 1 diabetes. Methods: The concept of differential sequential patterns (DSPs) is introduced with the aim of representing deviations in the patient's blood glucose level (BGL) and the amount of insulin injections administered. The decision support tool is created using data mining algorithms for discovering sequential patterns. Results: By using the DSPs, it is possible to support the physician's decisionmaking concerning changing the treatment (i.e., whether to increase or decrease the insulin dosage). The other contributions of the paper are an algorithm for generating DSPs and a new method for evaluating nocturnal glycaemia. The proposed qualitative evaluation of nocturnal glycaemia improves the generalization capabilities of the DSPs. Conclusions: The usefulness of the proposed approach was evident in the results of experiments in which juvenile diabetic patients actual data were used. It was confirmed that the proposed DSPs can be used to guide the therapy of numerous juvenile patients with type 1 diabetes.

In the most affected city of Santa Cruz, this system was complemented by an entomological surveillance program based on periodical search for immature stages of Aedes aegypti in dwelling water-holding containers. Here, we analyze these data and describe dengue patterns over 6 years (2002-2008), highlighting the spatial distribution of patients and vectors. Methodology/Principal Findings Data mining concerned six annual epidemic cycles (2002-2008), with continuous serological and clinical results and entomological data from 16 surveys, examined at the scales of 36 urban areas and four concentric areas covering the entire city. Annual incidence varied from 0.28% to 0.95%; overall incidence was higher in women and adults, and dengue dynamics followed successive periods of high (January-June) and low (July-December) transmission. Lower numbers of cases from the city center to the periphery were observed, poorly related to the more homogeneous and permanent distribution of A. aegypti. "Plant pots" were a major vector source in the city center, and "Tires" and "Odds and ends" beyond the second ring of the city. Conclusions/Significance Over the years, the increasing trend of dengue cases has been highlighted as well as its widespread distribution over the entire city, but an underestimation of the number of cases is strongly suspected. Contrary to popular belief, the city center appears more affected than the periphery, and dengue is not particularly related to waste. Interestingly, the clinical diagnosis of dengue by physicians improved over the years, whatever the gender, age and residential area of suspected cases.

Di-(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate Metabolites in Urine Show Age-Related Changes and Associations with Adiposity and Parameters of Insulin Sensitivity in Childhood	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL) PHTHALATE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; PUBERTAL CHANGES; THYROID-FUNCTION; IN-VITRO; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; GLUCOSE	Objectives Phthalates might be implicated with obesity and insulin sensitivity. We evaluated the levels of primary and secondary metabolites of Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in urine in obese and normal-weight subjects both before and during puberty, and investigated their relationships with auxological parameters and indexes of insulin sensitivity. Design and Methods DEHP metabolites (MEHP, 6-OH-MEHP, 5-oxo-MEHP, 5-OH-MEHP, and 5-CX-MEHP), were measured in urine by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS. Traditional statistical analysis and a data mining analysis using the Auto-CM analysis were able to offer an insight into the complex biological connections between the studied variables. Results The data showed changes in DEHP metabolites in urine related with obesity, puberty, and presence of insulin resistance. Changes in urine metabolites were related with age, height and weight, waist circumference and waist to height ratio, thus to fat distribution. In addition, clear relationships in both obese and normal-weight subjects were detected among MEHP, its products of oxidation and measurements of insulin sensitivity. Conclusion It remains to be elucidated whether exposure to phthalates per se is actually the risk factor or if the ability of the body to metabolize phthalates is actually the key point. Further studies that span from conception to elderly subjects besides further understanding of DEHP metabolism are warranted to clarify these aspects.

Molecular interactions between pathogens and their hosts are the key parts of the infection mechanisms. Novel antimicrobial therapeutics to fight drug resistance is only possible in case of a thorough understanding of pathogen-host interaction (PHI) systems. Existing databases, which contain experimentally verified PHI data, suffer from scarcity of reported interactions due to the technically challenging and time consuming process of experiments. These have motivated many researchers to address the problem by proposing computational approaches for analysis and prediction of PHIs. The computational methods primarily utilize sequence information, protein structure and known interactions. Classic machine learning techniques are used when there are sufficient known interactions to be used as training data. On the opposite case, transfer and multitask learning methods are preferred. Here, we present an overview of these computational approaches for predicting PHI systems, discussing their weakness and abilities, with future directions.

In traditional power grids, the frequency is the controlled quantity to maintain supply and load power balance. Thereby, high rotating mass inertia ensures for stability. In the future, system stability will have to rely more on real-time measurements and sophisticated control, especially when integrating fluctuating renewable power sources or high-load consumers like electrical vehicles to the low-voltage distribution grid. In the present contribution, we describe a data processing network for the in-house developed low-voltage, high-rate measurement devices called electrical data recorder (EDR). These capture units are capable of sending the full high-rate acquisition data for permanent storage in a large-scale database. The EDR network is specifically designed to serve for reliable and secured transport of large data, live performance monitoring, and deep data mining. We integrate dedicated different interfaces for statistical evaluation, big data queries, comparative analysis, and data integrity tests in order to provide a wide range of useful post-processing methods for smart grid analysis. We implemented the developed EDR network architecture for high-rate measurement data processing and management at different locations in the power grid of our Institute. The system runs stable and successfully collects data since several years. The results of the implemented evaluation functionalities show the feasibility of the implemented methods for signal processing, in view of enhanced smart grid operation.

Currently, several salivary proteins remain unidentified and for some others, their function yet to be determined. The goal of the present study is to utilize mass spectrometry analysis to widen our knowledge of mouse salivary proteins, and through extensive database searches, provide further insight into the array of proteins that can be found in saliva. A comprehensive mouse salivary proteome will also facilitate the development of mouse models to study specific biomarkers of many human diseases. Results: Individual saliva samples were collected from male and female mice, and later pooled according to sex. Two pools of saliva from female mice (2 samples/pool) and 2 pools of saliva from male mice were used for analysis utilizing high performance liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry (nano-RPLC-MS/MS). The resulting datasets identified 345 proteins: 174 proteins were represented in saliva obtained from both sexes, as well as 82 others that were more female specific and 89 that were more male specific. Of these sex linked proteins, twelve were identified as exclusively sex-limited; 10 unique to males and 2 unique to females. Functional analysis of the 345 proteins identified 128 proteins with catalytic activity characteristics; indicative of proteins involved in digestion, and 35 proteins associated with stress response, host defense, and wound healing functions. Submission of the list of 345 proteins to the BioMart data mining tool in the Ensembl database further allowed us to identify a total of 283 orthologous human genes, of which, 131 proteins were recently reported to be present in the human salivary proteome. Conclusions: The present study is the most comprehensive list to date of the proteins that constitute the mouse salivary proteome. The data presented can serve as a useful resource for identifying potentially useful biomarkers of human health and disease.

This paper addresses the problem of how to estimate the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of chemical compounds in the human body using decision tree-based regression methods from the area of data mining (or machine learning). Hence, the pros and cons of several different types of decision tree-based regression methods have been discussed. The regression methods predict Vss using, as predictive features, both the compounds' molecular descriptors and the compounds' tissue: plasma partition coefficients (K-t:p) - often used in physiologically-based pharmacokinetics. Therefore, this work has assessed whether the data mining-based prediction of Vss can be made more accurate by using as input not only the compounds' molecular descriptors but also (a subset of) their predicted K-t:p values. Results: Comparison of the models that used only molecular descriptors, in particular, the Bagging decision tree (mean fold error of 2.33), with those employing predicted K-t:p values in addition to the molecular descriptors, such as the Bagging decision tree using adipose K-t:p (mean fold error of 2.29), indicated that the use of predicted K-t:p values as descriptors may be beneficial for accurate prediction of Vss using decision trees if prior feature selection is applied. Conclusions: Decision tree based models presented in this work have an accuracy that is reasonable and similar to the accuracy of reported Vss inter-species extrapolations in the literature. The estimation of Vss for new compounds in drug discovery will benefit from methods that are able to integrate large and varied sources of data and flexible non-linear data mining methods such as decision trees, which can produce interpretable models.

Our research deployed vehicle-mounted electromagnetic sensor survey equipment to map and quantify soil variability (similar to 50ha per day) using apparent electrical conductivity as an indirect measure of soil texture and moisture differences. A portable visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectrometer (350-2500nm) was then used in the field to acquire hyperspectral data from the side of soil cores to a specified depth at optimized sampling locations. The sampling locations were derived by statistical analysis of the electromagnetic survey dataset, to proportionally sample the full range of spatial variability. The VNIR spectra were used to predict soil organic carbon (prediction model using field-moist spectra: R-2=0.39; RPD=1.28; and air-dry spectra: R-2=0.80; RPD=2.25). These point values were combined with the electromagnetic survey data to produce a soil organic carbon map, using a random forest data mining approach (validation model: R-2=0.52; RMSE=3.21MgC/ha to 30cm soil depth; prediction model: R-2=0.92; RMSE=1.53MgC/ha to 30cm soil depth). This spatial modeling method, using high-resolution sensor data, enables prediction of soil carbon stocks, and their spatial variability, at a resolution previously impractical using a solely laboratory-based approach.

Because hundreds of variables give rise to a high level of redundancy and dimensionality with time complexity, they are more likely to have spurious relationships, and even the weakest relationships will be highly significant by any statistical test. Hence cluster analysis is a main task of data mining and is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar. to each other than to those in other groups. In this paper system implementation is of great significance, which defines a new definition based on information-theoretic entropy and analyzes the analog behaviors of objects at hand so as to address the measurement of uncertainties in the classification of categorical data. The sources were taken from a survey aimed to identify of job guidance from students in high school at PyeongTaek. We show how variable precision information-entropy based rough set can be used to group students in each section. It is proved that the proposed method has the more exact classification than the conventional in attributes more than 10 and that is more effective in job searching for students.

Minimal infrequent pattern based approach for mining outliers in data streams	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Minimal infrequent pattern; Outlier detection; Data streams; Data mining	DISTANCE-BASED OUTLIERS; FREQUENT ITEMSETS; SLIDING WINDOW; CATEGORICAL-DATA; LOCAL OUTLIERS; UNCERTAIN DATA; SERIES DATA	Outlier detection is an important task in data mining which aims at detecting patterns that are unusual in a dataset. Though several techniques are proved to be useful in solving some outlier detection problems, there are certain issues yet to be resolved. Most of the existing methods compute distance of points in full dimensional space to detect outliers. But in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity may not be qualitatively meaningful due to the curse of dimensionality and incurs high computational cost. Moreover, the existing methods focus on discovering outliers but do not provide the interpretability of different subspaces that cause the abnormality. Frequent pattern mining based approaches resolve the aforementioned issues. Recently, infrequent pattern mining has attracted the attention of data mining research community which aims at discovering rare associations and researches in this area motivated to propose a new method to detect outliers in data streams. Infrequent patterns are more interesting than frequent patterns in some domains such as fraudulent credit transactions, anomaly detection, etc. In such applications, mining infrequent patterns facilitates detecting outliers. Minimal infrequent patterns are generators of family of infrequent patterns. In this paper, a novel method is presented to detect outliers by mining minimal infrequent patterns from data streams. Three measures namely Transaction Weighting Factor (TWF), Minimal Infrequent Deviation Factor (MIPDF) and Minimal Infrequent Pattern based Outlier Factor (MIFPOF) are defined. An algorithm called Minimal Infrequent Pattern based Outlier Detection (MIFPOD) method is proposed for detecting outliers in data streams based on mined minimal infrequent patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on synthetic dataset obtained from vital dataset collected from body sensors and a publicly available real dataset. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in detecting outliers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Hemalatha, C.

These models are very popular for building highly accurate classifiers and have been employed in a number of real world applications. During the last years, several studies and different algorithms have been proposed to integrate associative classification models with the fuzzy set theory, leading to the so-called fuzzy associative classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient fuzzy associative classification approach based on a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithm. Fuzzy items are generated by discretizing the input variables and defining strong fuzzy partitions on the intervals resulting from-these discretizations. Then, fuzzy associative classification rules are mined by employing a fuzzy extension of the FP-Growth algorithm, one of the most efficient frequent pattern mining algorithms. Finally, a set of highly accurate classification rules is generated after a pruning stage. We tested our approach on seventeen real-world datasets and compared the achieved results with the ones obtained by using both a non-fuzzy associative classifier, namely CMAR, and two recent state-of-the-art classifiers, namely FARC-HD and D-MOFARC, based on fuzzy association rules. Using non-parametric statistical tests, we show that our approach outperforms CMAR and achieves accuracies similar to FARC-HD and D-MOFARC. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The decision tree (DT) technique is a supervised data mining method that shows good promise for this purpose. The C5.0 and CHAID algorithms were employed in this study to construct decision trees and to extract rules that show the associations between the input and output variables (attributes) for roofer fall accidents. Data obtained from the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was incorporated in this research. Degree of injury (fatality vs. nonfatal injury) was selected as the output attribute, and a multitude of input attributes were included in the study. Two models based on the algorithms were developed and validated. The results showed that decision trees provided specific and detailed depictions of the associations between the attributes. It was found that fatality chances increased with increasing fall distance and decreased when safety training was provided. The most important input attributes in the models were identified as the fall distance, fatality/injury cause, safety training, and construction operation prompting fall, meaning that these factors had the best predictive power related to whether a roofer fall accident would result in a fatality or nonfatal injury.

Understanding the relationship between these two perspectives and finding ways to improve both is a major challenge of modern molecular biology. Computational approaches for finding DNA motifs are well recognized as useful tools to biologists, which greatly help in saving experimental time and cost in wet laboratories. Over these years, many motif search algorithms and Web-based tools have been developed based on computational intelligence systems and data mining techniques in light of classical electronic computers. In order to use quantum computers in DNA motif model discovering, a related quantum algorithm is necessary. In this paper, based on the quantum adiabatic theorem, an adiabatic quantum algorithm and its application to DNA motif model discovery are obtained in terms of the MISCORE-based motif score. The proposed method can be used to deal with discovering of DNA motif models with big data by a quantum computer, e.g. D-Wave. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, YH; Tsai, CF; Tai, CT; Chiang, IC				Hu, Ya-Han; Tsai, Chih-Fong; Tai, Chun-Tien; Chiang, In-Chi			A novel approach for mining cyclically repeated patterns with multiple minimum supports	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Cyclically repeated pattern (CRP) mining Multiple minimum supports; Sequential pattern	GENERALIZED ASSOCIATION RULES; PARTIAL PERIODIC PATTERNS; SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; CONSTRAINTS; DATABASES	Periodic patterns and cyclic patterns have been used to discover recurring patterns in sequence databases. Toroslu (2003) proposed cyclically repeated pattern (CRP) mining, in which a new parameter called repetition support is considered in the mining process. In a data sequence, the occurrence of a subsequence must satisfy a single user-specified minimum repetition support. However, in real-life applications, items may occur at various frequencies in a database. The rare item problem may occur when all items are set to a single minimum repetition support. To solve this problem, we included the concept of multiple minimum supports to enable users to specify the multiple minimum item repetition support (MIR) according to the natures of items. In this paper, we first redefined CRPs based on the MIR and original form of the sequence minimum support. A new algorithm, rep-PrefixSpan, was developed for discovering a complete set of CRPs in sequence databases. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits performance superior to that of conventional CRP mining. The proposed method can be applied in many application domains including customer purchase behavior, web logging, and stock analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, JCW; Hong, TP; Lin, TC				Lin, Jerry Chun-Wei; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Lin, Tsung-Chin			A CMFFP-tree algorithm to mine complete multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy set; Quantitative database; Multiple linguistic terms; Fuzzy frequent itemsets; Frequent pattern tree	ASSOCIATION RULES; FP-TREES; GENERATION; DATABASE; SETS	In the past, many algorithms were proposed to adopt fuzzy-set theory for discovering fuzzy association rules from quantitative databases. The fuzzy frequent pattern (FFP)-tree and the compressed fuzzy frequent pattern (CFFP)-tree algorithms were respectively proposed to mine the incomplete fuzzy frequent itemsets from the tree-based structures. In the past, multiple fuzzy frequent pattern (MFFP)-tree algorithm was proposed to keep more linguistic terms for mining fuzzy frequent itemsets. Since the MFFPtree algorithm inherits the property of the FFP-tree algorithm, numerous tree nodes are thus required to build the MFFP-tree structure for mining the desired multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets. In this paper, the compressed multiple fuzzy frequent pattern (CMFFP)-tree algorithm is designed to keep not only the linguistic term with maximum membership value but also the other frequent linguistic terms for mining the completely fuzzy frequent itemsets. In the designed CMFFP-tree algorithm, the multiple frequent linguistic terms are sorted in descending order of their occurrence frequencies to build the CMFFP-tree structure. The construction process is the same as the CFFP-tree algorithm except more information are kept for later mining process to discover the completely fuzzy frequent itemsets. Each node in the CMFFPtree uses the additional array to keep the membership values of its prefix path by intersection operation. A CMFFP-mine algorithm is also designed to efficiently mine the multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets from the developed CMFFP-tree structure. Experiments are then conducted to show the performance of the proposed CMFFP-tree algorithm in terms of execution time and the number of tree nodes, compared to those of the MFFP-tree and CFFP-tree algorithms.

Following this line of thought, we propose the Communicating Ants for Clustering with Backtracking strategy (CACB) algorithm, which is based on a dynamic and an adaptive aggregation threshold and a backtracking strategy where artificial ants are allowed to turn back in their previous aggregation decisions. The CACB algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that generates compact dendrograms since it allows the aggregation of more than two clusters at a time. Its high performance is experimentally shown through several real benchmark data sets and a content-based image retrieval system.

Some sensitive or private information concerning individuals, businesses and organizations has to be suppressed before it is shared or published. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) has become an important issue in recent years. In the past, many heuristic approaches were developed to sanitize databases for the purpose of hiding sensitive information in PPDM, but data sanitization of PPDM is considered to be an NP-hard problem. It is critical to find the balance between privacy protection for hiding sensitive information and maintaining the discovery of knowledge, or even reducing artificial knowledge in the sanitization process. In this paper, a GA-based framework with two optimization algorithms is proposed for data sanitization. A novel evaluation function with three concerned factors is designed to find the appropriate transactions to be deleted in order to hide sensitive itemsets. Experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GA-based algorithms with regard to different factors such as the execution time, the number of hiding failures, the number of missing itemsets, the number of artificial itemsets, and database dissimilarity.

The identification of outliers is important for many applications, including those related to intrusion detection, credit card fraud, criminal activity in electronic commerce, medical diagnosis and anti-terrorism. Various outlier detection methods have been proposed for solving problems in different domains. In this paper, a new outlier detection method is proposed from the perspectives of granular computing (GrC) and rough set theory. First, we give a definition of outliers called GR(GrC and rough sets)-based outliers. Second, to detect GR-based outliers, an outlier detection algorithm called ODGrCR is proposed. Third, the effectiveness of ODGrCR is evaluated by using a number of real data sets. The experimental results show that our algorithm is effective for outlier detection. In particular, our algorithm takes much less running time than other outlier detection methods.

Frequent pattern mining based on item frequencies is the most fundamental topic in the pattern mining field. However, it is difficult to discover the important patterns on the basis of only frequencies since characteristics of real-world databases such as relative importance of items and non-binary transactions are not reflected. In this regard, utility pattern mining has been considered as an emergent research topic that deals with the characteristics. In real-world applications, meanwhile newly generated data by continuous operation or data in other databases for integration analysis can be gradually added to the current database. To efficiently deal with both existing and new data as a database, it is necessary to reflect increased data to previous analysis results without analyzing the whole database again. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called HUPID-Growth (High Utility Patterns in Incremental Databases Growth) for mining high utility patterns in incremental databases. Moreover, we suggest a tree structure constructed with a single database scan named HUPID-Tree (High Utility Patterns in Incremental Databases Tree), and a restructuring method with a novel data structure called TIList (Tail-node Information List) in order to process incremental databases more efficiently. We conduct various experiments for performance evaluation with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm more efficiently processes real datasets compared to previous ones.

The ubiquitous phenomenon of massive data and sparse information imposes considerable challenges in data mining research. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework, Exemplar-based low-rank sparse matrix decomposition (EMD), to cluster large-scale datasets. Capitalizing on recent advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EMD can partition datasets with large dimensions and scalable sizes efficiently. Specifically, given a data matrix, EMD first computes a representative data subspace and a near-optimal low-rank approximation. Then, the cluster centroids and indicators are obtained through matrix decomposition, in which we require that the cluster centroids lie within the representative data subspace. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a compact "sketch"of the data. This makes the clustering highly efficient and robust to noise. In addition, the clustering results are sparse and easy for interpretation. From a theoretical perspective, we prove the correctness and convergence of the EMD algorithm, and provide detailed analysis on its efficiency, including running time and spatial requirements. Through extensive experiments performed on both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the performance of EMD for clustering large-scale data.

Choosing the best representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical step in time series data mining. In this work, we investigate the problem of discovering the natural intrinsic representation model, dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. The ability to automatically discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the best parameters for particular algorithms, as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification, clustering and outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal Description Length framework. Extensive empirical tests show that our method is simpler, more general and more accurate than previous methods, and has the important advantage of being essentially parameter-free.

J	Wang, F; Sun, JM				Wang, Fei; Sun, Jimeng			Survey on distance metric learning and dimensionality reduction in data mining	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Distance metric learning; Dimensionality reduction; Data mining	RELEVANT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EIGENMAPS	Distance metric learning is a fundamental problem in data mining and knowledge discovery. Many representative data mining algorithms, such as -nearest neighbor classifier, hierarchical clustering and spectral clustering, heavily rely on the underlying distance metric for correctly measuring relations among input data. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated, either theoretically or empirically, that learning a good distance metric can greatly improve the performance of classification, clustering and retrieval tasks. In this survey, we overview existing distance metric learning approaches according to a common framework. Specifically, depending on the available supervision information during the distance metric learning process, we categorize each distance metric learning algorithm as supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised. We compare those different types of metric learning methods, point out their strength and limitations. Finally, we summarize open challenges in distance metric learning and propose future directions for distance metric learning.

While small changes to normal operating conditions made by this system may not seriously affect the quality of a product, a system failure will be declared if an observation significantly deviates from the in-control region before defective units are mass-produced. Although a number of research works integrating data-mining algorithms with MSPC have been proposed to effectively manage a large amount of data, this combination may not function for the case of system failures due to the extreme imbalance of data. This research proposes a new approach and employs a classification technique, namely, random forest, which overcomes the class imbalance problem. The proposed method systematically shifts artificial data toward the region of failures to ensure the classifier correctly detects system failures. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of failure detection counts.

However most existing methods, fail to identify nodes with multiple community affiliation, correctly. In this paper, a unique method to define overlapping community in complex networks is proposed, using the overlapping neighborhood ratio to represent relations between nodes. Matrix factorization is then utilized to assign nodes into their corresponding community structures. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates the use of Perron clusters to estimate the number of overlapping communities in a network. Experimental results in real and artificial networks show, with great accuracy, that the proposed method succeeds to recover most of the overlapping communities existing in the network.

Clustering disaggregated load profiles using a Dirichlet process mixture model	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; Classification algorithms; Data mining; Energy use; Power demand; Smart grids	NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS; PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; CUSTOMERS	The increasing availability of substantial quantities of power-use data in both the residential and commercial sectors raises the possibility of mining the data to the advantage of both consumers and network operations. We present a Bayesian non-parametric model to cluster load profiles from households and business premises. Evaluators show that our model performs as well as other popular clustering methods, but unlike most other methods it does not require the number of clusters to be predetermined by the user. We used the so-called 'Chinese restaurant process' method to solve the model, making use of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The number of clusters grew logarithmically with the quantity of data, making the technique suitable for scaling to large data sets. We were able to show that the model could distinguish features such as the nationality, household size, and type of dwelling between the cluster memberships. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Efficient Algorithms for Mining the Concise and Lossless Representation of High Utility Itemsets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Frequent itemset; closed(+) high utility itemset; lossless and concise representation; utility mining; data mining	FREQUENT PATTERNS; CLOSED ITEMSETS; SPACE	Mining high utility itemsets (HUIs) from databases is an important data mining task, which refers to the discovery of itemsets with high utilities (e.g. high profits). However, it may present too many HUIs to users, which also degrades the efficiency of the mining process. To achieve high efficiency for the mining task and provide a concise mining result to users, we propose a novel framework in this paper for mining closed(+) high utility itemsets (CHUIs), which serves as a compact and lossless representation of HUIs. We propose three efficient algorithms named AprioriCH (Apriori-based algorithm for mining High utility Closed(+) itemsets), AprioriHC-D (AprioriHC algorithm with Discarding unpromising and isolated items) and CHUD (Closed(+) High Utility Itemset Discovery) to find this representation. Further, a method called DAHU (Derive All High Utility Itemsets) is proposed to recover all HUIs from the set of CHUIs without accessing the original database. Results on real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithms are very efficient and that our approaches achieve a massive reduction in the number of HUIs. In addition, when all HUIs can be recovered by DAHU, the combination of CHUD and DAHU outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for mining HUIs.

We call such graphs weighted attribute graphs (WAGs). Nodes of a WAG exhibit multiple attributes with varying, non-negative weights. WAGs are ubiquitous in real-world applications. For example, in a co-authorship WAG, each author is a node; each attribute corresponds to a particular topic (e.g., databases, data mining, and machine learning); and the amount of expertise in a particular topic is represented by a non-negative weight on that attribute. A typical search in this setting specifies both connectivity between nodes and constraints on weights of nodal attributes. For example, a user's search may be: find three coauthors (i.e., a triangle) where each author's expertise is greater than 50 percent in at least one topic area (i.e., attribute). We propose a ranking function which unifies ranking between the graph structure and attribute weights of nodes. We prove that the problem of retrieving the optimal answer for graph search on WAGs is NP-complete. Moreover, we propose a fast and effective top-k graph search algorithm for WAGs. In an extensive experimental study with multiple real-world graphs, our proposed algorithm exhibits significant speed-up over competing approaches. On average, our proposed method is more than 7x faster in query processing than the best competitor.

In this context, the target function may change over time, an inherent problem of online learning (known as concept drift). In order to handle concept drift regardless of the learning model, we propose new methods to monitor the performance metrics measured during the learning process, to trigger drift signals when a significant variation has been detected. To monitor this performance, we apply some probability inequalities that assume only independent, univariate and bounded random variables to obtain theoretical guarantees for the detection of such distributional changes. Some common restrictions for the online change detection as well as relevant types of change (abrupt and gradual) are considered. Two main approaches are proposed, the first one involves moving averages and is more suitable to detect abrupt changes. The second one follows a widespread intuitive idea to deal with gradual changes using weighted moving averages. The simplicity of the proposed methods, together with the computational efficiency make them very advantageous. We use a Naive Bayes classifier and a Perceptron to evaluate the performance of the methods over synthetic and real data.

Convex hull is important in many applications such as GIS, statistical analysis and data mining. Due to the ubiquity of data uncertainty such as location uncertainty in real-world applications, we study the concept of convex hull over uncertain data in 2D space. We propose the Probabilistic Convex Hull (PCH) query and demonstrate its applications, such as Flickr landscape photo extraction and activity region visualization, where location uncertainty is incurred by GPS devices or sensors. To tackle the problem of possible world explosion, we develop an O(N-3) algorithm based on geometric properties, where N is the data size. We further improve this algorithm with spatial indices and effective pruning techniques, which prune the majority of data instances. To achieve better time complexity, we propose another O(N-2 log N) algorithm, by maintaining a probability oracle in the form of a circular array with nice properties. Finally, to support applications that require fast response, we develop a Gibbs-sampling-based approximation algorithm which efficiently finds the PCH with high accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of our algorithms for answering PCH queries.

The standard low-rank matrix completion methods relax the rank minimization problem by the trace norm minimization. However, this relaxation may make the solution seriously deviate from the original solution. Meanwhile, most completion methods minimize the squared prediction errors on the observed entries, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust matrix completion method to address these two problems. The joint Schatten -norm and -norm are used to better approximate the rank minimization problem and enhance the robustness to outliers. The extensive experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real-world applications in collaborative filtering prediction and social network link recovery. All empirical results show that our new method outperforms the standard matrix completion methods.

In order to improve the internal quality of a software system, identifying faulty entities such as classes, modules, methods is essential for software developers. As defective software entities are hard to identify, machine learning-based classification models are still developed to approach the problem of detecting software design defects. We are proposing a novel method based on relational association rule mining for detecting faulty entities in existing software systems. Relational association rules are a particular type of association rules and describe numerical orderings between attributes that commonly occur over a dataset. Our method is based on the discovery of relational association rules for identifying design defects in software. Experiments on open source software are conducted in order to detect defective classes in object-oriented software systems, and a comparison of our approach with similar existing approaches is provided.

It is important to design a privacy-preserving LOF outlier detection algorithm as the data on which LOF runs is typically spilt among multiple participants and no one is willing to disclose his sensitive information due to legal or moral considerations. This is, however, a hard problem since participants need to find the maximum one of the distances between an object and its k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) without learning the information of these objects. In this paper, we propose an efficient protocol for privacy-preserving LOF outlier detection. We first employ a shuffle protocol to permute the distance vectors owned by different participants. Then, we design a secure selection method to obtain the garbled k-NN indexes and shares of k-distance for given objects. For each object, we make use of the k-distance of all objects to construct a vector, based on which the permute protocol is executed again to obtain new shares of k-distance. Finally, the shares corresponding to the garbled k-NN indexes are selected as the expected result. Our protocol ensures that all the intermediates are shared between multiple participants and thus avoid information leaking. In addition, our protocol is efficient as we prove that the computation and communication complexity of our protocol is bounded by .

Key characteristic information to the data is often lost, particularly when averaging or aggregation processes are applied. Therefore, other methods of analysing data need to be used so that this information is not lost. One such method which lends itself to analysing large amounts of information is data mining. This allows for the data to be segmented before such aggregation processes are applied. Moreover, segmentation allows for dimension reduction thus enabling easier manipulation of the data. Clustering methods have been used in the electricity industry for some time. However, their use at a domestic level has been somewhat limited to date. This paper investigates three of the most widely used unsupervised clustering methods: k-means, k-medoid and Self Organising Maps (SOM). The best performing technique is then evaluated in order to segment individual households into clusters based on their pattern of electricity use across the day. The process is repeated for each day over a six month period in order to characterise the diurnal, intra-daily and seasonal variations of domestic electricity demand. Based on these results a series of Profile Classes (PC's) are presented that represent common patterns of electricity use within the home. Finally, each PC is linked to household characteristics by applying a multi-nominal logistic regression to the data. As a result, households and the manner with which they use electricity in the home can be characterised based on individual customer attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, YS; Yu, WD; Li, QM				Cheng, Yusi; Yu, Wen-der; Li, Qiming			GA-based multi-level association rule mining approach for defect analysis in the construction industry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Association rule; Data mining; Construction defects; GA; Concept hierarchy	REWORK; GENERATION; PATTERNS	In construction industry, work defects yield time and cost overruns of construction projects and also cause disputes between project participants during construction and operation phases. To date, there hasn't yet been an adequate analytical model to extract useful information from the database of construction defects. The information represented in the form of association rules could enhance quality management via defect prediction and causation analysis. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach that incorporates the concept hierarchy of construction defects to discover multi-level patterns of defects from the database of defects in the Chinese construction industry during 2000 to 2010. First, the domain knowledge of construction defect is incorporated into a concept hierarchy to adjust mining items at different levels according to the data sparseness and the interestingness of a rule. Second, a GA-based approach is proposed to generate interesting association rules without specified threshold of minimum confidence, taking advantage of the searching capability of GA Finally, the redundant rules in the mining results are pruned by post-processing method. A test case is selected to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach within the problem domain. It is concluded that the proposed method provided an effective tool to discover useful knowledge hidden in historical defect cases. The discovered knowledge indicating relationships between defects and defect causes enables project managers to make strategies for estimating and reducing defects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Data mining-based statistical analysis of biological data uncovers hidden significance: clustering Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients based on the response of their PBMC with IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion to stimulation with Hsp60	CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES			English	Article						Hashimoto's thyroiditis; Hsp60; IL-2; IFN-gamma; Data mining; Clustering; Delta values	SHOCK	The pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis includes autoimmunity involving thyroid antigens, autoantibodies, and possibly cytokines. It is unclear what role plays Hsp60, but our recent data indicate that it may contribute to pathogenesis as an autoantigen. Its role in the induction of cytokine production, pro- or anti-inflammatory, was not elucidated, except that we found that peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) from patients or from healthy controls did not respond with cytokine production upon stimulation by Hsp60 in vitro with patterns that would differentiate patients from controls with statistical significance. This "negative" outcome appeared when the data were pooled and analyzed with conventional statistical methods. We re-analyzed our data with non-conventional statistical methods based on data mining using the classification and regression tree learning algorithm and clustering methodology. The results indicate that by focusing on IFN-gamma and IL-2 levels before and after Hsp60 stimulation of PBMC in each patient, it is possible to differentiate patients from controls. A major general conclusion is that when trying to identify disease markers such as levels of cytokines and Hsp60, reference to standards obtained from pooled data from many patients may be misleading. The chosen biomarker, e.g., production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by PBMC upon stimulation with Hsp60, must be assessed before and after stimulation and the results compared within each patient and analyzed with conventional and data mining statistical methods.

Comprehensive mechanical property classification of vapor-grown carbon nanofiber/vinyl ester nanocomposites using support vector machines	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Support vector machines; Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Vapor-grown carbon nanofiber/vinyl ester; Confusion matrix; Cross validation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MATERIALS INFORMATICS; METALLOGRAPHIC IMAGES; OPTIMIZATION; VALIDATION; DESIGN	In the context of data mining and knowledge discovery, a large dataset of vapor-grown carbon nanofiber (VGCNF)/vinyl ester (VE) nanocomposites was thoroughly analyzed and classified using support vector machines (SVMs) into ten classes of desired mechanical properties. These classes are high true ultimate strength, high true yield strength, high engineering elastic modulus, high engineering ultimate strength, high flexural modulus, high flexural strength, high impact strength, high storage modulus, high loss modulus, and high tan delta. Resubstitution and 3-folds cross validation techniques were applied and different sets of confusion matrices were used to compare and analyze the classifier's resulting classification performance. The designed SVMs model is resourceful for materials scientists and engineers, because it can be used to qualitatively assess different nanocomposite mechanical responses associated with different combinations of the formulation, processing, and environmental conditions. In addition, the lead time required to develop VGCNF/VE nanocomposites for particular engineering application will be significantly reduced using the designed SVMs classifier. This work specifically present a framework for a fast and reliable classification of a large material dataset with respect to desired mechanical properties, and can be used for all materials within the context of materials science and engineering.

J	Xue, CJ; Song, WJ; Qin, LJ; Dong, Q; Wen, XY				Xue Cunjin; Song Wanjiao; Qin Lijuan; Dong Qing; Wen Xiaoyang			A mutual-information-based mining method for marine abnormal association rules	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Mutual information; Data mining; Quantitative association rule; Marine abnormal association rules	SCIENCE; ENSO; SEA	Long time series of remote sensing images are a key source of data for exploring large-scale marine abnormal association patterns, but pose significant challenges for traditional approaches to spatio-temporal analysis. This paper proposes a mutual-information-based quantitative association rule-mining algorithm (MIQarma) to address these challenges. MIQarma comprises three key steps. First, MIQarma calculates the asymmetrical mutual information between items with one scan of the database, and extracts pair-wise related items according to the user-specified information threshold. Second, a linking-pruning-generating recursive loop generates (k+1)-dimensional candidate association rules from k-dimensional rules on basis of the user-specified minimum support threshold, and this step is repeated until no more candidate association rules are generated. Finally, strong association rules are generated according to the user-specified minimum evaluation indicators. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of MIQarma, we present two case studies: one considers performance analysis and the other identifies marine abnormal association relationships.

In this paper, we identify these special characteristics, and address power consumption issues through two novel techniques. First, we reorganize the computation sequence of the web browser when loading a webpage, so that the web browser can first run the computations that will generate new data transmissions and retrieve these data from the web server. Then, the web browser can put the wireless radio interface into low power state, release the radio resource, and then run the remaining computations. Second, we introduce a practical data mining based method to predict the user reading time of webpages, based on which the smartphone can switch to low power state when the reading time is longer than a threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our energy-aware approaches, we develop a testbed with Android phones on T-Mobile UMTS network. Experimental results show that our approach can reduce the power consumption of smartphone by more than 30 percent during web browsing. Moreover, our solution can further reduce the webpage loading time and increase the network capacity.

It can be considered as an extended statistical hypotheses testing with pre-defined structural model. However, when the SEM is applied as an exploratory technique in data mining, the traditional model depicts a fundamental limitation of incapacity of generating and refining structural model. A new SEM method is proposed in this paper, which combines the principles of cluster and regression analysis. Thus, the new mathematical model can not only generate factors to form model structure but also ensure the optimum relationship to the objective variables. The method is applied to a data set of lake sediment geochemical compositions for identifying gold mineralization associated factors in Southern Nova Scotia, Canada. A SEM model consisting of three measurement sub-models and one structural sub-model is created on the basis of the concentration values of 16 elements from 671 lake sediment samples. The calculated results show that the factors obtained by the new SEM model represent three geochemical factors that are associated with As and dominated by Cu, Zn and W, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm combined with a support vector machine (SVM) for feature selection and classification in Data mining. The proposed approach tries to find a subset of features that maximizes the classification accuracy rate of SVM. In addition, another hybrid algorithm of MA and SVM with optimized parameters is also developed. The two versions of our proposed method are evaluated on some datasets and compared with some well-known classifiers for data classification. The computational experiments show that the hybrid method MA + SVM with optimized parameters provides competitive results and finds high quality solutions.

Seismo-ionospheric precursory anomalies detection from DEMETER satellite data based on data mining	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Earthquake prediction; Ionospheric anomaly; Data mining; DEMETER satellite		Widespread researches and studies on earthquake prediction show that seismo-ionospheric disturbances can be observed over seismic regions before an earthquake. However, it is still hard to detect accurate pre-seismic ionosphere anomaly and use them to predict earthquake. To solve the problem, we propose a method that can extract the feature of pre-seismic ionospheric anomalies based on data mining. The main theme of this method can be described as follows: First, we mine frequent itemsets from pre-seismic ionosphere data measured by DEMETER (Detection of Electromagnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) satellite and regard them as seismic features after a series of processing; then we carry out earthquake prediction experiments in test region to check the validity of these features as well as searching for interesting information. The experimental results reveal that this method is effective, and we also get some remarkable conclusions about earthquake prediction, such as the features of pre-seismic ionosphere anomalies contain ion temperature, electron density, electron temperature and plasma potential and among all the experimental conditions we discussed in this paper, and features mined from ionosphere data 5 days before earthquake lead to the highest accuracy in earthquake prediction.

In this paper, we propose a way to perform a quick estimation using convenient, reliable building data that are readily available regionally instead of the information usually required by traditional methods. Using a dataset of existing buildings in Grenoble (France) with an EMS98 vulnerability classification and by means of two different data mining techniques-association rule learning and support vector machine-we developed seismic vulnerability proxies. These were applied to the whole France using basic information from national databases (census information) and data derived from the processing of satellite images and aerial photographs to produce a nationwide vulnerability map. This macroscale method to assess vulnerability is easily applicable in case of a paucity of information regarding the structural characteristics and constructional details of the building stock. The approach was validated with data acquired for the city of Nice, by comparison with the RiskUE method. Finally, damage estimations were compared with historic earthquakes that caused moderate-to-strong damage in France. We show that due to the evolution of vulnerability in cities, the number of seriously damaged buildings can be expected to double or triple if these historic earthquakes were to occur today.

Thereby, the focus lies on an intuitive understanding of the underlying mathematical principles rather than detailed algorithmic pipelines. Important mathematical properties of the technologies are summarized in the tabular form. The behavior of representative techniques is demonstrated for three benchmarks, followed by a short discussion on how to quantitatively evaluate these mappings. In addition, three currently active research topics are addressed: how to devise dimensionality reduction techniques for complex non-vectorial data sets, how to easily shape dimensionality reduction techniques according to the users preferences, and how to device models that are suited for big data sets.

An adequate diagnosis of acute leukemia, based on the identification of a leukemic cell population and the hematopoietic lineage assessment, is the first goal toward defining correct risk stratification of patients and tailoring specific therapies to patients. Diagnosis of acute leukemia underwent an important change since the 1970s when the only available diagnostic tools were cytomorphology and cytochemistry. Nowadays, the development of modern techniques and their combined use in a multimodal approach lead to a better identification and sub-classification of acute leukemia. Thus, blast identification in acute leukemia required a comprehensive global approach, by combining cytomorphology, cytochemistry, multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular genetic methods. At least, new sequencing technologies, such as gene expression profiling (GEP) and whole-genome sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, and comparative genomic hybridization array, could represent the new frontiers in the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in acute leukemia.

Mining web-based data to assess public response to environmental events	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Editorial Material						Twitter; Google trends; Social media; Web search trends; Data mining; Algal blooms; Public perception and interest	ECOLOGY; BLOOMS	We explore how the analysis of web-based data, such as Twitter and Google Trends, can be used to assess the social relevance of an environmental accident. The concept and methods are applied in the shutdown of drinking water supply at the city of Toledo, Ohio, USA. Toledo's notice, which persisted from August 1 to 4, 2014, is a high-profile event that directly influenced approximately half a million people and received wide recognition. The notice was given when excessive levels of microcystin, a byproduct of cyanobacteria blooms, were discovered at the drinking water treatment plant on Lake Erie. Twitter mining results illustrated an instant response to the Toledo incident, the associated collective knowledge, and public perception. The results from Google Trends, on the other hand, revealed how the Toledo event raised public attention on the associated environmental issue, harmful algal blooms, in a long-term context. Thus, when jointly applied, Twitter and Google Trend analysis results offer complementary perspectives. Web content aggregated through mining approaches provides a social standpoint, such as public perception and interest, and offers context for establishing and evaluating environmental management policies.

Shifting the metallocentric molybdoenzyme paradigm: the importance of pyranopterin coordination	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Cofactor; Electrochemistry; Electron transfer; Metallocenter assembly	HUMAN SULFITE OXIDASE; PERIPLASMIC NITRATE REDUCTASE; INTRAMOLECULAR ELECTRON-TRANSFER; MONONUCLEAR MOLYBDENUM ENZYMES; CARBON-MONOXIDE DEHYDROGENASE; IRON-SULFUR MOLYBDOENZYME; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ACTIVE-SITE	In this review, we test the hypothesis that pyranopterin coordination plays a critical role in defining substrate reactivities in the four families of mononuclear molybdenum and tungsten enzymes (Mo/W-enzymes). Enzyme families containing a single pyranopterin dithiolene chelate have been demonstrated to have reactivity towards two (sulfite oxidase, SUOX-fold) and five (xanthine dehydrogenase, XDH-fold) types of substrate, whereas the major family of enzymes containing a bis-pyranopterin dithiolene chelate (dimethylsulfoxide reductase, DMSOR-fold) is reactive towards eight types of substrate. A second bis-pyranopterin enzyme (aldehyde oxidoreductase, AOR-fold) family catalyzes a single type of reaction. The diversity of reactions catalyzed by each family correlates with active site variability, and also with the number of pyranopterins and their coordination by the protein. In the case of the AOR-fold enzymes, inflexibility of pyranopterin coordination correlates with their limited substrate specificity (oxidation of aldehydes). In examples of the SUOX-fold and DMSOR-fold enzymes, we observe three types of histidine-containing charge-transfer relays that can: (1) connect the piperazine ring of the pyranopterin to the substrate-binding site (SUOX-fold enzymes); (2) provide inter-pyranopterin communication (DMSOR-fold enzymes); and (3) connect a pyran ring oxygen to deeply buried water molecules (the DMSOR-fold NarGHI-type nitrate reductases). Finally, sequence data mining reveals a number of bacterial species whose predicted proteomes contain large numbers (up to 64) of Mo/W-enzymes, with the DMSOR-fold enzymes being dominant. These analyses also reveal an inverse correlation between Mo/W-enzyme content and pathogenicity.

J	Lai, CH				Lai, Chin-Hui			Applying Knowledge Flow Mining to Group Recommendation Methods for Task-Based Groups	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; collaborative filtering	DOCUMENT RECOMMENDATION; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; DISCOVERY; TRUST; NEWS; WEB	In a knowledge-intensive environment, a task in an organization is typically performed by a group of people who have task-related knowledge and expertise. Each group may require task-related knowledge of different topic domains and documents to accomplish its tasks. Document recommendation methods are very useful to resolve the information overload problem and proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs. A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow (KF) to represent the evolution of his information needs over time. However, the information needs of workers and groups may change over time, so that modeling the knowledge referencing behavior of a group of workers is difficult. Additionally, most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers' KFs, or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge. In this work, I integrate the KF mining method and propose group-based recommendation methods, including group-based collaborative filtering (GCF) and group content-based filtering (GCBF), to actively provide task-related documents for groups. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have better performance than the personalized recommendation methods in recommending the needed documents for groups. Thus, the recommended documents can fulfill the groups' task needs and facilitate knowledge sharing among groups.

Researchers have presented numerous techniques that mine and analyze execution profiles to assist software testing and other reliability enhancing approaches. Previous empirical studies have shown that the effectiveness of such techniques is likely to be impacted by the type of profiled program elements. This work further studies the impact of the characteristics of execution profiles by focusing on their size; noting that a typical profile comprises a large number of program elements, in the order of thousands or higher. Specifically, the authors devised six reduction techniques and comparatively evaluated them by measuring the following: (1) reduction rate; (2) information loss; (3) impact on two applications of dynamic program analysis, namely, cluster-based test suite minimization (App-I), and profile-based online failure and intrusion detection (App-II). The results were promising as the following: (a) the average reduction rate ranged from 92% to 98%; (b) three techniques were lossless and three were slightly lossy; (c) reducing execution profiles exhibited a major positive impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of App-I; and (d) reduction exhibited a positive impact on the efficiency of App-II, but a minor negative impact on its effectiveness.

Identification of Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy in Patients with Cirrhosis Based on White Matter Imaging and Bayesian Data Mining	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; INHIBITORY CONTROL TEST; CEREBRAL EDEMA; LIVER-DISEASE; WATER-CONTENT; ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; QUANTIFICATION; HYPONATREMIA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter abnormalities have been demonstrated to play an important role in minimal hepatic encephalopathy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether WM diffusion tensor imaging can be used to identify minimal hepatic encephalopathy among patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 65 patients with cirrhosis with covert hepatic encephalopathy (29 with minimal hepatic encephalopathy and 36 without hepatic encephalopathy). Participants underwent DTI, from which we generated mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps. We used a Bayesian machine-learning technique, called Graphical-Model-based Multivariate Analysis, to determine WM regions that characterize group differences. To further test the clinical significance of these potential biomarkers, we performed Cox regression analysis to assess the potential of these WM regions in predicting survival. RESULTS: In mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy maps, 2 spatially distributed WM regions (predominantly located in the bilateral frontal lobes, corpus callosum, and parietal lobes) were consistently identified as differentiating minimal hepatic encephalopathy from no hepatic encephalopathy and yielded 75.4%-81.5% and 83.1%-92.3% classification accuracy, respectively. We were able to follow 55 of 65 patients (median = 18 months), and 15 of these patients eventually died of liver-related causes. Survival analysis indicated that mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values in WM regions were predictive of survival, in addition to the Child-Pugh score. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that WM DTI can provide useful biomarkers differentiating minimal hepatic encephalopathy from no hepatic encephalopathy, which would be helpful for minimal hepatic encephalopathy detection and subsequent treatment.

Detection of Yarkovsky acceleration in the context of precovery observations and the future Gaia catalogue	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrometry; celestial mechanics; minor planets, asteroids: general	NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS; DYNAMICS; DRIFTS	Context. The Yarkovsky effect is a weak non-gravitational force leading to a small variation of the semi-major axis of an asteroid. Using radar measurements and astrometric observations, it is possible to measure a drift in semi-major axis through orbit determination. Aims. This paper aims to detect a reliable drift in semi-major axis of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from ground-based observations and to investigate the impact of precovery observations and the future Gaia catalogue in the detection of a secular drift in semi-major axis. Methods. We have developed a precise dynamical model of an asteroid's motion taking the Yarkovsky acceleration into account and allowing the fitting of the drift in semi-major axis. Using statistical methods, we investigate the quality and the robustness of the detection. Results. By filtering spurious detections with an estimated maximum drift depending on the asteroid's size, we found 46 NEAs with a reliable drift in semi-major axis in good agreement with the previous studies. The measure of the drift leads to a better orbit determination and constrains some physical parameters of these objects. Our results are in good agreement with the 1 / D dependence of the drift and with the expected ratio of prograde and retrograde NEAs. We show that the uncertainty of the drift mainly depends on the length of orbital arc and in this way we highlight the importance of the precovery observations and data mining in the detection of consistent drift. Finally, we discuss the impact of Gaia catalogue in the determination of drift in semi-major axis.

J	Jung, H; Chung, K				Jung, Hoill; Chung, Kyungyong			Sequential pattern profiling based bio-detection for smart health service	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Smart health service platform; Health; Data mining; Bio-detection; Sequential pattern; AprioriAll algorithm; Convergence		Due to the development of IT convergence technologies, increased attention has focused on smart health service platforms to detect emergency situations related to chronic disease, telemedicine, silvercare, and wellness. Moreover, there is a high demand for technologies that can properly judge a situation and provide suitable countermeasures or health information if an emergency situation occurs. In this paper, we propose the sequential pattern analysis based bio-detection for smart health services. A smart health service platform is able to save bio-images and their locations detected in a smart health surveillance area where CCD cameras are installed. When a person's figure is saved, the route tracing detects any movement and then traces its location. In addition, the platform analyzes the perceived bio-images and sequential patterns in order to determine whether or not the emergency situation is normal. Using AprioirAll algorithm-based sequential pattern profile analysis, bio-detection can detect a user who is undergoing an emergency based on abnormal patterns. It performs this task by managing information obtained from data and trace analyses, and it starts bio-detection only when there are patterns not conforming to sequential patterns. In other words, bio-detection detects the maximum sequence that can satisfy the minimum support in a given transaction. Sequential pattern profile analysis based on life-logs can analyze normal and abnormal profiles to provide health guidelines.

Population aging and a shift from an acute to a chronic disease with a long duration of illness have urgently necessitated healthcare service for efficient, systematic health management. Clinical decision support system (CDSS) is an integrated healthcare system that effectively guides health management and promotion, recommendation for regular health check-up, tailor-made diet therapy, health behavior change for self-care, alert service for drug interaction in patients with chronic diseases with a high prevalence. Although CDSS rule-based algorithm aids guidelines and decision making according to a single chronic disease, it is unable to inform unique characteristics of each chronic disease and suggest preventive strategies and guidelines of complex diseases. Therefore, this study proposes evolutionary rule decision making using similarity based associative chronic disease patients to normalize clinical conditions by utilizing information of each patient and recommend guidelines corresponding detailed conditions in CDSS rule-based inference. Decision making guidelines of chronic disease patients could be systematically established according to various environmental conditions using database of patients with different chronic diseases.

Parallel and distributed computing systems (e.g. multicore computing, grid computing, cloud computing,etc.), along with hybrid programming models (e.g. MapReduce, MPI, etc.), is seen a sought-after solution for accelerating data-intensive applications. One of main challenges is how to exploit these advanced technologies effectively in facilitating fundamental science discoveries such as those in Biomedical Sciences. This paper explores how MapReduce and Cloud computing can accelerate performance of data intensive applications through a real data mining use case in the Biomedical Sciences. We have first adapted the data mining task using MapReduce model and then deployed it onto the Cloud. We have built an analytic model based on the MapReduce computations to evaluate the efficiency and performance of the prototype. The results, from both experiments and the evaluation model, show the performance and scalability can be enhanced through these advanced technologies.

Mashup introduces an open environment that is exposed to many security vulnerabilities, threats and risks. These weaknesses will bring security to the forefront when developing mashup applications and will require new ways of identifying and managing said risks. The primary goal of this paper is to present a client side mashup security framework to ensure that the sources for mashup applications are tested and secured against malicious intrusions, This framework is based on risk analysis and mashup source classification that will examine, analyze and evaluate the data transitions between the server-side and the client-side. Risk filtering using data mining suggests a new data mining technique also be utilized to enhance the quality of the risk analysis by removing most of the false risks. This approach is called the Risk Filtering Data Mining algorithm (RFDM). The RFDM framework deals with three types of clusters (trusted, untrusted and hesitation or unknown) to handle the hesitation clusters. Our proposal is to employ Atanassov's Instuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (A-IFs) as it improves the results of an URL. Finally, the results would be evaluated based on five experimental measures generated by a confusion matrix, namely: Accuracy (AC), recall or true positive rate (TP), precision (P), F-measure (considers both precision and recall) and F-beta.

J	Portmess, L; Tower, S				Portmess, Lisa; Tower, Sara			Data barns, ambient intelligence and cloud computing: the tacit epistemology and linguistic representation of Big Data	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Big Data; Data analytics; Cloud computing; Political ecology; Information theory		The explosion of data grows at a rate of roughly five trillion bits a second, giving rise to greater urgency in conceptualizing the infosphere (Floridi 2011) and understanding its implications for knowledge and public policy. Philosophers of technology and information technologists alike who wrestle with ontological and epistemological questions of digital information tend to emphasize, as Floridi does, information as our new ecosystem and human beings as interconnected informational organisms, inforgs at home in ambient intelligence. But the linguistic and conceptual representations of Big Data-the massive volume of both structured and unstructured data-and the real world practice of data-mining for patterns and meaningful interpretation of evidence reveal tension and ambiguity in the bold promise of data analytics. This paper explores the tacit epistemology of the rhetoric and representation of Big Data and suggests a richer account of its ambiguities and the paradox of its real world materiality. We argue that Big Data should be recognized as manifesting multiple and conflicting trajectories that reflect human intentionality and particular patterns of power and authority. Such patterns require attentive exploration and moral appraisal if we are to resist simplistic informationist ontologies of Big Data, and the subtle forms of control in the political ecology of Big Data that undermine its promise as transformational knowledge.

Principal Component and Factor Analysis to Study Variations in the Aging Lumbar Spine	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Age related changes; data mining; dimension reduction; factor analysis; lumbar spine; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); principal component analysis	DISC DEGENERATION; AGE; MRI; SEGMENTATION; INDIVIDUALS; POPULATION; VERTEBRAE; BONE	Human spine is a multifunctional structure of human body consisting of bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles which all undergo a process of change with the age. A sudden change in these features either naturally or through injury can lead to some serious medical conditions which puts huge burden on health services and economy. While aging is inevitable, the effect of aging on different areas of spine is of clinical significance. This paper reports the growth and degenerative pattern of human spine using principal component analysis. Some noticeable lumbar spine features such as vertebral heights, disc heights, disc signal intensities, paraspinal muscles, subcutaneous fats, psoas muscles, and cerebrospinal fluid were used to study the variations seen on lumbar spine with the natural aging. These features were extracted from lumbar spine magnetic resonance images of 61 subjects with age ranging from 2 to 93 years. Principal component analysis is used to transform complex and multivariate feature space to a smaller meaningful representation. PCA transformation provided 2-D visualization and knowledge of variations among spinal features. Further useful information about correlation among the spinal features is acquired through factor analysis. The knowledge of age related changes in spinal features are important in understanding different spine related problems.	[Khan, A.

Meanwhile, based on new definitions of single health cycle and time between events, recurrent inspecting events distributed with martingale process can correspond with event-specific failure function during equipment lifecycle. On this occasion, more inspecting events can be utilized in a complete cycle to predict potential risk and assess equipment health condition. Then, stratified nonparametric PHM is employed to build the multitype recurrent events-specific failure model appropriate for competing risk problem toward interval censored. Lastly, the example in terms of transformers demonstrates the modeling procedure. Results show the well asymptotic property and goodness-of-fit tested by both of graphical and analytical methods. Compared with existing failure models, such as age-based or CBF model, this improved nonparametric regression model can mine lifecycle data acquisition from asset management system, depict the failure trend accurately considering both individual and group features, and lay the foundation for health prognosis, maintenance optimization, and asset management in power grid.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a kind of mainstream EA paradigm with a purpose of developing solutions for optimization problems. Clustering ensembles have emerged as an outstanding algorithm in machine learning to leverage the consensus across multiple clustering solutions and combines their predictions into a single solution with improved robustness, stability and accuracy. Multimedia advancement and popularity of the social Web has collectively provided an easy way to generate bulk of videos. Categorization of such Web videos has become a hot research challenge. In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Evolutionary Ensemble (SS-EE) framework for social media mining, e.g., Web Video Categorization (WVC), using their low cost textual features, intrinsic relations and extrinsic Web support. The contributions of this research work are as follows. First, we extend the traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to Semantic VSM (S-VSM) by considering the semantic similarity between the feature terms using Normalized Google Distance (NGD) approach. Second, we define a new distance measure, Triangular Similarity (TrS) between two Textual Feature Vectors (TFV) based on the frequencies of most relevant terms in each category. Third, we iterate the clustering ensemble process with the help of GA guided by a new measure, Pre-Paired Percentage (PPP), to be used as the fitness function during the genetic cycle. Fourth, in the key steps of the GA, crossover and mutation genetic operators, we define them by an intelligent mechanism of clustering ensemble. Fifth, in order to terminate the genetic cycle, we define another new measure, Clustering Quality (Cq), based on similarity matrix and clustering labels. Experiments on real world social-Web data (YouTube) have been performed to validate the SS-EE framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessment of curated phenotype mining in neuropsychiatric disorder literature	METHODS			English	Article						Data mining; Text mining; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Clinical diagnostics; Data curation; Drug therapy	ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; ASSOCIATION; DEMENTIA; ONTOLOGY; DATABASE; GENES	Clinical evaluation of patients and diagnosis of disorder is crucial to make decisions on appropriate therapies. In addition, in the case of genetic disorders resulting from gene abnormalities, phenotypic effects may guide basic research on the mechanisms of a disorder to find the mutated gene and therefore to propose novel targets for drug therapy. However, this approach is complicated by two facts. First, the relationship between genes and disorders is not simple: one gene may be related to multiple disorders and a disorder may be caused by mutations in different genes. Second, recognizing relevant phenotypes might be difficult for clinicians working with patients of closely related complex disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders best illustrate these difficulties since phenotypes range from metabolic to behavioral aspects, the latter extremely complex. Based on our clinical expertise on five neurodegenerative disorders, and from the wealth of bibliographical data on neuropsychiatric disorders, we have built a resource to infer associations between genes, chemicals, phenotypes for a total of 31 disorders. An initial step of automated text mining of the literature related to 31 disorders returned thousands of enriched terms. Fewer relevant phenotypic terms were manually selected by clinicians as relevant to the five neural disorders of their expertise and used to analyze the complete set of disorders. Analysis of the data indicates general relationships between neuropsychiatric disorders, which can be used to classify and characterize them. Correlation analyses allowed us to propose novel associations of genes and drugs with disorders. More generally, the results led us to uncovering mechanisms of disease that span multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, for example that genes related to synaptic transmission and receptor functions tend to be involved in many disorders, whereas genes related to sensory perception and channel transport functions are associated with fewer disorders. Our study shows that starting from expertise covering a limited set of neurological disorders and using text and data mining methods, meaningful and novel associations regarding genes, chemicals and phenotypes can be derived for an expanded set of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results are intended for clinicians to help them evaluate patients, and for basic scientists to propose new gene targets for drug therapies. This strategy can be extended to virtually all diseases and takes advantage of the ever increasing amount of biomedical literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A novel, objective, quantitative method of evaluation of the back pain component using comparative computerized multi-parametric tactile mapping before/after spinal cord stimulation and database analysis: The "Neuro-Pain't" software	NEUROCHIRURGIE			English	Article						Back Pain; Pain mapping; Spinal cord stimulation; Surface coverage; Efficacy/Specificity; Data mining	DRAWINGS; SURGERY	Introduction. - One of the major challenges of neurostimulation is actually to address the back pain component in patients suffering from refractory chronic back and leg pain. Facing a tremendous expansion of neurostimulation techniques and available devices, implanters and patients can still remain confused as they need to select the right tool for the right indication. To be able to evaluate and compare objectively patient outcomes, depending on therapeutical strategies, it appears essential to develop a rational and quantitative approach to pain assessment for those who undergo neurostimulation implantation. Objectives, material and methods. - We developed a touch screen interface, in Poitiers University Hospital and N-3 Lab, called the "Neuro-PainT", to detect, record and quantify the painful area surface and intensity changes in an implanted patient within time. The second aim of this software is to analyse the link between a paraesthesia coverage generated by a type of neurostimulation and a potential analgesic effect, measured by pain surface reduction, pain intensity reduction within the painful surface and local change in pain characteristics distribution. The third aim of Neuro-PainT is to correlate these clinical parameters to global patient data and functional outcome analysis, via a network database (Neuro-Database), to be able to provide a concise but objective approach of the neurostimulation efficacy, summarized by an index called "RFG Index". Results and discussion. - This software has been used in more than 190 patients since 2012, leading us to define three clinical parameters grouped as a clinical component of the RFG Index, which might be helpful to assess neurostimulation efficacy and compare implanted devices. Conclusion. - The Neuro-PainT is an original software designed to objectively and quantitatively characterize reduction of a painful area in a given individual, in terms of intensity. surface and pain typology, in	[Rigoard, P.; Nivole, K.; Blouin, P.; Monlezun, O.; Roulaud, M.; Lorgeoux, B.; Guetarni, F.] Univ Poitiers Hosp, Lab Neuromodulat & Neural Networks N3, F-86000 Poitiers, France; [Rigoard, P.; Monlezun, O.; Roulaud, M.; Lorgeoux, B.; Bataille, B.] Univ Poitiers Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, F-86000 Poitiers, France	Guetarni, F (reprint author), Serv Neurochirurg, Lab N3, Unite Rachis & Neurostimulat, 2 Rue Mil, F-86021 Poitiers, France.	f.guetarni@chu-poitiers.fr			Medtronic Inc & St Jude Medical	Dr Rigoard is a consultant for Medtronic Inc.

Proposal of an international clinical network using an integrated database and health economic analysis: The proback network	NEUROCHIRURGIE			English	Article						Failed back surgery syndrome; Neurostimulation; Database; Data mining; Outcome predictors; Networku de cliniciens	SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL-MANAGEMENT; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MULTICENTER	Introduction. - In the context of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) treatment, the current practice in neurostimulation varies from center-to-center and most clinical decisions are based on an individual diagnosis. Neurostimulation evaluation tools and pain relief assessement are of major concern, as they now constitute one of the main biases of clinical trials. Moreover, the proliferation of technological devices, in a fertile and unsatisfied market, fosters and only furthers the confusion. There are three options available to apply scientific debates to our daily neurostimulation practice: intentional ignorance, standardized evidence-based practice or alternative data mining approach. Objective. - In view of the impossibility of conducting multiple randomized clinical trials comparing various devices, one by one, the proposed concept would be to redefine the indications and the respective roles of the various spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation devices with large-scale computational modeling/data mining approach, by conducting a multicenter prospective database registry, supported by a clinician's global network called "PROBACK". Methods. - We chose to specifically analyze 6 parameters: device coverage performance/coverage selectivity/persistence of the long-term electrical response (technical criteria) and comparative mapping of patient pain relief/persistence of the long-term clinical response/safety and complications occurrence (clinical criteria). Two types of analysis will be performed: immediate analysis (including cost analysis) and computational analysis, i.e. demonstration of the robustness of certain correlations of variables, in order to extract response predictors. Discussion/conclusion. - By creating an international prospective database, the purpose of the PROBACK project was to set up a process of extraction and comparative analysis of data derived from the selection, implantation and follow-up of FBSS patients candidates for implanted neurostimulation. This evaluation strategy should help to change the opinions of each implanter and each health system towards a more rational decision-making approach subtended by mathematical reality.

Association rule mining through adaptive parameter control in particle swarm optimization	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Association rule mining; Evolutionary computation; Particle swarm optimization; Adaptive PSO; Estimation of evolution state	ACCELERATION COEFFICIENTS; ALGORITHM; ADAPTATION	Association rule mining is a data mining task on a great deal of academic research has been done and many algorithms are proposed. Association rule mining is treated as a twofold process by most of the methods. It increases the complexity of the system and takes up more time and space. Evolutionary Computation (EC) are fast growing search based optimization method for association rule mining. Among ECs particle swarm optimization (PSO) is more suited for mining association rules. The bottleneck of PSO is setting the precise values for their control parameters. Setting values to the control parameter is done either through parameter tuning or parameter control. This paper proposes an adaptive methodology for the control parameters in PSO namely, acceleration coefficients and inertia weight based on estimation of evolution state and fitness value respectively. Both of the proposed adaptive methods when tested on five datasets from University of California Irvine (UCI) repository proved to generate association rules with better accuracy and rule measures compared to simple PSO.

To help users understand the data to be searched, in this work we investigate the problem of frequent co-occurring terms (FCTs) in large relational data. By returning a set of most FCTs with the given keywords, we can provide a chance for users to see a big picture of relevant data information. The investigation of FCT problem is also one of the fundamental building blocks of data mining because the discovered FCTs can be employed to analyze the topics or contexts of user interest. Although the problem of FCTs computation was proposed and investigated in Tao and Yu [(2009) Finding Frequent Co-Occurring Terms in Relational Keyword Search. 12th Int. Conf. Extending Database Technology EDBT, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, March 23-26, pp. 839-850. ACM, New York, USA], further investigation is needed to improve the performance because FCT computation is very expensive. Especially for the increasing volume of data, the centralized approach in Tao and Yu [(2009) Finding Frequent Co-Occurring Terms in Relational Keyword Search. 12th Int. Conf. Extending Database Technology EDBT, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, March 23-26, pp. 839-850. ACM, New York, USA] may incur a big challenge on the efficiency of performing an FCT computation. To do this, we investigate how to perform parallel FCT computation using MapReduce which is a well-accepted framework for data-intensive applications over clusters of computers. We design an effective mapping mechanism that exploits the approximately maximal workload of FCT computation for balancing the computational cost of each processor, while reducing the shuffling cost and avoiding the data-skewness. Analytical and experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed approach using TPC-H benchmark datasets with different sizes.

High-resolution mass spectrometric metabolite profiling of a novel synthetic designer drug, N-(adamantan-1-yl)-1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamide (STS-135), using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and assessment of metabolic stability with human liver microsomes	DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						STS-135; high resolution mass spectrometry; human hepatocytes; metabolism; synthetic cannabinoids	URINARY METABOLITES; LC-MS/MS; QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT; CANNABINOIDS JWH-018; NEUTRAL ANTAGONIST; SMOKING MIXTURES; IDENTIFICATION; GAS; EXTRACTION; RECEPTORS	N-(Adamantan-1-yl)-1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamide (STS-135) is a new synthetic cannabinoid in herbal incense products discussed on Internet drug user forums and identified in police seizures. To date, there are no STS-135 clinical or in vitro studies identifying STS-135 metabolites. However, characterizing STS-135 metabolism is critical because synthetic cannabinoid metabolites can possess pharmacological activity and parent compounds are rarely detectable in urine. To characterize the metabolite profile, human hepatocytes were incubated with 10 mu mol/L STS-135 for up to 3 h. High-resolution mass spectrometry with software-assisted data mining identified 29 STS-135 metabolites. Less than 25% of STS-135 parent compound remained after 3 h incubation. Primary metabolites were generated by mono-, di- or trihydroxylation with and without ketone formation, dealkylation, and oxidative defluorination of N-fluoropentyl side chain or possible oxidation to carboxylic acid, some of them further glucuronidated. Hydroxylations occurred mainly on the aliphatic adamantane ring and less commonly on the N-pentyl side chain. At 1 h, phase I metabolites predominated, while at 3 h, phase II metabolites were present in higher amounts. The major metabolites were monohydroxy STS-135 (M25) and dihydroxy STS-135 (M21), both hydroxylated on the adamantane system. Moreover, metabolic stability of STS-135 (1 mu mol/L) was assessed in human liver microsomes experiments. The in vitro half-life of STS-135 was 3.10.2 min and intrinsic clearance (CLint) was 208.8 mL center dot min(-1)center dot kg(-1). This is the first report characterizing STS-135 hepatic metabolic pathways. These data provide potential urinary targets to document STS-135 intake in clinical and forensic settings and potential candidates for pharmacological testing.

The available data on installed capacity, level voltage, type of renewable technology and geographical location the renewable energy potential for electricity generation was mapped into representative zones using K-Means clustering algorithm. For each zone, the potential was assessed on voltage level and renewable energy generation technologies (wind, solar, hydro, biogas, biomass, and cogeneration). The zones obtained can be a useful working tool for retrofitting substations, upgrading of transmission and distribution lines and also for redesigning them at different parameters with respect to the overload.

This study evaluated the contribution of EHR and HIE networks to physicians by investigating whether health information technology can lead to more efficient admission decisions by reducing redundant admissions in the stressful environment of emergency. Log-files were retrieved from an integrative and interoperable EHR that serves seven main Israeli hospitals. The analysis was restricted to a group of patients seen in the emergency departments who were administered a Creatinine test. The assessment of the contribution of EHR to admission decisions used various statistical analyses and track log-file analysis. We showed that using the EHR contributes to more efficient admission decisions and reduces the number of avoidable admissions. In particular, there was a reduction in readmissions when patient history was viewed. Using EHR can help respond to the international problem of avoidable hospital readmissions.

These systems mine association rules in software revision histories. However, mining coarse-grained rules using only edit histories produces recommendations with low accuracy, and can only produce recommendations after a developer edits a file. In this work, we explore the use of finer-grained association rules, based on the insight that view histories help characterize the contexts of files to edit. To leverage this additional context and fine-grained association rules, we have developed MI, a recommendation system extending ROSE, an existing edit-based recommendation system. We then conducted a comparative simulation of ROSE and MI using the interaction histories stored in the Eclipse Bugzilla system. The simulation demonstrates that MI predicts the files to edit with significantly higher recommendation accuracy than ROSE (about 63 over 35 percent), and makes recommendations earlier, often before developers begin editing. Our results clearly demonstrate the value of considering both views and edits in systems to recommend files to edit, and results in more accurate, earlier, and more flexible recommendations.

To reduce the labeling effort needed in the data collection phase, active learning is often applied in streaming scenarios, where a learning algorithm is allowed to select new examples to be manually labeled in order to improve the learner's performance. Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing. The advanced features of ClowdFlows are demonstrated on a sentiment analysis use case, using active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to microblogging data streams.

Two approaches were used for microsatellite typing: data mining in expressed sequence tag /open reading frame expressed sequence tags libraries and PCR-based Isolation of Microsatellite Arrays from genomic libraries. All microsatellites found were evaluated for their abundance, frequency and usefulness as markers. Genotyping of T. rangeli strains and clones was performed for 18 loci amplified by PCR from expressed sequence tag/open reading frame expressed sequence tags libraries. The presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the nuclear, multi-copy, spliced leader gene was assessed in 18 T. rangeli strains, and the results show that T. rangeli has a predominantly clonal population structure, allowing a robust phylogenetic analysis. Microsatellite typing revealed a subdivision of the KP1(-) genetic group, which may be influenced by geographical location and/or by the co-evolution of parasite and vectors occurring within the same geographical areas. The hypothesis of parasite-vector co-evolution was corroborated by single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the spliced leader gene. Taken together, the results suggest three T. rangeli groups: (i) the T. rangeli Amazonian group; (ii) the T. rangeli KP1(-) group; and (iii) the T. rangeli KP1(+) group. The latter two groups possibly evolved from the Amazonian group to produce KP1(+) and KP1(-) strains. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A novel method is proposed for low-rank matrix recovery, targeting at higher recovery accuracy and stronger theoretical guarantee. Specifically, the proposed method is based on a nonconvex optimization model, by solving the low-rank matrix which can be recovered from the noisy observation. To solve the model, an effective algorithm is derived by minimizing over the variables alternately. It is proved theoretically that this algorithm has stronger theoretical guarantee than the existing work. In natural image denoising experiments, the proposed method achieves lower recovery error than the two compared methods. The proposed low-rank matrix recovery method is also applied to solve two real-world problems, i.e., removing noise from verification code and removing watermark from images, in which the images recovered by the proposed method are less noisy than those of the two compared methods.

In this paper, a novel system, MrKIP, is proposed to recognize rootkits based on their kernel-level activities. Our scheme semiautomatically generates suitable locations for analysts to implement checkpoints, which are used to profile kernel-space activities. Then, collected rootkits are executed in an emulator with these checkpoints for behavior profiling. The collected behaviors are clustered and used for model construction. The constructed model can be used to recognize new variants of rootkit families. Our scheme differs from conventional tracers due to its ability to cover kernel-space malware and the whole-system scope. In addition, monitoring at the kernel level raises high barrier for malware to evade, since all tasks are eventually executed through the basic kernel functions.

In prior work, several efficient mining algorithms were proposed to explore substitution rules. However, all the methods may produce redundant substitution rules. Therefore, this paper discusses the problem of mining non-redundant substitution rules and proposes the NRM (non-redundant substitution rules mining) algorithm as a solution. A substitution rule is said to be non-redundant if the provided information is not covered by other rules. To make the mining process more efficient, the property of frequent closed patterns is utilized and three lemmas are proposed to prune redundant substitution rides. Our experimental results show that the performance of NRM algorithm is superior to that of naive apriori-based approaches	[Chen, Yi-Chun] Inst Informat Ind, Adv Res Inst, Taipei 105, Taiwan; [Lee, Guanling] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Hualien 974, Taiwan	Chen, YC (reprint author), Inst Informat Ind, Adv Res Inst, Taipei 105, Taiwan.	divienchen@iii.org.tw; guanling@mail.ndhu.edu.tw			National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 101-2221-E-259-002]	This research was partially supported by National Science Council, Taiwan under Contract No. NSC 101-2221-E-259-002.		17	0	0	INST INFORMATION SCIENCE	TAIPEI	ACADEMIA SINICA, TAIPEI 115, TAIWAN	1016-2364			J INF SCI ENG	J.

Early and precise detection of genetic mutations is a demanding task in the field of bioinformatics and molecular biology, while the accurate identification of rescue mutations presents great therapeutic remedies. In this research investigation, our aim is to identify potential P53 cancer -causing mutants and predict possible rescue mutations at secondary -site DNA binding domains. We highlight the impact of data mining techniques on predicting the active and inactive P53 mutant status based on the amino-acid substitutions at the DNA-binding sites. A collection of 16772 cancer cases related to P53 mutations, have been explored to detect and categorize the P53 cancer mutants and their rescue mutants in silico through Data Mining techniques. We have identified fifty-four P53 cancer mutants and report new rescue mutants for thirteen existing hot spot P53 cancer mutants. Identification of new rescue mutants is expected to offer remarkable advancement in the field of cancer therapy targeting drugs to specifically restore normal P53 transcriptional activity.	[Jacob, S.

Exploring soil databases: a self-organizing map approach	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						soil quality databases; self-organizing map; data mining	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; QUALITY; CLUSTER	A soil quality database (SQDB) is a collection of soil samples described by a given set of parameters, allowing farmers, scientists and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about practices, processes and policies for soil use and management. If each parameter is considered as a dimension of the space spanned by the SQDB, extracting information becomes a difficult task when the number of parameters is >3. A widely used approach to explore multidimensional data sets is the self-organizing map (SOM) method, which is suitable for clustering, visualization and extraction of information from multidimensional data. We applied the SOM method as an exploratory technique to an unlabelled SQDB to extract knowledge - data patterns and data associations - from the data set (the time and location of each sample were unknown). The SQDB used in this study is a set of 1240 unlabelled samples within the Central Valley of Chile, covering ca 7500km(2). The predominant soils are Andisols with a large organic matter content (7-12%), small bulk densities (0.6-1.0g/cm(3)) and large water-holding capacity. We identified three patterns: (i) isolated region within the map with close neurons (smooth transitions), (ii) two or more regions with predominantly large or small values and (iii) homogeneous map with small values with an isolated region of large values. These patterns show that the data set represented more than two groups that were not necessarily related. For pH, no important associations with other investigated parameters were observed. Previous studies carried out by the local agricultural research station showed that pH values below 5.5 constrain nutrient uptake. Thus, locations presenting pH<5,5 should be subject to seasonal monitoring to assess management practices that mitigate soil acidity. The component plane for organic matter indicates that ca. 50% of the soil samples had contents <8% related to soil series characteristics and management practices. As the k-means is initialized by random partitions, the two-step approach (clustering the map representing the input data) is less sensitive to variations in the input data (subsamples) than is the direct application of k-means to the input data, but it also reduces the computational cost. The ability of SOMs to visualize multidimensional data sets helps gain an understanding of the data in the exploratory phase, such as the association and integration of physical, chemical and biological parameters.

Their densities are estimated using Gaussian kernel density estimation, the top 5 000 spectra in descend order by their densities are selected as rare objects, and the top 300 000 spectra in ascend order by their densities are selected as normal objects. Then, KNN were used to classify the rest objects, and simultaneously K nearest neighbors of the 5 000 rare spectra are also selected as rare objects. As a result, there are totally 21 193 spectra selected as initial rare spectra, which include error spectra caused by deletion, redden, bad calibration, spectra consisting of different physically irrelevant components, planetary nebulas, QSOs, special white dwarfs (DZ, DQ, DC), carbon stars, white dwarf main-sequence binaries (WDMS), cataclysmic variable (CV) stars and so on. By cross identification with SIMBAD, NED, ADS and major literature, it is found that three DZ white dwarfs, one WDMS, two CVs with company of G-type star, three CVs candidates, six DC white dwarfs, one DC white dwarf candidate and one BL Lacertae (BL lac) candidate are our new findings. We also have found one special DA white dwarf with emission lines of Ca II triple and Mg I, and one unknown object whose spectrum looks like a late M star with emission lines and its image looks like a galaxy or nebula.

HCV exploits complex molecular mechanisms, which result in a high degree of intrahost genetic heterogeneity. This high degree of variability represents a challenge for the accurate establishment of genetic relatedness between cases and complicates the identification of sources of infection. Tracking HCV infections is crucial for the elucidation of routes of transmission in a variety of settings. Therefore, implementation of HCV advanced molecular surveillance (AMS) is essential for disease control. Accounting for virulence is also important for HCV AMS and both viral and host factors contribute to the disease outcome. Therefore, HCV AMS requires the incorporation of host factors as an integral component of the algorithms used to monitor disease occurrence. Importantly, implementation of comprehensive global databases and data mining are also needed for the proper study of the mechanisms responsible for HCV transmission. Here, we review molecular aspects associated with HCV transmission, as well as the most recent technological advances used for virus and host characterization. Additionally, the cornerstone discoveries that have defined the pathway for viral characterization are presented and the importance of implementing advanced HCV molecular surveillance is highlighted.

A high shear granulation process is often assumed to be well mixed and is represented using a single compartment PBM. However, the inhomogeneities existent within the granulator are not effectively addressed using the single PBM representation for the process. Thus, a multi-compartment model is needed to account for the inhomogeneities within the granulator. In this study, the multiple compartments are identified from data mining methods (e.g. clustering) and their average values are thereby obtained. Using regression analysis, a general expression is obtained for the size of the compartments and the average values for different operating conditions. These expressions are then used within a multi-compartment PBM formulation to describe the process dynamics. Validation for the regression expressions also showed good agreement against the varying operating conditions. Also, the multi-compartment model is able to account for mechanical dispersion behaviors that is typically associated with a high-shear process. This study shows that the assumption of a single compartment for a high-shear granulator is often inadequate and the multi-compartment based approach can offer a better physical representation of the process.

A word may have several meanings, but WSD is the task of selecting the correct sense of a polysemous word based on its context. Proposed solutions are based on supervised and unsupervised learning methods. The majority of researchers in the area focused on choosing proper size of 'n' in n-gram that is used for WSD problem. In this research, the concept has been taken to a new level by using variable 'n' and variable size window. The concept is based on the iterative patterns extracted from the text. We show that this type of sequential pattern is more effective than many other solutions for WSD. Using regular data mining algorithms on the extracted features, we significantly outperformed most monolingual WSD solutions. The state-of-the-art results were obtained using external knowledge like various translations of the same sentence. Our method improved the accuracy of the multilingual system more than 4 percent, although we were using monolingual features.

We record different user's actions such as clicks, search queries and pageviews. We use the collected information to estimate in real time the probability of a click on a banner. Each click on a banner generates a profit. Our goal is to maximize the overall profit. We use a naive Bayesian model. We keep track of the click frequencies of the different banners under the additional information provided by the actions that each user has performed. We apply our strategy on real data in which we simply use the hours during which a user is connected as a feature. We describe the results obtained on these real data that give support to the effectiveness of our strategy. Moreover we describe some heuristics to improve the estimate of the click frequencies and to avoid displaying the same banner to the same user too many times.

The explosive growth in the amount of public domain-available chemical and biological data has generated huge effort to design, analyze, and apply novel learning methodologies. Here, I focus on machine-learning techniques within the context of ligand-based VS (LBVS). In addition, I analyze several relevant VS studies from recent publications, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in this field and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.

Hydrologic data of flash flood events in the Lan-Yang River basin in Taiwan were used for the case study. Various percentages (from 50% to 10%) of hydrologic data, including those for flood stage and rainfall data, were mined and used as informative data to characterize a flood hydrograph. Information on these mined hydrologic data sets was quantified using entropy indices, namely marginal entropy, joint entropy, transinformation, and conditional entropy. Analytical results obtained using the entropy indices proved that the mined informative data could be hydrologically interpreted and have a meaningful explanation based on information entropy. Estimates of marginal and joint entropies showed that, in view of flood forecasting, the flood stage was a more informative variable than rainfall. In addition, hydrologic models with variables containing more total information were preferable to variables containing less total information. Analysis results of transinformation explained that approximately 30% of information on the flood stage could be derived from the upstream flood stage and 10% to 20% from the rainfall. Elucidating the mined hydrologic data by applying information theory enabled using the entropy indices to interpret various hydrologic processes.

Combining population and spatial data allows for socio-graphic information to be visualized, in order to evaluate the total numbers of people at risk of environmental health hazards, who have died in natural disasters etc. Therefore, spatial distribution of population data is an effective way to integrate statistical and spatial data. This paper presents a multi-factor data fusion modeling method for population estimation, which is based on spatial relationships that determine the factors affecting population distribution. The factors that have a strong correlation with population distribution in the Hebei Province were extracted using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Their standardized weight coefficients were factored as weight coefficients of population distribution in a given spatial unit. The unit (1 km x 1 km) population database was established, allowing for the computation of the relevant population data error. The accuracy of the map was then assessed by comparing predicted population data with that collected from the local government. The results show that the population correlated with geographical factors. The population of the Hebei Province was distributed heterogeneously, increasing from the northwest to southeast. There was relatively low population density in the Taihang Mountains in the west and in the Yanshan Mountains in the northeast, with less than 100 people per square kilometer. The population density in the central Hebei Province was higher, with about 2,000 people per square kilometer, which was higher and denser than that in Handan, Shijiazhuang, Langfang, and Tangshan. These findings may be important for data mining (DM), Decision-making Support Systems (DSS), and regional sustainable development.

Based on human IQ calculations, the paper first establishes a 2014 Internet Intelligence Scale and designs an intelligence test bank regarding search engines. Then, an intelligence test using such test bank is carried out on 50 typical search engines from 25 countries and regions across the world. Meanwhile, another intelligence test is also conducted in the human age groups of 6, 12 and 18 years using the same test bank and rules. Next, the absolute IQ and the relative IQ of the 53 test subjects are calculated in accordance with the test results. Finally, the data mining method is applied to find out the features of search engines reflected in the Internet intelligence test and the intelligence difference between search engines and human beings.

With the growing amount of ageing-related data available on the web, in particular concerning the genetics of ageing, it is timely to apply data mining methods to that data, in order to try to discover novel patterns that may assist ageing research. In this work, we introduce new hierarchical feature selection methods for the classification task of data mining and apply them to ageing-related data from four model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), and Mus musculus (mouse). The main novel aspect of the proposed feature selection methods is that they exploit hierarchical relationships in the set of features (Gene Ontology terms) in order to improve the predictive accuracy of the Naive Bayes and 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN) classifiers, which are used to classify model organisms' genes into pro-longevity or anti-longevity genes. The results show that our hierarchical feature selection methods, when used together with Naive Bayes and 1-NN classifiers, obtain higher predictive accuracy than the standard (without feature selection) Naive Bayes and 1-NN classifiers, respectively. We also discuss the biological relevance of a number of Gene Ontology terms very frequently selected by our algorithms in our datasets.

Over the past decades, various new clustering techniques have been developed based on modelling PPIs as binary relations. Non-binary information of co-complex relations (prey/bait) in PPIs data derived from tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) experiments has been unfairly disregarded. In this paper, we propose a Biased Random Walk based algorithm for detecting protein complexes from TAP-MS data, resulting in the random walk with restarting baits (RWRB). RWRB is developed based on Random walk with restart. The main contribution of RWRB is the incorporation of co-complex relations in TAP-MS PPI networks into the clustering process, by implementing a new restarting strategy during the process of random walk. Through experimentation on un-weighted and weighted TAP-MS data sets, we validated biological significance of our results by mapping them to manually curated complexes. Results showed that, by incorporating non-binary, co-membership information, significant improvement has been achieved in terms of both statistical measurements and biological relevance. Better accuracy demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art clustering algorithms for the detection of protein complexes in TAP-MS data.

Cloud computing storage services are an economical approach to dealing with such volumes of data. In cloud storage situations, data encryption and access control are commonly used for the protection of data. Full data encryption is able to ensure privacy; however, this approach makes it difficult to analyze the data in an efficient manner. Data analysis in a cloud environment requires a balance between data security and data analysis capacity. This study proposes a high-efficiency, privacy-preservation scheme for data distribution in hybrid clouds to improve data protection, expand the availability of data, and reduce cloud system resources consumption. Data classification and selective data protection mechanisms are also addressed. Results of functional analysis and comparison revealed that the proposed scheme reduces the time required for encryption and decryption by as much as 82.76% and decreases the number of privacy content by up to 92.5% while allowing data mining without compromising privacy.

In this study, an analysis of genome-wide association study data using data mining algorithms has revealed single-nucleotide polymorphisms that may be the basis for the molecular etiology of bipolar disorders. Methods: The study was conducted as a case-control study, and data from the Whole Genome Association Study of Bipolar Disorder (dbGaP Study Accession: phs000017.v3.p1) were used. The goal of the project was to identify genes that make individuals more susceptible to bipolar disorders. The data set included 1767 controls and 653 bipolar disorder only cases. Genotyping data were generated by Affymetrix Affy 6.0. A total of 934,940 oligos were scanned. Results: Various data mining approaches have identified 6 common SNPs which also have a statistically higher importance than others (rs10415145, rs10857580, rs11023096, rs4654814, rs4792189, rs7569781). rs10415145 is located on chromosome 19 at 19q13.11 and is related to ZNF507 (Zinc Finger Protein 507). While there are no publications reporting ZNF507 in bipolar disorders, a few publications exist studying other zinc finger protein genes. In addition, because it had the highest regulome score, DOCK10 was found to be a potentially related gene. Conclusion: Zinc finger protein genes may play a role in the etiology of bipolar disorders. More detailed studies would help clarify this relation and describe its pathway.

In terms of the envisioned methodologies, those catchphrases tend to emphasize the role of predictive analytics, that is, statistical techniques including data mining and machine learning, as well as supercomputing. Interestingly, however, while this perspective takes the availability of data as a given, it does not answer the question how one would discover the required data in today's chaotic information universe, how one would understand which data sets can be meaningfully integrated, and how to communicate the results to humans and machines alike. The semantic web addresses these questions. In the following, we argue why the data train needs semantic rails. We point out that making sense of data and gaining new insights work best if inductive and deductive techniques go hand-in-hand instead of competing over the prerogative of interpretation.

Statistical learning for variable annuity policyholder withdrawal behavior	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						variable annuity; feature selection; machine learning; Bayesian network; rotation forest; data mining		The variable annuity product has many desirable features for retirement saving purposes, such as stock-linked growth potential, protection against losses in the investment, and guarantees of minimum payout amount at annuitization. Therefore, it is of great interest to study this product for designing next generation retirement solutions. Policyholder behavior is one of the most important profit or loss factors for the variable annuity product, and insurance companies generally do not have sophisticated models at the current time. This paper will discuss a new approach using modern statistical learning techniques to model policyholder withdrawal behavior with promising results. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Jackson, B; Lorenz, R				Jackson, Brian; Lorenz, Ralph			A multiyear dust devil vortex survey using an automated search of pressure time series	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						dust devils; convective vortices; in situ instrumentation; data mining; planetary atmospheres	MARS; VORTICES; FREQUENCY; DROPS; EARTH	Dust devils occur in arid climates on the Earth and ubiquitously on Mars, where they likely dominate the supply of atmospheric dust and influence climate. Martian dust devils have been studied with a combination of orbiting and landed spacecraft, while most studies of terrestrial dust devils have involved manned monitoring of field sites, which can be costly both in time and personnel. As an alternative approach, we describe a multiyear in situ survey of terrestrial dust devils using pressure loggers deployed at El Dorado Playa in Nevada, USA, a site known for dust devil activity. Analogous to previous surveys for Martian dust devils, we conduct a posthoc analysis of the barometric data to search for putative dust devil pressure dips using a new automated detection algorithm. We investigate the completeness and false positive rates of our new algorithm and conduct several statistically robust analyses of the resulting population of dips. We also investigate possible seasonal, annual, and spatial variability of the putative dust devil dips, possible correlations with precipitation, and the influence of sample size on the derived population statistics. Our results suggest that large numbers of dips (>1000) collected over multiple seasons are probably required for accurate assessment of the underlying dust devil population. Correlating long-term barometric time series with other data streams (e.g., solar flux measurements from photovoltaic cells) can uniquely elucidate the natures and origins of dust devils, and accurately assessing their influence requires consideration of the full distribution of dust devil properties, rather than average values.

Existing anti-phishing tools lack the accuracy and generalizability needed to protect Internet users and organizations from the myriad of attacks encountered daily. Consequently, users often disregard these tools' warnings. In this study, using a design science approach, we propose a novel method for detecting phishing websites. By adopting a genre theoretic perspective, the proposed genre tree kernel method utilizes fraud cues that are associated with differences in purpose between legitimate and phishing websites, manifested through genre composition and design structure, resulting in enhanced anti-phishing capabilities. To evaluate the genre tree kernel method, a series of experiments were conducted on a testbed encompassing thousands of legitimate and phishing websites. The results revealed that the proposed method provided significantly better detection capabilities than state-of-the-art anti-phishing methods. An additional experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of the genre tree kernel technique in user settings; users utilizing the method were able to better identify and avoid phishing websites, and were consequently less likely to transact with them. Given the extensive monetary and social ramifications associated with phishing, the results have important implications for future anti-phishing strategies. More broadly, the results underscore the importance of considering intention/purpose as a critical dimension for automated credibility assessment: focusing not only on the "what" but rather on operationalizing the "why" into salient detection cues.

In this study, we demonstrate several of the capabilities of the ViTA-Lab framework through the exploration of renal-damage risk factors in patients with diabetes type II. Materials and methods The ViTA-Lab framework combines data-driven temporal data mining techniques, with interactive, query-driven, visual analytical capabilities, to support, in an integrated fashion, an iterative investigation of time-oriented clinical data and of patterns discovered in them. Patterns discovered through the data mining mode can be explored visually, and vice versa. Both analysis modes are supported by a rich underlying ontology of clinical concepts, their relations, and their temporal properties. The knowledge enables us to apply a temporal-abstraction pre-processing phase that abstracts in a context-sensitive manner raw time-stamped data into interval-based clinically meaningful interpretations, increasing the results' significance. We demonstrate our approach through the exploration of risk factors associated with future renal damage (micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria) and their relationship to the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and creatinine level concepts, in the longitudinal records of 22 000 patients with diabetes type II followed for up to 5 years. Results The iterative ViTA-Lab analysis process was highly feasible. Higher ranges of either normal albuminuria or normal creatinine values and their combination were shown to be significantly associated with future micro-albuminuria and macro-albuminuria. The risk increased given high HbA1C levels for women in the lower range of normal albuminuria, and for men in the higher range of albuminuria. Conclusions The ViTA-Lab framework can potentially serve as a virtual laboratory for investigations of large masses of longitudinal clinical databases, for discovery of new knowledge through interactive exploration, clustering, classification, and prediction.

A primary phenotype was defined from actual patient profiles in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. Network visualizations depicting primary relationships were compared to those incorporating secondary adjacencies. Interactivity was enabled through a phenotype visualization software concept: the Phenomics Advisor. Subendocardial infarction with cardiac arrest was demonstrated as a sample phenotype; there were 332 primarily adjacent diagnoses, with 5423 relationships. Primary network visualization suggested a treatment-related complication phenotype and several rare diagnoses; re-clustering by secondary relationships revealed an emergent cluster of smokers with the metabolic syndrome. Network visualization reveals phenotypic patterns that may have remained occult in pairwise correlation analysis. Visualization of complex data, potentially offered as point-of-care tools on mobile devices, may allow clinicians and researchers to quickly generate hypotheses and gain deeper understanding of patient subpopulations.

And the TP determination models were respectively developed for large leaf cultivars, middle leaf cultivars and all the cultivars. Interval partial least squares (iPLS) was proposed to extract and optimize feature from full-spectrum data. Regression models were respectively established based on PLS, iPLS and biPLS. Modeling results showed that the model based on the biPLS with the optimal subinterval selection (2452-dimensional wavenumbers) outperformed the other models, and the optimal regression model was obtained with high validation correlation of 0.9059, and low RMSE of 1.0277. On the basis of the optimal subinterval selection from biPLS, a further excavation of characteristic wavenumber was done by random frog. Thus, 18 optimal wavenumbers were selected for the TP determination, and the corresponding linear formula of the TP measurement was established. The results proved the feasibility of infrared' spectra for measurement of the TP content of tea. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both copepods and ciliates have a crucial linkage role in constituting the marine food web. Analyzing the predator-prey interactions between these two species helps us to understand the productivity of oceans better. In this study, we explored the interactive patterns between copepods and ciliates and used the locomotion indicator net-to-gross displacement ratio (NGDR) to conduct quantitative analyses on the swimming patterns of copepods. We discovered that the movement trails of copepods are more distorted in undisturbed environments where the NGDR was significantly lower. In an environment where dilates were present, the NGDR of copepods was significantly higher. This result indicated that the movement trails in the latter scenario were more linear and that the NGDR can clearly distinguish the swimming patterns of copepods. In addition, this study developed a qualitative motion description to be embedded in the interactive trail data of copepods and ciliates, which facilitates the data mining technologies needed to perform advanced analyses. The results of the association rules and decision tree analyses clearly demonstrated the interactive characteristics that could not be explored solely using locomotion indicators. The most obvious characteristic is that the swimming patterns employed by copepods to approach ciliates were either a downward vertical sinking or a horizontal movement Upward movements for the copepods were not typically observed. More detailed swimming patterns of interactions between copepods and ciliates were revealed using the rule-based forms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A knowledge discovery process for spatiotemporal data: Application to river water quality monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data mining; Spatiotemporal databases; Sequential patterns; Water management	PATTERNS; DATABASES	Rapid population growth and human activity (such as agriculture, industry, transports,...) development have increased vulnerability risk for water resources. Due to the complexity of natural processes and the numerous interactions between hydro-systems and human pressures, water quality is difficult to be quantified. In this context, we present a knowledge discovery process applied to hydrological data. To achieve this objective, we combine successive methods to extract knowledge on data collected at stations located along several rivers. Firstly, data is pre-processed in order to obtain different spatial proximities. Later, we apply a standard algorithm to extract sequential patterns. Finally we propose a combination of two techniques (1) to filter patterns based on interest measure, and; (2) to group and present them graphically, to help the experts. Such elements can be used to assess spatialized indicators to assist the interpretation of ecological and river monitoring pressure data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In fact, ecology studies, follows and analyzes phenomenon across space and time and according to several parameters. OLAP systems can provide to ecologists browsing in a large dataset One focus of the current research on OIAP system is the automatic design of OLAP cubes and of data warehouse schemas. This kind of works makes accessible OLAP technology to non information technology experts. But to be efficient, the automatic OLAP building must take into account various cases. Moreover the OLAP technology is based on the concept of hierarchy. Thereby the hierarchical clustering methods are often used by OLAP system designer. In this article, we propose using hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a metric that comes from ecological studies (the Gower similarity index) to build automatically hierarchical dimensions in an OLAP cube. With this similarity index we can perform a hierarchical clustering on heterogeneous datasets that contains qualitative and quantitative variables. We offer a prototypical automatic system which builds dimension for an OLAP cube and we measure the performances of this system according to the number of clustered individuals and according to the number of variables used for clustering. Thanks to these measures we can offer an approximation of performances with a large dataset 'thereby the Gower index in a hierarchical agglomerative clustering permits the management of heterogeneous datatet with missing values in a context of automatic building of OLAP cube. With this methodology, we can build new dimensions based on hierarchies in the data, which are not evident. The data mining methods can complete the expert knowledge during the design of an OLAP cube, because these methods can explain the inherent structure of the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Especially in the retail application domain, RFID is increasingly adopted to capture the shopping tracks and behavior of in-store customers. To further enhance the potential of this promising application, in this paper, we propose a unified framework for RFID-based path analytics, which uses both in-store shopping paths and RFID-based purchasing data to mine actionable navigation patterns. Four modules of this framework are discussed, which are: (1) mapping from the physical space to the cyber space, (2) data preprocessing, (3) pattern mining and (4) knowledge understanding and utilization. In the data preprocessing module, the critical problem of how to capture the mainstream shopping path sequences while wiping out unnecessary redundant and repeated details is addressed in detail. To solve this problem, two types of redundant patterns, i.e., loop repeat pattern and palindrome-contained pattern are recognized and the corresponding processing algorithms are proposed. The experimental results show that the redundant pattern filtering functions are effective and scalable. Overall, this work builds a bridge between indoor positioning and advanced data mining technologies, and provides a feasible way to study customers' shopping behaviors via multi-source RFID data.

Analysis of the power signals emitted by wind turbines for the diagnosis of mechanical faults in their mechanical transmission chain is insufficient. A successful diagnosis requires the inclusion of accelerometers to evaluate vibrations. This work presents a multi-sensory system for fault diagnosis in wind turbines, combined with a data-mining solution for the classification of the operational state of the turbine. The selected sensors are accelerometers, in which vibration signals are processed using angular resampling techniques and electrical, torque and speed measurements. Support vector machines (SVMs) are selected for the classification task, including two traditional and two promising new kernels. This multi-sensory system has been validated on a test-bed that simulates the real conditions of wind turbines with two fault typologies: misalignment and imbalance. Comparison of SVM performance with the results of artificial neural networks (ANNs) shows that linear kernel SVM outperforms other kernels and ANNs in terms of accuracy, training and tuning times. The suitability and superior performance of linear SVM is also experimentally analyzed, to conclude that this data acquisition technique generates linearly separable datasets.

J	Lemogne, C				Lemogne, Cedric			Neuroimaging: A tool for psychopathology?	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						Cognitive psychology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurophysiology; Neuropsychology; Psychobiology; Psychopathology	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SOCIAL EXCLUSION; SELF; FACES; METAANALYSIS; ANXIETY; CORTEX; PAIN; FMRI	Psychopathology is worthy of consideration to inform the application of functional neuroimaging to the study of mental disorders. By promoting an approach based on mental processes underlying disorders rather than an approached based on diagnostic categories, it offers the opportunity to identify biomarkers that could be used as nosological tools. Such biomarkers may eventually inform treatment strategies. However, the question of whether functional brain imaging can be used to learn something about psychopathology, that is understanding the nature and the relationships of mental processes that underlie psychiatric disorders, remains controversial. A potential advantage of functional brain imaging could be the examination of non-conscious mental processes that could be both non reportable by the subject and difficult to capture with behavioral measures. As an example, several studies found depression and anxiety to be associated with amygdala aberrant reactivity to masked emotional stimuliThis might be interpreted as signaling automatic cognitive biases such as those proposed by cognitive theory. But when trying to deduce the presence of a mental process M from a specific pattern of brain activity A, frequently referred to as reverse inference, one has to consider several issues, regardless of the nature of the mental process. These issues can be best formalized with a Bayesian approach where the probability of the presence of M according to A, P(M/A) depends on the a priori probability of M to be present, P(M), as well as on conditional probabilities P(RIM) and P(P(R/(M) over bar). Obviously, P(M) depends on the specificity of the experimental paradigm used. However, reverse inference usually takes place when A was unexpected (i.e. not supposed to be engaged by the experimental task). Conditional probabilities regarding the probability of A according to the presence or the absence of M, P(AIM) and p(A/(M) over bar) can be estimated using methods of data mining based on growing databases. The less A is specific to M, that is to say the higher p(A/(M) over bar) is, the less valid the reverse inference will be. This is even worse when the definition of R is loose. Despite these limitations, reverse inference is nevertheless a powerful heuristic tool when it comes to generate testable hypotheses about the nature of mental processes and their relationships. Combined with carefully designed experimental paradigms, functional brain imaging is thus likely to bring new knowledge to psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It arises in many practical applications such as recommender systems, information retrieval, and marketing analysis of social networks. We propose a new mathematical programming approach for predicting a future network using estimated node degree distribution identified from historical data. The link prediction problem is formulated as an integer programming problem that maximizes the sum of link scores (probabilities) with respect to the estimated node degree distribution. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on real-life social networks, and the computational results show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of previously published link prediction methods.

J	Marateb, HR; Goudarzi, S				Marateb, Hamid Reza; Goudarzi, Sobhan			A noninvasive method for coronary artery diseases diagnosis using a clinically-interpretable fuzzy rule-based system	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Classification; clinical prediction rule; coronary artery disease; data mining; fuzzy logic	AMERICAN-HEART-ASSOCIATION; BODY-MASS INDEX; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; RISK-FACTORS; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; DISCRETIZATION; CONSUMPTION	Background: Coronary heart diseases/coronary artery diseases (CHDs/CAD), the most common form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), are a major cause for death and disability in developing/developed countries. CAD risk factors could be detected by physicians to prevent the CAD occurrence in the near future. Invasive coronary angiography, a current diagnosis method, is costly and associated with morbidity and mortality in CAD patients. The aim of this study was to design a computer-based noninvasive CAD diagnosis system with clinically interpretable rules. Materials and Methods: In this study, the Cleveland CAD dataset from the University of California UCI (Irvine) was used. The interval-scale variables were discretized, with cut points taken from the literature. A fuzzy rule-based system was then formulated based on a neuro-fuzzy classifier (NFC) whose learning procedure was speeded up by the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. Two feature selection (FS) methods, multiple logistic regression (MLR) and sequential FS, were used to reduce the required attributes. The performance of the NFC (without/with FS) was then assessed in a hold-out validation framework. Further cross-validation was performed on the best classifier. Results: In this dataset, 16 complete attributes along with the binary CHD diagnosis (gold standard) for 272 subjects (68% male) were analyzed. MLR + NFC showed the best performance. Its overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, type I error (a) and statistical power were 79%, 89%, 84%, 0.1 and 79%, respectively. The selected features were "age and ST/heart rate slope categories," "exercise-induced angina status," fluoroscopy, and thallium-201 stress scintigraphy results. Conclusion: The proposed method showed "substantial agreement" with the gold standard. This algorithm is thus, a promising tool for screening CAD patients.

Most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. Objective: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable information about pollution levels and public response. Methods: We mined a collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior or a health concern. Results: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to.718 (n= 74, P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be taken to improve quality. Conclusions: We have found quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects. Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data, especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires expensive surveys or interviews.

However, building an FIL for a modified database requires a lot of time and memory. Currently, there is no approach for updating an FIL with deleted transactions. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach for maintaining FILs for transaction deletion without rescanning the original database if the number of eliminated transactions is smaller than the threshold determined based on the pre-large and diffset concepts. A diffset-based approach is first used for fast building an FIL. Then, two proposed approaches (tidset-based and diffset-based) are used for updating the FIL with transaction deletion. The experiment was conducted to show that the diffset-based approach outperforms the tidset-based and the batch-mode approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a nonlinear kernel method, however, it does not scale well to large scale data, because the computation of the chi(2) kernel matrix is intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a sparse random projection method to linearly approximate the chi(2) kernel, so that the original nonlinear SVMs could be converted to linear ones. Then we are able to make use of the existing large scale linear SVMs training method efficiently. Experimental results on three popular image data sets (MNIST, rcv1.binary, Caltech-101) show that the proposed method can significantly improve the learning efficiency of the chi(2) kernel SVMs and the improvement comes at almost no cost of accuracy.

The choice of feature subset determines the classification accuracy. It is a crucial aspect to construct efficient feature selection algorithm. Here, by constructing the feature vector graph, a new feature evaluation criterion based on community modularity in complex network is proposed to select the most informative features. To eliminate the relevant redundancy among features, conditional mutual information-based criterion is used to capture information about relevant independency between features, which is the amount of information they can predict about label variable, but they do not share. The most informative features with maximum relevant independency are added to the optimal subset. Integrating these two points, a method named the community modularity Q value-based feature selection (CMQFS) is put forward in this paper. Furthermore, our method based on community modularity can be certified by k-means cluster theory. We compared the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods by several experiments to indicate that CMQFS is more efficient and accurate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We select Chinese CSI 300 index futures as the research object. The fuzzy time series model combines the fuzzy theory and the time series theory, thus this model can solve the fuzzy data in stock index futures prices. This paper establishes a multivariate model and improves the accuracy of computation. By combing traditional fuzzy time series models and rough set method, we use fuzzy c-mean algorithm to make the data into discrete. Further more, we deal with the rules in mature modules of the rough set and then refine the rules using data mining algorithms. Finally, we use the CSI 300 index futures to test our model and make a prediction of the prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Still, human experience is not limited to the levels of cognition and affect but extends further into the realm of universal instincts and innate behaviours that form the collective unconscious. Patterns of instinctual traits shape archetypes that represent images of the unconscious. This study investigated whether seven various archetypal experiences of users lead to recognisable patterns of physiological responses. More specifically, the potential of predicting the archetypal experiences by a computer from physiological data collected with wearable sensors was evaluated. The subjects were stimulated to feel the archetypal experiences and conscious emotions by means of film clips. The physiological data included measurements of cardiovascular and electrodermal activities. Statistical analysis indicated a significant relationship between the archetypes portrayed in the videos and the physiological responses. Data mining methods enabled us to create between-subject prediction models that were capable of classifying four archetypes with an accuracy of up to 57.1%. Further analysis suggested that classification performance could be improved up to 70.3% in the case of seven archetypes by using within-subject models.

An Efficient Algorithm for Extracting High Utility Itemsets from Weblog Data	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Weblog; High utility itemset; Complexity; Frequent pattern; Cosine similarity	MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS; ASSOCIATION RULES; DISCOVERY; TREE	High utility itemset refers to those set of items which has high utility such as profit in a database. High utility of itemset plays a crucial role in real life. In recent years, various algorithms have been proposed for finding high utility itemset but unfortunately they are not completely relevant at the time and space point of view. In the data mining field, high utility itemset can be found in different categories of data like time series, categorical, etc. Log data is useful for finding behaviour of the user in different aspects. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm named HUIM (High Utility Itemsets Mining) and construct HUI-FP (High Utility Itemsets-Frequent Pattern) Tree for efficiently mining high utility itemsets from log database. The behaviour of the user can be predicted through the high utility of every visited page. We have also proposed pattern generation technique based on cosine similarities among itemsets. These techniques generate strong patterns, and customized users profile according to that pattern. The proposed algorithm is better than the previous state of the art algorithm for high utility itemset generation.	[Bakariya, Brijesh; Thakur, G.

The new diffusion activation energies data of 298 binary systems, covering six faced-centered cubic (fcc) host metals of Group I (Cu, Ag, Au) and Group VIII (Fe, Co, Ni) and 76 elements of periods of 3, 4, 5 and 6, are predicted in this work. Furthermore, a new analytic expression, derived from data-mining, has been developed, which sheds light on the delicate relationship between diffusion activation energy and materials fundamental properties. The present approach can be extended to study the impurity diffusion in metal alloys of other complex structures where diffusion activation energies are difficult to obtain from first-principles calculation due to the complex diffusion mechanism. The present results could be used to provide useful data for other material simulation techniques such as CALPHAD or facilitate the choice of materials for technological applications.

For this reason, it is important to develop methods that improve ADE signal detection in pharmacovigilance databases. Our objective is to apply 3D pharmacophoric similarity models to enhance ADE recognition in Offsides, a pharmacovigilance resource with drug-ADE associations extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We developed a multi-ADE predictor implementing 3D drug similarity based on a pharmacophoric approach, with an ADE reference standard extracted from the SIDER database. The results showed that the application of our 3D multi-type ADE predictor to the pharmacovigilance data in Offsides improved ADE identification and generated enriched sets of drug-ADE signals. The global ROC curve for the Offsides ADE candidates ranked with the 3D similarity score showed an area of 0.7. The 3D predictor also allows the identification of the most similar drug that causes the ADE under study, which could provide hypotheses about mechanisms of action and ADE etiology. Our method is useful in drug development, screening potential adverse effects in experimental drugs, and in drug safety, applicable to the evaluation of ADE signals selected through pharmacovigilance data mining.

In general, according to the 10 attribute weighting models, the SSR alleles of PEAPHTAP-2 and PSBLOX13.2-1 were the two most important attributes to generate discrimination among eight different species and subspecies of genus Pisum. In addition, K-Medoids unsupervised clustering run on Chi squared dataset exhibited the best prediction accuracy (83.12%), while the lowest accuracy (25.97%) gained as K-Means model ran on FCdb database. Irrespective of some fluctuations, the overall accuracies of tree induction models were significantly high for many algorithms, and the attributes PSBLOX13.2-3 and PEAPHTAP could successfully detach Pisum fulvum accessions and cultivars from the others when two selected decision trees were taken into account. Meanwhile, the other used supervised algorithms exhibited overall reliable accuracies, even though in some rare cases, they gave us low amounts of accuracies. Our results, altogether, demonstrate promising applications of both supervised and unsupervised algorithms to provide suitable data mining tools regarding accurate fingerprinting of different species and subspecies of genus Pisum, as a fundamental priority task in breeding programs of the crop.

METHODS: Five hundred and sixty-seven cases with undiff-EGC undergoing gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy were examined retrospectively. Using clinicopathological factors of patient age, location, size, an endoscopic macroscopic tumor form, ulceration, depth, histology, lymphatic involvement (LI) and venous involvement (VI), LNM risk was examined and stratified by conventional statistical analysis and data-mining analysis. RESULTS: LNM was positive in 44 of 567 cases (7.8%). Univariate analysis revealed > 2 cm, protrusion, submucosal (sm), mixed type, LI and VI as significant prognostic factors and > 2 cm and LI-positive were independent factors by multivariate analysis. In preoper-atively evaluable factors excluding LVI, sm and > 2 cm were independent factors. According to the depth and size, cases were categorized into the low-risk group [m and <= 2 cm, 0% (LNM incidence)], the moderaterisk group (m and > 2 cm, 5.6%; and sm and <= 2 cm, 6.0%), and the high-risk group (sm and > 2 cm, 19.3%). On the other hand, LNM occurred in 1.4% in all LI-negative cases, greatly lower than 28.2% in all LI-positive cases, and LNM incidence was low in LI-negative cases even in the moderate-and high-risk groups. CONCLUSION: LNM-related factors in undiff-EGC were depth and size preoperatively while those were LI and size postoperatively. Among these factors, LI was the most significantly correlated factor.

The citrate content of fruit cell vacuoles influences citrus organoleptic qualities. Although citrus could have PH5-like homologs that are involved in citrate accumulation, the details are still unknown. In this study, extensive data-mining with the PH5 sequence and PCR amplification confirmed that there are at least eight PH5-like genes (CsPH1-8) in the citrus genome. CsPHs have a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, and they have high similarity to PhPH5, AtAHA10 or AtAHA2 (from 64.6 to 80.9%). They contain 13-21 exons and 12-20 introns and were evenly distributed into four subgroups of the P3A-subfamily (CsPH1, CsPH2, and CsPH3 in Group I, CsPH4 and CsPH5 in Group II, CsPH6 in Group IV, and CsPH7 and CsPH8 in Group III together with PhPH5). A transcript analysis showed that CsPH1, 3, and 4 were predominantly expressed in mature leaves, whereas CsPH2 and 7 were predominantly expressed in roots, CsPH5 and 6 were predominantly expressed in flowers, and CsPH8 was predominantly expressed in fruit juice sacs (JS). Moreover, the CsPH transcript profiles differed between orange and pummelo, as well as between high-acid and low-acid cultivars. The low-acid orange "Honganliu" exhibits low transcript levels of CsPH3, CsPH4, CsPH5, and CsPH8, whereas the acid-free pummelo (AFP) has only a low transcript level of CsPH8. In addition, ABA injection increased the citrate content significantly, which was accompanied by the obvious induction of CsPH2, 6, 7, and 8 transcript levels. Taken together, we suggest that CsPH8 seems likely to regulate citrate accumulation in the citrus fruit vacuole.

Here, we developed a set of 11 metrics to capture the increasing sarcomere organization that occurs intracellularly during striated muscle cell development. To test our metrics, we analyzed the localization of the contractile protein alpha-actinin in a variety of primary and stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes. Further, we combined these metrics with data mining algorithms to unbiasedly score the phenotypic maturity of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

The movement pattern is identified by 20 characteristics from the three components of the ground reaction force which are used as input information for the neural networks in gender-specific gait classification. The classification performance between MOBJ-LASSO (97.4%) and multi-objective algorithm (MOBJ) (97.1%) is similar, but the MOBJ-LASSO algorithm achieved more improved results than the MOBJ because it is able to eliminate the inputs and automatically select the parameters of the neural network. Thus, it is an effective tool for data mining using neural networks. From 20 inputs used for training, MOBJ-LASSO selected the first and second peaks of the vertical force and the force peak in the antero-posterior direction as the variables that classify the gait patterns of the different genders.

HP1 beta Is a Biomarker for Breast Cancer Prognosis and PARP Inhibitor Therapy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE; HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN-1; SYNTHETIC LETHALITY; MOLECULAR PORTRAITS; OVARIAN-CANCER; KI-67 PROTEIN; DNA-DAMAGE; TUMORS; MARKER	Members of the heterochromatin protein 1 family (HP1 alpha, beta and gamma) are mostly associated with heterochromatin and play important roles in gene regulation and DNA damage response. Altered expression of individual HP1 subtype has profound impacts on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We analyzed the expression profile of HP1 family by data mining using a published microarray data set coupled with retrospective immunohistochemistry analyses of archived breast cancer biospecimens. We found that the patient group overexpressing HP1 beta mRNA is associated with poorly differentiated breast tumors and with a significantly lower survival rate. Immunohistochemical staining against HP1 alpha, HP1 beta and HP1. shows that respective HP1 expression level is frequently altered in breast cancers. 57.4 - 60.1% of samples examined showed high HP1 beta expression and 39.9 - 42.6 % of examined tumors showed no or low expression of each HP1 subtype. Interestingly, comparative analysis on HP1 expression profile and breast cancer markers revealed a positive correlation between the respective expression level of all three HP1 subtypes and Ki-67, a cell proliferation and well-known breast cancer marker. To explore the effect of individual HP1 on PARP inhibitor therapy for breast cancer, MCF7 breast cancer cells and individually HP1-depleted MCF7 cells were treated with PARP inhibitor ABT-888 with or without carboplatin. Notably, HP1 beta-knockdown cells are hypersensitive to the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 alone and its combination with carboplatin. In summary, while increased HP1 beta expression is associated with the poor prognosis in breast cancer, compromised HP1 beta abundance may serve as a useful predictive marker for chemotherapy, including PARP inhibitors against breast cancer.

Genomic DNA from 221 unrelated German patients was genotyped on high-resolution SNP arrays. Putative CNVs were filtered according to stringent criteria, compared with those of 531 population-based German controls, and validated by qPCR. Candidate genes were prioritized using in silico, expression, and segregation analyses, data mining and enrichment analyses of genes and pathways. In 27% of the 221 unrelated patients, a total of 77 protein coding genes displayed rare, nonrecurrent, germline CNVs. The set included 26 candidates with molecular and cellular functions related to tumorigenesis. Targeted high-throughput sequencing found truncating point mutations in 12% (10/77) of the prioritized genes. No clear evidence was found for autosomal recessive subtypes. Six patients had potentially causative mutations in more than one of the 26 genes. Combined with data from recent studies of early-onset colorectal and breast cancer, recurrent potential loss-of-function alterations were detected in CNTN6, FOCAD (KIAA1797), HSPH1, KIF26B, MCM3AP, YBEY and in three genes from the ARHGAP family. In the canonical Wnt pathway oncogene CTNNB1 (-catenin), two potential gain-of-function mutations were found. In conclusion, the present study identified a group of rarely affected genes which are likely to predispose to colorectal adenoma formation and confirmed previously published candidates for tumor predisposition as etiologically relevant. What's new? So far, two genes have been implicated in the inheritance of adenomatous polyposis, a condition that leads to colorectal cancer: APC and MAP. But disturbances in these genes only account for about half of the disease cases. In this study, the authors sought that genetic basis by performing for the first time a genome-wide investigation into copy number variations among colorectal adenomatous polyposis patients. They identified a group of candidate genes that boost the risk of hereditary colorectal tumors; several patients had disruptions in multiple genes, suggesting that a simple lab test to evaluate risk might not be forthcoming.

Integrated satellite data fusion and mining for monitoring lake water quality status of the Albufera de Valencia in Spain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Lake management; Remote sensing; Data fusion; Data mining; Machine learning	LANDSAT SURFACE REFLECTANCE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; IMAGERY; MODEL; ALGORITHMS	Lake eutrophication is a critical issue in the interplay of water supply, environmental management, and ecosystem conservation. Integrated sensing, monitoring, and modeling for a holistic lake water quality assessment with respect to multiple constituents is in acute need. The aim of this paper is to develop an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of satellite remote sensing images to generate daily estimates of some water quality parameters of interest, such as chlorophyll a concentrations and water transparency, to be applied for the assessment of the hypertrophic Albufera de Valencia. The Albufera de Valencia is the largest freshwater lake in Spain, which can often present values of chlorophyll a concentration over 200 mg m(-3) and values of transparency (Secchi Disk, SD) as low as 20 cm. Remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhance Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images were fused to carry out an integrative near-real time water quality assessment on a daily basis. Landsat images are useful to study the spatial variability of the water quality parameters, due to its spatial resolution of 30 m, in comparison to the low spatial resolution (250/500 m) of MODIS. While Landsat offers a high spatial resolution, the low temporal resolution of 16 days is a significant drawback to achieve a near real-time monitoring system. This gap may be bridged by using MODIS images that have a high temporal resolution of 1 day, in spite of its low spatial resolution. Synthetic Landsat images were fused for dates with no Landsat overpass over the study area. Finally, with a suite of ground truth data, a few genetic programming (GP) models were derived to estimate the water quality using the fused surface reflectance data as inputs. The GP model for chlorophyll a estimation yielded a R-2 of 0.94, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 8 mg m(-3), and the GP model for water transparency estimation using Secchi disk showed a R-2 of 0.89, with an RMSE = 4 cm. With this effort, the spatiotemporal variations of water transparency and chlorophyll a concentrations may be assessed simultaneously on a daily basis throughout the lake for environmental management.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how driving patterns databases and data mining can be used to appropriately design this infrastructure. This application focuses on the Italian province of Firenze, involving about 12,000 conventional fuel vehicles monitored over one month, estimating a fleet share shift from conventional fuel vehicles to battery electric vehicles ranging from 10% to 57%, and a mileage share shift from 1.6% to 36.5%. The increase of electric energy demand from electric vehicles ranges from 0.7% to 18% of the total demand in the province, with a number of charging spots three-to-six times higher than the number of circulating electric vehicles. Additionally the results show that a Vehicle-to-Grid interaction strategy can contribute to reduce from 5% to 50% the average daily electric energy demand in specific locations. This paper provides a description of the developed model and focuses on the valuable potential of the proposed methodology to support future policies for designing alternative fuel infrastructure in urban areas.

The main idea is to identify typical load profiles (TLP) of MV consumers and to develop a rule set for the automatic classification of new consumers. To achieve our goal a methodology is proposed consisting of several steps: data pre-processing; application of several clustering algorithms to segment the daily load profiles; selection of the best partition, corresponding to the best consumers' segmentation, based on the assessments of several clustering validity indices; and finally, a classification model is built based on the resulting clusters. To validate the proposed framework, a case study which includes a real database of MV consumers is performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Asquith, K				Asquith, Kyle			Knowing the Child Consumer through Box Tops: Data Collection, Measurement, and Advertising to Children, 1920-1945	CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Audience measurement; Data mining; Children's media; Advertising history; Audience commodification	HISTORICAL-PERSPECTIVE	National advertisers took an earnest interest in children during the first half of the 20th century. Throughout this period, food advertisers commonly offered children membership in clubs and premiums (prizes) in exchange for proofs of purchase, such as box tops. This article, relying upon primary research from the advertising trade press and ad agency archives, considers box tops as instruments that generated market-relevant knowledge. I argue that the submission of box tops to advertisers was an early form of data mining-used to learn about and better target consumers, but also as an audience metric, an ad hoc ratings system for print and radio broadcast sponsorship investments. These arguments are contextualized in critical theories that suggest commercial media audiences, as well as consumers more broadly, are manufactured and that measurement plays a central role in the processes of audience manufacture and commodification. I draw two important conclusions. First, this research demonstrates that consumer surveillance is not unique to the digital era of advertising.

J	Dellepiane, U; Palagi, L				Dellepiane, Umberto; Palagi, Laura			Using SVM to combine global heuristics for the Standard Quadratic Problem	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Quadratic programming; Nonlinear programming; Data mining; Maximum Clique Problem; Global optimization	OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; MAXIMUM CLIQUE; ALGORITHM; BOUNDS	The Standard Quadratic Problem (StQP) is an NP-hard problem with many local minimizers (stationary points). In the literature, heuristics based on unconstrained continuous non-convex formulations have been proposed (Bomze & Palagi, 2005; Bomze, Grippo, & Palagi, 2012) but none dominates the other in terms of best value found. Following (Cassioli, DiLorenzo, Locatelli, Schoen, & Sciandrone, 2012) we propose to use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to define a multistart global strategy which selects the "best" heuristic. We test our method on StQP arising from the Maximum Clique Problem on a graph which is a challenging combinatorial problem. We use as benchmark the clique problems in the DIMACS challenge.

These mechanisms have been widely used in spatial data query, spatial data mining, evaluation of equivalence and similarity in a spatial scene, as well as for consistency assessment of the topological relations of multi-resolution spatial databases. The concept of computational fuzzy topological space is applied to simple fuzzy regions to efficiently and more accurately solve fuzzy topological relations. Thus, extending the existing research and improving upon the previous work, this paper presents a new method to describe fuzzy topological relations between simple spatial regions in Geographic Information Sciences (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Firstly, we propose a new definition for simple fuzzy line segments and simple fuzzy regions based on the computational fuzzy topology. And then, based on the new definitions, we also propose a new combinational reasoning method to compute the topological relations between simple fuzzy regions, moreover, this study has discovered that there are (1) 23 different topological relations between a simple crisp region and a simple fuzzy region; (2) 152 different topological relations between two simple fuzzy regions. In the end, we have discussed some examples to demonstrate the validity of the new method, through comparisons with existing fuzzy models, we showed that the proposed method can compute more than the existing models, as it is more expressive than the existing fuzzy models.

Populus species are widely cultivated for diverse uses. Especially, they grow in different habitats, from salty soil to mesophytic environment, and are therefore used as a model genus for elucidating physiological and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in woody plants. Description: The Salinity Tolerant Poplar Database (STPD) is an integrative database for salt-tolerant poplar genome biology. Currently the STPD contains Populus euphratica genome and its related genetic resources. P. euphratica, with a preference of the salty habitats, has become a valuable genetic resource for the exploitation of tolerance characteristics in trees. This database contains curated data including genomic sequence, genes and gene functional information, non-coding RNA sequences, transposable elements, simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms information of P. euphratica, gene expression data between P. euphratica and Populus tomentosa, and whole-genome alignments between Populus trichocarpa, P. euphratica and Salix suchowensis. The STPD provides useful searching and data mining tools, including GBrowse genome browser, BLAST servers and genome alignments viewer, which can be used to browse genome regions, identify similar sequences and visualize genome alignments. Datasets within the STPD can also be downloaded to perform local searches. Conclusions: A new Salinity Tolerant Poplar Database has been developed to assist studies of salt tolerance in trees and poplar genomics. The database will be continuously updated to incorporate new genome-wide data of related poplar species. This database will serve as an infrastructure for researches on the molecular function of genes, comparative genomics, and evolution in closely related species as well as promote advances in molecular breeding within Populus.

However, Heart Rate Variability predictive value for vascular events is not completely clear. The aim of this study is to develop novel predictive models based on data-mining algorithms to provide an automatic risk stratification tool for hypertensive patients. Methods A database of 139 Holter recordings with clinical data of hypertensive patients followed up for at least 12 months were collected ad hoc. Subjects who experienced a vascular event (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, syncopal event) were considered as high-risk subjects. Several data-mining algorithms (such as support vector machine, tree-based classifier, artificial neural network) were used to develop automatic classifiers and their accuracy was tested by assessing the receiver-operator characteristics curve. Moreover, we tested the echographic parameters, which have been showed as powerful predictors of future vascular events. Results The best predictive model was based on random forest and enabled to identify high-risk hypertensive patients with sensitivity and specificity rates of 71.4% and 87.8%, respectively. The Heart Rate Variability based classifier showed higher predictive values than the conventional echographic parameters, which are considered as significant cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions Combination of Heart Rate Variability measures, analyzed with data-mining algorithm, could be a reliable tool for identifying hypertensive patients at high risk to develop future vascular events.

J	Kim, HU; Chen, GQ				Kim, Hyun Uk; Chen, Grace Qianhong			Identification of hydroxy fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolism-related genes in lesquerella through seed transcriptome analysis	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Hydroxy fatty acid; Lesquerella; Physaria fendleri; Seed; Transcriptome; Triacylglycerol; Gene expression; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction	DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE; TRANSGENIC ARABIDOPSIS; ENZYMATIC-SYNTHESIS; FENDLERI SEED; OIL CONTENT; MICROSOMAL PREPARATIONS; PHYSARIA BRASSICACEAE; OLEATE 12-HYDROXYLASE; CONDENSING ENZYME; RICINOLEIC ACID	Background: Castor oil is the only commercial source of hydroxy fatty acid that has industrial value. The production of castor oil is hampered by the presence of the toxin ricin in its seed. Lesquerella seed also accumulates hydroxy fatty acid and is free of ricin, and thus it is being developed as a new crop for hydroxy fatty acid production. A high-throughput, large-scale sequencing of transcripts from developing lesquerella seeds was carried out by 454 pyrosequencing to generate a database for quality improvement of seed oil and other agronomic traits. Deep mining and characterization of acyl-lipid genes were conducted to uncover candidate genes for further studies of mechanisms underlying hydroxy fatty acid and seed oil synthesis. Results: A total of 651 megabases of raw sequences from an mRNA sample of developing seeds was acquired. Bioinformatic analysis of these sequences revealed 59,914 transcripts representing 26,995 unique genes that include nearly all known seed expressed genes. Based on sequence similarity with known plant proteins, about 74% (19,861) genes matched with annotated coding genes. Among them, 95% (18,868) showed highest sequence homology with Arabidopsis genes, which will allow translation of genomics and genetics findings from Arabidopsis to lesquerella. Using Arabidopsis acyl-lipid genes as queries, we searched the transcriptome assembly and identified 615 lesquerella genes involved in all known pathways of acyl-lipid metabolism. Further deep mining the transcriptome assembly led to identification of almost all lesquerella genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. Moreover, we characterized the spatial and temporal expression profiles of 15 key genes using the quantitative PCR assay. Conclusions: We have built a lesquerella seed transcriptome that provides a valuable reference in addition to the castor database for discovering genes involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerols enriched with hydroxy fatty acids. The information obtained from data mining and gene expression profiling will provide a resource not only for the study of hydroxy fatty acid metabolism, but also for the biotechnological production of hydroxy fatty acids in existing oilseed crops.

J	Lopalco, PL; DeStefano, F				Lopalco, Pier Luigi; DeStefano, Frank			The complementary roles of Phase 3 trials and post-licensure surveillance in the evaluation of new vaccines	VACCINE			English	Review						Vaccine trials; Vaccine marketing authorisation; Vaccine safety; Vaccine effectiveness	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; ROTAVIRUS VACCINATION; BORDETELLA-PERTUSSIS; INFLUENZA-A; SAFETY SURVEILLANCE; IMMUNIZATION SAFETY; ACELLULAR VACCINES; REPORTING SYSTEM; CHILDREN; INTUSSUSCEPTION	Vaccines have led to significant reductions in morbidity and saved countless lives from many infectious diseases and are one of the most important public health successes of the modern era. Both vaccines' effectiveness and safety are keys for the success of immunisation programmes. The role of post-licensure surveillance has become increasingly recognised by regulatory authorities in the overall vaccine development process. Safety, purity, and effectiveness of vaccines are carefully assessed before licensure, but some safety and effectiveness aspects need continuing monitoring after licensure; Post-marketing activities are a necessary complement to pre-licensure activities for monitoring vaccine quality and to inform public health programmes. In the recent past, the availability of large databases together with data-mining and cross-linkage techniques have significantly improved the potentialities of post-licensure surveillance. The scope of this review is to present challenges and opportunities offered by vaccine post-licensure surveillance. While pre-licensure activities form the foundation for the development of effective and safe vaccines, post-licensure monitoring and assessment, are necessary to assure that vaccines are effective and safe when translated in real world settings. Strong partnerships and collaboration at an international level between different stakeholders is necessary for finding and optimally allocating resources and establishing robust post-licensure processes.

Mining severe drug-drug interaction adverse events using Semantic Web technologies: a case study	BIODATA MINING			English	Article						Drug-drug Interaction; Adverse drug event; Data mining; Semantic web technology; Electronic medical records	KNOWLEDGE-BASE; REPORTING DATA; PHARMACOGENOMICS	Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major contributing factor for unexpected adverse drug events (ADEs). However, few of knowledge resources cover the severity information of ADEs that is critical for prioritizing the medical need. The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate a Semantic Web-based approach for mining severe DDI-induced ADEs. Methods: We utilized a normalized FDA Adverse Event Report System (AERS) dataset and performed a case study of three frequently prescribed cardiovascular drugs: Warfarin, Clopidogrel and Simvastatin. We extracted putative DDI-ADE pairs and their associated outcome codes. We developed a pipeline to filter the associations using ADE datasets from SIDER and PharmGKB. We also performed a signal enrichment using electronic medical records (EMR) data. We leveraged the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grading system and classified the DDI-induced ADEs into the CTCAE in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Results: We identified 601 DDI-ADE pairs for the three drugs using the filtering pipeline, of which 61 pairs are in Grade 5, 56 pairs in Grade 4 and 484 pairs in Grade 3. Among 601 pairs, the signals of 59 DDI-ADE pairs were identified from the EMR data. Conclusions: The approach developed could be generalized to detect the signals of putative severe ADEs induced by DDIs in other drug domains and would be useful for supporting translational and pharmacovigilance study of severe ADEs.

Transcriptome Profiling of Khat (Catha edulis) and Ephedra sinica Reveals Gene Candidates Potentially Involved in Amphetamine-Type Alkaloid Biosynthesis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BENZOIC-ACID BIOSYNTHESIS; PHENYLPROPYLAMINO ALKALOIDS; RNA-SEQ; ACETOHYDROXYACID SYNTHASE; N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; OPIUM POPPY; EXPRESSION; PLANTS; AMINOTRANSFERASE; BENZALDEHYDE	Amphetamine analogues are produced by plants in the genus Ephedra and by khat (Catha edulis), and include the widely used decongestants and appetite suppressants (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrine and (1R,2S)-ephedrine. The production of these metabolites, which derive from L-phenylalanine, involves a multi-step pathway partially mapped out at the biochemical level using knowledge of benzoic acid metabolism established in other plants, and direct evidence using khat and Ephedra species as model systems. Despite the commercial importance of amphetamine-type alkaloids, only a single step in their biosynthesis has been elucidated at the molecular level. We have employed Illumina next-generation sequencing technology, paired with Trinity and Velvet-Oases assembly platforms, to establish data-mining frameworks for Ephedra sinica and khat plants. Sequence libraries representing a combined 200,000 unigenes were subjected to an annotation pipeline involving direct searches against public databases. Annotations included the assignment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms used to allocate unigenes to functional categories. As part of our functional genomics program aimed at novel gene discovery, the databases were mined for enzyme candidates putatively involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. Queries used for mining included enzymes with established roles in benzoic acid metabolism, as well as enzymes catalyzing reactions similar to those predicted for amphetamine alkaloid metabolism. Gene candidates were evaluated based on phylogenetic relationships, FPKM-based expression data, and mechanistic considerations. Establishment of expansive sequence resources is a critical step toward pathway characterization, a goal with both academic and industrial implications.

Several clinical trials reported that GTE was well tolerated and had potential anti-cancer efficacy. Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) is the primary compound responsible for the anti-cancer effect of GTE; however, the effect of EGCG alone is limited. To identify GTE compounds capable of potentiating EGCG bioactivity, we performed metabolic profiling of 43 green tea cultivar panels by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Here, we revealed the polyphenol eriodictyol significantly potentiated apoptosis induction by EGCG in vitro and in a mouse tumour model by amplifying EGCG-induced activation of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR)/protein kinase B/endothelial nitric oxide synthase/protein kinase C delta/acid sphingomyelinase signalling pathway. Our results show that metabolic profiling is an effective chemical-mining approach for identifying botanical drugs with therapeutic potential against multiple myeloma. Metabolic profiling-based data mining could be an efficient strategy for screening additional bioactive compounds and identifying effective chemical combinations.

J	Sobkowicz, P				Sobkowicz, Pawel			Innovation Suppression and Clique Evolution in Peer-Review-Based, Competitive Research Funding Systems: An Agent-Based Model	JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Innovation; Research Funding; Cliques	GRANT APPLICATIONS; SCIENCE; PUBLICATION; CHANCE; IMPACT; SCIENTISTS; STRATEGIES; MEDIOCRITY; PROPOSALS; NEPOTISM	Peer review is ubiquitous in modern science: from the evaluation of publications to the distribution of funding. While there is a long tradition of, and many arguments for, peer review as a beneficial and necessary component of scientific processes, the exponential growth of the research community, the 'publish or perish' pressures and increasing insecurity and competition for research grants have led to an increasing number of voices describing the weaknesses of the system. One of the most frequent accusations against the peer review system is that it inhibits true innovation. The availability of better data mining tools allows interested stakeholders, in principle, to monitor many aspects of the process and to promote a better understanding of the interplay of various factors. 'In principle' - because a lot of information is hidden behind the screens of anonymity and confidentiality. Our work presents an attempt at a theoretical understanding of some aspects of the process via an idealized agent-based model, which describes the effects of the peer review done by 'imperfect' agents, in particular with respect to promotion of mediocrity and to formation of self-serving cliques. The results of the model suggest that both phenomena can be quite robust and require careful monitoring of the system to combat their negative effects. Some mitigating measures are simulated and discussed.									94	0	0	J A S S S	GUILDFORD	UNIV SURREY, DEPT SOCIOLOGY, GUILDFORD GU2 7XH, SURREY, ENGLAND	1460-7425			JASSS-J ARTIF SOC S	JASSS	MAR 31	2015	18	2							UNSP 13			23	Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Social Sciences - Other Topics	CH9RL	WOS:000354373800017

The microarray data mining revealed that R. paludigenum activated transcription of genes important for plant hormones, signalling transduction, stress and defensive responses in orange peel tissue. Moreover, up-regulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, phenylpropanoids biosynthesis, and alkaloid biosynthesis I, were observed at the transcription level. Conversely, large amounts of genes involved in starch metabolism, oligosaccharide and glycoside metabolism were markedly repressed by R. paludigenum treatment. Activation of phenylpropanoids biosynthesis pathway was correlated with the increasing production of phenolic acids and their subsequent metabolite lignin, indicating antifungal metabolites indeed contributed to biocontrol yeast enhanced fruit protection. Our findings provide an important basis for understanding the mechanisms of resistance induction in mandarin orange, as well as for reducing postharvest losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, it is difficult to install sensors at demand facilities because their scale and installation environment differ among customers. As a result, the demand facilities are inspected at fixed time intervals. In this paper, we propose condition-based maintenance (CBM), which improves maintenance quality at demand facilities. The proposed method was developed using maintenance data from demand facilities, collected using time-based maintenance, and we conduct the analysis primarily using failure data. We use data mining to analyze transaction data that we modeled on the basis of the maintenance data and to construct a failure predictive model that can predict the failure of facilities and its causes from the results of the analysis. By using the constructed model, we will be able to identify the objects requiring maintenance which may most likely lead to failures in the future, and this study can contribute to improvement of maintenance technologies for demand facilities using the proposed CBM.

J	Krishnamoorthy, S				Krishnamoorthy, Srikumar			Pruning strategies for mining high utility itemsets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						High utility itemsets; Frequent itemsets; Data mining	DISCOVERY	High utility itemset mining problem involves the use of internal and external utilities of items (such as profits, margins) to discover interesting patterns from a given transactional database. It is an extension of the basic frequent itemset mining problem and is proven to be considerably hard and intractable. This is due to the lack of inherent structural properties of high utility itemsets that can be exploited. Several heuristic methods have been suggested in the literature to limit the large search space. This paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art and proposes a high utility mining method that employs novel pruning strategies. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on several real and synthetic benchmark sparse and dense datasets. A comparative evaluation of the method against a state-of-the-art method is also presented. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed method is very effective in pruning unpromising candidates, especially for sparse transactional databases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Association rule mining with mostly associated sequential patterns	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rule mining; Interesting rules; Pattern recognition; Big data; Knowledge discovery; Data mining	K FREQUENT PATTERNS; LARGE DATABASES; ALGORITHM; ITEMSETS	In this paper, we address the problem of mining structured data to find potentially useful patterns by association rule mining. Different than the traditional find-all-then-prune approach, a heuristic method is proposed to extract mostly associated patterns (MASPs). This approach utilizes a maximally-association constraint to generate patterns without searching the entire lattice of item combinations. This approach does not require a pruning process. The proposed approach requires less computational resources in terms of time and memory requirements while generating a long sequence of patterns that have the highest co-occurrence. Furthermore, k-item patterns can be obtained thanks to the sub-lattice property of the MASPs. In addition, the algorithm produces a tree of the detected patterns; this tree can assist decision makers for visual analysis of data. The outcome of the algorithm implemented is illustrated using traffic accident data. The proposed approach has a potential to be utilized in big data analytics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bouguettaya, A; Yu, Q; Liu, XM; Zhou, XM; Song, A				Bouguettaya, Athman; Yu, Qi; Liu, Xumin; Zhou, Xiangmin; Song, Andy			Efficient agglomerative hierarchical clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Clustering analysis; Hybrid clustering; Data mining; Data distribution; Coefficient of correlation	ALGORITHMS	Hierarchical clustering is of great importance in data analytics especially because of the exponential growth of real-world data. Often these data are unlabelled and there is little prior domain knowledge available. One challenge in handling these huge data collections is the computational cost. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency by introducing a set of methods of agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Instead of building cluster hierarchies based on raw data points, our approach builds a hierarchy based on a group of centroids. These centroids represent a group of adjacent points in the data space. By this approach, feature extraction or dimensionality reduction is not required. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study. We tested the approach with different clustering methods (i.e., UPGMA and SLINK), data distributions, (i.e., normal and uniform), and distance measures (i.e., Euclidean and Canberra). The experimental results indicate that, using the centroid based approach, computational cost can be significantly reduced without compromising the clustering performance. The performance of this approach is relatively consistent regardless the variation of the settings, i.e., clustering methods, data distributions, and distance measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is currently a focus of interest among public and private organizations, governments, research institutes and companies operating in diverse fields as health, security, commercial recommendations, detection of anomalies and future trends among others. In this problem, the main objective is to recognize and extract meaningful information (patterns, structure, underlying relationships, etc.) from huge amounts of heterogeneous data. This task is complicated by new, significant storage and processing requirements due to unprecedented volumes of data. In this scenario, new algorithms in Pattern Recognition and related fields are being devised, while well known techniques are revisited and adapted to these new challenges. Latin American research in the "Big Data" problem is still incipient, but there is a significant body of recent works in the subjects of Pattern Recognition and related fields that indirectly addresses the problem. This paper reviews Latin American contributions in Pattern Recognition and related fields in the last lustrum. The focus is set on-but not restricted to-applications in the fields of Computer Vision and Image Analysis with large scale characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One is based on a robust z-score and the other uses a Mahalanobis type robust distance. The methods couple the ideas of point to plane orthogonal distance and local surface point consistency to get Maximum Consistency with Minimum Distance (MCMD). The methods estimate the best-fit-plane based on most probable outlier free, and most consistent, points set in a local neighbourhood. Then the normal and curvature from the best-fit-plane will be highly robust to noise and outliers. Experiments are performed to show the performance of the algorithms compared to several existing well-known methods (from computer vision, data mining, machine learning and statistics) using synthetic and real laser scanning datasets of complex (planar and non-planar) objects. Results for plane fitting, denoising, sharp feature preserving and segmentation are significantly improved. The algorithms are demonstrated to be significantly faster, more accurate and robust. Quantitatively, for a sample size of 50 with 20% outliers the proposed MCMD_Z is approximately 5, 15 and 98 times faster than the existing methods; uLSIF, RANSAC and RPCA, respectively. The proposed MCMD_MD method can tolerate 75% clustered outliers, whereas, RPCA and RANSAC can only tolerate 47% and 64% outliers, respectively. In terms of outlier detection, for the same dataset, MCMD_Z has an accuracy of 99.72%, 0.4% false positive rate and 0% false negative rate; for RPCA, RANSAC and uLSIF, the accuracies are 97.05%, 47.06% and 94.54%, respectively, and they have misclassification rates higher than the proposed methods. The new methods have potential for local surface reconstruction, fitting, and other point cloud processing tasks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are some algorithms proposed to extract the intrinsic characteristics of different type of high-dimensional data by performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction, such as 1SOMAP, LLE and so on. Most of these algorithms operate in a batch mode and cannot be effectively applied when data are collected sequentially. In this paper, we proposed a new incremental version of ISOMAP which can use the previous computation results as much as possible and effectively update the low dimensional representation of data points as many new samples are accumulated. Experimental results on synthetic data as well as real world images demonstrate that our approaches can construct an accurate low-dimensional representation of the data in an efficient manner.

The context in which a choice is made is an important factor for recommendation systems. Recently, researchers extended the classical matrix factorization to enable generic integration of contextual information by modeling the relevant data as a tensor. However, current tensor factorization methods have two important limitations: (1) computing costs can be very high in practice and (2) they can only be applied to static conditions. In this paper, we propose the GPUTENSOR, a parallel tensor factorization algorithm, to accelerate the tensor factorization of large datasets to support efficient context-aware recommendations. The basic idea of this algorithm is to partition a tensor into smaller blocks and then exploit the inherent parallelism and high memory bandwidth of Graphics Processing Units (CPU) to perform tensor related operations in parallel. Furthermore, based on the observation that contextual information changes dynamically and frequently, we present GPUTENSOR(+), an effective incremental method that models the apparent changes of a tensor by adaptively updating its previously factorized components instead of recomputing them on the whole dataset every time data are changed. Experiments indicate that the proposed methods can achieve significant timesavings without a significant loss in accuracy. As an important data mining tool, these methods can be used a potential basis for many other interesting tensor applications, such as clustering, trend detection, social network analysis, and latent concept discovery.

Although NoSQL systems have not been designed to support joins, as they are applied to a wide variety of applications, the need to support joins has emerged. Furthermore, joins performed in NoSQL systems are generally similarity joins, rather than exact-match joins, which find similar pairs of records. Since Web applications often use the MapReduce framework, we develop a solution to perform similarity joins in NoSQL systems using the MapReduce framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Serpins play critical roles in an array of fundamental biological processes. In this study, we identified a complete set of 25 serpin genes from channel catfish genome by comprehensive data mining of existing genomic resources. Phylogenetic analysis verified their identities and supported the classification of serpins into six families as in mammals. Extensive comparative genomic analyses suggested that most serpins were conserved among vertebrates, while some were lineage-specific. Analysis of serpin gene expression in mucosal tissues after bacterial infections indicated that serpin genes were regulated in a tissue-specific and time-dependent manner. Distinct expression patterns between infections of the two pathogens were observed, indicating that much more rapid host responses of serpin expression were initiated after ESC infection than after columnaris infection. These studies set the foundation for future studies of host-pathogen interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Natale, F; Carvalho, N; Paulrud, A				Natale, Fabrizio; Carvalho, Natacha; Paulrud, Anton			Defining small-scale fisheries in the EU on the basis of their operational range of activity The Swedish fleet as a case study	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Spatial; GIS; Data mining; Logbook data; Classification; Clustering		Extending the definition of small scale fisheries is a recurrent issue in policy and research debates. A broader definition of small scale fisheries would need to encompass, in addition to vessel size attributes such as vessel length, variables relating to their local operational range, their social role in coastal communities and the economics of the enterprise. In this study, data mining and geospatial analysis techniques were used to explore the relationship between vessel characteristics and local operational range. The process relies heavily on the availability of detailed logbook data and involves two main steps: (I) clustering vessels on the basis of operational range attributes and (2) finding vessel characteristics that best match the operational range classes through machine learning algorithms. The analysis was carried out using the Swedish fishing fleet as a case study and considers the fishing activity of the entire fleet over the period 2007-2013. Swedish logbook data offers the advantage of providing precise spatial information on the location of the catch. Results clearly identified three operational range clusters: local, medium and long range. When considering engine power and vessel tonnage as explanatory variables, the classification algorithms were able to represent the operational range classes with a success rate of 94%. However, the fact that medium size vessels operate and compete in the same operational range class of small size vessels limits, in practice, the possibility of using vessel characteristics to represent univocally the local operational range characteristics of small scale fisheries, unless very high thresholds for power and tonnage are used.

In-situ observation of bulk 3D grain evolution during plastic deformation in polycrystalline Cu	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY			English	Article						Microstructures; Crystal plasticity; Polycrystalline material; Non-destructive evaluation; High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION; TEXTURE EVOLUTION; ELASTIC STRAINS; PART 1; ORIENTATION; MICROSCOPY; COPPER; RECRYSTALLIZATION; MICROSTRUCTURE	We present a non-destructive in-situ measurement of three-dimensional (3D) microstructure evolution of 99.995% pure polycrystalline copper during tensile loading using synchrotron radiation. Spatially resolved three-dimensional crystallographic orientation fields are reconstructed from the measured diffraction data obtained from a near-field high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (nf-HEDM), and the evolution of about 5000 3D bulk grains is tracked through multiple stages of deformation. Spatially resolved observation of macroscopic texture change, anisotropic deformation development, and the correspondence of different crystallographic parameters to defect accumulation are illustrated. Moreover, correlations between different crystallographic parameters, such as crystal rotation evolution, short- and long-range orientation gradient development, microstructural features, and grain size effects are investigated. The current state of data mining tools available to analyze large and complicated diffraction data is presented and challenges associated with extracting meaningful information from these datasets are discussed.

Data mining for gravitationally lensed quasars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; DARK-MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; BROAD-LINE REGION; 7TH DATA RELEASE; TIME DELAYS; GALAXIES; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; CONSTRAINTS; VARIABILITY	Gravitationally lensed quasars are brighter than their unlensed counterparts and produce images with distinctive morphological signatures. Past searches and target-selection algorithms, in particular the Sloan Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), have relied on basic morphological criteria, which were applied to samples of bright, spectroscopically confirmed quasars. The SQLS techniques are not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. DES, PS1, LSST), because spectroscopic information is not readily available and the large data volume requires higher purity in target/candidate selection. We carry out a systematic exploration of machine-learning techniques and demonstrate that a two-step strategy can be highly effective. In the first step, we use catalogue-level information (griz+WISE magnitudes, second moments) to pre-select targets, using artificial neural networks. The accepted targets are then inspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (gradient-boosted trees), to form a final set of candidates. The results from this procedure can be used to further refine the simpler SQLS algorithms, with a twofold (or threefold) gain in purity and the same (or 80 per cent) completeness at target-selection stage, or a purity of 70 per cent and a completeness of 60 per cent after the candidate-selection step. Simpler photometric searches in griz+WISE based on colour cuts would provide samples with 7 per cent purity or less. Our technique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates can be obtained from a Stage III experiment (e.g. DES catalogue/data base) in a few CPU hours. The techniques are easily extendable to Stage IV experiments like LSST with the addition of time domain information.

Predicting future trends of financial markets is more remarkable these days especially after the recent global financial crisis. So traders who access to a powerful engine for extracting helpful information throw raw data can meet the success. In this paper we propose a new intelligent model in a multi-agent framework called bat-neural network multi-agent system (BNNMAS) to predict stock price. The model performs in a four layer multi-agent framework to predict eight years of DAX stock price in quarterly periods. The capability of BNNMAS is evaluated by applying both on fundamental and technical DAX stock price data and comparing the outcomes with the results of other methods such as genetic algorithm neural network (GANN) and some standard models like generalized regression neural network (GRNN), etc. The model tested for predicting DAX stock price a period of time that global financial crisis was faced to economics. The results show that BNNMAS significantly performs accurate and reliable, so it can be considered as a suitable tool for predicting stock price specially in a long term periods.

J	Hong, TP; Chen, CH; Lin, FS				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Chen, Chun-Hao; Lin, Feng-Shih			Using group genetic algorithm to improve performance of attribute clustering	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Attribute clustering; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Grouping genetic algorithm; Data mining	FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION	Feature selection is a pre-processing step in data mining and machine learning, and is very important in analyzing high-dimensional data. Attribute clustering has been proposed for feature selection. If similar attributes can be clustered into groups, they can then be easily replaced by others in the same group when some attribute values are missing. Hong et al. proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) to find appropriate attribute clusters. However, in their approaches, multiple chromosomes represent the same attribute clustering result (feasible solution) due to the combinatorial property, and thus the search space is larger than necessary. This study improves the performance of the GA-based attribute clustering process based on the grouping genetic algorithm (GGA). In the proposed approach, the general GGA representation and operators are used to reduce redundancy in the chromosome representation for attribute clustering. Experiments are also conducted to compare the efficiency of the proposed approach with that of an existing approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can derive attribute grouping results in an effective way. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has aroused great concern and research upsurge in the field of data mining. Clustering is an effective tool of data mining, so data stream clustering will undoubtedly become the focus of the study in data stream mining. In view of the characteristic of the high dimension, dynamic, real-time, many effective data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed. In addition, data stream information are not deterministic and always exist outliers and contain noises, so developing effective data stream clustering algorithm is crucial. This paper reviews the development and trend of data stream clustering and analyzes typical data stream clustering algorithms proposed in recent years, such as Birch algorithm, Local Search algorithm, Stream algorithm and CluStream algorithm. We also summarize the latest research achievements in this field and introduce some new strategies to deal with outliers and noise data. At last, we put forward the focal points and difficulties of future research for data stream clustering.

Optimization of hot forming process using data mining techniques and finite element method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Hot forming; B-pillar; Geometry feature; Process parameter; Data mining	HIGH STRENGTH STEEL; SIMULATION	In the process of hot forming, many design variables have effects on the final results in different and complex ways, such as geometry feature and forming process parameters. It is difficult to understand the relationship between design variables and results, which is very important to guide the design. In this paper, Data Mining (DM) was introduced to explore the influence of the parts geometric feature and the hot forming parameters on hot forming results of an automobile B-pillar model, and the optimum parameter ranges were determined. Firstly, a series of variable parameters were chosen and 100 groups of experimental data were generated with super Latin method, then the FEM ananlysis results were calculated respectively. Secondly, analysis and evaluation of simulation results were carried out by making full use of the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. Finally, a series of B-pillar hot forming rules were refined, such as the initial temperature of the sheet metal should be controlled between 720 A degrees C to 800 A degrees C. The fillet radius is recommended to be bigger than 10mm and the height gradient should be controlled under 67mm, etc. A real B-pillar model was designed to testify the rules and the result shows that the rules are correct and effective.

Early detection through mammography screening could significantly reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, most of screening methods may consume large amount of resources. We propose a computational model, which is solely based on personal health information, for breast cancer risk assessment. Our model can be served as a pre-screening program in the low-cost setting. In our study, the data set, consisting of 3976 records, is collected from Taipei City Hospital starting from 2008.1.1 to 2008.12.31. Based on the dataset, we first apply the sampling techniques and dimension reduction method to preprocess the testing data. Then, we construct various kinds of classifiers (including basic classifiers, ensemble methods, and cost-sensitive methods) to predict the risk. The cost-sensitive method with random forest classifier is able to achieve recall (or sensitivity) as 100 %. At the recall of 100 %, the precision (positive predictive value, PPV), and specificity of cost-sensitive method with random forest classifier was 2.9 % and 14.87 %, respectively. In our study, we build a breast cancer risk assessment model by using the data mining techniques. Our model has the potential to be served as an assisting tool in the breast cancer screening.

J	Yang, H; Fong, SM				Yang, Hang; Fong, Simon			Countering the concept-drift problems in big data by an incrementally optimized stream mining model	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Concept drift; Data stream mining; Very fast decision tree		Mining the potential value hidden behind big data has been a popular research topic around the world. For an infinite big data scenario, the underlying data distribution of newly arrived data may be appeared differently from the old one in the real world. This phenomenon is so-called the concept-drift problem that exists commonly in the scenario of big data mining. In the past decade, decision tree inductions use multi-tree learning to detect the drift using alternative trees as a solution. However, multi-tree algorithms consume more computing resources than the singletree. This paper proposes a singletree with an optimized node-splitting mechanism to detect the drift in a test-then-training tree-building process. In the experiment, we compare the performance of the new method to some state-of-art singletree and multi-tree algorithms. Result shows that the new algorithm performs with good accuracy while a more compact model size and less use of memory than the others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is known that twenty percent customers produce eighty percent profiles. Thus, how to find these customers is very critical. Customer lifetime value (CLV) is presented to evaluate customers in terms of recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) variables. A novel model is proposed to analyze customers purchase data and RFM variables based on ordered weighting averaging (OWA) and K-Means cluster algorithm. OWA is employed to determine the weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. K-Means algorithm is used to cluster customers according to RFM values. Churn customers could be found out by comparing RFM values of every cluster group with average RFM. Questionnaire is conducted to investigate which reasons cause customers dissatisfaction. Rank these reasons to help E-commerce improve services. The experimental results have demonstrated that the model is effective and reasonable.

An evolutionary algorithm for the discovery of rare class association rules in learning management systems	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Rare association rules; Grammar guided genetic programming; Evolutionary computation; Educational data mining		Association rule mining, an important data mining technique, has been widely focused on the extraction of frequent patterns. Nevertheless, in some application domains it is interesting to discover patterns that do not frequently occur, even when they are strongly related. More specifically, this type of relation can be very appropriate in e-learning domains due to its intrinsic imbalanced nature. In these domains, the aim is to discover a small but interesting and useful set of rules that could barely be extracted by traditional algorithms founded in exhaustive search-based techniques. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for mining rare class association rules when gathering student usage data from a Moodle system. We analyse how the use of different parameters of the algorithm determine the rule characteristics, and provides some illustrative examples of them to show their interpretability and usefulness in e-learning environments. We also compare our approach to other existing algorithms for mining both rare and frequent association rules. Finally, an analysis of the rules mined is presented, which allows information about students' unusual behaviour regarding the achievement of bad or good marks to be discovered.	[Luna, J.

The oil-film concentrated in the rotor's journal bearings is the root cause of the system's occurring nonlinear effects known as sub-synchronous vibrations, the behavior of which depends on both the system's geometric and dynamic configuration. In this paper, a methodology is applied for the case of a turbocharger with full-floating ring bearings that allows the quantification of the sub-synchronous vibrations during run-up simulations. It is conducted by considering both the wheel shaft and shaft-bearing geometry as a set of input parameters, the variation of which contributes in quantifying their influence upon the sub-synchronous evolution with respect to amplitude and duration criteria. Motivated by linear multivariate regression algorithms and data mining techniques, i.e., correlation coefficients and global sensitivity methods, the influence of each design parameter on the sub-synchronous formation is analyzed. Furthermore, with the help of the non-supervised neural network methods, design configurations are indicated that could be set as a compromise in terms of feasibility and low-cost production.

The present cross-sectional approach to olfactory drug effects made use of the recent developments in informatics, knowledge discovery, and data mining allowing connecting drug-related information from humans with underlying molecular drug targets. In this prospective cross-sectional study, n = 1008 outpatients at a general practitioner were enrolled. All currently taken medications were obtained, and olfactory function was assessed by means of a clinically established 12-item odor identification test. The association between the patients' sense of smell and the administered medications was based (i) on the active pharmacological substances and (ii) on the molecular targets queried from the publicly accessible DrugBank database. Of the 168 different substances, six were taken sufficiently often to be analyzed. The administration of levothyroxine was associated with a higher olfactory score (p = 0.033). For the 168 drugs, 323 different targets could be queried. Thirty-one gene products were addressed sufficiently often to be analyzed. Besides agonistic targeting of thyroid hormone receptors (genes THRA1, THRB1) agreeing with the above result, antagonistically targeting the adrenoceptor alpha 1A (gene ADRA1A) by several unrelated medications was associated with a significantly higher olfactory score (p = 0.012). The identified drug effects on olfaction are both biologically plausible based on supportive information from basic science studies. The novel molecular target-based approach suggested clear advantages over the classical drug or drug class-based approach. It increased the analyzable data volume fivefold and provided plausible hypotheses about mechanistic drug effects opening possibilities for drug discovery and repurposing.

In order to realize an effective multiview clustering, two issues must be addressed, namely, how to combine the clustering result from each view and how to identify the importance of each view. In this paper, based on a newly proposed objective function which explicitly incorporates two penalty terms, a basic multiview fuzzy clustering algorithm, called collaborative fuzzy c-means (Co-FCM), is firstly proposed. It is then extended into its weighted view version, called weighted view collaborative fuzzy c-means (WV-Co-FCM), by identifying the importance of each view. The WV-Co-FCM algorithm indeed tackles the above two issues simultaneously. Its relationship with the latest multiview fuzzy clustering algorithm Collaborative Fuzzy K-Means (Co-FKM) is also revealed. Extensive experimental results on various multiview datasets indicate that the proposed WV-Co-FCM algorithm outperforms or is at least comparable to the existing state-of-the-art multitask and multiview clustering algorithms and the importance of different views of the datasets can be effectively identified.

There appears, however, to be a dearth of empirical case studies which consider in detail the initial stages in DM management to enable apt foundation for its later successful implementation. Our research applied a multi-method strategy to determine the critical success factors of embryonic DM implementation. We propose and validate, through a series of cases, a conceptual framework to guide practitioners' adoption of DM. Our findings reveal additional issues for applied decision making in the context of DM success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CRAFFT: an activity prediction model based on Bayesian networks	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Bayesian networks; Activity prediction; Activity recognition; Smart environments; Prompting; Clustering	ENVIRONMENTS	Recent advances in the areas of pervasive computing, data mining, and machine learning offer unique opportunities to provide health monitoring and assistance for individuals facing difficulties to live independently in their homes. Several components have to work together to provide health monitoring for smart home residents including, but not limited to, activity recognition, activity discovery, activity prediction, and prompting system. Compared to the significant research done to discover and recognize activities, less attention has been given to predict the future activities that the resident is likely to perform. Activity prediction components can play a major role in design of a smart home. For instance, by taking advantage of an activity prediction module, a smart home can learn context-aware rules to prompt individuals to initiate important activities. In this paper, we propose an activity prediction model using Bayesian networks together with a novel two-step inference process to predict both the next activity features and the next activity label. We also propose an approach to predict the start time of the next activity which is based on modeling the relative start time of the predicted activity using the continuous normal distribution and outlier detection. To validate our proposed models, we used real data collected from physical smart environments.

Patterns are extracted with respect to a given set of constraints (frequency, closedness, size, etc). In practice, many constraints require threshold values whose choice is often arbitrary. This difficulty is even harder when several thresholds are required and have to be combined. Moreover, patterns barely missing a threshold will not be extracted even if they may be relevant. The paper advocates the introduction of softness into the pattern discovery process. By using Constraint Programming, we propose efficient methods to relax threshold constraints as well as constraints involved in patterns such as the top-k patterns and the skypatterns. We show the relevance and the efficiency of our approach through a case study in chemoinformatics for discovering toxicophores.

The method is generally applicable to all types of spectra evolving as a function of any arbitrary parameter. This approach is based on correlation functions and statistical scedasticity formalism. Numerous challenges in analyzing high throughput experimental data can be tackled using the herein proposed method. We applied this method to understand the reactivity pathway and formation mechanism of a Li-ion battery cathode material during high temperature synthesis using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate that Pearson's correlation function can easily unravel all major phase transition and, more importantly, the minor structural changes which cannot be revealed by conventionally inspecting the series of diffraction patterns. Furthermore, a two-dimensional (2D) reactivity pattern calculated as the scedasticity along all measured reciprocal space of all successive diffraction pattern pairs unveils clearly the structural evolution path and the active areas of interest during the synthesis. The methods described here can be readily used for on-the-fly data analysis during various in-situ operando experiments in order to quickly evaluate and optimize experimental conditions, as well as for post data analysis and large data mining where considerable amount of data hinders the feasibility of the investigation through point-by-point inspection.

Building an Integrated Water-Land Use Database for Defining Benchmarks, Conservation Targets, and User Clusters	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water management; Conservation; Data analysis; Databases; Water demand; Land use	MODEL	Water utilities have large amounts of data at their disposal, which are seldom being used to their full potential. Integrating water billing records with land-use and demographic data organizes information and makes inherent correlations easier to understand, facilitating communication to stakeholders. This data was integrated for three Ontario (Canada) municipalities, Barrie, Guelph, and London. A summary tool was created, with proposed metrics and charts, that facilitates comparisons between cities, definition of benchmarks, and identification of targets for conservation. More than 60% of consumption in these cities is residential, and mostly lies below the Ontario average of 267 L/cap . day. Water user clusters were created through self-organizing maps, K-means, and hierarchical clustering, and selected according to their pseudo-F and Rand statistics.

An effective association rule mining scheme using a new generic basis	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Association rule mining; Condensed representations; Basis for association rules; Frequent closed itemset	FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; REPRESENTATION; GENERATORS	Association rule mining among itemsets is a fundamental task and is of great importance in many data mining applications including attacks in network data, stock market, financial applications, bioinformatics to find genetic disorders, etc. However, association rule extraction from a reasonable-sized database produces a large number of rules. As a result, many of them are redundant to other rules, and they are practically useless. To overcome this issue, methods for mining non-redundant rules are essentially required. To address such problem, we initially propose a definition for redundancy in sense of minimal knowledge and then a compact representation of non-redundant association rules which we call as compact informative generic basis. We also provide an improved version of the existing DCI_CLOSED algorithm (DCI_PLUS) to find out the frequent closed itemsets (FCI) with their minimal representative generators in combination with BitTable which represents a compact database form in a single scan of the original database. We further introduce an algorithm for constructing the compact informative generic basis from the FCI and their generators in an efficient way. We finally present an inference mechanism in which all association rules can be generated without accessing the database. Experiments are performed on the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing related methods.

CMEIAS JFrad: A Digital Computing Tool to Discriminate the Fractal Geometry of Landscape Architectures and Spatial Patterns of Individual Cells in Microbial Biofilms	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Biofilm architecture; CMEIAS; Fractal geometry; Image analysis; Spatial pattern	DIMENSION; ECOLOGY; MICROSCOPY	Image analysis of fractal geometry can be used to gain deeper insights into complex ecophysiological patterns and processes occurring within natural microbial biofilm landscapes, including the scale-dependent heterogeneities of their spatial architecture, biomass, and cell-cell interactions, all driven by the colonization behavior of optimal spatial positioning of organisms to maximize their efficiency in utilization of allocated nutrient resources. Here, we introduce CMEIAS JFrad, a new computing technology that analyzes the fractal geometry of complex biofilm architectures in digital landscape images. The software uniquely features a data-mining opportunity based on a comprehensive collection of 11 different mathematical methods to compute fractal dimension that are implemented into a wizard design to maximize ease-of-use for semi-automatic analysis of single images or fully automatic analysis of multiple images in a batch process. As examples of application, quantitative analyses of fractal dimension were used to optimize the important variable settings of brightness threshold and minimum object size in order to discriminate the complex architecture of freshwater microbial biofilms at multiple spatial scales, and also to differentiate the spatial patterns of individual bacterial cells that influence their cooperative interactions, resource use, and apportionment in situ. Version 1.0 of JFrad is implemented into a software package containing the program files, user manual, and tutorial images that will be freely available at http://cme.msu.edu/cmeias/. This improvement in computational image informatics will strengthen microscopy-based approaches to analyze the dynamic landscape ecology of microbial biofilm populations and communities in situ at spatial resolutions that range from single cells to microcolonies.

New clustering methods for population comparison on paternal lineages	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS			English	Article						Y haplogroups; Eurasian populations; Human demographic history; Data mining; Probabilistic clustering; Self-organising maps	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; Y-CHROMOSOME; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; FOLK-MUSIC; DIVERSITY; GENETICS; MODEL; PERSPECTIVE; ALGORITHM; EVOLUTION	The goal of this study is to show two new clustering and visualising techniques developed to find the most typical clusters of 18-dimensional Y chromosomal haplogroup frequency distributions of 90 Western Eurasian populations. The first technique called "self-organizing cloud (SOC)" is a vector-based self-learning method derived from the Self Organising Map and non-metric Multidimensional Scaling algorithms. The second technique is a new probabilistic method called the "maximal relation probability" (MRP) algorithm, based on a probability function having its local maximal values just in the condensation centres of the input data. This function is calculated immediately from the distance matrix of the data and can be interpreted as the probability that a given element of the database has a real genetic relation with at least one of the remaining elements. We tested these two new methods by comparing their results to both each other and the k-medoids algorithm. By means of these new algorithms, we determined 10 clusters of populations based on the similarity of haplogroup composition. The results obtained represented a genetically, geographically and historically well-interpretable picture of 10 genetic clusters of populations mirroring the early spread of populations from the Fertile Crescent to the Caucasus, Central Asia, Arabia and Southeast Europe. The results show that a parallel clustering of populations using SOC and MRP methods can be an efficient tool for studying the demographic history of populations sharing common genetic footprints.

J	Kim, C				Kim, Chulyun			Theoretical analysis of constructing wavelet synopsis on partitioned data sets	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Wavelet; MapReduce; Data mining; Cloud computing; Big data		Currently, the size of data becomes much larger and the distributed data processing is getting very important to manage the huge size of data. The MapReduce well known as Google's data processing environment is the most popular distributed platform with good scalability and fault tolerance. Many traditional algorithms in the single machine environment are being adopted to the MapReduce platform. In this paper we analyze a novel algorithm to generate wavelet synopses on the distributed MapReduce framework. Wavelet synopsis is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction methods and has been studied in various areas such as query optimization, approximate query answering, feature selection, etc. In the proposed algorithm, the wavelet synopsis can be calculated by a single MapReduce phase, and, by minimizing the amount of data communicated through the network of the distributed MapReduce platform, all computations are processed within almost linear time complexity. We theoretically study the properties of constructing wavelet synopsis on partitioned data sets and the correctness of the proposed algorithm.

J	Jung, H; Yoo, H; Lee, Y; Chung, KY				Jung, Hoill; Yoo, Hyun; Lee, Youngho; Chung, Kyung-Yong			Interactive pain nursing intervention system for smart health service	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Interactive health; Collaborative filtering; Nursing support; Medical data mining; Pain; Intervention	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; INDUSTRY; MODEL	In modern society, the amount of information has significantly increased due to the development of BT-IT convergence technology. This leads to developing information obtaining and searching technologies from much data. Although system integration for medicare has been largely established to accumulate large amounts of information, there is a lack of provision and support of information for nursing activities, using such an established database. In particular, the judgment for pain intervention depends on the experience of individual nurses, leading to usually making subjective decisions. Thus, there is some danger in applying unwanted anesthesia and drug abuse. In this paper, we proposed the interactive pain nursing intervention system for smart health service. The proposed method uses collaborative filtering that extracts some pain strengths, which represent a high relative level, based on similar pain strengths. Pain strength estimation method using collaborative filtering calculates patient similarities through Pearson correlation coefficients in which a neighbor selection method is used based on the pain strength. In general, medical data in patients shows various distributions due to its own characteristics, as sample data demonstrates. Therefore, this is determined as an applicable theory to the sparsity problem. In addition, it is compensated using a default voting method. The medical data evaluated by applying standard data and its accuracy in pain prediction is verified. The test of the proposed method yielded excellent extraction results; it is possible to provide the fundamental data and guideline to nurses for recognizing the pain of patients based on the results of this study. This represents increased patient welfare for smart health services.

We then propose a hybrid fuzzy rough with K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)-based classifier (FRNN) to classify the patterns in the reduced datasets, obtained from the fuzzy rough bio-inspired algorithm search. While exploring other possible hybrid evolutionary processes, we then conducted experiments considering (i) same feature selection algorithm with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier; (ii) instance based selection using synthetic minority over-sampling technique with fuzzy rough K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), SVM and RF classifier. The proposed hybrid is subsequently validated using real-life datasets obtained from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid produces good classification accuracy. Finally, parametric and nonparametric statistical tests of significance are carried out to observe consistency of the classifiers.

This is an important issue for understanding protein folding mechanism and guiding de novo protein design. Twenty naturally occurring amino acids and eight secondary structures consist of a 28-letter alphabet to determine folding kinetics and mechanism. Here we predict folding kinetic rates of proteins from many reduced alphabets. We find that a reduced alphabet of 10 letters achieves good correlation with folding rates, close to the one achieved by full 28-letter alphabet. Many other reduced alphabets are not significantly correlated to folding rates. The finding suggests that not all amino acids and secondary structures are equally important for protein folding. The foldable sequence of a protein could be designed using at least 10 folding units, which can either promote or inhibit protein folding. Reducing alphabet cardinality without losing key folding kinetic information opens the door to potentially faster machine learning and data mining applications in protein structure prediction, sequence alignment and protein design.

Mainly young generation is becoming victim to this because of the fast pace of life. Extensive measures should be taken to overcome this trauma. Data are collected worldwide to gain some useful knowledge, but problem occurs in handling the large amount of data. Therefore, data mining techniques are being used to resolve the problems. In this paper, we have applied the data mining techniques such as association analysis and frequent pattern tree on depression database containing 5,964 records. These techniques are used altogether to extract efficient results. It saves the processing time and effort when used together. The results from our analysis state the most common symptoms of depressed patients as well as discuss the scenarios of the patients.

The importance of metadata to assess information content in digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology	CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH			English	Article						Neuron morphology; Metadata; Digital reconstruction; Data standards; Completeness	BASKET CELLS; DENDRITIC ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; RAT; MORPHOMETRY; NOISE	Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors provide a powerful representation of neuronal morphology in formats amenable to quantitative analysis, computational modeling, and data mining. Reconstructed files, however, require adequate metadata to identify the appropriate animal species, developmental stage, brain region, and neuron type. Moreover, experimental details about tissue processing, neurite visualization and microscopic imaging are essential to assess the information content of digital morphologies. Typical morphological reconstructions only partially capture the underlying biological reality. Tracings are often limited to certain domains (e.g., dendrites and not axons), may be incomplete due to tissue sectioning, imperfect staining, and limited imaging resolution, or can disregard aspects irrelevant to their specific scientific focus (such as branch thickness or depth). Gauging these factors is critical in subsequent data reuse and comparison. NeuroMorpho.Org is a central repository of reconstructions from many laboratories and experimental conditions. Here, we introduce substantial additions to the existing metadata annotation aimed to describe the completeness of the reconstructed neurons in NeuroMorpho.Org. These expanded metadata form a suitable basis for effective description of neuromorphological data.

Considerable research has been conducted in these fields to optimize maintenance actions. Most research proposes approaches based on physics: physical model of a specific failure, law of aging, etc. In spite of their performance, these approaches are quite difficult to implement on a complex integrated system. Each field of expertise assesses the good health of a system part using its own experts, its own methods, and, in some cases, its own data. Nevertheless, these fields all make up the same machine, and no interaction between systems is considered. Our study is not based on physical approaches but uses operational data and mathematical tools to diagnose, off-line, the current state of the system. The proposed paper concerns a new concept consisting in characterizing normal system functioning by using data recorded during monitoring. The life profile of this complex system is described by employing all the available data to determine, on the one hand, all normal events and, on the other, to identify abnormal events according to their position compared to the normal envelope defined. The recorded data are then specifically analyzed to characterize the level of criticism of an event considered to be abnormal. This abnormal event could then be assimilated to a global behavioral drift of the studied behavior, which is different to usual behavior. This approach is applied to helicopters by use of all flight recorded data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Moeyersoms, J; Martens, D				Moeyersoms, Julie; Martens, David			Including high-cardinality attributes in predictive models: A case study in churn prediction in the energy sector	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Predictive modeling; High-cardinality attributes; Chum prediction	CUSTOMER ATTRITION; CLASSIFICATION; SERVICES; NETWORKS; SUPPORT	High-cardinality attributes are categorical attributes that contain a very large number of distinct values, like for example: family names, ZIP codes or bank account numbers. Within a predictive modeling setting, such features could be highly informative as it might be useful to know that people live in the same village or pay with the same bank account number. Despite this notable and intuitive advantage, high-cardinality attributes are rarely used in predictive modeling. The main reason for this is that including these attributes by using traditional transformation methods is either impossible due to anonymization of the data (when using semantic grouping of the values) or will vastly increase the dimensionality of the data set (when using dummy encoding), thereby making it difficult or even impossible for most classification techniques to build prediction models. The main contributions of this work are (1) the introduction of several possible transformation functions coming from different domains and contexts, that allow the inclusion of high-cardinality features in predictive models. (2) Using a unique data set of a large energy company with more than 1 million customers, we show that adding such features indeed improves the predictive performance of the model significantly. Moreover, (3) we empirically demonstrate that having more data leads to better prediction models, which is not observed for "traditional" data. As such, we also contribute to the area of big data analytics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the search for compounds affording good bioactivity, equal importance should also be placed on achieving those with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, the balance and realization of both key properties is an intricate problem that requires great caution. In this editorial, the authors explore the available computational tools in the context of the extant of big data that has borne out via advents of the Omics revolution. As such, the selection of appropriate computational tools for analyzing the vast number of chemical libraries, target proteins and interactomes is the first step toward maximizing the chance for success. However, in order to realize this, it is also necessary to have a solid foundation on the big concepts of drug discovery as well as knowing which tools are available in order to give drug discovery scientists the best opportunity.

Exploiting the manifold regularization (MR), Belkin et al. proposed a new semisupervised classification algorithm: Laplacian support vector machines (LapSVMs), and have shown the state-of-the-art performance in SSL field. To further improve the LapSVMs, we proposed a fast Laplacian SVM (FLapSVM) solver for classification. Compared with the standard LapSVM, our method has several improved advantages as follows: 1) FLapSVM does not need to deal with the extra matrix and burden the computations related to the variable switching, which make it more suitable for large scale problems; 2) FLapSVM's dual problem has the same elegant formulation as that of standard SVMs. This means that the kernel trick can be applied directly into the optimization model; and 3) FLapSVM can be effectively solved by successive overrelaxation technology, which converges linearly to a solution and can process very large data sets that need not reside in memory. In practice, combining the strategies of random scheduling of subproblem and two stopping conditions, the computing speed of FLapSVM is rigidly quicker to that of LapSVM and it is a valid alternative to PLapSVM.

Best Practices: An Electronic Drug Alert Program to Improve Safety in an Accountable Care Environment	JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY			English	Article								BACKGROUND: The accountable care organization (ACO), one of the most promising and talked about new models of care, focuses on improving communication and care transitions by tying potential shared savings to specific clinical and financial benchmarks. An important factor in meeting these benchmarks is an ACO's ability to manage medications in an environment where medical and pharmacy care has been integrated. The program described in this article highlights the critical components of Marshfield Clinic's Drug Safety Alert Program (DSAP), which focuses on prioritizing and communicating safety issues related to medications with the goal of reducing potential adverse drug events. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Once the medication safety concern is identified, it is reviewed to evaluate whether an alert warrants sending prescribers a communication that identifies individual patients or a general communication to all physicians describing the safety concern. Instead of basing its decisions regarding clinician notification about drug alerts on subjective criteria, the Marshfield Clinic's DSAP uses an internally developed scoring system. The scoring system includes criteria developed from previous drug alerts, such as level of evidence, size of population affected, severity of adverse event identified or targeted, litigation risk, available alternatives, and potential for duration of medication use. Each of the 6 criteria is assigned a weight and is scored based upon the content and severity of the alert received. OBSERVATIONS: In its first 12 months, the program targeted 6 medication safety concerns involving the following medications: topiramate, glyburide, simvastatin, citalopram, pioglitazone, and lovastatin. Baseline and follow-up prescribing data were gathered on the targeted medications. Follow-up review of prescribing data demonstrated that the DSAP provided quality up-to-date safety information that led to changes in drug therapy and to decreases in potential adverse drug events. In aggregate, nearly 10,000 total potential adverse drug events were identified with baseline data from the DSAP initiatives, and nearly 8,000 were resolved by changes in prescribing. IMPLICATIONS: Implications and additional thoughts from The Working Group on Optimizing Medication Therapy in Value-Based Healthcare were provided for the following categories: leveraging electronic health records, importance of data collection and reassessment, preventing alert fatigue utilizing various techniques, relevance to ACO quality measurement, and limitations of a retrospective system. RECOMMENDATIONS: While health information technologies have been recognized as a cornerstone for an ACO's success, additional research is needed on comparing these types of technological innovations. Future research should focus on reviewing comparable scoring criteria and alert systems utilized in a variety of ACOs. In addition, an examination of different data mining procedures used within different electronic health record platforms would prove useful to ACOs looking to improve the care of not only the subpopulations with specific metrics associated with them, but their patient population as a whole. The authors also highlight the need for additional research on health information exchanges, including the cost and resource requirements needed to successfully participate in these types of networks.

The deregulated kinase activities and the knowledge of these disorders are of great clinical interest of drug discovery. The most critical issue is the development of safe and efficient disease diagnosis and treatment for less cost and in less time. It is critical to develop innovative approaches that aim at the root cause of a disease, not just its symptoms. Bioinformatics including genetic, genomic, mathematics and computational technologies, has become the most promising option for effective drug discovery, and has showed its potential in early stage of drug-target identification and target validation. It is essential that these aspects are understood and integrated into new methods used in drug discovery for diseases arisen from deregulated kinase activity. This article reviews bioinformatics techniques for protein kinase data management and analysis, kinase pathways and drug targets and describes their potential application in pharma ceutical industry.

Using historical patient information stored in clinical datasets, data mining and machine learning approaches can be applied to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. A common drawback is the absence of information, i.e., missing data, in certain clinical trials. However, most standard prediction methods are not able to handle incomplete samples and, then, missing data imputation is a widely applied approach for solving this inconvenience. Therefore, and taking into account the characteristics of each breast cancer dataset, it is required to perform a detailed analysis to determine the most appropriate imputation and prediction methods in each clinical environment This research work analyzes a real breast cancer dataset from Institute Portuguese of Oncology of Porto with a high percentage of unknown categorical information (most clinical data of the patients are incomplete), which is a challenge in terms of complexity. Four scenarios are evaluated: (I) 5-year survival prediction without imputation and 5-year survival prediction from cleaned dataset with (II) Mode imputation, (Ill) Expectation-Maximization imputation and (IV) K-Nearest Neighbors imputation. Prediction models for breast cancer survivability are constructed using four different methods: K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Experiments are performed in a nested ten-fold cross-validation procedure and, according to the obtained results, the best results are provided by the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm: more than 81% of accuracy and more than 0.78 of area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve, which constitutes very good results in this complex scenario.

In recent years, some studies have used the data mining technique to detect earnings management, with which the accuracy has therefore risen. As such, this study attempts to diagnose the detecting biotechnology industry earnings management by integrating suitable computing models, we first screened the earnings management variables with the principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian network (BN), followed by further constructing the integrated model with the back propagation neural network (BPN) and C5.0 (decision tree) to detect if a company's earnings were seriously manipulated. The empirical results show that combining the EN screening method with C5.0 decision tree has the best performance with an accuracy rate of 98.51%. From the rules set in the final additional testing of the study, it is also found that an enterprise's prior period discretionary accruals play an important role in affecting the serious degree of accrual earnings management.

Zolghadri			A proposed expert system for word sense disambiguation: deductive ambiguity resolution based on data mining and forward chaining	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						expert system; forward chaining; machine translation; ambiguity resolution; word sense disambiguation; association rule mining		One of the major issues in the process of machine translation is the problem of choosing the proper translation for a multi-sense word referred to as word sense disambiguation (WSD). Two commonly used approaches to this problem are statistical and example-based methods. In statistical methods, ambiguity resolution is mostly carried out by making use of some statistics extracted from previously translated documents or dual corpora of source and target languages. Example-based methods follow a similar approach as they also make use of bilingual corpora. However, they perform the task of matching at run-time (i.e. online matching). In this paper, by looking at the WSD problem from a different viewpoint, we propose a system, which consists of two main parts. The first part includes a data mining algorithm, which runs offline and extracts some useful knowledge about the co-occurrences of the words. In this algorithm, each sentence is imagined as a transaction in Market Basket Data Analysis problem, and the words included in a sentence play the role of purchased items. The second part of the system is an expert system whose knowledge base consists of the set of association rules generated by the first part. Moreover, in order to deduce the correct senses of the words, we introduce an efficient algorithm based on forward chaining in order to be used in the inference engine of the proposed expert system. The encouraging performance of the system in terms of precision and recall as well as its efficiency will be analysed and discussed through a set of experiments.	[Fakhrahmad, S. M.; Sadreddini, M.

This paper describes a study to build predictive models to identify parts of the software that have high probability of occurrence of fault. We have considered the effect of thresholds of object-oriented metrics on fault proneness and built predictive models based on the threshold values of the metrics used. Prediction of fault prone classes in earlier phases of software development life cycle will help software developers in allocating the resources efficiently. In this paper, we have used a statistical model derived from logistic regression to calculate the threshold values of object oriented, Chidamber and Kemerer metrics. Thresholds help developers to alarm the classes that fall outside a specified risk level. In this way, using the threshold values, we can divide the classes into two levels of risk - low risk and high risk. We have shown threshold effects at various risk levels and validated the use of these thresholds on a public domain, proprietary dataset, KC1 obtained from NASA and two open source, Promise datasets, IVY and JEdit using various machine learning methods and data mining classifiers. Interproject validation has also been carried out on three different open source datasets, Ant and Tomcat and Sakura. This will provide practitioners and researchers with well formed theories and generalised results. The results concluded that the proposed threshold methodology works well for the projects of similar nature or having similar characteristics.

To progress on this issue, we have proposed a knowledge engineering approach based on human-computer interaction (i.e. user-centred design as defined by the standard ISO 9241-210:2010) and artificial intelligence techniques (i.e. data mining) that involve educators in the process of eliciting educational oriented recommendations. To date, this approach differs from most recommenders in education in focusing on identifying relevant actions to be recommended on e-learning services from a user-centric perspective, thus widening the range of recommendation types. This approach has been used to identify 32 recommendations that consider several types of actions, which focus on promoting active participation of learners and on strengthening the sharing of experiences among peers through the usage of the social services provided by the learning environment. The paper describes where data mining techniques have been applied to complement the user-centred design methods to produce social oriented recommendations in online learning environments.

An important topic in ROC analysis is the ROC convex hull (ROCCH), which is the least convex majorant (LCM) of the empirical ROC curve and covers potential optima for a given set of classifiers. ROCCH maximization problems have been taken as multiobjective optimization problem (MOPs) in some previous work. However, the special characteristics of ROCCH maximization problem makes it different from traditional MOPs. In this paper, the difference will be discussed in detail and a new convex hull-based multiobjective genetic programming (CH-MOGP) is proposed to solve ROCCH maximization problems. Specifically, convex hull-based without redundancy sorting (CWR-sorting) is introduced, which is an indicator-based selection scheme that aims to maximize the area under the convex hull. A novel selection procedure is also proposed based on the proposed sorting scheme. It is hypothesized that by using a tailored indicator-based selection, CH-MOGP becomes more efficient for ROC convex hull approximation than algorithms that compute all Pareto optimal points. Empirical studies are conducted to compare CH-MOGP to both existing machine learning approaches and multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) methods with classical selection schemes. Experimental results show that CH-MOGP outperforms the other approaches significantly.

J	Ozkan, MB; Karagoz, P				Ozkan, Mehmet Baris; Karagoz, Pinar			A Novel Wind Power Forecast Model: Statistical Hybrid Wind Power Forecast Technique (SHWIP)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data Mining; dynamic clustering; K-means; numerical weather prediction; wind power forecasting	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; SPEED	As the result of increasing population and growing technological activities, nonrenewable energy sources, which are the main energy providers, are diminishing day by day. Due to this factor, efforts on efficient utilization of renewable energy sources have increased all over the world. Wind is one of the most significant alternative energy resources. However, in comparison with other renewable energy sources, it is so variable that there is a need for estimating and planning of wind power generation. In this paper, a new statistical short-term (up to 48 h) wind power forecast model, namely statistical hybrid wind power forecast technique (SHWIP), is presented. In the proposed model, weather events are clustered with respect to the most important weather forecast parameters. It also combines the power forecasts obtained from three different numerical weather prediction (NWP) sources and produces a hybridized final forecast. The proposed model has been in operation at the Wind Power Monitoring and Forecast System for Turkey (RITM), and the results of the newmodel are compared with well-known statistical models and physical models in the literature. The most important characteristics of the proposed model is the need for a lesser amount of historical data while constructing the mathematical model compared with the other statistical models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). To produce a reliable forecast, ANN and SVM need at least 1 year of historical data; on the other hand, the proposed SHWIP method's results are applicable even under 1 month of training data, and this is an important feature for the forecast of the newly established wind power plants (WPPs).

This paper proposes a novel pattern discovery (PD)-based fuzzy classification scheme for the DSA. First, the PD algorithm is improved by integrating the proposed centroid deviation analysis technique and the prior knowledge of the training data set. This improvement can enhance the performance when it is applied to extract the patterns of data from a training data set. Secondly, based on the results of the improved PD algorithm, a fuzzy logic-based classification method is developed to predict the security index of a given power system operating point. In addition, the proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 50-machine system and is compared with other state-of-the-art classification techniques. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed model is more effective in the DSA of a power system.

This is an interdisciplinary method that integrates the researches of optics, data mining, and image processing. Because objects have unique but imperfect surfaces, their laser speckle is capable of providing suitable identifiable features for authentication. In our method, matching points among speckle images acquired from one plastic card are extracted by scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). The spatial relations among the matching points are then transformed to 9 direction lower triangular (9DLT) representations. Then, the Apriori algorithm mines frequent patterns so a useful association rule is obtained as the feature to identify the similarity between each of the speckle images for the purpose of authenticity verification. The proposed method is especially robust in the cases of card displacement and luminance change resulted from laser attenuation. Experimental results show that the proposed method has promising results and outperforms existing methods in identification accuracy.

ITS rely on accurate transit infrastructure data that often contain erroneous information (e.g., inconsistencies or is out of date). In this paper, we propose a new methodology that makes use of GPS traces to automatically detect or correct bus stop locations, reconstruct bus route shapes, and estimate time schedules. The methodology performs different steps: 1) data cleaning and detection of trips; 2) bus stop extraction through data mining techniques; 3) route shape reconstruction; and 4) time schedule estimation.

Paradoxically, in veterinary medicine, lack of data requires integrating available data to make meaningful population inferences. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling is a useful tool to apply meta-analysis to diverse pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of veterinary drugs. This review provides a summary of the characteristics of PK data of veterinary drugs and how integration of these data may differ from human PK studies. The limits of meta-analysis include the sophistication of data mining, and generation of misleading results caused by biased or poor quality data. The overriding strength of meta-analysis applied to this field is that robust statistical analysis of the diverse sparse data sets inherent to veterinary medicine applications can be accomplished, thereby allowing population inferences to be made.

Mobile devices are resource and energy limited; they can rely on cloud computing resource to perform computationally intensive operations such as data mining and multimedia processing. This paper presents the cost and energy aware service provisioning scheme for mobile client in mobile cloud, which includes two-stage optimization process. In the first-stage optimization process, the mobile cloud user gives the unique optimal payment to the cloud provider under the cost and energy constraint and optimizes its benefit. In the second-stage optimization process, mobile cloud provider runs multiple VMs to execute the jobs for mobile cloud users; the cloud providers also need to maximize the revenue. The cost and energy aware service provisioning algorithm in mobile cloud is proposed. The proposed algorithm is involved with the cloud datacenter provider's optimization and mobile cloud user's optimization, which are conducted by two routines. In the simulation, the proposed cost and energy aware mobile cloud service provisioning algorithm is compared with other related algorithm.

A GMM-based clustering algorithm models a dataset with a mixture of multiple Gaussian components and estimates the model parameters using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Recently, a new Locally Consistent GMM (LCGMM) has been proposed to improve the clustering performance by exploiting the local manifold structure of the data using a p nearest neighbor graph. In addition to the underlying manifold structure, many other forms of prior knowledge may guide the clustering process and improve the performance. In this paper, we introduce a Semi-Supervised LCGMM (Semi-LCGMM), where the prior knowledge is provided in the form of class labels of partial data. In particular, the new Semi-LCGMM incorporates the prior knowledge into the maximum likelihood function of the original LCGMM, and the model parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. It is worth noting that, in our algorithm, each class may be modeled by multiple Gaussian components while in the unsupervised setting each class is modeled by a single Gaussian component. Our algorithm has shown promising results in many different applications, including clustering breast cancer data, heart disease data, handwritten digit images, human face images, and image segmentation.

J	Yom, S				Yom, Sean			From Methodology to Practice: Inductive Iteration in Comparative Research	COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES			English	Article						qualitative methods; quantitative methods	VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS; P-VALUES; PUBLICATION; SOCIOLOGY; SCIENCE; ECONOMETRICS; INFERENCE; POLITICS; HISTORY; MODEL	Most methods in comparative politics prescribe a deductive template of research practices that begins with proposing hypotheses, proceeds into analyzing data, and finally concludes with confirmatory tests. In reality, many scholars move back and forth between theory and data in creating causal explanations, beginning not with hypotheses but hunches and constantly revising their propositions in response to unexpected discoveries. Used transparently, such inductive iteration has contributed to causal knowledge in comparative-historical analysis, analytic narratives, and statistical approaches. Encouraging such practices across methodologies not only adds to the toolbox of comparative analysis but also casts light on how much existing work often lacks transparency. Because successful hypothesis testing facilitates publication, yet as registration schemes and mandatory replication do not exist, abusive practices such as data mining and selective reporting find easy cover behind the language of deductive proceduralism. Productive digressions from the deductive paradigm, such as inductive iteration, should not have the stigma associated with such impropriety.

To deal with explosively growing amounts of data, data analytics has emerged as a critical technology related to computing, signal processing, and information networking. In this paper, a formalism is considered in which data are modeled as a generalized social network and communication theory and information theory are thereby extended to data analytics. First, the creation of an equalizer to optimize information transfer between two data variables is considered, and financial data are used to demonstrate the advantages of this approach. Then, an information coupling approach based on information geometry is applied for dimensionality reduction, with a pattern recognition example to illustrate the effectiveness of this formalism. These initial trials suggest the potential of communication theoretic data analytics for a wide range of applications.

Fast HEVC Encoding Decisions Using Data Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Computational complexity; data mining (DM); decision trees; early termination; High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)	EFFICIENCY VIDEO ENCODERS; MODE DECISION; CODING HEVC; COMPLEXITY; COMPRESSION	The High Efficiency Video Coding standard provides improved compression ratio in comparison with its predecessors at the cost of large increases in the encoding computational complexity. An important share of this increase is due to the new flexible partitioning structures, namely the coding trees, the prediction units, and the residual quadtrees, with the best configurations decided through an exhaustive rate-distortion optimization (RDO) process. In this paper, we propose a set of procedures for deciding whether the partition structure optimization algorithm should be terminated early or run to the end of an exhaustive search for the best configuration. The proposed schemes are based on decision trees obtained through data mining techniques. By extracting intermediate data, such as encoding variables from a training set of video sequences, three sets of decision trees are built and implemented to avoid running the RDO algorithm to its full extent. When separately implemented, these schemes achieve average computational complexity reductions (CCRs) of up to 50% at a negligible cost of 0.56% in terms of Bjontegaard Delta (BD) rate increase. When the schemes are jointly implemented, an average CCR of up to 65% is achieved, with a small BD-rate increase of 1.36%. Extensive experiments and comparisons with similar works demonstrate that the proposed early termination schemes achieve the best rate-distortion-complexity tradeoffs among all the compared works.

Similarities between PD pulses are acquired by comparisons of the corresponding ST-amplitude (STA) matrices, which are input of APC to realize the PD pulses separation and obtain two sub-groups of PD pulses having similar time-frequency characteristics. A classification-based model for separation results validation are developed using a support vector machine with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) classifier and 27 phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) statistical features. Artificial defect models are made to simulate two PD sources simultaneously active. Several PD data of different two simultaneous PD sources are acquired in laboratory and adopted for algorithm testing. It is shown that ST computes very fast and is suitable for online PD applications. The separation results of PD data produced in laboratory are verified by the developed validation model, which demonstrate that ST combined with APC can effectively eliminate pulse-shaped noises (PSN) and separate pulses of two simultaneous PD sources. Comparisons with typical separation methods from the state of the art provide better separation performance of the proposed ST combined with APC algorithm for two simultaneous PD sources. The obtained results in this work provide a solid basis for the data mining technique that can be used to facilitate PD diagnosis of transformers.

The approach uses an object-oriented connectivity algorithm that segments gridded near-global satellite precipitation data into four-dimensional (4D) objects (longitude, latitude, time, and intensity). These precipitation systems have distinct spatiotemporal properties that are counted, tracked, described, and stored in a searchable database. A case study of western United States precipitation systems is performed, demonstrating the unique properties and capabilities of this object-oriented database. The precipitation dataset used in the case study is the University of California, Irvine, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) from 1 March 2000 to 1 January 2011. A search of the database for all western United States precipitation systems during this time period returns 626 precipitation systems as objects. By analyzing these systems as segmented objects, joint interactions of the selected climate phenomena 1) Arctic Oscillation (AO), 2) Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), and 3) El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on precipitation can be shown. They directly show the increased/decreased likelihood of having precipitation systems occurring over the western United States (monthly count) during phases of these climate phenomena. It is found that specific climate phenomena impact the monthly count of the events differently, and that the joint interaction of climate phenomena of the AO-MJO and AO-ENSO is important, especially during certain months of the year. It is also found that these interactions impact the physical features of the precipitation systems themselves.

On an introductory level, it provides some historical background to the development of data mining, sketches its relationship to other disciplines, and introduces a number of tasks that are typically considered data mining tasks. It next focuses on one particular aspect that may play a larger role in data mining, namely, declarativeness. Despite the fact that many different data mining tools have been developed, this variety still offers less flexibility to the user than desired. It also creates a problem of choice: which tool is most suitable for a given problem? Declarative data mining may provide a solution for this. In other domains of computer science, declarative languages have led to major leaps forward in technology. Early results show that in data mining, too, declarative approaches are feasible and may make the process easier, more flexible, more efficient, and more correct.

Here, media attention, expressed by Google News reference volume, and changes in information seeking behavior, expressed by Google Trends, were used to estimate the length of a teachable moment for 2004-2011 Nobel Prize announcements. On average, Nobel Prize announcements attracted the attention of online users for no longer than a week. News coverage declined slower and occasionally displayed seasonal trends. There was a 50% drop in searches between the day of the announcement and the following day, and an analogous pattern for news coverage of all laureates varying for different disciplines. The affordances of using publicly available online data to identify the most effective teachable moments relating to science are discussed.

Historically, post-licensure safety monitoring has been accomplished using passive reporting systems and by conducting formal Phase IV randomized trials or large epidemiological studies, also known as safety surveillance or pharmacovigilance studies. However, crucial gaps in the safety evidence base provided by these approaches have led to high profile product withdrawals and growing public concern about unknown health risks associated with licensed products. To address the limitations of existing surveillance systems and to facilitate more accurate and rapid detection of safety problems, new systems involving active surveillance of large, population-based cohorts using observational health care databases are being developed. In this article, we review common statistical methods that have been employed previously for post-licensure safety monitoring, including data mining and sequential hypothesis testing, and assess which methods may be promising for potential use within this newly proposed prospective observational cohort monitoring framework. We discuss gaps in existing approaches and identify areas where methodological development is needed to improve the success of safety surveillance efforts in this setting.

Unfortunately, there has been no translation of this knowledge into the development of novel and improved pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorders. We comment on some of the reasons for failed drug discovery in psychiatry, particularly on the use of ill-suited disease models and on the use of diagnostic constructs unrelated to the underlying biological mechanisms. Furthermore, we argue that the use of human genetic findings together with biologically informed phenotypes and advanced data-mining methodology will catalyze the identification of promising drug targets and, finally, will lead to improved therapeutic outcomes.

Gene introgression through hybridization with related, non-indigenous poplar taxa may additionally reduce the population size and genetic diversity of native black poplar. We assessed the exposure of native black poplar in Slovenia to genetic introgression using a combination of habitat and gene flow models. The habitat model was built with data mining on forest inventory data employing classification decision trees. Dispersion distances for pollen, seeds and vegetative parts at 0.9% and 0.001% of adventitious presence threshold were assessed using modified gene flow models. To protect native black poplar, protection zones around native black poplar stands were proposed. Since the population of native black poplar may be exposed to various introgression pressures (e.g., the vicinity of exotic, genetically compatible poplar plantations, or feral populations potentially initiated along transport corridors or rivers), we assessed the intensity of introgression pressure by intersecting the occupied and potential habitat with the introgression pressure areas. In 2010, native black poplar occurred on 43,756 ha (2.2% of the total Slovenian territory), while the suitable habitat extended up to 108,724 ha (5.4%). The protection zones were 0.5-4.6 times larger than the occupied and potential habitat depending on the selected threshold and the type of dispersion vector. In the worst case scenario, 45.1% of protection zones would be exposed to high hybridization pressure. We recommend extending the proposed methodological approach to other regions with endangered black poplar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, Y; Zhang, B; Zhang, CS				Zhang, Yuesong; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Changsheng			Composite Service Reselection Method in Correlation Context	International Journal of Web Services Research			English	Article						Correlated Abstract Services; Correlation Services; Qos; Reselection of Composite Service		Reselection of composite service is one of the core research issues in service computing field. In practical scenarios, because of business relations between service providers or the restrictions of service physical deployment environment, there may be correlation among services. Its existence affects the quality of services used together, makes corresponding abstract services potentially correlating with each other. This leads the QoS used to determine the bindings between abstract and concrete services to be inaccurate, and the selected services would not be the optimal one in actual execution environment. In this paper, the QoS-Correlation services are extracted from the execution log through Apriori data mining method. Then, the authors capture the correlated abstract services to present such correlations in a higher level of abstraction regardless of actual services. In the final, the correlated abstract services will be regarded as a task unit, and the corresponding correlation services of each task unit as its candidate services set. They also propose a correlation-aware service selection method in the paper. The method includes runtime reselection whenever the actual QoS largely deviates from the estimates.

Study design We searched VAERS for US reports after Hib vaccines among reports received from January 1, 1990, to December 1, 2013. We reviewed a random sample of reports and accompanying medical records for reports classified as serious. All reports of death were reviewed. Physicians assigned a primary clinical category to each reviewed report. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify AEs that were disproportionally reported after Hib vaccines. Results VAERS received 29 747 reports after Hib vaccines; 5179 (17%) were serious, including 896 reports of deaths. Median age was 6 months (range 0-1022 months). Sudden infant death syndrome was the stated cause of death in 384 (51%) of 749 death reports with autopsy/death certificate records. The most common nondeath serious AE categories were neurologic (80; 37%), other noninfectious (46; 22%) (comprising mainly constitutional signs and symptoms); and gastrointestinal (39; 18%) conditions. No new safety concerns were identified after clinical review of reports of AEs that exceeded the data mining statistical threshold. Conclusion Review of VAERS reports did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns for Hib vaccines.

MARKERMINER 1.0: A NEW APPLICATION FOR PHYLOGENETIC MARKER DEVELOPMENT USING ANGIOSPERM TRANSCRIPTOMES	APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; introns; marker development; next-generation sequencing; phylogenetics; single-copy nuclear genes; transcriptomes	PLANT SYSTEMATICS; FLOWERING PLANTS; GENERATION; ALIGNMENT; MAFFT; ARABIDOPSIS; SEQUENCES; FAMILIES; GENOMICS; GENE	Premise of the study: Targeted sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms offers enormous potential for plant systematics by enabling economical acquisition of multilocus data sets that can resolve difficult phylogenetic problems. However, because discovery of single-copy nuclear (SCN) loci from NGS data requires both bioinformatics skills and access to high-performance computing resources, the application of NGS data has been limited. Methods and Results: We developed MarkerMiner 1.0, a fully automated, open-access bioinformatic workflow and application for discovery of SCN loci in angiosperms. Our new tool identified as many as 1993 SCN loci from transcriptomic data sampled as part of four independent test cases representing marker development projects at different phylogenetic scales. Conclusions: MarkerMiner is an easy-to-use and effective tool for discovery of putative SCN loci. It can be run locally or via the Web, and its tabular and alignment outputs facilitate efficient downstream assessments of phylogenetic utility, locus selection, intron-exon boundary prediction, and primer or probe development.

Data mining in the reduction of the number of places of experiments for plant cultivates	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Data mining; Maize cultivation; Clustering; Artificial neural networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; MODEL	When a new plant cultivar is developed, it needs to be evaluated in relation to different environmental conditions before being commercially released. A set of experiments systematically was conducted at various locations with the purpose of evaluating the performance of the plants, in different soil, climate and elevation conditions. In these experiments, the plant culture development was monitored throughout the entire planting cycle. It is important to note that these experiments are very expensive and the aim of this work is to verify the possibility of reducing the number of places of the experiments without losing of representativeness in the evaluation of planted cultivars. To achieve this goal, the interaction among soil, climate and plant was modeled and the major components in each of these systems were considered. Neural computational models were also developed in order to estimate data regarding the relative air humidity. Using the partitioned clustering technique (k-medians), clusters (planting sites) were built in such a way that, according to the methodology proposed were similar in terms of soil, climate and plant behavior. The consistency of the formed clusters was evaluated by two criteria and the recommendation for reducing the cultivation sites was presented. By analyzing the results, it was possible to verify that the clustering process is not sufficient for deciding which planting locations should be omitted. It is necessary to count on complementary evaluation criteria associated with the production and cultivar ranking. In this work, the national competition experiments of maize cultivars in Brazil are considered as case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A multi-layer perceptron ensemble is selected to build the total energy model integrating three indoor air quality models, the facility temperature model, the facility relative humidity model, and the facility CO2 concentration model. To balance the energy consumption and the indoor air quality, a quad-objective optimization problem is constructed. The problem is solved with a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm producing control settings of supply air temperature and static pressure of the air handling unit. By assigning different weights to the objectives to the model, the generated control settings optimize HVAC system with the trade-off between the energy consumption and the facility thermal comfort. Significant energy savings can be obtained even with air quality constraint. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MCH is released into general circulation from the neurohypophysis, which causes pigment aggregation in the skin chromatophores. Recently, a novel MCH (MCH2) precursor gene, which is orthologous to the mammalian MCH precursor gene, has been identified in some teleosts using genomic data mining. The physiological function of MCH2 remains unclear. In the present study, we cloned the cDNA for MCH2 from barfin flounder, Verasper moseri. The putative prepro-MCH2 contains 25 amino acids of MCH2 peptide region. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a high resolution mass analyzer were used for confirming the amino acid sequences of MCH1 and MCH2 peptides from the pituitary extract. In vitro synthesized MCH1 and MCH2 induced pigment aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. A mammalian cell-based assay indicated that both MCH1 and MCH2 functionally interacted with both the MCH receptor types 1 and 2. Mch1 and mch2 are exclusively expressed in the brain and pituitary. The levels of brain mch2 transcript were three times higher in the fish that were chronically acclimated to a white background than those acclimated to a black background. These results suggest that in V. moseri, MCH1 and MCH2 are involved in the response to changes in background colors, during the process of chromatophore control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In ruminants, this period is associated with elongation of the extra-embryonic tissues, gastrulation of the embryonic disk and cross-talk with the endometrium. Recent data have prompted the need for accurate staging of the bovine conceptus and shown that asynchrony between elongation and gastrulation processes may account for pregnancy failure. Data mining of endometrial gene signatures has allowed the identification of molecular pathways and new factors regulated by the conceptus (e.g. FOXL2, SOCS6). Interferon-tau has been recognised to be the major signal of pregnancy recognition, but prostaglandins and lysophospholipids have also been demonstrated to be critical players at the conceptus-endometrium interface. Interestingly, up-regulation of interferon-regulated gene expression has been identified in circulating immune cells during implantation, making these factors a potential source of non-invasive biomarkers for early pregnancy. Distinct endometrial responses have been shown to be elicited by embryos produced by artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation or somatic cell nuclear transfer. These findings have led to the concept that endometrium is an early biosensor of embryo quality. This biological property first demonstrated in cattle has been recently extended and associated with embryo selection in humans. Hence, compromised or suboptimal endometrial quality can subtly or deeply affect embryo development, with visible and sometimes severe consequences for placentation, foetal development, pregnancy outcome and the long-term health of the offspring.

We conducted a series of surveys to examine the relationships among their experiences and activities on the day of the earthquake, their physical, mental, and economic problems following the disaster, and how their problems changed over time. The initial survey was performed in April 2011, with three follow-up surveys in July 2011, February 2012, and April 2013. The initial survey focused on students' experiences and living conditions during the disaster, which contained questions on their locations and circumstances, family circumstances, lives after the earthquake, voluntary works, physical or mental health problems, and desire for counseling. The follow-up surveys included new items regarding their circumstances, changes in their health problems, and their desire for economic assistance. Students who answered the first survey to the 4th one, with response rates in the following bracket, were as follows: 472 (28.0%), 640 (29.9%), 681 (36.0%), and 678 (39.0%), respectively. Six months after the earthquake, about 20% having experienced physical and/or mental problems. Although there was a trend toward a reduction in suffering and health problems over time, some students' conditions remained unchanged or worsened. It is notable that students who had participated in voluntary activities, despite their own suffering of harm and distress, were identified as the group that required the closest attention. Our present results can be applied to appropriate supports for students in future large-scale disasters.

Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label, and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this article, we generalize the ERM principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound, we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a nonconvex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. We further extend our method to multiclass active learning by introducing novel pseudolabels in the multiclass case and developing an efficient algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Until recently, metabolic engineering in plants relied on the laborious testing of ad hoc modifications to achieve desirable changes in the metabolic profile. However, technological advances in data mining, modeling, multigene engineering and genome editing are now taking away much of the guesswork by allowing the impact of modifications to be predicted more accurately. In this review we discuss recent developments in knowledge-based metabolic engineering strategies, that is the gathering and mining of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data to generate models of metabolic pathways that help to define and refine optimal intervention strategies.

Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistics. One of the data mining tasks is anomaly detection which is the analysis of large quantities of data to identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern. Anomaly detection is applicable in a variety of domains, e.g., fraud detection, fault detection, system health monitoring but this article focuses on application of anomaly detection in the field of network intrusion detection. The main goal of the article is to prove that an entropy-based approach is suitable to detect modern botnet-like malware based on anomalous patterns in network. This aim is achieved by realization of the following points: (i) preparation of a concept of original entropy-based network anomaly detection method, (ii) implementation of the method, (iii) preparation of original dataset, (iv) evaluation of the method.

In this paper, we presents a novel method for feature selection with the use of opposite sign test (OST) as a local search for the electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm, denoted as improved electromagnetism-like mechanism (IEM) algorithm. Nearest neighbor algorithm is served as a classifier for the wrapper method. The proposed IEM algorithm is compared with nine popular feature selection and classification methods. Forty-six datasets from the UCI repository and eight gene expression microarray datasets are collected for comprehensive evaluation. Non-parametric statistical tests are conducted to justify the performance of the methods in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa index. The results confirm that the proposed IEM method is superior to the common state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we apply IEM to predict the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after a gestational DM. Our research helps identify the risk factors for this disease; accordingly accurate diagnosis and prognosis can be achieved to reduce the morbidity and mortality rate caused by DM.

For this reason, the identification of the relationships between diseases and genes is important in biology. We propose a method called LGscore, which identifies disease-related genes using Google data and literature data. To implement this method, first, we construct a disease-related gene network using text-mining results. We then extract gene-gene interactions based on co-occurrences in abstract data obtained from PubMed, and calculate the weights of edges in the gene network by means of Z-scoring. The weights contain two values: the frequency and the Google search results. The frequency value is extracted from literature data, and the Google search result is obtained using Google. We assign a score to each gene through a network analysis. We assume that genes with a large number of links and numerous Google search results and frequency values are more likely to be involved in disease. For validation, we investigated the top 20 inferred genes for five different diseases using answer sets. The answer sets comprised six databases that contain information on disease-gene relationships. We identified a significant number of disease-related genes as well as candidate genes for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. Our method was up to 40% more accurate than existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is especially true for visual data and highly detailed data too complex to be easily understood in raw forms. In this work, we present several of our recent interdisciplinary works in data mining solar image repositories and discuss the over-arching need for effective visualizations of data, metadata, and results along the way. First, we explain the complex characteristics and overwhelming abundance of image data being produced by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Then we discuss the wide scope of solar data mining and highlight visual results from work in data labeling, classification, and clustering. Lastly, we present an overview of the first-ever Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system for solar images, and conclude with a brief look at the direction of our future research.

Data Mining applied to Forensic Speaker Identification	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Data Mining; Classifiers; Ensemble Methods; Speaker Recognition; Data Fusion	TALKER RECOGNITION; POSITION STATEMENT; MODEL TREES; VERIFICATION; SPEECH	In this paper we analyze the advantages of using data mining techniques and tools for data fusion in forensic speaker recognition. Segmental and suprasegmental features were employed in 28 different classifiers, in order to compare their performances. The selected classifiers have different learning techniques: lazy or instance-based, eager and ensemble. Two approaches were employed on the classification task: the use of all features and the use of a feature subset, selected with a gain ratio methodology. The best performances, with all features, were obtained by three classifiers: Logistic Model Tree (eager), LogitBoost (ensemble) and Multilayer Perceptron (eager). Support Vector Machine (eager) proved to be a good classifier if a Pearson VII function-based universal kernel was used. When low dimensional features were selected, ensemble classifiers exceeded the performance of all others classifiers. Segmental and tone features demonstrated the best speaker discrimination capabilities, followed by duration and quality voice features. Evaluation was performed on Argentine-Spanish voice samples from the Speech_Dat database recorded on a fixed telephone environment. Different recording sessions and channels for the test segments were added and the Z-norm procedure was applied for channel compensation.	[Univaso, P.; Gurlekian, J.

Downscaling 250-m MODIS Growing Season NDVI Based on Multiple-Date Landsat Images and Data Mining Approaches	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							PLATTE RIVER-BASIN; ECOSYSTEM PERFORMANCE ANOMALIES; ESTIMATING ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; LEAF-AREA INDEX; MULTITEMPORAL MODIS; UNITED-STATES; COVER; VEGETATION; REFLECTANCE; CLASSIFICATION	The satellite-derived growing season time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) has been used as a proxy for vegetation biomass productivity. The 250-m GSN data estimated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors have been used for terrestrial ecosystem modeling and monitoring. High temporal resolution with a wide range of wavelengths make the MODIS land surface products robust and reliable. The long-term 30-m Landsat data provide spatial detailed information for characterizing human-scale processes and have been used for land cover and land change studies. The main goal of this study is to combine 250-m MODIS GSN and 30-m Landsat observations to generate a quality-improved high spatial resolution (30-m) GSN database. A rule-based piecewise regression GSN model based on MODIS and Landsat data was developed. Results show a strong correlation between predicted GSN and actual GSN (r = 0.97, average error = 0.026). The most important Landsat variables in the GSN model are Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) in May and August. The derived MODIS-Landsat-based 30-m GSN map provides biophysical information for moderate-scale ecological features. This multiple sensor study retains the detailed seasonal dynamic information captured by MODIS and leverages the high-resolution information from Landsat, which will be useful for regional ecosystem studies.

Surveillance and detection of unusual events in toxicovigilance: Review of relevant methods	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			French	Review						Surveillance; Detection; Vigilance; Toxicovigilance; Poisoning center; Data mining	STATISTICAL SIGNAL-DETECTION; DATA-MINING METHODOLOGIES; REPORTING SYSTEM; PUBLIC VERSION; SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; DATABASE; SAFETY; IMPLEMENTATION; ASSOCIATIONS	Background. - Declared cases of exposures related to potential toxic agents are reported through a national database, the French Network of Poison Centers, and account on average for 200,000 cases per year, including 75,000 to 80,000 symptomatic cases. These data are currently used to investigate signals from local, national or international institutional partners (such as hospitals, local health authorities, and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed). Our objective is to complete this classical toxicovigilance activity through the automated detection of unexpected or unusual events in order to identify precociously signals representing potential threats for public health. To reach this objective, the inventory of surveillance and detection methods of unexpected events is necessary. Methods. - A literature review was conducted via Scopus1 and Pubmed1 databases, completed with grey literature and data available on worldwide vigilance systems' websites. Results. - The most commonly used methods are disproportional measures in the field of pharmacovigilance, some of which are subject to a routine detection at regular time intervals. Criteria of signal generation differ from one system to another, which have implemented data filtering strategies before or after analysis, in order to decrease the number of generated signals and improve their priority level. These signals are then transmitted to an experts committee for a clinical and epidemiological evaluation, and at times, for informing the patient's medical records. We also notice an interest in other approaches such as surveillance methods of temporal series or symbolic methods for associative rules extraction between one or more drugs and one or more adverse effects, with the possibility to include other types of variables, such a demographic data. The developments of probabilistic-based algorithms have also been recently developed, opening new opportunities. Conclusion. - These surveillance and detection methods are of high interest for the automated detection of signals from the French toxicovigilance network. The initial step to developing these methods consists in studying the statistical quality of data and targeting the needs and expectations of the toxicovigilance network for what we want and what we can detect.

We report three conclusions: (1) analysts' forecast information was rewarded by the global market between January 1997 and December 2011; (2) analysts' forecasts can be combined with reported fundamental data, such as earnings, book value, cash flow and sales, and also with momentum, in a stock selection model for identifying mispriced securities; and (3) the portfolio returns of the multi-factor risk-controlled portfolios allow us to reject the null hypothesis for the data mining corrections test. The earnings forecasting variable dominates our composite model in terms of its impact on stock selection. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this regard, the major purpose of this study is to investigate the users' preferential factors of ease of workplace learning in Korean WLS business organizations. A total of 517 employees from five major conglomerate groups in Korea participated in a Web-based training course and answered the survey questionnaire. Four feedback and service related factors are important, which can be explained by high-context culture of Korea. With the understandings of conservative cultural effect of high-context in Korea, instructors can start to find the required special designs considering feedback and service-related factors as well as contents for successful Web-based learning systems.

Automatic abstraction of imaging observations with their characteristics from mammography reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							RADIOLOGY REPORTS; DATA SYSTEM; COREFERENCE RESOLUTION; BREAST-CANCER; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; EXTRACTION; MICROCALCIFICATIONS; RETRIEVAL; DIAGNOSIS	Background Radiology reports are usually narrative, unstructured text, a format which hinders the ability to input report contents into decision support systems. In addition, reports often describe multiple lesions, and it is challenging to automatically extract information on each lesion and its relationships to characteristics, anatomic locations, and other information that describes it. The goal of our work is to develop natural language processing (NLP) methods to recognize each lesion in free-text mammography reports and to extract its corresponding relationships, producing a complete information frame for each lesion. Materials and methods We built an NLP information extraction pipeline in the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) NLP toolkit. Sequential processing modules are executed, producing an output information frame required for a mammography decision support system. Each lesion described in the report is identified by linking it with its anatomic location in the breast. In order to evaluate our system, we selected 300 mammography reports from a hospital report database. Results The gold standard contained 797 lesions, and our system detected 815 lesions (780 true positives, 35 false positives, and 17 false negatives). The precision of detecting all the imaging observations with their modifiers was 94.9, recall was 90.9, and the F measure was 92.8. Conclusions Our NLP system extracts each imaging observation and its characteristics from mammography reports. Although our application focuses on the domain of mammography, we believe our approach can generalize to other domains and may narrow the gap between unstructured clinical report text and structured information extraction needed for data mining and decision support.

Based on the high separation ability of RRLC and full scan of MS analysis, MSE was developed to generate product ion spectrum without precursor ion selecting. Mixture of drug degradation products was separated by RRLC, and then the eluate was analyzed by MS with collision energy switching to acquire both of molecule ions and product ions. Mass defect filter (MDF) was used to discover drug degradation products from raw data. Therefore, the relative quantity and structure information of drug degradation products were obtained. The proposed method has been demonstrated as an effective tool for the impurity profiling and drug quality control.

Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard, however results take weeks to process. Scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Consequently there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately and quickly diagnose the disease. Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. Objectives: In order to increase the classification accuracy of AIRS, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates a support vector machine into AIRS for diagnosing tuberculosis. Patients and Methods: Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory of Iran were used as the benchmark data set, with the sample size of 175 (114 positive samples for TB and 60 samples in the negative group). The strategy of this study was to ensure representativeness, thus it was important to have an adequate number of instances for both TB and non-TB cases. The classification performance was measured through 10-fold cross-validation, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), sensitivity and specificity, Youden's Index, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), a machine learning program for windows. Results: With an accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, Youden's Index of 1, Area Under the Curve of 1, and RMSE of 0, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis patients. Conclusions: There have been many researches that aimed at diagnosing tuberculosis faster and more accurately. Our results described a model for diagnosing tuberculosis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This model can be used as an additional tool for experts in medicine to diagnose TBC more accurately and quickly.

In this paper, we address four major challenges posed, namely, infinite length, extraction of knowledge with single scan, processing time, and accuracy. Since data streams are infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Mining such streaming data for knowledge acquisition is a unique opportunity and even a tough task. A streaming algorithm must scan data once and extract knowledge. While mining data streams, processing time, and accuracy have become two important aspects. In this paper, we propose PSTMiner which considers the nature of data streams and provides an efficient classifier for predicting the class label of real data streams. It has greater potential when compared with many existing classification techniques. Additionally, we propose a compact novel tree structure called PSTree (Prefix Streaming Tree) for storing data. Extensive experiments conducted on 24 real datasets from UCI repository and synthetic datasets from MOA (Massive Online Analysis) show that PSTMiner is consistent. Empirical results show that performance of PSTMiner is highly competitive in terms of accuracy and performance time when compared with other approaches under windowed streaming model.

Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e. plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods. In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.

Drawing on a multi-method study including data mining of 561 client records and 20 interviews with service providers, the distinctive nature of older people's homelessness is demonstrated. Three pathways to homelessness in later life are identified. With close to 70 per cent of the participants having had a conventional housing history, the article reveals in rich detail the circumstances surrounding critical housing incidents for older Australians. It shows that older people are at risk when they are evicted, are unable to continue to living with family, face unaffordable rent in the private rental market, cannot continue living in inaccessible rental housing, as well as experience a breakdown in an important relationship. The results provide key material to inform the design of services and policy initiatives to prevent and address homelessness for older Australians.

J	Sakai, T; Tamura, K				Sakai, Tatsuhiro; Tamura, Keiichi			Real-time analysis application for identifying bursty local areas related to emergency topics	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Spatiotemporal clustering; Density-based clustering; Social media; Naive Bayes; Burst detection		Since social media started getting more attention from users on the Internet, social media has been one of the most important information source in the world. Especially, with the increasing popularity of social media, data posted on social media sites are rapidly becoming collective intelligence, which is a term used to refer to new media that is displacing traditional media. In this paper, we focus on geotagged tweets on the Twitter site. These geotagged tweets are referred to as georeferenced documents because they include not only a short text message, but also the documents' posting time and location. Many researchers have been tackling the development of new data mining techniques for georeferenced documents to identify and analyze emergency topics, such as natural disasters, weather, diseases, and other incidents. In particular, the utilization of geotagged tweets to identify and analyze natural disasters has received much attention from administrative agencies recently because some case studies have achieved compelling results. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time analysis application for identifying bursty local areas related to emergency topics. The aim of our new application is to provide new platforms that can identify and analyze the localities of emergency topics. The proposed application is composed of three core computational intelligence techniques: the Naive Bayes classifier technique, the spatiotemporal clustering technique, and the burst detection technique. Moreover, we have implemented two types of application interface: a Web application interface and an android application interface. To evaluate the proposed application, we have implemented a real-time weather observation system embedded the proposed application. we used actual crawling geotagged tweets posted on the Twitter site. The weather observation system successfully detected bursty local areas related to observed emergency weather topics.

Severity is important for distinguishing among phenotypes; however other severity indices classify patient-level severity (e.g., mild vs. acute dermatitis) rather than phenotype-level severity (e.g., acne vs. myocardial infarction). Phenotype-level severity is independent of the individual patient's state and is relative to other phenotypes. Further, phenotype-level severity does not change based on the individual patient. For example, acne is mild at the phenotype-level and relative to other phenotypes. Therefore, a given patient may have a severe form of acne (this is the patient-level severity), but this does not effect its overall designation as a mild phenotype at the phenotype-level. Methods: We present a method for classifying severity at the phenotype-level that uses the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms. Our method is called the Classification Approach for Extracting Severity Automatically from Electronic Health Records (CAESAR). CAESAR combines multiple severity measures - number of comorbidities, medications, procedures, cost, treatment time, and a proportional index term. CAESAR employs a random forest algorithm and these severity measures to discriminate between severe and mild phenotypes. Results: Using a random forest algorithm and these severity measures as input, CAESAR differentiates between severe and mild phenotypes (sensitivity = 91.67, specificity = 77.78) when compared to a manually evaluated reference standard (k = 0.716). Conclusions: CAESAR enables researchers to measure phenotype severity from EHRs to identify phenotypes that are important for comparative effectiveness research.

J	Dawson, P; Gailis, R; Meehan, A				Dawson, Peter; Gailis, Ralph; Meehan, Alaster			Detecting disease outbreaks using a combined Bayesian network and particle filter approach	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Disease surveillance; Syndromic surveillance; Plague; Epidemics		Evaluating whether a disease outbreak has occurred based on limited information in medical records is inherently a probabilistic problem. This paper presents a methodology for consistently analysing the probability that a disease targeted by a surveillance system has appeared in the population, based on the medical records of the individuals within the target population, using a Bayesian network. To enable the system to produce a probability density function of the fraction of the population that is infected, a mathematically consistent conjoining of Bayesian networks and particle filters is used. This approach is tested against the default algorithm of ESSENCE Desktop Edition (which adaptively uses Poisson, exponentially weighted moving average and linear regression techniques as needed), and is shown, for the simulated test data used, to give significantly shorter detection times at false alarm rates of practical interest. This methodology shows promise to greatly improve detection times for outbreaks in populations where timely electronic health records are available for data-mining.

J	Ahangar-Asr, A; Javadi, AA; Khalili, N				Ahangar-Asr, Alireza; Javadi, Akbar A.; Khalili, Nasser			An evolutionary approach to modelling the thermomechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						unsaturated soils; thermomechanical behaviour; evolutionary data mining	SATURATED CLAYS; POROUS-MEDIA; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; COUPLED HEAT; POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION; NEURAL NETWORKS; VOLUME CHANGES; AIR TRANSFER; TEMPERATURE	A new data-mining approach is presented for modelling of the stress-strain and volume change behaviour of unsaturated soils considering temperature effects. The proposed approach is based on the evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), which unlike some other data-mining techniques, generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of systems directly from raw experimental (or field) data. The proposed methodology can operate on large quantities of data in order to capture nonlinear and complex relationships between contributing variables. The developed models allow the user to gain a clear insight into the behaviour of the system. Unsaturated triaxial test data from the literature were used for development and verification of EPR models. The developed models were also used (in a coupled manner) to produce the entire stress path of triaxial tests. Comparison of the EPR model predictions with the experimental data revealed the robustness and capability of the proposed methodology in capturing and reproducing the constitutive thermomechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. More importantly, the capability of the developed models in accurately generalizing the predictions to unseen data cases was illustrated. The results of a sensitivity analysis showed that the models developed from data are able to capture and represent the physical aspects of the unsaturated soil behaviour accurately. The merits and advantages of the proposed methodology are also discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Product quality of injection molded parts is influenced by the injection molding process. In this study statistical tools were used to develop a model that relates injection molding process variables to part quality. A statistically based model predictive control algorithm was developed for controlling part quality with manipulated variables coolant flow rate and coolant temperature. This approach replaces the need of off-line quality measurement and provides real-time injection modeling quality control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessment of ultrafine particles and noise measurements using fuzzy logic and data mining techniques	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Noise; Total number concentration; Traffic; Fuzzy logic; Data mining	AIR-POLLUTION; URBAN-AIR; SW SPAIN; STREET CANYON; CU-SMELTER; EXPOSURE; POLLUTANTS; EMISSIONS; INFERENCE; SYSTEMS	This study focuses on correlations between total number concentrations, road traffic emissions and noise levels in an urban area in the southwest of Spain during the winter and summer of 2009. The high temporal correlation between sound pressure levels, traffic intensity, particle number concentrations related to traffic, black carbon and NOx concentrations suggests that noise is linked to traffic emissions as a main source of pollution in urban areas. First, the association of these different variables was studied using PreFuRGe, a computational tool based on data mining and fuzzy logic. The results showed a clear association between noise levels and road-traffic intensity for non-extremely high wind speed levels. This behaviour points, therefore, to vehicular emissions being the main source of urban noise. An analysis for estimating the total number concentration from noise levels is also proposed in the study. The high linearity observed between particle number concentrations linked to traffic and noise levels with road traffic intensity can be used to calculate traffic related particle number concentrations experimentally. At low wind speeds, there are increases in noise levels of 1 dB for every 100 vehicles in circulation. This is equivalent to 2000 cm(-3) per vehicle in winter and 500 cm(-3) in summer. At high wind speeds, wind speed could be taken into account. This methodology allows low cost sensors to be used as a proxy for total number concentration monitoring in urban air quality networks.

Post-licensure surveillance of quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine United States, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), July 2013-June 2014	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine safety; Post-licensure surveillance; Live attenuated influenza vaccine; Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; IMMUNIZATION SAFETY DATA; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVENTION; GUIDELINES; COLLECTION; CHILDREN; ADULTS	Background: Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) was approved in 2012 for healthy persons aged 2-49 years. Beginning with the 2013-2014 influenza season, LAIV4 replaced trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). Methods: We analyzed LAIV4 reports to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system. LAIV4 reports in 2013-2014 were compared to LAIV3 reports from the previous three influenza seasons. Medical records were reviewed for non-manufacturer serious reports (i.e., death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We conducted Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reporting for LAIV4. Results: In 2013-2014, 12.7 million doses of LAIV4 were distributed and VAERS received 779 reports in individuals aged 2-49 years; 95% were non-serious. Expired drug administered (42%), fever (13%) and cough (8%) were most commonly reported in children aged 2-17 years when LAIV4 was administered alone, while headache (18%), expired drug administered (15%) and exposure during pregnancy (12%) were most common in adults aged 18-49 years. We identified one death report in a child who died from complications of cerebellar vascular tumors. Among non-death serious reports, neurologic conditions were common in children and adults. In children, seizures (3) and Guillain-Barre. syndrome (2) were the most common serious neurologic outcomes. We identified three serious reports of asthma/wheezing following LAIV4 in children. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for vaccine administration errors and for influenza illness in children. Conclusions: Our analysis of VAERS reports for LAIV4 did not identify any concerning patterns. The data mining finding for reports of influenza illness is consistent with low LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness observed for influenza A disease in children in 2013-2014. Reports of LAIV4 administration to persons in whom the vaccine is not recommended (e.g., pregnant women) indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding indications.

J	Chen, C; He, Y; Wu, JH; Zhou, JM				Chen, Chao; He, Yang; Wu, Jianhui; Zhou, Jinming			Creation of a free, Internet-accessible database: the Multiple Target Ligand Database	Journal of Cheminformatics			English	Article						Polypharmacology; Multiple-target ligands; Database; Drug discovery	DRUG DISCOVERY; POLYPHARMACOLOGY; SITE; FENFLURAMINE; SIMILARITY; PREDICTION; RECEPTORS; PARADIGM; INSIGHTS	Background: Polypharmacology plays an important part in drug discovery, and remains a major challenge in drug development. Identification of the underlying polypharmacology of a drug, as well as development of polypharmacological drugs, have become important issues in the pharmaceutical industry and academia. Description: Herein, through data mining of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a free, Internet-accessible database called the Multiple Target Ligand Database (MTLD; www.mtdcadd.com) was constructed. The MTLD contains 1,732 multiple-target ligands (MTLs) which bind to 14,996 binding sites extracted from 12,759 PDB structures. Among MTLs, 222 entries are approved drugs and 1,334 entries are drug-like compounds. The MTLD could be an extremely useful tool in the development of polypharmacological drugs. It also sheds light on the side effects of drugs through anticipation of their multiple functions and similarities in the binding sites of multiple targets. The entire database is free for online searching, browsing, and downloading. Conclusion: As a crucial expansion of the PDB, increasing numbers of MTLs will be included in the MTLD. Eventually, it will become an efficient platform to obtain useful information on MTLs and their underlying polypharmacology.

Kent			IL-18 Acts in Synergy with IL-7 To Promote Ex Vivo Expansion of T Lymphoid Progenitor Cells	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							RECEPTOR-DEFICIENT MICE; RECENT THYMIC EMIGRANTS; INTERLEUKIN-7 RECEPTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; CUTTING EDGE; IN-VITRO; CYTOKINE; EXPRESSION; THYMOCYTES; APOPTOSIS	Although IL-18 has not previously been shown to promote T lymphopoiesis, results obtained via a novel data mining algorithm (global microarray meta-analysis) led us to explore a predicted role for this cytokine in T cell development. IL-18 is a member of the IL-1 cytokine family that has been extensively characterized as a mediator of inflammatory immune responses. To assess a potential role for IL-18 in T cell development, we sort-purified mouse bone marrow-derived common lymphoid progenitor cells, early thymic progenitors (ETPs), and double-negative 2 thymocytes and cultured these populations on OP9-Delta-like 4 stromal layers in the presence or absence of IL-18 and/or IL-7. After 1 wk of culture, IL-18 promoted proliferation and accelerated differentiation of ETPs to the double-negative 3 stage, similar in efficiency to IL-7. IL-18 showed synergy with IL-7 and enhanced proliferation of both the thymus-derived progenitor cells and the bone marrow-derived common lymphoid progenitor cells. The synergistic effect on the ETP population was further characterized and found to correlate with increased surface expression of c-Kit and IL-7 receptors on the IL-18-treated cells. In summary, we successfully validated the global microarray meta-analysis prediction that IL-18 affects T lymphopoiesis and demonstrated that IL-18 can positively impact bone marrow lymphopoiesis and T cell development, presumably via interaction with the c-Kit and IL-7 signaling axis.

Association rules mining is a feasible technique to convert this large amount of data into usable knowledge for clinical decision making, research or billing. We present a data driven method to create a knowledge base linking medications to pathological conditions through their therapeutic indications from elements within the EHRs. Methods: Association rules were created from the data of patients hospitalised between May 2012 and May 2013 in the department of Cardiology at the University Hospital of Strasbourg. Medications were extracted from the medication list, and the pathological conditions were extracted from the discharge summaries using a natural language processing tool. Association rules were generated along with different interestingness measures: chi square, lift, conviction, dependency, novelty and satisfaction. All medication-disease pairs were compared to the Summary of Product Characteristics, which is the gold standard. A score based on the other interestingness measures was created to filter the best rules, and the indices were calculated for the different interestingness measures. Results: After the evaluation against the gold standard, a list of accurate association rules was successfully retrieved. Dependency represents the best recall (0.76). Our score exhibited higher exactness (0.84) and precision (0.27) than all of the others interestingness measures. Further reductions in noise produced by this method must be performed to improve the classification precision. Conclusions: Association rules mining using the unstructured elements of the EHR is a feasible technique to identify clinically accurate associations between medications and pathological conditions.

An analysis of the existing cases extracted by data-mining the Cambridge Structural Database reveals that they can be classified according to the particular cause of symmetry breaking. One class of complexes exhibits the SPT caused by concerted displacive atomic motions due to the change in the metal-ligand bond lengths during the SCO. Such transitions are usually abrupt, with strong coupling between the SCO and SPT. The second class is characterized by symmetry lowering due to the stabilization of an intermediate mixed high-spin/low-spin state. The abruptness of the SCO is not a necessity in such case. Finally, in the third class, the SPT takes place due to the crystallographic ordering of peripheral groups, counter ions, or solvent molecules that are remote from the SCO centers. Such SPTs exhibit only weak coupling (if any) to the SCO. This analysis is expected to assist in the design of multifunctional SCO materials that rely on the symmetry-breaking SPTs.

J	Wang, LM				Wang, LiMin			Mining causal relationships among clinical variables for cancer diagnosis based on Bayesian analysis	BioData Mining			English	Article						Causal relationship; Cancer diagnosis; Restricted Bayesian classifier	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BREAST-CANCER; PROBABILITY ESTIMATION; NAIVE BAYES; PREDICTION	Background: Cancer is the second leading cause of death around the world after cardiovascular diseases. Over the past decades, various data mining studies have tried to predict the outcome of cancer. However, only a few reports describe the causal relationships among clinical variables or attributes, which may provide theoretical guidance for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Different restricted Bayesian classifiers have been used to discover information from numerous domains. This research work designed a novel Bayesian learning strategy to predict cause-specific death classes and proposed a graphical structure of key attributes to clarify the implicit relationships implicated in the data set. Results: The working mechanisms of 3 classical restricted Bayesian classifiers, namely, NB, TAN and KDB, were analysed and summarised. To retain the properties of global optimisation and high-order dependency representation, the proposed learning algorithm, i.e., flexible K-dependence Bayesian network (FKBN), applies the greedy search of conditional mutual information space to identify the globally optimal ordering of the attributes and to allow the classifiers to be constructed at arbitrary points (values of K) along the attribute dependence spectrum. This method represents the relationships between different attributes by using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model. A total of 12 data sets were selected from the SEER database and KRBM repository by 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation purposes. The findings revealed that the FKBN model outperformed NB, TAN and KDB. Conclusions: A Bayesian classifier can graphically describe the conditional dependency among attributes. The proposed algorithm offers a trade-off between probability estimation and network structure complexity. The direct and indirect relationships between the predictive attributes and class variable should be considered simultaneously to achieve global optimisation and high-order dependency representation. By analysing the DAG inferred from the breast cancer data set of the SEER database we divided the attributes into two subgroups, namely, key attributes that should be considered first for cancer diagnosis and those that are independent of each other but are closely related to key attributes. The statistical analysis results clarify some of the causal relationships implicated in the DAG.

Molecular insights into land snail neuropeptides through transcriptome and comparative gene analysis	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Snail; Theba pisana; Neuropeptides; Central nervous system; Muscle; Hepatopancreas	MOLLUSK LYMNAEA-STAGNALIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EGG-LAYING HORMONE; CERNUELLA-VIRGATA; APLYSIA-CALIFORNICA; SIGNAL PEPTIDES; HELIX-ASPERSA; PROTEIN; INSULIN; PREDICTION	Background: Snails belong to the molluscan class Gastropoda, which inhabit land, freshwater and marine environments. Several land snail species, including Theba pisana, are crop pests of major concern, causing extensive damage to agriculture and horticulture. A deeper understanding of their molecular biology is necessary in order to develop methods to manipulate land snail populations. Results: The present study used in silico gene data mining of T. pisana tissue transcriptomes to predict 24,920 central nervous system ( CNS) proteins, 37,661 foot muscle proteins and 40,766 hepatopancreas proteins, which together have 5,236 unique protein functional domains. Neuropeptides, metabolic enzymes and epiphragmin genes dominated expression within the CNS, hepatopancreas and muscle, respectively. Further investigation of the CNS transcriptome demonstrated that it might contain as many as 5,504 genes that encode for proteins destined for extracellular secretion. Neuropeptides form an important class of cell-cell messengers that control or influence various complex metabolic events. A total of 35 full-length neuropeptide genes were abundantly expressed within T. pisana CNS, encoding precursors that release molluscan-type bioactive neuropeptide products. These included achatin, allototropin, conopressin, elevenin, FMRFamide, LFRFamide, LRFNVamide, myomodulins, neurokinin Y, PKYMDT, PXFVamide, sCAPamides and several insulin-like peptides. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of neural ganglia confirmed the presence of many of these neuropeptides. Conclusions: Our results provide the most comprehensive picture of the molecular genes and proteins associated with land snail functioning, including the repertoire of neuropeptides that likely play significant roles in neuroendocrine signalling. This information has the potential to expedite the study of molluscan metabolism and potentially stimulate advances in the biological control of land snail pest species.

Molecular codes defining rostrocaudal domains in the embryonic mouse hypothalamus	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						peduncular hypothalamus; terminal hypothalamus; acroterminal domain; genoarchitecture	PEPTIDERGIC NEURONS; FOREBRAIN	The prosomeric model proposes that the hypothalamus is a rostral forebrain entity, placed ventral to the telencephalon and rostral to the diencephalon. Gene expression markers differentially label molecularly distinct dorsoventral progenitor domains, which represent continuous longitudinal bands across the hypothalamic alar and basal regions. There is also circumstantial support for a rostrocaudal subdivision of the hypothalamus into transverse peduncular (caudal) and terminal (rostral) territories (PHy, THy). In addition, there is evidence for a specialized acroterminal domain at the rostral midline of the terminal hypothalamus (ATD). The PHy and THy transverse structural units are presently held to form part of two hypothalamo-telencephalic prosomeres (hpl and hp2, respectively), which end dorsally at the telencephalic septocommissural roof. PHy and THy have distinct adult nuclei, at all dorsoventral levels. Here we report the results of data mining from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas database, looking for genes expressed differentially in the PHy, Thy, and ATD regions of the hypothalamus at several developmental stages. This search allowed us to identify additional molecular evidence supporting the postulated fundamental rostrocaudal bipartition of the mouse hypothalamus into the PHy and THy, and also corroborated molecularly the singularity of the ATD. A number of markers were expressed in Thy (Fgf15, Gsc, nkx6.2, Otx1, Zic1/5), but were absent in PHy, while other genes showed the converse pattern (Erbb4, Irx1/3/5, Lmo4, Mfap4, Plag11, Pmch). We also identified markers that selectively label the ATD (Fgf8/10/18, Otx2, Pomc, Rax, Six6). On the whole, these data help to explain why, irrespective of the observed continuity of all dorsoventral molecular hypothalamic subdivisions across PHy and THy, different nuclear structures originate within each of these two domains, and also why singular structures arise at the ATD, e.g., the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus, the median eminence and the neurohypophysis.

J	Ferrari, DG; de Castro, LN				Ferrari, Daniel Gomes; de Castro, Leandro Nunes			Clustering algorithm selection by meta-learning systems: A new distance-based problem characterization and ranking combination methods	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Clustering; Problem characterization; Algorithm ranking; Algorithm selection; Meta-knowledge; Meta-learning systems	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; VALIDATION; VALIDITY; MODELS; NUMBER	Data clustering aims to segment a database into groups of objects based on the similarity among these objects. Due to its unsupervised nature, the search for a good-quality solution can become a complex process. There is currently a wide range of clustering algorithms, and selecting the best one for a given problem can be a slow and costly process. In 1976, Rice formulated the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP), which postulates that the algorithm performance can be predicted based on the structural characteristics of the problem. Meta-learning brings the concept of learning about learning; that is, the meta-knowledge obtained from the algorithm learning process allows the improvement of the algorithm performance. Meta-learning has a major intersection with data mining in classification problems, in which it is normally used to recommend algorithms. The present paper proposes new ways to obtain meta-knowledge for clustering tasks. Specifically, two contributions are explored here: (1) a new approach to characterize clustering problems based on the similarity among objects; and (2) new methods to combine internal indices for ranking algorithms based on their performance on the problems. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the recommendation quality. The results show that the new meta-knowledge provides high-quality algorithm selection for clustering tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a novel decision-making framework for precision marking using data-mining techniques. First, this study presents a trend model to accurately predict monthly supply quantity; second, it uses a RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) model to select attributes to cluster customers into different groups; third, it uses CHAID decision trees and Pareto values to identify important attribute values to distinguish different customer groups; and finally, it creates different supply strategies targeting each customer group. The objective of the proposed precision-making framework is to help managers identify the potential characteristics of different customer categories and put forward appropriate precision marketing strategies, which can greatly reduce inventory for every customer category. The real-world data from a company in China were collected and used in a case study to illustrate how to implement the proposed framework. This case study demonstrates that our proposed decision-making framework is efficient and capable of providing a very good precision marketing strategy for enterprises. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating available supermarket commodities for food bank collection in the absence of information	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Forecasting; In-kind donations; Data mining; Food bank operations	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION; ASSISTANCE; MANAGEMENT; MODELS	Food insecurity is a widespread concern in the United States. Addressing this concern is a chief goal of many non-profit organizations including food banks. Understanding the availability of donations is beneficial when addressing the demand in local communities, especially when their collection requires food bank-managed vehicles. High-volume donors such as supermarkets, however, do not provide information in regards to what items are available. This can negatively impact inventory management capabilities and cause unnecessary transportation costs. This research evaluates four approximation methods based on their ability to estimate food availability at supermarkets including the multiple layer perceptron artificial neural network, multiple linear regression, and two naive estimates for the average collection amount. Using a subset of the historic data provided by the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina (FBCENC), the four approximation methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to estimate collection amounts in the next planning period. Transportation cost estimates are then calculated using projections made using each approximation method and compared to those calculated using the actual transportation costs. Results suggest that the MLP-NN models provide the best approximations for each food type and provide closer estimations for transportation cost than other approximation methods.

In this paper, we propose a method to recommend travel locations in a city for a user, based on topic distribution of his travel histories in other cities and the given context (i.e., season and weather). A topic model is used to mine the interest distribution of users, which is then exploited to build the user-user similarity model and make travel recommendations. The season and weather context information is considered during the mining and the recommendation processes. Our method is evaluated on a Flickr dataset, which contains photos taken in 11 cities of China. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the precision of travel behavior prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimization techniques provide a way to efficiently search for these solutions. ACO applied to data mining tasks - a decision tree construction - is one of these methods and the focus of this paper. The Ant Colony Decision Tree (ACDT) approach generates solutions efficiently and effectively but scales poorly to large problems. This article merges the methods that have been developed for better construction of decision trees by ants. The ACDT approach is tested in the context of the bi-criteria evaluation function by focusing on two problems: the size of the decision trees and the accuracy of classification obtained during ACDT performance. This approach is tested in co-learning mechanism, it means agents-ants can interact during the construction decision trees via pheromone values. This cooperation is a chance of getting better results. The proposed methodology of analysis of ACDT is tested in a number of well-known benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The empirical results clearly show that the ACDT algorithm creates good solutions which are located in the Pareto front.

However, a consumer's perception is often qualitative and is achieved through third party surveys or the company's recording of after-sale feedback through explicit surveys or warranty based commitments. In this paper, we consider an automobile company's warranty records for different vehicle models and suggest a data mining procedure to assign a customer satisfaction index (CSI) to each vehicle model based on the perceived notion of the level of satisfaction of customers. Based on the developed CSI function, customers are then divided into satisfied and dissatisfied customer groups. The warranty data are then clustered separately for each group and analyzed to find possible causes (field failures) and their relative effects on customer's satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) for a vehicle model. Finally, speculative introspection has been made to identify the amount of improvement in CSI that can be achieved by the reduction of some critical field failures through better design practices. Thus, this paper shows how warranty data from customers can be utilized to have a better perception of ranking of a product compared to its competitors in the market and also to identify possible causes for making some customers dissatisfied and eventually to help percolate these issues at the design level. This closes the design cycle loop in which after a design is converted into a product, its perceived level of satisfaction by customers can also provide valuable information to help make the design better in an iterative manner. The proposed methodology is generic and novel, and can be applied to other consumer products as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, current research in data mining shows an increasing interest in emotion assessment for improving human-machine interaction. Based on the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) which derives from automatic nervous system responses, computers can assess user emotions and find correlations between significant EEG features extracted from the raw data and the human emotional states. With the advent of modern signal processing techniques, the evaluative power of human emotion derived from EEG is increased exponentially due to the huge number of features that are typically extracted from the EEG signals. Notwithstanding that the expanded set of features could allow computers to evaluate emotions in an accurate way, it is too complex a task to manage in a structured way and, for the reasons stated, methods and approaches to enable both EEG information management and evaluation are necessary to support emotion assessment. Starting from this consideration, this paper proposes an enhanced EEG-based emotion assessment system exploiting a collection of ontological models representing EEG feature sets and arousal-valence space (two-dimensional emotion scale), statistical tests capable of evaluating the gender-specific correlations between EEG features and emotional states, and a classification methodology inferring arousal and valence levels. As will be shown in the experimental section where the proposed approach has been tested on a public dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that better performance in emotion assessment can be achieved using our framework as compared with other studies using the same dataset and with three other classification techniques.

Different from traditional fuzzy data mining, fuzzy utility mining considers not only quantities of items in transactions but also their profits for deriving high fuzzy utility itemsets. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy utility measure with the fuzzy minimum operator to evaluate the fuzzy utilities of itemsets. Besides, an effective fuzzy utility upper-bound model based on the proposed measure is designed to provide the downward-closure property in fuzzy sets, thus reducing the search space of finding high fuzzy utility itemsets. A two-phase fuzzy utility mining algorithm, named TPFU, is also proposed and described for solving the problem of fuzzy utility mining. At last, the experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed algorithm has good performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of instance selection is to reduce the data size by filtering out noisy data, which may degrade the mining performance, from a given dataset. Genetic algorithms have presented an effective instance selection approach to improve the performance of data mining algorithms. However, current approaches only pursue the simplest evolutionary process based on the most reasonable and simplest rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel instance selection algorithm, namely a genetic-based biological algorithm (GBA). GBA fits a "biological evolution" into the evolutionary process, where the most streamlined process also complies with the reasonable rules. In other words, after long-term evolution, organisms find the most efficient way to allocate resources and evolve. Consequently, we can closely simulate the natural evolution of an algorithm, such that the algorithm will be both efficient and effective. Our experiments are based on comparing GBA with five state-of-the-art algorithms over 50 different domain datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that GBA outperforms these baselines, providing the lowest classification error rate and the least storage requirement. Moreover, GBA is very computational efficient, which only requires slightly larger computational cost than GA.

An incremental clustering algorithm based on hyperbolic smoothing	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Nonsmooth optimization; Cluster analysis; Smoothing techniques; Nonlinear programming	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; MINIMUM SUM; NONSMOOTH OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; BRANCH	Clustering is an important problem in data mining. It can be formulated as a nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problem. For the most global optimization techniques this problem is challenging even in medium size data sets. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows one to apply local methods of smooth optimization to solve the clustering problems. We apply an incremental approach to generate starting points for cluster centers which enables us to deal with nonconvexity of the problem. The hyperbolic smoothing technique is applied to handle nonsmoothness of the clustering problems and to make it possible application of smooth optimization algorithms to solve them. Results of numerical experiments with eleven real-world data sets and the comparison with state-of-the-art incremental clustering algorithms demonstrate that the smooth optimization algorithms in combination with the incremental approach are powerful alternative to existing clustering algorithms.

J	Verma, R				Verma, Rajkumar			Generalized Bonferroni Mean Operator for Fuzzy Number Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets and its Application to Multiattribute Decision Making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							AGGREGATION OPERATORS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; INFORMATION	The Bonferroni mean (BM) was originally introduced by Bonferroni in 1950. A prominent characteristic of BM is its capability to capture the interrelationship between input arguments. This makes BM useful in various application fields, such as decision making, information retrieval, pattern recognition, and data mining. In this paper, we examine the issue of fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy information fusion. We first propose a new generalized Bonferroni mean operator called generalized fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy weighted Bonferroni mean (GFNIFWBM) operator for aggregating fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy information. The properties of the new aggregation operator are studied and their special cases are examined. Furthermore, based on the GFNIFWBM operator, an approach to deal with multiattribute decision-making problems under fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy environment is developed. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the multiattribute decision-making process. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm was proposed as an algorithm to solve a classification problem involving a high degree of class imbalance without losing the explaining capacity, a desirable characteristic of single decision trees and rule sets. CTC works by resampling the training sample and building a tree from each subsample, in a similar manner to ensemble classifiers, but applying the ensemble process during the tree construction phase, resulting in a unique final tree. In the ECML/PKDD 2013 conference the term "Inner Ensembles" was coined to refer to such methodologies. In this paper we propose a resampling strategy for classification algorithms that use multiple subsamples. This strategy is based on the class distribution of the training sample to ensure a minimum representation of all classes when resampling. This strategy has been applied to CTC over different classification contexts. A robust classification algorithm should not just be able to rank in the top positions for certain classification problems but should be able to excel when faced with a broad range of problems. In this paper we establish the robustness of the CTC algorithm against a wide set of classification algorithms with explaining capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Exploring such databases with new pattern mining approaches involving new data structures is thus important. This paper investigates this data mining challenge by presenting OrderSpan, an algorithm that is able to extract a set of closed partially ordered patterns from a sequence database. It combines well-known properties of prefixes and suffixes. Furthermore, we extend OrderSpan by adapting efficient optimizations used in sequential pattern mining domain. Indeed, the proposed method is flexible and follows the sequential pattern paradigm. It is more efficient in the search space exploration, as it skips redundant branches. Experiments were performed on different real datasets to show (I) the effectiveness of the optimized approach and (2) the benefit of closed partially ordered patterns with respect to closed sequential patterns.

J	Lines, J; Bagnall, A				Lines, Jason; Bagnall, Anthony			Time series classification with ensembles of elastic distance measures	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Time series classification; Elastic distance measures; Ensembles	REPRESENTATION; FEATURES	Several alternative distance measures for comparing time series have recently been proposed and evaluated on time series classification (TSC) problems. These include variants of dynamic time warping (DTW), such as weighted and derivative DTW, and edit distance-based measures, including longest common subsequence, edit distance with real penalty, time warp with edit, and move-split-merge. These measures have the common characteristic that they operate in the time domain and compensate for potential localised misalignment through some elastic adjustment. Our aim is to experimentally test two hypotheses related to these distance measures. Firstly, we test whether there is any significant difference in accuracy for TSC problems between nearest neighbour classifiers using these distance measures. Secondly, we test whether combining these elastic distance measures through simple ensemble schemes gives significantly better accuracy. We test these hypotheses by carrying out one of the largest experimental studies ever conducted into time series classification. Our first key finding is that there is no significant difference between the elastic distance measures in terms of classification accuracy on our data sets. Our second finding, and the major contribution of this work, is to define an ensemble classifier that significantly outperforms the individual classifiers. We also demonstrate that the ensemble is more accurate than approaches not based in the time domain. Nearly all TSC papers in the data mining literature cite DTW (with warping window set through cross validation) as the benchmark for comparison. We believe that our ensemble is the first ever classifier to significantly outperform DTW and as such raises the bar for future work in this area.

There is a plethora of similarity measures for sequences in the literature, most of them being designed for sequences of items. In this work, we study the problem of measuring the similarity between sequences of itemsets. We focus on the notion of common subsequences as a way to measure similarity between a pair of sequences composed of a list of itemsets. We present new combinatorial results for efficiently counting distinct and common subsequences. These theoretical results are the cornerstone of an effective dynamic programming approach to deal with this problem. In addition, we propose an approximate method to speed up the computation process for long sequences. We have applied our method to various data sets: healthcare trajectories, online handwritten characters and synthetic data. Our results confirm that our measure of similarity produces competitive scores and indicate that our method is relevant for large scale sequential data analysis.

In learning to rank, the performance of a ranking model is strongly affected by the number of labeled examples in the training set; on the other hand, obtaining labeled examples for training data is very expensive and time-consuming. This presents a great need for the active learning approaches to select most informative examples for ranking learning; however, in the literature there is still very limited work to address active learning for ranking. In this paper, we propose a general active learning framework, expected loss optimization (ELO), for ranking. The ELO framework is applicable to a wide range of ranking functions. Under this framework, we derive a novel algorithm, expected discounted cumulative gain (DCG) loss optimization (ELO-DCG), to select most informative examples. Then, we investigate both query and document level active learning for raking and propose a two-stage ELO-DCG algorithm which incorporate both query and document selection into active learning. Furthermore, we show that it is flexible for the algorithm to deal with the skewed grade distribution problem with the modification of the loss function. Extensive experiments on real-world web search data sets have demonstrated great potential and effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.

Periodicity analysis from the recorded data is an important data mining task which provides useful insights into the physical events and enables us to report outliers and predict future behaviors. To mine periodicity in an event, we have to face real-world challenges of inherently complicated periodic behaviors and imperfect data collection problem. Specifically, the hidden temporal periodic behaviors could be oscillating and noisy, and the observations of the event could be incomplete. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic measure for periodicity and design a practical algorithm, ePeriodicity, to detect periods. Our method has thoroughly considered the uncertainties and noises in periodic behaviors and is provably robust to incomplete observations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Classification is one of the commonly used tasks in data mining applications. For the past decade, due to the rise of various privacy issues, many theoretical and practical solutions to the classification problem have been proposed under different security models. However, with the recent popularity of cloud computing, users now have the opportunity to outsource their data, in encrypted form, as well as the data mining tasks to the cloud. Since the data on the cloud is in encrypted form, existing privacy-preserving classification techniques are not applicable. In this paper, we focus on solving the classification problem over encrypted data. In particular, we propose a secure k-NN classifier over encrypted data in the cloud. The proposed protocol protects the confidentiality of data, privacy of user's input query, and hides the data access patterns. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to develop a secure k-NN classifier over encrypted data under the semi-honest model. Also, we empirically analyze the efficiency of our proposed protocol using a real-world dataset under different parameter settings.

J	Wang, H; Li, WJ				Wang, Hao; Li, Wu-Jun			Relational Collaborative Topic Regression for Recommender Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Collaborative filtering; topic models; recommender system; social network; relational learning	MODELS	Due to its successful application in recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) has become a hot research topic in data mining and information retrieval. In traditional CF methods, only the feedback matrix, which contains either explicit feedback (also called ratings) or implicit feedback on the items given by users, is used for training and prediction. Typically, the feedback matrix is sparse, which means that most users interact with few items. Due to this sparsity problem, traditional CF with only feedback information will suffer from unsatisfactory performance. Recently, many researchers have proposed to utilize auxiliary information, such as item content (attributes), to alleviate the data sparsity problem in CF. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is one of these methods which has achieved promising performance by successfully integrating both feedback information and item content information. In many real applications, besides the feedback and item content information, there may exist relations (also known as networks) among the items which can be helpful for recommendation. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model called Relational Collaborative Topic Regression (RCTR), which extends CTR by seamlessly integrating the user-item feedback information, item content information, and network structure among items into the same model. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model can achieve better prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods with lower empirical training time. Moreover, RCTR can learn good interpretable latent structures which are useful for recommendation.

We prove that our algorithms' learning regrets-the losses incurred by the algorithms due to uncertainty-are logarithmically increasing in time and thus the time average reward converges to the optimal average reward. Moreover, we also illustrate how the regret depends on the size of the action space, and we show that this relationship is influenced by the informativeness of the reward structure with regard to each agent's individual action. When the overall reward is fully informative, regret is shown to be linear in the total number of actions of all the agents. When the reward function is not informative, regret is linear in the number of joint actions. Our analytic and numerical results show that the proposed learning algorithms significantly outperform existing online learning solutions in terms of regret and learning speed. We illustrate how our theoretical framework can be used in practice by applying it to online Big Data mining using distributed classifiers.

J	Lin, J				Lin, Jimmy			On Building Better Mousetraps and Understanding the Human Condition: Reflections on Big Data in the Social Sciences	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						big data; computational social science; machine learning; data mining; log analysis	CHOCOLATE CONSUMPTION; NOBEL	Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of big data: disruptive technologies that have transformed commerce, science, and many aspects of society. Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is better science or better engineering. Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.

Within the rapid-growth stage, they display the fastest cartilage development in the animal kingdom. To identify microRNA (miRNA) profiling in red deer (Cervus elaphus) antler cartilage, we applied deep sequencing technology to a small RNA library constructed from pooled cartilage (three antlers from three individuals). We generated 9,520,645 mappable reads with a size distribution of between 15 and 30 nucleotides (miRNAs of 18 nucleotides were the most abundant group: 31 %). Bioinformatics data mining revealed 399 miRNAs in antler cartilage, of which 345 were highly conserved and expressed in 25 other mammals, including the cattle (Bos taurus) and in humans (Homo sapiens). The remaining 54 miRNAs we identified were novel and likely to be antler-cartilage specific, but were expressed at low levels. The identification of these known and newly identified miRNAs in antler cartilage significantly enhances our understanding of the miRNA profiling of regenerating antler cartilage. Further studies are necessary to better understand miRNAs-regulated antlerogenesis.

We describe an indirect sampling (data mining) approach to obtain these data in children. Methods: Twenty-two serum biochemistry results from 6,989 children, who visited their primary care physician in Queensland, Australia, and were tested only twice within a year were included. The CVg and index of individuality of the boys and girls were estimated by year of age, according to the procedures recommended by Fraser and Harris. Results: The CVg was generally higher during the first year of life and declined to reach a constant level by age 4 to 6 years, except for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and phosphate. The CVg for these tended to increase after age 10 years. Most of the serum biochemistries examined in this study had indices of individuality 0.6 or less, except sodium, anion gap, bicarbonate, and chloride, which ranged from 0.6 to 1.4. The indices of individuality were very stable across all ages. Conclusions: These data are comparable to those reported by the Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals study and the Ricos database for adults. This study reports the CVg trends and data for boys and girls by year of age, which have not been described previously.

J	Elguebaly, T; Bouguila, N				Elguebaly, Tarek; Bouguila, Nizar			Model-based approach for high-dimensional non-Gaussian visual data clustering and feature weighting	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Unsupervised learning; Feature selection; Clustering; Asymmetric generalized Gaussian; Action recognition; Facial expression recognition	HUMAN ACTION CATEGORIES; FEATURE-SELECTION; OBJECT DETECTION; MIXTURE-MODELS; TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; FACIAL-EXPRESSION; FACE DETECTION; IMAGES; RECOGNITION; DENSITY	Clustering is the task of classifying patterns or observations into clusters or groups. Generally, clustering in high-dimensional feature spaces has a lot of complications such as: the unidentified or unknown data shape which is typically non-Gaussian and follows different distributions; the unknown number of clusters in the case of unsupervised learning; and the existence of noisy, redundant, or uninformative features which normally compromise modeling capabilities and speed. Therefore, high-dimensional data clustering has been a subject of extensive research in data mining, pattern recognition, image processing, computer vision, and other areas for several decades. However, most of existing researches tackle one or two problems at a time which is unrealistic because all problems are connected and should be tackled simultaneously. Thus, in this paper, we propose two novel inference frameworks for unsupervised non-Gaussian feature selection, in the context of finite asymmetric generalized Gaussian (AGG) mixture-based clustering. The choice of the AGG distribution is mainly due to its ability not only to approximate a large class of statistical distributions (e.g. impulsive, Laplacian, Gaussian and uniform distributions) but also to include the asymmetry. In addition, the two frameworks simultaneously perform model parameters estimation as well as model complexity (i.e., both model and feature selection) determination in the same step. This was done by incorporating a minimum message length (MML) penalty in the model learning step and by fading out the redundant densities in the mixture using the rival penalized EM (RPEM) algorithm, for first and second frameworks, respectively. Furthermore, for both algorithms, we tackle the problem of noisy and uninformative features by determining a set of relevant features for each data cluster. The efficiencies of the proposed algorithms are validated by applying them to real challenging problems namely action and facial expression recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ACs are formed by compounds with small structural changes having large differences in potency. Accordingly, ACs are a primary source of structure-activity relationship (SAR) information. Through large-scale compound data mining it has been shown that the vast majority of ACs are formed in a coordinated manner by groups of structurally analogous compounds with significant potency variations. In network representations coordinated ACs form clusters of varying size but frequently recurrent topology. Recently, computational methods have been introduced to systematically organize AC clusters and extract SAR information from them. AC clusters are widely distributed over compound activity classes and represent a rich source of SAR information. These clusters can be visualized in AC networks and isolated. However, it is challenging to extract SAR information from such clusters and make this information available to the practice of medicinal chemistry. Therefore, it is essential to go beyond subjective case-by-case analysis and design computational approaches to systematically access SAR information associated with AC clusters.

We propose an automatic incremental diagnostic methodology and CAD flow, based on data mining (DM). It is a model-based approach that incrementally determines the tests to be executed to isolate the faulty component, aiming at minimizing the total number of executed tests, without compromising 100% diagnostic accuracy. The DM engine allows for shorter test sequences with respect to other reasoning-based solutions (e.g., Bayesian belief networks), not requiring complex pre and post-conditions management. Experimental results on a large set of synthetic examples and on three industrial boards substantiate the quality of the proposed approach.

Due to the rapid evolution of data on the Web, more emerging challenges have been posed on traditional clustering techniques: 1) correlations among related clustering tasks and/or within individual task are not well captured; 2) the problem of clustering out-of-sample data is seldom considered; and 3) the discriminative property of cluster label matrix is not well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering model, namely multitask spectral clustering (MTSC), to cope with the above challenges. Specifically, two types of correlations are well considered: 1) intertask clustering correlation, which refers the relations among different clustering tasks and 2) intratask learning correlation, which enables the processes of learning cluster labels and learning mapping function to reinforce each other. We incorporate a novel l(2,p)-norm regularizer to control the coherence of all the tasks based on an assumption that related tasks should share a common low-dimensional representation. Moreover, for each individual task, an explicit mapping function is simultaneously learnt for predicting cluster labels by mapping features to the cluster label matrix. Meanwhile, we show that the learning process can naturally incorporate discriminative information to further improve clustering performance. We explore and discuss the relationships between our proposed model and several representative clustering techniques, including spectral clustering, k-means and discriminative k-means. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets illustrate the advantage of the proposed MTSC model compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.

The secondary goal is to investigate the usefulness of Mutual Information (MI) analysis in estimating cortical sleep EEG arousals for detection of PPI. For these purposes, healthy controls and patients were compared to each other with respect to both linear (Pearson correlation coefficient and coherence) and nonlinear quantifiers (MI) in addition to phase locking quantification for six sleep stages (stage. 1-4, rem, wake) by means of interhemispheric dependency between two central sleep EEG derivations. In test, each connectivity estimation calculated for each couple of epoches (C3-A2 and C4-A1) was identified by the vector norm of estimation. Then, patients and controls were classified by using 10 different types of data mining classifiers for five error criteria such as accuracy, root mean squared error, sensitivity, specificity and precision. High performance in a classification through a measure will validate high contribution of that measure to detecting PPI. The MI was found to be the best method in detecting PPI. In particular, the patients had lower MI, higher PCC for all sleep stages. In other words, the lower sleep EEG synchronization suffering from PPI was observed. These results probably stand for the loss of neurons that then contribute to less complex dynamical processing within the neural networks in sleep disorders an the functional central brain connectivity is nonlinear during night sleep. In conclusion, the level of cortical hemispheric connectivity is strongly associated with sleep disorder. Thus, cortical communication quantified in all existence sleep stages might be a potential marker for sleep disorder induced by PPI.

Two datamining tools, namely decision tree and artificial neural network, were used to analyze the historical cases of oral cancer, and their performance was compared with that of logistic regression, the popular statistical analysis tool. Both decision tree and artificial neural network models showed superiority to the traditional statistical model. However, as to clinician, the trees created by the decision tree models are relatively easier to interpret compared to that of the artificial neural network models. Cluster analysis also discovers that those stage 4 patients whose also possess the following four characteristics are having an extremely low survival rate: pN is N2b, level of RLNM is level I-III, AJCC-T is T4, and cells mutate situation (G) is moderate.

Most of them use data mining approaches to explore the behaviors and interactions between users. Such approaches are unable to reveal the complex mechanism and the process of information diffusion. Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) models fluid behaviors at the microscopic scale, similar to the information diffusion in social media that is determined by the collective behavior of many personal retweeting of topics. We propose an information diffusion model inspired by the fundamental idea of LBM to analyze and simulate users' communicating behaviors and processes in Micro-blogging. The micro-blog space is regarded as an artificial physical system with social phenomena such as micro-blog bursting. The macroscopic properties of the information diffusion model are explored to simulate and predict the trend of information diffusion for any specific topic. A novel visualization style mimicking fluid dynamics is proposed to help understand the scale of information diffusion and the popularity of a topic. The flow visualization based on the speed of information diffusion is useful in discovering typical information diffusion patterns for different types of topics in social networks. Comparing with other approaches, our approach provides more effective yet intuitive simulation.

Quick assessment of drug-related admissions over time (QUADRAT study)	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						adverse drug events; hospitalization; computerized prescreening; Netherlands; epidemiology; polypharmacy; drug-related hospitalization; pharmacoepidemiology	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENTS; FREQUENCY; MEDICATION; RECORDS; EVENTS	PurposeTo develop a computerized prescreening procedure for the identification of possible/probably Hospital Admissions potential Related to Medications (HARMs). MethodPairs of drugs and reasons for hospitalization (generated automatically from the PHARMO record linkage database by using two data mining techniques) were assessed manually to determine whether they represented pharmacologically plausible adverse drug events (PP-ADEs). Two crude samples of these PP-ADEs (from 2005 and 2008) were examined manually to establish causality and preventability on the basis of hospital discharge letters plus medication dispensing data. The results were used to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the crude causality PP-ADEs, the net percentage of possible/probably HARMs, and their potential preventability. ResultsData mining by Gamma Poisson Shrinkage and trend analysis produced 1330 and 2941 significant drug-event pairs, respectively. After manual assessment, 307 different PP-ADEs remained. The annual prevalence of these PP-ADEs was stable at approximately 8% throughout 2000-2009. Manual assessment of two samples of crude PP-ADEs showed that their causality PPV was 53.7% (95%CI: 52.7%-54.7%) in 2005 and 47.9% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.0%) in 2008. The net contribution of possible/probably HARMs to all acute admissions was 4.6% (95%CI: 4.5%-4.8%) in 2005 and 3.9% (95%CI: 3.8%-4.0%) in 2008. The potential preventability of all possible/probably HARMs in the two samples was 19.3% (95%CI: 18.5-20.1). ConclusionAutomated pre-selection of PP-ADEs is an efficient way to monitor crude trends. Further validation and manual assessment of the automatically selected hospitalizations is necessary to get a more detailed and precise picture. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Conversely, retrieving pertinent information from the copious resources available is not only difficult but also time consuming. In the recent years, tagging activity has been perceived as a potential source of knowledge on personal preferences, interests, targets, goals, and other attributes. Tags allow users to effectively annotate resources using keywords to personalize their recommendations and organize the resources for easy retrieval. However, the preference of users varies extremely resulting in tagging being counterproductive. These shortcomings reduce the application of the tagging system for filtering as well as retrieval of information. The tag recommendation system becomes useful by suggesting a set of relevant keywords to annotate the resources. This paper presents a review of the tag recommendation systems and the constraints that affects the available tag recommendation systems. Furthermore, we propose the use of spreading activation algorithm to study the role of constructed topic ontology for efficient tag recommendations. This approach is founded on the assumption that tags that are recommended to the user are predicted from the extracted keywords from the existing blogs and the topics in constructed topic ontology. We have also proposed a tag classification system, namely Correlation-based Feature Selection-Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and classifier HGA-SVM (support vector machine), and have compared the results with results produced by other existing feature selection methods. The results obtained from the experiments have been presented. (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The development and wide application of environmental biotechnology, for example in bioenergy production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and drinking water disinfection, have been bringing us with both environmental and economic benefits. Strikingly, extensive applications of microscopic and molecular techniques since 1990s have allowed engineers to peep into the microbiology in "black box" of engineered microbial communities in biotechnological processes, providing guidelines for process design and optimization. Recently, revolutionary advances in DNA sequencing technologies and rapidly decreasing costs are altering conventional ways of microbiology and ecology research, as it launches an era of next-generation sequencing (NGS). The principal research burdens are now transforming from traditional labor-intensive wet-lab experiments to dealing with analysis of huge and informative NGS data, which is computationally expensive and bioinformatically challenging. This study discusses state-of-the-art bioinformatics and statistical analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data from prevalent NGS platforms to promote its applications in exploring microbial diversity of functional and pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their interactions in biotechnological processes.

A data mining analysis of a public service loyalty program	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Data mining; CRM; Behavioral data; Loyalty card	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; E-GOVERNMENT; BIG DATA; PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; CITIZENS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Customer loyalty programs are largely present in the private sector and have been elaborately studied. Applications from the private sector have found resonance in a public setting, however, simply extrapolating research results is not acceptable, as their rationale inherently differs. This study focuses on data from a loyalty program issued by the city of Antwerp (Belgium). The aim of the loyalty card entails large citizen participation, however, an active user base of only 20 % is reached. Predictive techniques are employed to increase this number. Using spatial behavioral user information, a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine are used which result in models capable of predicting whether a user will actively use its card, whether a user will defect in the near future and which locations a user will visit. Also, a projection of spatial behavioral data onto even more fine-grained spatio-temporal data is performed. The results are promising: the best model achieves an AUC value of 92.5%, 85.5% and 88.12% (averaged over five locations) for the predictions, respectively. Moreover, as behavior is modeled in more detail, better predictions are made. Two main contributions are made in this study. First, as a theoretical contribution, fine-grained behavioral data contributes to a more sound decision-making process. Second, as a practical contribution, the city of Antwerp can now make tailored strategic decisions to increase its active user base. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prediction models are derived from logged on-board data that are downloaded during workshop visits and have been collected over three years on a large number of vehicles. A number of issues are identified with the data sources, many of which originate from the fact that the data sources were not designed for data mining. Nevertheless, exploiting this available data is very important for the automotive industry as means to quickly introduce predictive maintenance solutions. It is shown on a large data set from heavy duty trucks in normal operation how this can be done and generate a profit. Random forest is used as the classifier algorithm, together with two methods for feature selection whose results are compared to a human expert. The machine learning based features outperform the human expert features, which supports the idea to use data mining to improve maintenance operations in this domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe how stacking of geographically allocated classifications can create a map composite of higher accuracy than any of the individual classifiers. We used both voting algorithms and trainable classifiers with a set of validation data to combine individual land cover maps. We describe the generality of this setup in terms of existing algorithms and accuracy assessment procedures. This method has the advantage of not requiring posterior probabilities or level of support for predicted class labels. We demonstrate the technique using Landsat based, 30-meter land cover maps, the highest resolution, globally available product of this kind. We used globally distributed validation samples to composite the maps and compute accuracy. We show that geographic stacking can improve individual map accuracy by up to 6.6%. The voting methods can also achieve higher accuracy than the best of the input classifications. Accuracies from different classifiers, input data, and output type are compared. The results are illustrated on a Landsat scene in California, USA. The compositing technique described here has broad applicability in remote sensing based map production and geographic classification.

Management of ambulance headquarters and hospitals, which are part of the physical infrastructure, should be assessed to ensure a timely response. The objective of this research is to propose a general assessment process for a prehospital EMS by evaluating the physical infrastructure. A geographic information system is adapted to visualize and analyze the EMS of a region EMS from various perspectives. In the assessment process, the EMS is evaluated with incident data and the transportation network is evaluated through spatial and temporal analyses such as service area, clustering, and spatial interpolation. As a case study, the process is applied to New Taipei City for the assessment of its prehospital EMS. The results have shown that the proposed assessment process can help discover existing deficiencies and offer suggestions to the current EMS. Regions less accessible by the EMS were discovered; the spatial coverage of historical demand incidents was 93.8% for the union of ambulance headquarters and 70.52% for the union of hospitals in their respective 3km service areas. Cluster analysis suggested an EMS performance gain of 0.68% compared with the current situation for the construction of an additional ambulance facility and 1.45% for an additional hospital. Future work will extend the proposed process with specialized spatial and temporal data mining techniques and to apply the process to more case studies.

Diversifying Selection Analysis Predicts Antigenic Evolution of 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A Virus in Humans	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							HEMAGGLUTININ; SUBTYPE; VACCINE; DRIFT; NS1	Although a large number of immune epitopes have been identified in the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) protein using various experimental systems, it is unclear which are involved in protective immunity to natural infection in humans. We developed a data mining approach analyzing natural H1N1 human isolates to identify HA protein regions that may be targeted by the human immune system and can predict the evolution of IAV. We identified 16 amino acid sites experiencing diversifying selection during the evolution of prepandemic seasonal H1N1 strains and found that 11 sites were located in experimentally determined B-cell/antibody (Ab) epitopes, including three distinct neutralizing Caton epitopes: Sa, Sb, and Ca2 [A. J. Caton, G. G. Brownlee, J. W. Yewdell, and W. Gerhard, Cell 31:417-427, 1982, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(82)90135-0]. We predicted that these diversified epitope regions would be the targets of mutation as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) lineage evolves in response to the development of population-level protective immunity in humans. Using a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, we identified 10 amino acid sites that significantly differed between the pH1N1 isolates and isolates from the recent 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 influenza seasons. Three of these sites were located in the same diversified B-cell/Ab epitope regions as identified in the analysis of prepandemic sequences, including Sa and Sb. As predicted, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using human sera from subjects vaccinated with the initial pH1N1 isolate demonstrated reduced reactivity against 2013-2014 isolates. Taken together, these results suggest that diversifying selection analysis can identify key immune epitopes responsible for protective immunity to influenza virus in humans and thereby predict virus evolution. IMPORTANCE The WHO estimates that approximately 5 to 10% of adults and 20 to 30% of children in the world are infected by influenza virus each year. While an adaptive immune response helps eliminate the virus following acute infection, the virus rapidly evolves to evade the established protective memory immune response, thus allowing for the regular seasonal cycles of influenza virus infection. The analytical approach described here, which combines an analysis of diversifying selection with an integration of immune epitope data, has allowed us to identify antigenic regions that contribute to protective immunity and are therefore the key targets of immune evasion by the virus. This information can be used to determine when sequence variations in seasonal influenza virus strains have affected regions responsible for protective immunity in order to decide when new vaccine formulations are warranted.

They integrate both the management of imprecision/uncertainty and inherent interpretability of Fuzzy Rule Based Systems, with the learning and adaptation capabilities of evolutionary optimization. Over the years, many different approaches in Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems have been developed for improving the behavior of fuzzy systems, either acting on the Fuzzy Rule Base Systems' elements, or by defining new approaches for the evolutionary components. All these efforts have enabled Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems to be successfully applied in several areas of Data Mining and engineering. In accordance with the former, a wide number of applications have been also taken advantage of these types of systems. However, with the new advances in computation, novel problems and challenges are raised every day. All these issues motivate researchers to make an effort in releasing new ways of addressing them with Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems. In this paper, we will review the progression of Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems by analyzing their taxonomy and components. We will also stress those problems and applications already tackled by this type of approach. We will present a discussion on the most recent and difficult Data Mining tasks to be addressed, and which are the latest trends in the development of Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems.

Some years after their introduction, sequentially, intuitionistic fuzzy propositional logic, intuitionistic fuzzy predicate logic, intuitionistic fuzzy modal logic and intuitionistic fuzzy temporal logic have been introduced, presented here shortly. During the last 25 years, different intuitionistic fuzzy tools have been used for evaluation of objects from the area of the Artificial Intelligence, as expert systems (having, e.g. facts and rules, with intuitionistic fuzzy degrees of validity and non-validity), decision making processes (having, e.g. intuitionistic fuzzy estimations of the criteria), neural networks, pattern recognitions, metaheuristic algorithms, etc. Short review of these legs of research is offered, with some concrete ideas of possible new directions of study. On this basis, a non-formal discussion is raised on the benefits of applying various elements of intuitionistic fuzzy logics as tools for evaluation of Data Mining processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the method for classifying and analyzing lung cancer hospitalization expenses so as to predict reasonable medical cost has become an issue of common interest for both hospitals and insurance institutions. MethodsA C5.0 algorithm is adopted to analyze factors influencing hospitalization expenses of 731 lung cancer patients. A C5.0 algorithm is a data mining method used to classify calculation. ResultsIncreasing the number of input variables leads to variation in the importance of different variables, but length of stay (LOS), major therapy, and medicine cost are the three variables of greater importance. They are important factors that affect the hospitalization cost of lung cancer patients. In all three calculations, the classification accuracy rate of training and testing partition sets reached 84% and above. The classification accuracy rate reached over 95% after addition of the cost variables. ConclusionThe classification rules are proven to be in accordance with actual clinical practice. The model established by the research can also be applied to other diseases in the screening and analysis of disease hospitalization costs according to selected feature variables.

This vast amount of data can help identify various patterns in the human population. In this study, we present methods and algorithms that can assist in identifying variations in lifespan distributions of the human population in the past centuries, in detecting social and genetic features that correlate with the human lifespan, and in constructing predictive models of human lifespan based on various features that can easily be extracted from genealogy datasets. We have evaluated the presented methods and algorithms on a large online genealogy dataset with over a million profiles and over 9 million connections, all of which were collected from the WikiTree website. Our findings indicate that significant but small positive correlations exist between the parents' lifespan and their children's lifespan. Additionally, we found slightly higher and significant correlations between the lifespans of spouses. We also discovered a very small positive and significant correlation between longevity and reproductive success in males, and a small and significant negative correlation between longevity and reproductive success in females. Moreover, our predictive models presented results with a Mean Absolute Error as low as 13.18 in predicting the lifespans of individuals who outlived the age of 10, and our classification models presented better than random classification results in predicting which people who outlive the age of 50 will also outlive the age of 80. We believe that this study will be the first of many studies to utilize the wealth of data on human populations, existing in online genealogy datasets, to better understand factors that influence the human lifespan. Understanding these factors can assist scientists in providing solutions for successful aging.

How to initiate model learning with the least human supervision (i.e., manual labeling) and how to encode the structural knowledge are two elements of this challenge, as they largely determine the scalability and applicability of any solution. In this article, we propose a model-learning method that starts from a single-labeled object for each category, and mines further model knowledge from a number of informally captured, cluttered scenes. However, in these scenes, target objects are relatively small and have large variations in texture, scale, and rotation. Thus, to reduce the model bias normally associated with less supervised learning methods, we use the robust 3D shape in RGB-D images to guide our model learning, then apply the properly trained category models to both object detection and recognition in more conventional RGB images. In addition to model training for their own categories, the knowledge extracted from the RGB-D images can also be transferred to guide model learning for a new category, in which only RGB images without depth information in the new category are provided for training. Preliminary testing shows that the proposed method performs as well as fully supervised learning methods.

Detection of changes in a structure's ability to withstand subsequent loads can aid decisions on safety, repair, rehabilitation, and demolition. Dynamic property shifts can show internal cracks and minor damage before propagation or failure occurs, but only if a proper indicator is selected. In order to evaluate potential damage indices, a model three-story metal frame building was constructed and incrementally damaged. An as-built baseline was used for both sequential and cumulative comparisons to ten scenarios with removed bracing. Identical data sets are mined via twelve algorithms using six unique damage indicators, and each algorithm's performance is evaluated. Of all implemented schemes, frequency response function subtraction using frequency content differentials as a direct indicator is the most accurate damage detection scheme for the three-story test structure.

Gene-gene interaction of CFH, ARMS2, and ARMS2/HTRA1 on the risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in Chinese population	EYE			English	Article							MULTIFACTOR-DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; COMPLEMENT-FACTOR-H; JAPANESE POPULATION; ASSOCIATION; VARIANTS; HTRA1; POLYMORPHISMS; HAPLOTYPE; REGION; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Purpose To evaluate the association and interaction of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes (CFH, ARMS2, and ARMS2/HTRA1) with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in Chinese population. Methods A total of 300 nAMD and 300 PCV patients and 301 normal subjects participated in the present study. The allelic variants of rs800292, rs2274700, rs3750847, rs3793917, and rs1065489 were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Gene-gene interactions were evaluated by the data mining approach multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Results The risk alleles of CFH rs800292, rs2274700, ARMS2 rs3057847, and ARMS2/HTRA1 rs3793917 showed significant difference between nAMD or PCV patients and controls (all P<0.01). The homozygosity of risk alleles for rs800292, rs2274700, rs3750847, and rs3793917 were significantly different between nAMD patients and controls (all P<0.01), and predisposed to PCV patients (all P<0.01). After cross-validation consistency (CVC) and permutation tests, the two-locus model rs2274700_rs3750847 has a balanced accuracy of 64.37% in predicting nAMD disease risk. The one-marker model, rs3750847, and two-locus model rs2274700_rs3750847 has a balanced accuracy of 66.07% and 65.89% in predicting PCV disease risk, respectively. Furthermore, CFH rs1065489 did not show significant association with nAMD (P>0.01), but was strongly associated with PCV in Chinese patients (P<0.001). Conclusions In this study, we found that the interaction of ARMS2 and ARMS2/HTRA1 is significantly associated with nAMD, and the interaction of CFH and ARMS2 is pronounced in PCV development in Chinese population.

The models are developed on data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) studies, and are validated on an external, retrospectively collected cohort. Methods: We selected fifty-one clinical parameters measured at baseline during the DCCT as potential risk factors for the following adverse outcomes: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), Hypoglycemia, Ketoacidosis, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Neuropathy and Retinopathy. For each outcome we applied a data-mining analysis protocol in order to identify the best-performing signature, i.e., the smallest set of clinical parameters that, considered jointly, are maximally predictive for the selected outcome. The predictive models built on the selected signatures underwent both an interval validation on the DCCT/EDIC data and an external validation on a retrospective cohort of 393 diabetes patients (49 Type I and 344 Type II) from the Chorleywood Medical Center, UK. Results: The selected predictive signatures contain five to fifteen risk factors, depending on the specific outcome. Internal validation performances, as measured by the Concordance Index (Cl), range from 0.62 to 0.83, indicating good predictive power. The models achieved comparable performances for the Type I and, quite surprisingly, Type II external cohort. Conclusions: Data-mining analyses of the DCCT/EDIC data allow the identification of accurate predictive models for diabetes-related complications. We also present initial evidences that these models can be applied on a more recent, European population. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Empirical work in this field often focuses on the macro level. Using the case of nuclear energy policy in the United States as proof of concept, we demonstrate how decisive budget changes in a specific policy subsystem can be linked to attention of Congress and the president. We utilize a mixed-methods data-mining approach: Maximum likelihood estimation is used to analyze the distribution of the nuclear energy RD&D budget. Then attention data of both Congress and the president are structured by means of cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Finally, these data are used in a generalized linear model to predict specific budget shifts. The article is designed as a proof of concept: In the case of nuclear energy policy, we are able to predict budget shifts without violating the assumptions of PET. More importantly: we can demonstrate that attention is not only affecting the final policy outcome but also the corridor of the possible.

The massive spectra can be used for large sample research including the structure and evolution of the Galaxy and multi-waveband identication. In addition, the spectra are also ideal for searching for rare and special objects like white dwarf main-sequence star (WDMS). WDMS consist of a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main-sequence (MS) companion which has positive significance to the study of evolution and parameter of close binaries. WDMS is generally discovered by repeated imaging of the same area of sky, measuring light curves for objects or through photometric selection with follow-up observations. These methods require significant manual processing time with low accuracy and the real-time processing requirements can not be satisfied. In this paper, an automatic and efficient method for searching for WDMS candidates is presented. The method Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied in the newly released SDSS-DR10 spectra. A total number of 4 140 WDMS candidates are selected by the method and 24 of them are new discoveries which prove that our approach of finding special celestial bodies in massive spectra data is feasible. In addition, this method is also applicable to mining other special celestial objects in sky survey telescope data. We report the identfication of 24 new WDMS with spectra. A compendium of positions, mjd, plate and fiberid of these new discoveries is presented which enrich the spectral library and will be useful to the research of binary evolution models.

Given a large dataset and a specified query item, we are interested in finding items in the dataset that are within certain range of correlation with the query item. Such a problem, known as the correlation range query, has been a common task in many application domains. In this paper, we identify piecewise monotone properties of the upper and lower bounds of the I center dot coefficient, and propose an efficient correlation range query algorithm, called CORAQ. The CORAQ algorithm effectively prunes many items without computing their actual correlation coefficients with the query item. CORAQ also attains completeness and correctness of the query results. Experiments with large benchmark datasets show that this algorithm is much faster than its brute-force alternative and scales well with large datasets. As case studies, real-world datasets from recommendation applications are analyzed to demonstrate that CORAQ can help effectively identify interesting items to recommend to users.

Cluster Analysis of A-Train Data: Approximating the Vertical Cloud Structure of Oceanic Cloud Regimes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Clouds; Data mining; Satellite observations; Classification	SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; IDENTIFICATION	Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data continue to provide a wealth of two-dimensional, cloud-top information and derived environmental products. In addition, the A-Train constellation of satellites presents an opportunity to combine MODIS data with coincident vertical-profile data collected from sensors on CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Approximating the vertical structure of clouds in data-sparse regions can be accomplished through a two-step process that consists of cluster analysis of MODIS data and quantitative analysis of coincident vertical-profile data. Daytime data over the eastern North Pacific Ocean are used in this study for both the summer (June-August) and winter (December-February) seasons in separate cluster analyses. A-Train data from 2006 to 2009 are collected, and a K-means cluster analysis is applied to selected MODIS data that are coincident with single-layer clouds found in the CloudSat/CALIPSO (GEOPROF-lidar) data. The resultant clusters, 16 in both summer and winter, are quantified in terms of average cloud-base height, cloud-top height, and normalized cloud water content profile. A cluster and its quantified characteristics can then be assigned to a given pixel in near real-time MODIS data, regardless of its proximity to the observed vertical-profile data. When applied to a two-dimensional MODIS dataset, these assigned clusters can provide an approximate three-dimensional representation of the cloud scene.

Overview of modelling and simulation of metal powder bed fusion process at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Modelling and simulation; Metal laser powder bed fusion	MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; RADIATION TRANSFER; HEAT-SOURCES; LASER; FRAMEWORK; PARTS	The metal laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process uses high power lasers to build parts layer upon layer by melting fine metal powders. Qualification of parts produced using this technology is broadly recognised as a significant challenge. Physics based process models have been identified as being foundational to qualification of additively manufactured metal parts. In the present article, a multiscale modelling strategy is described that will serve as the foundation upon which process control and part qualification can be built. This includes a model at the scale of the powder that simulates single track/single multilayer builds and provides powder bed and melt pool thermal data. A second model computationally builds a complete part and predicts manufactured properties (residual stress, dimensional accuracy) in three dimensions. Modelling is tied to experiment through data mining.	[King, W.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Anderson, A. T.; Ferencz, R. M.; Hodge, N.

It has been shown to afford a wide variety of pharmacological activities particularly anticancer properties. In this study, 21 chrysin derivatives with anticancer activities against human gastric adenocarcinoma (SGC-7901) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines were employed for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) investigation. Molecular structures were geometrically optimized at the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level and their quantum chemical and molecular properties were obtained from Gaussian 09 and Dragon softwares, respectively. Significant descriptors for modeling the anticancer activities of SGC-7901 (i.e., SIC2, Mor11e, P2p, HTp, and R5e+) and HT-29 (i.e., L/Bw, BIC2, and Mor19p) cell lines were deduced from stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) method. QSAR models were constructed using MLR and their predictivities were verified via internal (i.e., leave one-out cross-validation; LOO-CV) and external sets. The predictive performance was evaluated from their squared correlation coefficients (R (2) and Q (2)) and root mean square error (RMSE). Results indicated good correlation between experimental and predicted anticancer activities as deduced from statistical parameters of internal and external sets as follows: R (Tr) (2) = 0.8778, RMSETr = 0.0854, Q (CV) (2) = 0.7315, RMSECV = 0.1375, Q (Ext) (2) = 0.7324, and RMSEExt = 0.1168 for QSAR models of SGC-7901 while R (Tr) (2) = 0.8201, RMSETr = 0.1293, Q (CV) (2) = 0.6829, RMSECV = 0.1735, Q (Ext) (2) = 0.8486, and RMSEExt = 0.1179 for QSAR models of HT-29. Furthermore, the obtained QSAR models provided pertinent insights on the structure-activity relationship of investigated compounds where molecular properties such as shape, electronegativities and polarizabilities were crucial for anticancer activity. The knowledge gained from the constructed QSAR models could serve as guidelines for the rational design of novel chrysin derivatives with potent anticancer activity.

The final data set included 27,865 weight measurements covering the whole year 2013 and it was selected from a database of Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority, Finland. The data set contains mixed household waste arising in 6 m(3) containers and it was processed identifying missing values and inconsistently low and high values as errors. The share of missing values and errors in the data set was 0.6%. This provides evidence that the waste weighing data gives reliable information of mixed waste generation at collection point level. Characteristic of mixed household waste arising at the waste collection point level is a wide variation between pickups. The seasonal variation pattern as a result of collective similarities in behaviour of households was clearly detected by smoothed medians of waste weight time series. The evaluation of the collection time series against the defined distribution range of pickup weights on the waste collection point level shows that 65% of the pickups were from collection points with optimally dimensioned container capacity and the collection points with over- and under-dimensioned container capacities were noted in 9.5% and 3.4% of all pickups, respectively. Occasional extra waste in containers occurred in 21.2% of the pickups indicating the irregular behaviour of individual households. The results of this analysis show that processing waste weighing data using knowledge discovery and data mining techniques provides trustworthy information of household waste generation and its variations.

The steady-state power signatures (PS) contain plenty of information needed for detecting state transition and aging of loads. On the other hand, adopting the values of PS directly has the drawbacks of taking a longer time and much memory for the datasets of energy management information system (EMIS). To effectively reduce the number of PS representing load state transition and aging signals, a feature extraction technique of the PS in the EMIS, Hellinger distance, is proposed in this paper.

MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Similarity; Categorical data; Distance measure; Multiple categories	K-MEANS; ALGORITHM; VALUES; ATTRIBUTES; DISTANCE; SYSTEMS	How to measure similarity or distance for multiple categorical data? It is an important step for Data Mining and Knowledge Management process to measure similarity or distance between objects appropriately. Measurements for continuous data have been well-defined and relatively easy to be calculated. However, the notion of similarity for categorical data is not simple, since categorical data usually is not simply translated into the numerical format, and they also have their own priority with structures and data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new measure for multiple categorical data sets using data distribution. Our new measure, MCSM (Multiple Categorical Similarity Measure), can solve conventional drawbacks of multiple categorical data sets successfully in which we prove the verification of our measure with mathematical proofs and experimentation. The experimental result shows that our measure is powerful for multiple categorical data sets with proper data distributions.

After ClCR was overexpressed in E. coli BL21, recombinant E. coli CCZU-T15 with high reductase activity and excellent stereoselectivity for the reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) into ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [(S)-CHBE] was screened using a modified high-throughput colorimetric screening strategy. After the reaction optimization, a highly stereoselective bioreduction of COBE into (S)-CHBE (>99% ee) with the resting cells of E. coli CCZU-T15 was successfully demonstrated in toluene-water (50:50, v/v) biphasic system. Biotransformation of 1000mM COBE for 24h in the biphasic system, (S)-CHBE (>99% ee) could be obtained in the high yield of 96.4%. Significantly, E. coli CCZU-T15 shows high potential in the industrial production of (S)-CHBE (>99% ee).

J	Garrett, A; New, J				Garrett, Aaron; New, Joshua			Scalable tuning of building models to hourly data	ENERGY			English	Article						Autotune; Energy Plus; Calibration; Optimization; Evolutionary computation	SYSTEMS	Energy models of existing buildings are unreliable unless calibrated so that they correlate well with actual energy usage. Manual tuning requires a skilled professional and is prohibitively expensive for small projects, imperfect, non-repeatable, and not scalable to the dozens of sensor channels that smart meters, smart appliances, and sensors are making available. A scalable, automated methodology is needed to quickly, intelligently calibrate building energy models to all available data, increase the usefulness of those models, and facilitate speed-and-scale penetration of simulation-based capabilities into the marketplace for actualized energy savings. The "Autotune" project is a novel, model-agnostic methodology that leverages supercomputing, large simulation ensembles, and big data mining with multiple machine learning algorithms to allow automatic calibration of simulations that match measured experimental data in a way that is deployable on commodity hardware. This paper shares several methodologies employed to reduce the combinatorial complexity to a computationally tractable search problem for hundreds of input parameters. Accuracy metrics are provided that quantify model error to measured data for either monthly or hourly electrical usage from a highly instrumented, emulated-occupancy research home.

Cellular and molecular responses to high-dose ionizing radiation have been characterized, but in the range of low dose, these responses are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the gene expression in response to LDIR (10 cGy) in the EpiDermFT human skin model. We identified 3299 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to LDIR. Among these DEGs, we noted several well-characterized long noncoding RNAs. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to detect altered molecular response. GO and KEGG pathway results showed that genes corresponding to "regulation of cell proliferation" were enriched. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that KRAS signaling pathway was enriched in response to LDIR and transcription targets of NF-kappa B were also enriched when exposed to LDIR.

Statistical and prognostic analysis of dynamic changes of platelet count in ICU patients	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						data mining; ICU; platelet count; patient monitoring; mortality; hemodynamic parameters	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; THROMBOCYTOPENIA; SYSTEM; SEPSIS	Laboratory tests are a primary resource to diagnose patient's diseases. However, physicians often make decisions based on the available information, which commonly includes the last test results as a static picture and have limited perspective of the role of trends in commonly measured parameters in enhancing the diagnostic process. By providing a dynamic patient profile the diagnosis could be more accurate and, as a consequence, physicians could anticipate changes in recovery trajectory and prescribe interventions more effectively. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients need continuous monitoring, which commonly includes the assessment of several blood components. One of these components is the platelet count which is used in assessing blood clotting. However, platelet counts represent a dynamic equilibrium of many simultaneous processes including altered capillary permeability, inflammatory cascades, as well as the coagulation process. To characterize the value of dynamic changes in platelet counts we applied analytic methods to datasets of critically ill patients in (i) a homogeneous population of ICU cardiac surgery patients, where an observation appears to be predictive of patient's complications and mortality and (ii) a heterogeneous group of ICU patients to confirm the previous observation.

Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.

The pH of an experiment is an important parameter and has the potential to be used in data-mining studies to help reduce the number of crystallization trials required. However, the pH is usually recorded as that of the buffer solution, which can be highly inaccurate. Results: Here, we show that a better estimate of the true pH can be predicted by considering not only the buffer pH but also any other chemicals in the crystallization solution. We use these more accurate pH values to investigate the disputed relationship between the pI of a protein and the pH at which it crystallizes.

Data-mining techniques, such as clustering, can extract meaningful information. Among them, the self-organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm has shown great promise; in particular since its computation time rises only linearly with the size of the data set. Whereas SOMs are generally used with few neurons, we investigate here their behavior with large numbers of neurons. Results: We present here a python library implementing the full SOM analysis workflow. Large SOMs can readily be applied on heavy data sets. Coupled with visualization tools they have very interesting properties. Descriptors for each conformation of a trajectory are calculated and mapped onto a 3D landscape, the U-matrix, reporting the distance between neighboring neurons. To delineate clusters, we developed the flooding algorithm, which hierarchically identifies local basins of the U-matrix from the global minimum to the maximum.

J	Chen, LF				Chen, Li-Fei			Exploring asymmetric effects of attribute performance on customer satisfaction using association rule method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer satisfaction; Asymmetric effect; Kano model; Attribute performance; Association rule	QUALITY ATTRIBUTES; KANO MODEL; EMPIRICAL-TEST; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; CLASSIFICATION; IMPROVEMENT	Identifying primary service attributes that generate customer satisfaction (CS) is critical to organizational success. The Kano model demonstrates an asymmetric relationship between attribute performance and CS. However, extant regression-based approaches for classifying Kano's quality attributes have theoretical limitations, such as multicollinearity problems, resulting in spurious inferences. The association rule (AR) method is widely used in data mining to explore the associations or correlations among variables because it does not require the typical assumptions associated with regression analyses. The framework developed in this study incorporates the AR method to classify Kano's quality attributes. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using a case study of a restaurant chain. The proposed method is more practical for classifying Kano's quality attributes because it shortens the time required for data collection. Moreover, the proposed method reduces computational complexity. Validity test results indicate that the proposed method markedly outperforms some regression-based approaches. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the FUSP-tree construction algorithm is thus modified for efficiently handling the deletion of customer sequences. A decremental FUSP-tree algorithm for sequences deletion (FUSP-DEL) is thus proposed for reducing the execution time of re-constructing the tree while the customer sequences are deleted in the original database. Experimental results show that the proposed FUSP-DEL algorithm has a good performance in both of the time and space complexity.

We consider a financial conditions index (FCI) for South Africa that is constructed from sixteen financial variables and test whether the FCI does better than its individual financial components in forecasting the key macroeconomic variables of output growth, inflation, and interest rates. Two sets of out-of-sample forecasts are obtained-one from a benchmark autoregressive (AR) model and one from a nested autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model that includes one financial variable at a time. This concept of forecast encompassing is used to examine the out-of-sample forecasting ability of these financial variables as well as of the FCI, while also controlling for data mining.

A maximal clique is perhaps the most fundamental dense substructure in a graph, and MCE is an important tool to discover densely connected subgraphs, with numerous applications to data mining on web graphs, social networks, and biological networks. While effective sequential methods for MCE are known, scalable parallel methods for MCE are still lacking. We present a new parallel algorithm for MCE, Parallel Enumeration of Cliques using Ordering (PECO), designed for the MapReduce framework. Unlike previous works, which required a post-processing step to remove duplicate and non-maximal cliques, PECO enumerates only maximal cliques with no duplicates. The key technical ingredient is a total ordering of the vertices of the graph which is used in a novel way to achieve a load balanced distribution of work, and to eliminate redundant work among processors. We implemented PECO on Hadoop MapReduce, and our experiments on a cluster show that the algorithm can effectively process a variety of large real-world graphs with millions of vertices and tens of millions of maximal cliques, and scales well with the degree of available parallelism.

Early detection of thyroid disorder is an increasingly important area in the field of medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Thyroid disorder, either over production (hyperthyroidism) or less production (hypothyroidism) results in imbalanced state of thyroid hormone stimulation in human beings. So, controlling this disorder has become a central issue in healthcare and needs great attention. This research critically examines different classification models constructed using a novel mathematical ranked improved F-score ordering (RIFO) applied to thyroid dataset taken from machine learning repository, University of California, Irvine. A total of nine possible and effective feature subsets have been constructed and each subset is tested with three most benchmarked algorithms namely C4.5, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function network (RBFN) using tenfold cross-validation and various training-test partitions. The obtained results show diverse conclusions, but one with interesting and highest accuracy has been presented. From the results, it is observed that MLP has emerged with an outstanding performance of 98.15%, which is greater than all earlier research. The dataset has 3 classes, 5 features and 215 records (hypo=30, hyper=35, normal=150).

Data mining, the major step in the process of the extraction of knowledge using descriptive and predictive algorithms that aid in making proactive decisions, has also been used for CVD diagnosis. Recently, diverse techniques have been developed for analyzing the ECG signals. However, due to the diversity of techniques used, terminologies, performance measures used in different techniques makes analysis and comparing of results thwarting. The aim of this work is to essentially explore and present the analysis of different data mining algorithms proposed earlier in literature for CVD diagnosis, their advantages and limitations. This paper presents various techniques for CVD diagnosis using data mining from an ECG signal under four major phases - ECG Acquisition, ECG Compression, ECG Feature Extraction and ECG diagnosis. The primary aim of this paper is to categorize the various researches done in this regard to provide a glossary for interested researchers and to aid in identifying their potential research direction.

To this end, we distribute locally built classification models in a network of participating users, and combine the shared classifiers into more powerful meta models. In order to increase the propagation efficiency, we apply a method for selecting the most discriminative model components and transmitting them to other participants. In our experiments on four large standard collections for text classification we study the resulting tradeoffs between network cost and classification accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed model propagation has negligible communication costs and substantially outperforms current approaches with respect to efficiency and classification quality.

Traditional data-processing method and classification algorithms might cause clinical information to disappear and reduce prediction performance. To improve the accuracy of clinical-outcome prediction by using multiple measurements, a new multiple-time-series data-processing algorithm with period merging is proposed. Clinical data from 83 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were used in this research. Their clinical reports from a defined period were merged using the proposed merging algorithm, and statistical measures were also calculated. After data processing, multiple measurements support vector machine (MMSVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernels was used as a classification method to predict HCC recurrence. A multiple measurements random forest regression (MMRF) was also used as an additional evaluation/classification method. To evaluate the data-merging algorithm, the performance of prediction using processed multiple measurements was compared to prediction using single measurements. The results of recurrence prediction by MMSVM with RBF using multiple measurements and a period of 120 days (accuracy 0.771, balanced accuracy 0.603) were optimal, and their superiority to the results obtained using single measurements was statistically significant (accuracy 0.626, balanced accuracy 0.459, P < 0.01). In the cases of MMRF, the prediction results obtained after applying the proposed merging algorithm were also better than single-measurement results (P < 0.05). The results show that the performance of HCC-recurrence prediction was significantly improved when the proposed data-processing algorithm was used, and that multiple measurements could be of greater value than single	[Tseng, Yi-Ju] Childrens Hosp, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Childrens Hosp Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ping, Xiao-Ou] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Liang, Ja-Der; Yang, Pei-Ming; Huang, Guan-Tarn] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lai, Feipei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Grad Inst Biomed Elect & Bioinformat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan	Tseng, YJ (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Childrens Hosp Informat Program, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

However, the biological behavior of citrus fruit ripening and postharvest senescence remains unclear. To better understand the senescence process of citrus fruit, we analyzed data sets from commercial microarrays, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and validated physiological quality detection of four main varieties in the genus Citrus. Network-based approaches of data mining and modeling were used to investigate complex molecular processes in citrus. The Citrus Metabolic Pathway Network and correlation networks were constructed to explore the modules and relationships of the functional genes/metabolites. We found that the different flesh-rind transport of nutrients and water due to the anatomic structural differences among citrus varieties might be an important factor that influences fruit senescence behavior. We then modeled and verified the citrus senescence process. As fruit rind is exposed directly to the environment, which results in energy expenditure in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, nutrients are exported from flesh to rind to maintain the activity of the whole fruit. The depletion of internal substances causes abiotic stresses, which further induces phytohormone reactions, transcription factor regulation, and a series of physiological and biochemical reactions.

The health state of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.

The activity recognition is usually done through two steps: activity pattern clustering and activity type decision. Although many related works have been suggested, they had some limited performance because they focused only on one part between the two steps. This paper tries to find the best combination of a pattern clustering method and an activity decision algorithm among various existing works. For the first step, in order to classify so varied and complex user activities, we use a relevant and efficient unsupervised learning method called the K-pattern clustering algorithm. In the second step, the training of smart environment for recognizing and predicting user activities inside his/her personal space is done by utilizing the artificial neural network based on the Allen's temporal relations. The experimental results show that our combined method provides the higher recognition accuracy for various activities, as compared with other data mining classification algorithms. Furthermore, it is more appropriate for a dynamic environment like an IoT based smart home.

A Method to Find Functional Dependencies Through Refutations and Duality of Hypergraphs	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						functional dependencies; duality of hypergraphs; minimal transversals	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; DUALIZATION; DISCOVERY; DATABASE	One of the most important steps in obtaining a relational model from legacy systems is the extraction of functional dependencies (FDs) through data mining techniques. Several methods have been proposed for this purpose and most use direct search methods that traverse the search space in exponential time in the number of attributes of the relation. As it is not uncommon to find in practice relations with tens of attributes, a need exists to further develop more efficient techniques to find FDs. The method studied here finds the minimal set of minimal FDs using algorithms that solve the hypergraph duality problem applied on the complement of the refutation hypergraph of the relation without going through the exponential search space. After showing that the extraction of FDs can be reduced to the hypergraph duality problem, experimental results are given as verification and characterization of the correctness and time complexity of the proposed tool.

Unlike frequent pattern mining, high utility pattern mining deals with non-binary databases, in which the information about purchased quantities of items is maintained. Due to the non-existence of anti-monotone property among the utilities of itemsets, utility mining becomes a big challenge. Moreover, discovering useful patterns from the huge number of potential patterns is a mining bottleneck. However, the compact (Closed and Maximal) high utility pattern mining moderately lessens the number of patterns, but it does not solve it. Recently, an efficient framework called GUIDE, was proposed in the literature to address this issue. Though, GUIDE effectively reduced the number of high utility patterns, yet the quality of few mined patterns and their utilities are not exact. In view of this, we propose a modified MGUIDE(LM) algorithm to improve the quality and determine exact utilities of maximal patterns.

Human factors/ergonomics implications of big data analytics: Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors annual lecture	ERGONOMICS			English	Article						big data; ethics; data mining; correlation	TASK DEMANDS; PERFORMANCE; VISUALIZATION; FUTURE	Practitioner Summary: Human factors/ergonomics practitioners are increasingly likely to work with the large data bases and novel software associated with big data analytics (BDA) and similar fields such as data mining. This paper shows the characteristics of BDA and details methodological and ethical issues that arise in BDA. In recent years, advances in sensor technology, connectedness and computational power have come together to produce huge data-sets. The treatment and analysis of these data-sets is known as big data analytics (BDA), and the somewhat related term data mining. Fields allied to human factors/ergonomics (HFE), e.g. statistics, have developed computational methods to derive meaningful, actionable conclusions from these data bases. This paper examines BDA, often characterised by volume, velocity and variety, giving examples of successful BDA use. This examination provides context by considering examples of using BDA on human data, using BDA in HFE studies, and studies of how people perform BDA. Significant issues for HFE are the reliance of BDA on correlation rather than hypotheses and theory, the ethics of BDA and the use of HFE in data visualisation.

In this perspective, motion analysis and tracking is challenging due to significant visual ambiguities which incite to look into more alternative solutions. In this work, we introduce a new framework for recognizing various motion patterns, extracting abnormal behaviours, and tracking them over crowded traffic scenes. The proposed approach exploits a novel density-based clustering method and highlights three traffic density levels. It performs in two modes: an "offline" mode for motion patterns learning and modelling, and an "online" mode for distinguishing irregular motions and tracking them separately. We developed a light density-based clustering technique to "online" cluster motion vectors, produced by optical flow, and compare them with motion pattern models previously defined. Non-identified clusters are treated as suspicious and tracked over the scene. To evaluate and validate our work, experiment results are discussed and compared with the most recent approaches.

The current study aims to repurpose marketed drugs and clinical candidates for new indications in diabetes treatment by mining clinical 'omics' data. We analyzed data from genome wide association studies (GWAS), proteomics and metabolomics studies and revealed a total of 992 proteins as potential anti-diabetic targets in human. Information on the drugs that target these 992 proteins was retrieved from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and 108 of these proteins are drug targets with drug projects information. Research and preclinical drug targets were excluded and 35 of the 108 proteins were selected as druggable proteins. Among them, five proteins were known targets for treating diabetes. Based on the pathogenesis knowledge gathered from the OMIM and PubMed databases, 12 protein targets of 58 drugs were found to have a new indication for treating diabetes. CMap (connectivity map) was used to compare the gene expression patterns of cells treated by these 58 drugs and that of cells treated by known antidiabetic drugs or diabetes risk causing compounds. As a result, 9 drugs were found to have the potential to treat diabetes. Among the 9 drugs, 4 drugs (diflunisal, nabumetone, niflumic acid and valdecoxib) targeting COX2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) were repurposed for treating type 1 diabetes, and 2 drugs (phenoxybenzamine and idazoxan) targeting ADRA2A (Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor) had a new indication for treating type 2 diabetes. These findings indicated that 'omics' data mining based drug repositioning is a potentially powerful tool to discover novel anti-diabetic indications from marketed drugs and clinical candidates. Furthermore, the results of our study could be related to other disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Ultra-Fast Data-Mining Hardware Architecture Based on Stochastic Computing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; STREAMS; IMAGE	Minimal hardware implementations able to cope with the processing of large amounts of data in reasonable times are highly desired in our information-driven society. In this work we review the application of stochastic computing to probabilistic-based pattern-recognition analysis of huge database sets. The proposed technique consists in the hardware implementation of a parallel architecture implementing a similarity search of data with respect to different pre-stored categories. We design pulse-based stochastic-logic blocks to obtain an efficient pattern recognition system. The proposed architecture speeds up the screening process of huge databases by a factor of 7 when compared to a conventional digital implementation using the same hardware area.

Based on this graph, we derive the normal profile composed of high-level features. We use NSL-KDD dataset to analyze and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed IDS at detecting denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed IDS can achieve good results in terms of detection rate and false positive rate. For some DOS attacks, 100% detection rate is achieved with 1.55% false positive. We also use KDD99 dataset to compare the proposed IDS with two statistical-based methods and some data mining and machine learning-based methods. Comparison study shows that the proposed IDS achieves the best tradeoff between detection rate (99.76%) and false positive rate (0.6%). It also requires just a few microseconds to classify the connection as normal or attack with low CPU usage and low memory consumption. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

But the results of related research still have to further investigate on some issues such as spatial scale. In this paper, we explore human mobility in greater Kaohsiung area by using long-term taxicabs' GPS data. The trip distance in our dataset exhibits exponential decay for short trips and power-law scaling for long trips. We propose an approach to investigate the possible mechanism of the power-law tail. Moreover, we utilize the method of simulation and random relinking trip path to explain the empirical observation. Our results show that the origin of power-law movement distribution may be largely due to the power-law population distribution.

The objective of these experiments is usually to find a reduced set of significant features, which can be used to differentiate the conditions assayed. In terms of development of novel feature selection computational methods, this task is challenging for the lack of fully annotated biological datasets to be used for benchmarking. A possible way to tackle this problem is generating appropriate synthetic datasets, whose composition and behaviour are fully controlled and known a priori. Results: Here we propose a novel method centred on the generation of networks of interactions among different biological molecules, especially involved in regulating gene expression. Synthetic datasets are obtained from ordinary differential equations based models with known parameters. Our results show that the generated datasets are well mimicking the behaviour of real data, for popular data analysis methods are able to selectively identify existing interactions. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used in conjunction to real biological datasets in the assessment of data mining techniques. The main strength of this method consists in the full control on the simulated data while retaining coherence with the real biological processes.

Limited data exist on the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in adults. We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in this previously understudied group. Methods. VAERS is the national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for US reports of adults aged >= 19 years who received the MMR vaccine from 1 January 2003 to 31 July 2013. We clinically reviewed reports and available medical records for serious AEs, pregnancy reports, and reports for selected prespecified outcomes. Results. During this period, VAERS received 3175 US reports after MMR vaccine in adults. Of these, 168 (5%) were classified as serious, including 7 reports of death. Females accounted for 77% of reports. The most common signs and symptoms for all reports were pyrexia (19%), rash (17%), pain (13%), and arthralgia (13%). We did not detect any new safety findings in empirical Bayesian data mining. We identified 131 reports of MMR vaccine administered to a pregnant woman; the majority of these vaccinations were in the first trimester and in 83 (62%), no AE was reported. Conclusions. In our review of VAERS data, we did not detect any new or unexpected safety concerns for MMR vaccination in adults. We identified reports of pregnant women exposed to MMR, which is a group in whom the vaccine is contraindicated, suggesting the need for continued provider education on vaccine recommendations and screening.

The inspection of the full scan mass chromatograms was usually performed manually, which is labor-intensive. It is difficult to distinguish low response signals from complex chemical background. Furthermore, this process is typically based on earlier knowledge of the chemical composition of TCM, and those molecules that have not been characterized earlier were thus ignored. In this paper, a strategy using UPLC-MS combined with pattern recognition analysis was developed to simplify and quicken the identification of multicomponent in Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. First, complex signals obtained by UPLC-MS were processed using automated data mining algorithm and further processed with multivariate chemometric methods. Multicomponent in Abelmoschns manihot L. can be clearly displayed in S- and VIP-plot. Using this method, 320 peaks which present Abelmoschus monihot L. were detected. In the next step, accurate mass spectra of the characteristic markers acquired by QTOF MS were used to estimate their elemental formulae and enable structure identification. By searching in METLIN database, 41 components were tentatively identified in Abelmoschus monihot L. Our results showed that UPLC-MS based-pattern recognition analysis approach can be used to quickly identify TCM multicomponent and for standardization of herbal preparations. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite advances in treatment for LAHNC, a significant minority of these patients continue to fail to achieve complete response with standard CRT. By constructing a multi-modality functional imaging (FI) predictive biomarker for CRT outcome for patients with LAHNC we hope to be able to reliably identify those patients at high risk of failing standard CRT. Such a biomarker would in future enable CRT to be tailored to the specific biological characteristics of each patients' tumour, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes. Methods/design: The INSIGHT study is a single-centre, prospective, longitudinal multi-modality imaging study using functional MRI and FDG-PET/CT for patients with LAHNC squamous cell carcinomas receiving radical CRT. Two cohorts of patients are being recruited: one treated with, and another treated without, induction chemotherapy. All patients receive radical intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. Patients undergo functional imaging before, during and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, as well as at the time of relapse, should that occur within the first two years after treatment. Serum samples are collected from patients at the same time points as the FI scans for analysis of a panel of serum markers of tumour hypoxia. Discussion: The primary aim of the INSIGHT study is to acquire a prospective multi-parametric longitudinal data set comprising functional MRI, FDG PET/CT, and serum biomarker data from patients with LAHNC undergoing primary radical CRT. This data set will be used to construct a predictive imaging biomarker for outcome after CRT for LAHNC. This predictive imaging biomarker will be used in future studies of functional imaging based treatment stratification for patients with LAHNC. Additional objectives are: defining the reproducibility of FI parameters; determining robust methods for defining FI based biological target volumes for IMRT planning; creation of a searchable database of functional imaging data for data mining. The INSIGHT study will help to establish the role of FI in the clinical management of LAHNC.

ADME SARfari: comparative genomics of drug metabolizing systems	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ALDEHYDE OXIDASE	Motivation: ADME SARfari is a freely available web resource that enables comparative analyses of drug-disposition genes. It does so by integrating a number of publicly available data sources, which have subsequently been used to build data mining services, predictive tools and visualizations for drug metabolism researchers. The data include the interactions of small molecules with ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) proteins responsible for the metabolism and transport of molecules; available pharmacokinetic (PK) data; protein sequences of ADME-related molecular targets for pre-clinical model species and human; alignments of the orthologues including information on known SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and information on the tissue distribution of these proteins. In addition, in silico models have been developed, which enable users to predict which ADME relevant protein targets a novel compound is likely to interact with.

The current European policy on energy saving, with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 244/2012, recommends a cost-optimal analysis of retrofit improvements, starting from some reference buildings. One relevant issue is the definition of a set of reference buildings effectively representative of the considered stock. A possible solution could be found using data mining techniques, such as the K-means clustering method, which allows the division of a large sample into more homogeneous and small groups. This work adopts the cluster analysis to find out a few school buildings representative of a sample of about 60 schools in the province of Treviso, North-East of Italy, thus reducing the number of buildings to be analyzed in detail to optimize the energy retrofit measures. Real consumption data of the scholastic year 2011-2012 were correlated to buildings characteristics through regression and the parameters with the highest correlation with energy consumption levels used in cluster analysis to group schools. This method has supported the definition of representative architectural types and the identification of a small number of parameters determinant to assess the energy consumption for air heating and hot water production.

Compared to the state of the art, ExProrre provides a CPU time saving of up to two orders of magnitude without compromising other dimensions of performance (e.g. memory). The reason why it is so fast is that EXPEDITE wastes less time in mining intermediate item sets that are discarded in later phases of the algorithm. More specifically, it cuts down the number of both duplicate FCIs those generated multiple times by the algorithm and infrequent itemsets those with low support or no supporting transactions. This feature, enjoyable by both sparse and dense datasets, is analytically motivated first, and then experimentally supported by extensive tests on real datasets. As a further contribution, we propose two alternative implementations of EXPEDITE that perform even better than the basic version, although they rely on particular features of the input dataset.

Advances in computation now make it possible to apply well-established data mining and pattern recognition techniques to these data to learn models that effectively relate structure and function. However, extracting meaningful numerical descriptors of protein sequence and structure is a key issue that requires an efficient and widely available solution. Results: We here introduce ProtDCal, a new computational software suite capable of generating tens of thousands of features considering both sequence-based and 3D-structural descriptors. We demonstrate, by means of principle component analysis and Shannon entropy tests, how ProtDCal's sequence-based descriptors provide new and more relevant information not encoded by currently available servers for sequence-based protein feature generation. The wide diversity of the 3D-structure-based features generated by ProtDCal is shown to provide additional complementary information and effectively completes its general protein encoding capability. As demonstration of the utility of ProtDCal's features, prediction models of N-linked glycosylation sites are trained and evaluated. Classification performance compares favourably with that of contemporary predictors of N-linked glycosylation sites, in spite of not using domain-specific features as input information. Conclusions: ProtDCal provides a friendly and cross-platform graphical user interface, developed in the Java programming language and is freely available at: http://bioinf.sce.carleton.ca/ProtDCal/. ProtDCal introduces local and group-based encoding which enhances the diversity of the information captured by the computed features. Furthermore, we have shown that adding structure-based descriptors contributes non-redundant additional information to the features-based characterization of polypeptide systems. This software is intended to provide a useful tool for general-purpose encoding of protein sequences and structures for applications is protein classification, similarity analyses and function prediction.

By collecting International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) coded EMR data as part of the Transition Project from Dutch and Maltese databases (using the EMR TransHIS), data mining algorithms can empirically quantify the relationships of all presenting reasons for encounter (RfEs) and recorded diagnostic outcomes. We have specifically looked at new episodes of care (EoC) for two urinary system infections: simple urinary tract infection (UTI, ICPC code: U71) and pyelonephritis (ICPC code: U70). Methods: Participating family doctors (FDs) recorded details of all their patient contacts in an EoC structure using the ICPC, including RfEs presented by the patient, and the FDs' diagnostic labels. The relationships between RfEs and episode titles were studied using probabilistic and data mining methods as part of the TRANSFoRm project. Results: The Dutch data indicated that the presence of RfE's "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection", "Dysuria", "Fear of UTI", "Urinary frequency/urgency", "Haematuria", "Urine symptom/complaint, other" are all strong, reliable, predictors for the diagnosis "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection". The Maltese data indicated that the presence of RfE's "Dysuria", "Urinary frequency/urgency", "Haematuria" are all strong, reliable, predictors for the diagnosis "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection". The Dutch data indicated that the presence of RfE's "Flank/axilla symptom/complaint", "Dysuria", "Fever", "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection", "Abdominal pain/cramps general" are all strong, reliable, predictors for the diagnosis "Pyelonephritis". The Maltese data set did not present any clinically and statistically significant predictors for pyelonephritis. Conclusions: We describe clinically and statistically significant diagnostic associations observed between UTIs and pyelonephritis presenting as a new problem in family practice, and all associated RfEs, and demonstrate that the significant diagnostic cues obtained are consistent with the literature. We conclude that it is possible to generate clinically meaningful diagnostic evidence from electronic sources of patient data.

Principal observations of my tomography model are largely consistent with mapped geology features and previous geophysical studies while providing previously unavailable, laterally continuous details of the southern Alaskan Cordillera lithosphere. At intermediate periods, a geophysically uniform crust is observed north of the Denali Fault and is consistent with a sharp transition in crustal thickness. Under the Wrangell volcanic belt, a prominent low-phase-velocity anomaly correlates well with the lateral extent of a relative low-gravity anomaly and Neogene surface volcanics. At longer periods, a low-phase-velocity anomaly bounds the inferred eastern extent of the subducted Yakutat microplate beneath the Wrangell volcanic belt.

Indeed, text collections are large and it is very difficult for biologists to fully take benefit from this amount of knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been applied to extract background knowledge from biomedical texts. Some of existing NLP approaches are based on handcrafted rules and thus are time consuming and often devoted to a specific corpus. Machine learning based NLP methods, give good results but generate outcomes that are not really understandable by a user. Results: We take advantage of an hybridization of data mining and natural language processing to propose an original symbolic method to automatically produce patterns conveying gene interactions and their characterizations. Therefore, our method not only allows gene interactions but also semantics information on the extracted interactions (e. g., modalities, biological contexts, interaction types) to be detected. Only limited resource is required: the text collection that is used as a training corpus. Our approach gives results comparable to the results given by state-of-the-art methods and is even better for the gene interaction detection in AIMed. Conclusions: Experiments show how our approach enables to discover interactions and their characterizations. To the best of our knowledge, there is few methods that automatically extract the interactions and also associated semantics information.

Characterizing the geometrical properties of these networks has become increasingly relevant for routing problems, inference and data mining. In real growing networks, topological, structural and geometrical properties emerge spontaneously from their dynamical rules. Nevertheless we still miss a model in which networks develop an emergent complex geometry. Here we show that a single two parameter network model, the growing geometrical network, can generate complex network geometries with non-trivial distribution of curvatures, combining exponential growth and small-world properties with finite spectral dimensionality. In one limit, the non-equilibrium dynamical rules of these networks can generate scale-free networks with clustering and communities, in another limit planar random geometries with non-trivial modularity. Finally we find that these properties of the geometrical growing networks are present in a large set of real networks describing biological, social and technological systems.

J	Mandloi, S; Chakrabarti, S				Mandloi, Sapan; Chakrabarti, Saikat			PALM-IST: Pathway Assembly from Literature Mining - an Information Search Tool	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; GENE NORMALIZATION; BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; TEXT; DATABASE; NETWORKS; SYSTEM; WEB; BIOLOGY; MEDLINE	Manual curation of biomedical literature has become extremely tedious process due to its exponential growth in recent years. To extract meaningful information from such large and unstructured text, newer and more efficient mining tool is required. Here, we introduce PALM-IST, a computational platform that not only allows users to explore biomedical abstracts using keyword based text mining but also extracts biological entity (e.g., gene/protein, drug, disease, biological processes, cellular component, etc.) information from the extracted text and subsequently mines various databases to provide their comprehensive inter-relation (e.g., interaction, expression, etc.). PALM-IST constructs protein interaction network and pathway information data relevant to the text search using multiple data mining tools and assembles them to create a meta-interaction network. It also analyzes scientific collaboration by extraction and creation of "co-authorship network," for a given search context. Hence, this useful combination of literature and data mining provided in PALM-IST can be used to extract novel protein-protein interaction (PPI), to generate meta-pathways and further to identify key crosstalk and bottleneck proteins. PALM-IST is available at www.hpppi.iicb.res.in/ctm.

However, the poor prognosis of young breast cancer cannot be fully explained by the clinical and molecular factors. Methods: This study investigated 1125 Chinese breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2009 to 2013. A data mining of gene expression profiles was performed for the young and older breast cancer patients, identifying significantly differentially expressed genes. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay were carried out for the clinical sample validations. Results: The investigation firstly displayed that young patients (<= 45 years) accounted for 47.6 % (535/1125) of breast cancer, and clinically associated with some unfavorable factors related to poor prognosis, such as invasive pathological type, high tumor grade, lymph node positive, ER negative and triple-negative subtype. Subsequently, 553 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified by the data mining. Of them, a set of genes related to immune function were observed to be up-regulated in young patients with breast cancer. Impressively, the CXCL13 (C-X-C motif chemokine 13) expression level showed the most significant difference (FC = 2.64, P = 8.2 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, the validations with clinical samples and correlation analysis demonstrated that CXCL13 was indeed highly expressed in young breast cancer and closely associated with some prognostic factors including lymph node positive and ER negative. Conclusion: This is the first to indicate the clinical relevance of CXCL13 to young breast cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for young breast cancer.

The challenge is to extract meaningful biological context for proteins or genes which is currently difficult because of the lack of an integrative workflow that hinders the efficiency and the robustness of data mining performed by biologists working on ruminants. Thus, we designed ProteINSIDE, a free web service (www. proteinside. org) that (I) provides an overview of the biological information stored in public databases or provided by annotations according to the Gene Ontology, (II) predicts proteins that are secreted to search for proteins that mediate signalisation between cells or tissues, and (III) analyses protein-protein interactions to identify proteins contributing to a process or to visualize functional pathways. Using lists of proteins or genes as a unique input, ProteINSIDE is an original all-inone tool that merges data from these searches to present a fast overview and integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic data from Bovine, Ovine, Caprine, Human, Rat, and Murine species. ProteINSIDE was bench tested with 1000 proteins identifiers from each species by comparison with DAVID, BioMyn, AgBase, PrediSi, and Phobius. Compared to DAVID or BioMyn, identifications and annotations provided by ProteINSIDE were similar from monogastric proteins but more numerous and relevant for ruminants proteins. ProteINSIDE, thanks to SignalP, listed less proteins potentially secreted with a signal peptide than PrediSi and Phobius, in agreement with the low false positive rate of SignalP. In addition ProteINSIDE is the only resource that predicts proteins secreted by cellular processes that do not involve a signal peptide. Lastly, we reported the usefulness of ProteINSIDE to bring new biological hypotheses of research from proteomics data: the biological meaning of the uptake of adiponectin by the foetal muscle and a role for autophagy during ontogenesis of adipose and muscle tissues.

Generally, it makes use of the complementary information embedded in multiple views to improve clustering performance. Recent methods usually find a low-dimensional embedding of multi-view data, but often ignore some useful prior information that can be utilized to better discover the latent group structure of multi-view data. To alleviate this problem, a novel pairwise sparse subspace representation model for multi-view clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to harness prior information to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with respect to other data points in the same view. The second part aims to maximize the correlation between the representations of different views. An alternating minimization method is provided as an efficient solution for the proposed multi-view clustering algorithm. A detailed theoretical analysis is also conducted to guarantee the convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that the must-link and cannot-link constraints can be naturally integrated into the proposed model to obtain a link constrained multi-view clustering model. Extensive experiments on five real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, reduction of 17 beta-estradiol production by inhibiting 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17 beta-HSD1) is an interesting route for breast cancer treatment particularly during adjuvant therapy. This study investigated the structure activity relationship of 17 beta-HSD1 inhibitors as to gain insights and understanding on the origins of 17 beta-HSD1 inhibitory activities. To meet this goal, multiple linear regression model was constructed and correspondingly the results revealed good predictivity (N = 31, R-2 = 0.9438, Q(2) = 0.8530). The model suggested that low molecular weight and energy were preferred as 17 beta-HSD1 inhibitors. Additionally, high molecular flexibility and high number of hydrogen bond donors were also shown to be important that is in correspondence to previously reported pharmacophore model of 17 beta-HSD1 inhibitors. Furthermore, molecular docking of inhibitors to 17 beta-HSD1 followed by anchor analysis suggested that three different pockets comprising of hydrogen bonding sites 1 and 2 as well as van der Waals contacts contributed to protein-ligand interactions. Post-docking analysis of potent compound 9 with 17 beta-HSD1 suggested that the binding modality was similar to the binding of substrate (i.e. estradiol) and its analog (i.e. equilin). Such information is useful in guiding the further design of novel and robust 17 beta-H5D1 inhibitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

One recent trend in developing control charts is based on novelty score algorithms that can effectively describe reality and reflect the unique characteristics of the data being monitored. In this study, we compared eight novelty score algorithmsthe T-2, Local T-2, D-max, D-mean, K-2, the k-nearest neighbor data description, the local density outlier factor, and the hybrid novelty score (HNS)in terms of their average run length performance. A rigorous simulation was conducted to compare the novelty score-based multivariate control charts under both normal and non-normal scenarios. The simulation showed that in both normal and lognormal scenarios, D-max-based control charts produced the most promising results. In skewed distribution with high kurtosis non-normal scenarios, HNS- and K-2-based control charts performed best. In symmetric with kurtosis non-normal scenarios, local T-2-based control charts outperformed the others.

Users' perceptions are heterogeneous for many reasons: the qualitative aspects of PT service, users' socio-economic characteristics, and the diversity of tastes and attitudes towards PT. By analysing different groups of users who share a common characteristic (e.g. socio-economic or travel behaviour), it is possible to homogenise user opinions about the quality of service. This paper studies quality as perceived by users of the metropolitan transit system of Granada (Spain) through a classification tree technique (classification and regression trees (CART)) based on five market segmentations (gender, age, frequency of use, reason for travelling, and type of ticket). CART is a non-parametric method that has a number of advantages compared to other methods that require a predefined underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables. The study is based on data gathered in several customer satisfaction surveys (non-research-oriented) conducted in the Granada metropolitan transit system. The models' outcomes show that some attributes are very important for almost all the market segments (punctuality and information), while others are not very relevant for any of the segments - most notably fare, despite the fact that fare was stated as very important by most of the passengers during the interview.

Radial basis function, multilayer perceptron and generalised regression neural networks were investigated and a comparison of their predictive ability for model solutions discussed. For real world application, the effect of matrix complexity on t(R) measurements is presented. Measured tit for some compounds in influent wastewater varied by >1 min in comparison to t(R) in model solutions. Similarly, matrix impact on artificial neural network predictive ability was addressed towards developing a more robust approach for routine screening applications. Overall, the best neural network had a predictive accuracy of <1.3 min at the 75th percentile of all measured t(R) data in wastewater samples (<10% of the total runtime). Coefficients of determination for 30 blind test compounds in wastewater matrices lay at or above R-2 = 0.92. Finally, the model Was evaluated for application to the semi-targeted identification of pharmaceutical residues during a weeklong wastewater sampling campaign. The model successfully identified native compounds at a rate of 83 +/- 4% and 73 +/- 5% in influent and effluent extracts, respectively. The use of an FIRMS database and the optimised ANN model was also applied to shortlisting of 37 additional compounds in wastewater. Ultimately, this research will potentially enable faster identification of emerging contaminants in the environment through more efficient post-acquisition data mining. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

SMYD2 is overexpressed in a significant percentage of esophageal squamous primary carcinomas, and that overexpression correlates with poor patient survival. However, the mechanism(s) by which SMYD2 promotes oncogenesis is not understood. A small molecule probe for SMYD2 would allow for the pharmacological dissection of this biology. In this report, we disclose LLY-507, a cell-active, potent small molecule inhibitor of SMYD2. LLY-507 is >100-fold selective for SMYD2 over a broad range of methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase targets. A1.63- A resolution crystal structure of SMYD 2 in complex with LLY-507 shows the inhibitor binding in the substrate peptide binding pocket. LLY-507 is active in cells as measured by reduction of SMYD2-induced monomethylation of p53 Lys(370) at submicromolar concentrations. We used LLY-507 to further test other potential roles of SMYD2. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics showed that cellular global histone methylation levels were not significantly affected by SMYD2 inhibition with LLY-507, and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that SMYD2 is primarily cytoplasmic, suggesting that SMYD2 targets a very small subset of histones at specific chromatin loci and/or non-histone substrates. Breast and liver cancers were identified through in silico data mining as tumor types that display amplification and/or overexpression of SMYD2. LLY-507 inhibited the proliferation of several esophageal, liver, and breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that LLY-507 serves as a valuable chemical probe to aid in the dissection of SMYD2 function in cancer and other biological processes.

This species acts as a vector of Plasmodium vivax, an important etiological agent of malaria, which represents a serious public health problem. In mosquitoes, trypsin-like serine proteases are important in blood meal digestion, immune responses and reproductive functions. The study of peptidases expressed in the mosquito midgut is essential to understanding the mechanisms of parasite-host interaction and the physiological process of nutrient digestion. Methods: Our study aimed to identify and characterize the proteolytic activities in the midgut of sugar-fed An. aquasalis females using zymographic analyses (substrate-SDS-PAGE), in-solution assays and mass spectrometry. Results: Here, we used a zymographic analysis to further biochemically characterize the proteolytic profile of the midgut of sugar-feeding An. aquasalis females. The trypsin peptidases migrated between similar to 17 and similar to 76 kDa and displayed higher proteolytic activities between pH 7.5 and 10 and at temperatures between 37 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Four putative trypsin-like serine peptidases were identified using mass spectrometry and data mining. The molecular masses of these peptidases were similar to those observed using zymography, which suggested that these peptidases could be responsible for some of the observed proteolytic bands. Conclusions: Taken together, our results contribute to the gene annotation of the unknown genome of this species, to the tissue location of these peptidases, and to the functional prediction of these crucial enzymes, which all impact further studies of this species.

However, heterogeneity is still the threat to the validity and quality of such studies. Currently, Q and its descendant I-2 (I square) tests are widely used as the tools for heterogeneity evaluation. The core mission of this kind of test is to identify data sets from similar populations and exclude those are from different populations. Although Q and I2 are used as the default tool for heterogeneity testing, the work we present here demonstrates that the robustness of these two tools is questionable. Methods and Findings We simulated a strictly normalized population S. The simulation successfully represents randomized control trial data sets, which fits perfectly with the theoretical distribution (experimental group: p = 0.37, control group: p = 0.88). And we randomly generate research samples Si that fits the population with tiny distributions. In short, these data sets are perfect and can be seen as completely homogeneous data from the exactly same population. If Q and I-2 are truly robust tools, the Q and I-2 testing results on our simulated data sets should not be positive. We then synthesized these trials by using fixed model. Pooled results indicated that the mean difference (MD) corresponds highly with the true values, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is narrow. But, when the number of trials and sample size of trials enrolled in the meta-analysis are substantially increased; the Q and I-2 values also increase steadily. This result indicates that I-2 and Q are only suitable for testing heterogeneity amongst small sample size trials, and are not adoptable when the sample sizes and the number of trials increase substantially. Conclusions Every day, meta-analysis studies which contain flawed data analysis are emerging and passed on to clinical practitioners as "updated evidence". Using this kind of evidence that contain heterogeneous data sets leads to wrong conclusion, makes chaos in clinical practice and weakens the foundation of evidence-based medicine. We suggest more strict applications of meta-analysis: it should only be applied to those synthesized trials with small sample sizes. We call upon that the tools of evidence-based medicine should keep up-to-dated with the cutting-edge technologies in data science. Clinical research data should be made available publicly when there is any relevant article published so the research community could conduct in-depth data mining, which is a better alternative for meta-analysis in many instances.

J	Du, F; Zhu, AX; Band, L; Liu, J				Du, Fei; Zhu, A-Xing; Band, Lawrence; Liu, Jing			Soil property variation mapping through data mining of soil category maps	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						soil property; continuous variation; hydrological modelling; data mining; SoLIM; soil similarity model	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; SPATIAL INFORMATION; FUZZY-LOGIC; DISAGGREGATION; MODEL; TOPMODEL; SCALE; SIMILARITY; SCIENCE	Spatial information on soil properties is an important input to hydrological models. In current hydrological modelling practices, soil property information is often derived from soil category maps by the linking method in which a representative soil property value is linked to each soil polygon. Limited by the area-class nature of soil category maps, the derived soil property variation is discontinuous and less detailed than high resolution digital terrain or remote sensing data. This research proposed dmSoil, a data-mining-based approach to derive continuous and spatially detailed soil property information from soil category maps. First, the soil-environment relationships are extracted through data mining of a soil map. The similarity of the soil at each location to different soil types in the soil map is then estimated using the mined relationships. Prediction of soil property values at each location is made by combining the similarities of the soil at that location to different soil types and the representative soil property values of these soil types. The new approach was applied in the Raffelson Watershed and Pleasant Valley in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, United States to map soil A horizon texture (in both areas) and depth to soil C horizon (in Pleasant Valley). The property maps from the dmSoil approach capture the spatial gradation and details of soil properties better than those from the linking method. The new approach also shows consistent accuracy improvement at validation points. In addition to the improved performances, the inputs for the dmSoil approach are easy to prepare, and the approach itself is simple to deploy. It provides an effective way to derive better soil property information from soil category maps for hydrological modelling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The information is distributed within database tables in large textual attributes with a free structure. Information retrieval from these information is necessary for complementing cardiotocography signals with additional information that is to be implemented in a decision support system. The basic statistical overview (n-gram analysis) helped with the insight into data structure, however more sophisticated methods have to be used as human (and expert) processing of the whole data were out of consideration: over 620,000 text fields contained text reports in natural language with (many) typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities, syntax errors and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. There was a strong need to efficiently determine the overall structure of the database and discover information that is important from the clinical point of view. We have used three different methods: k-means, self-organizing map and a self-organizing approach inspired by ant-colonies that performed clustering of the records. The records were visualized and revealed the most prominent information structure(s) that were consulted with medical experts and served for further mining from the database. The outcome of this task is a set of ordered or nominal attributes with a structural information that is available for rule discovery mining and automated processing for the research of asphyxia prediction during delivery. The proposed methodology has significantly reduced the processing time of loosely structured textual records for both IT and medical experts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One way to improve accuracy is through the combination of images from different sensors, by either image fusion or multi-sensor classifications. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine which classification method is more efficient in improving land cover classification accuracies for the Amazon varzea and similar wetland environments - (a) synthetically fused optical and SAR images or (b) multi-sensor classification of paired SAR and optical images. Land cover classifications based on images from a single sensor (Landsat TM or Radarsat-2) are compared with multi-sensor and image fusion classifications. Object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the J.48 data-mining algorithm were used for automated classification, and classification accuracies were assessed using the kappa index of agreement and the recently proposed allocation and quantity disagreement measures. Overall, optical-based classifications had better accuracy than SAR-based classifications. Once both datasets were combined using the multi-sensor approach, there was a 2% decrease in allocation disagreement, as the method was able to overcome part of the limitations present in both images. Accuracy decreased when image fusion methods were used, however. We therefore concluded that the multi-sensor classification method is more appropriate for classifying land cover in the Amazon varzea.

J	Moller, M; Volk, M				Moeller, Markus; Volk, Martin			Effective map scales for soil transport processes and related process domains - Statistical and spatial characterization of their scale-specific inaccuracies	GEODERMA			English	Article						Digital soil mapping; Geodata accuracy; Mass balance index; Scale; Tillage erosion	AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; LANDFORM ELEMENTS; TERRAIN-ANALYSIS; TILLAGE EROSION; EVOLUTION; GEOMORPHOMETRY; REDISTRIBUTION; SEGMENTATION; QUALITY; GENESIS	Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) aims at the creation of reliable, reproducible and dynamic spatial soil information according to specific users' requests and demands. Positional and temporal inaccuracies as well as the question of an optimal resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs) indicate scale-related issues which represent typical challenges for DSM. In this study, the effective map scale (EMS) approach is presented which enables the detection of operational scales where soil-related processes take place, the localization of corresponding process domains, as well as the statistical and spatial visualization of their scale-specific inaccuracies. The underlying algorithm can be considered as a test procedure for predictive efficiency where measurements, characterizing a soil-related process as well as a proxy variable and its scale-specific variation, are optimized. In doing so, positional and semantic inaccuracies of legacy data can be detected. The EMS approach is applied to the example of an agricultural parcel where soil erosion by tillage is assumed. Auger samples have been taken in order to quantify the amount of soil loss and accumulation during the last 80 years in a German landscape with a complex topography and dominating loess parent material. The measurements have been related to the terrain attribute Mass Balance Index (MBI), which acts as an indicator for tillage erosion and has been varied according to both scale and soil surface complexity. The indicator MBI is derived from a high resolution digital elevation model and combines the basic terrain attributes slope, curvature and vertical distance to channel network due to their importance for tillage erosion processes. Different scale levels have been created by a region-growing segmentation algorithm. Each scale level contains discrete soil-terrain objects, represented by polygons. The scale-related analysis of MBI variations and measurements has revealed a range of EMSs where process domains are visible. Their accuracies are characterized from various perspectives: (1.) The analysis of single MBI variants of scale and complexity by linear regression expresses the spatial and statistical variance of EMSs. (2.) The application of the data mining algorithm random forest on all the MBI variants of complexity per scale level leads to a spatial and statistical suppression of uncertain process domains and an emphasis of process domains, which could be predicted with a higher reliability. In this study, the process domains of accumulation could be identified on a range of operational scale levels. Due to the positional inaccuracies of auger samples and temporal inaccuracies based on overlaying long-term soil transport processes, the process domains of soil loss could not be sufficiently located.

Understanding the evolution of mathematics performance in primary education and the implications for STEM learning: A Markovian approach	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Mathematics education; Longitudinal student data; Markov chain; Educational data mining	HIGH-SCHOOL; MODELS	National reports have documented deficiencies in the vertical alignment of mathematical learning in K-12 education. Many students fail to master requisite concepts before advancing to more complex ideas, leaving them ill-prepared to succeed in higher level Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) coursework. In this paper, we model elementary and middle school students' performance in mathematics over time as a stochastic process to forecast their proficiency by the eighth grade. We conduct an extensive examination of tens of thousands of student records and extract useful information.

J	Duque, R; Gomez-Perez, D; Nieto-Reyes, A; Bravo, C				Duque, Rafael; Gomez-Perez, Domingo; Nieto-Reyes, Alicia; Bravo, Crescencio			Analyzing collaboration and interaction in learning environments to form learner groups	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Group formation; Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning; Analysis indicators; Data depth	DATA DEPTH; SYSTEM; TOOL	An important number of academic tasks should be solved collaboratively by groups of learners. The Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems support this collaboration by means of shared workspaces and tools that enable communication and coordination between learners. Successful collaboration and interaction can depend on the criteria followed when forming the groups of learners. This paper proposes a method that analyses the collaboration and interaction between learners using a set of indicators or variables about how they solve academic tasks. Then, the concept of data depth is used as a measurement of the closeness of the analysis indicators' values for a learner with respect to the values that the same indicators take for the other learners. Finally, the data depth is used to form new groups of learners whose analysis indicators take similar or different values. Thus, the method enables teachers to form homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to their preferences. This group formation process is carried out automatically by a software tool. This paper presents two case studies in which the method is applied to form groups of learners who solve academic tasks in different domains (computer programming and data mining).

J	Xing, WL; Guo, R; Eva, P; Sean, G				Xing Wanli; Guo Rui; Eva, Petakovic; Sean, Goggins			Participation-based student final performance prediction model through interpretable Genetic Programming: Integrating learning analytics, educational data mining and theory	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Learning analytics; Educational data mining; Prediction; CSCL; Activity theory; Genetic Programming	CLASSIFICATION; ONLINE	Building a student performance prediction model that is both practical and understandable for users is a challenging task fraught with confounding factors to collect and measure. Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students' participation in the CSCL (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of VMTwG trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the GP algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, its performance on large scale and high dimensional data is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose sparse fuzzy C-means (SFCM) algorithm, which reforms traditional FCM to deal with high dimensional data clustering, based on Witten's sparse clustering framework. SFCM embeds feature selection into FCM via sparse weighting and makes model interpretation easier. The experiments and comparisons indicate the method is able to select important features and also increase the efficiency for large-scale clustering problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, HL				Li, Hailin			Piecewise aggregate representations and lower-bound distance functions for multivariate time series	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Piecewise aggregate representation; Similarity measure; Lower bound function; Multivariate time series; Dynamic time warping	RECOGNITION; FEATURES; RETRIEVAL	Dimensionality reduction is one of the most important methods to improve the efficiency of the techniques that are applied to the field of multivariate time series data mining. Due to multivariate time series with the variable-based and time-based dimensions, the reduction techniques must take both of them into consideration. To achieve this goal, we use a center sequence to represent a multivariate time series so that the new sequence can be seen as a univariate time series. Thus two sophisticated piecewise aggregate representations, including piecewise aggregate approximation and symbolization applied to univariate time series, are used to further represent the extended sequence that is derived from the center one. Furthermore, some distance functions are designed to measure the similarity between two representations. Through being proven by some related mathematical analysis, the proposed functions are lower bound on Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. In this way, false dismissals can be avoided when they are used to index the time series. In addition, multivariate time series with different lengths can be transformed into the extended sequences with equal length, and their corresponding distance functions can measure the similarity between two unequal-length multivariate time series. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can reduce the dimensionality, and their corresponding distance functions satisfy the lower-bound condition, which can speed up the calculation of similarity search and indexing in the multivariate time series datasets.

In a typical three-dimensional simulation of the reactor operation simulator gives the core performance for a fuel lattice configuration measured by thermal limits, shutdown margin and produced energy. Based on these results we can determine the number of fulfilled parameters of a fuel lattice configuration. It is interesting to establish a relationship between the fuel lattice properties and the number of fulfilled core parameters in steady state reactor operation. So, with this purpose data mining techniques were used. Results indicate that these techniques are able to predict with enough accuracy (greater than 75%) if a given fuel lattice configuration will have a either "good" or "bad" performance according to reactor core simulation. In this way, they could be coupled with an optimization process to discard fuel lattice configurations with poor performance and, in this way accelerates the optimization process. Data mining techniques apply some filter methods to discard those variables with lower influence in the number of core fulfilled parameter. From this situation, it was also possible to identify a set of variables to be used in new optimization codes with different objective functions than those normally used. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model was built using novel methods to manage the variable selection problem posed by the very large number of predictor variables generated by Window Pane, namely the elastic-net, and a systematic cross-validation to determine the most frequently retained variables. The model predicts the final severity of brown rust with an RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) of 22.4%. The model's ability to predict treatment decisions was tested and exhibited a good performance as shown by an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.85. We also evaluated the suitability of our model for use in France by confronting the range of the climate variables in our dataset against the climatological range of these same variables in France. The final model also gives important insights into the key factors behind variations in brown rust disease pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mesa and macrotidal estuaries are governed by tidal action and could be influenced by river. The complexity of their behavior, suggest data mining methods may be particularly effective in selecting short-term series from a long-term series to identify the major modes of forcing variability. This study uses K-means clustering for two aims: explaining the variability of astronomical tides and river flows, and selecting scenarios of real forcings to obtain the mean behavior with a dimensional reduction. The application to the Suances estuary has highlighted the ability to classify long-term series in small number of groups. Before conducting any simulation, the proposal also determines the minimum and optimal number of groups to consider the combined effect of both forcings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One concern within the petrophysics community is that rock permeability value predicted by well logging should not be considered as absolute, mainly for carbonates, but a relative index for identifying more permeable zones. Therefore, in this paper a permeability classification methodology, based exclusively on H-1 NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation data, was evaluated for the first time as an alternative to the prediction of permeability as a continuous variable. To pursue this, a side-by-side comparison of different data mining techniques for the permeability classification task was performed using a petrophysical dataset with 78 rock samples from six different carbonate reservoirs. The effectiveness of six classification algorithms (k-NN, Naive Bayes, C4.5, SMO, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron) was evaluated to predict the rock permeability class according to the following ranges: low (<1 mD), fair (1-10 mD), good (10-100 mD) and excellent (>100 mD). Discretization and feature selection strategies were also employed as preprocessing steps in order to improve the classification accuracy. For the studied dataset, the results demonstrated that the Random Forest and SMO strategies delivered the best classification performance among the selected classifiers. The computational experiments also evidenced that our approach led to more accurate predictions when compared with two methods widely adopted by the petroleum industry (Kenyon and Timur-Coates models).

The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach.

J	Nguyen, LTT; Nguyen, NT				Nguyen, Loan T. T.; Ngoc Thanh Nguyen			An improved algorithm for mining class association rules using the difference of Obidsets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Class association rules; Data mining; Difference of Obidsets; Tree structure	INDUCTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHM; LATTICE-BASED APPROACH; CLASSIFICATION RULES; CLOSED ITEMSETS; CONSTRAINTS; KNOWLEDGE; ACCURACY; TREES; MINER	Class association rules play an important role in decision support systems and have thus been extensively studied. Recently, an efficient algorithm for mining class association rules, named CAR-Miner, has been proposed. It, however, consumes a lot of memory for storing the Obidsets (sets of object identifiers that contain itemsets) of itemsets and requires a lot of time to compute the intersection between two Obidsets, especially in the large datasets. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for mining class association rules that uses the difference between two Obidsets (d2O) to save memory usage and run time. Firstly, the d2O concept is developed. A strategy for reducing the storage space and computation time of d2O is then derived. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than CAR-Miner in terms of run time and memory usage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Nguyen, Loan T.

This paper presents a rule-based approach to emotion cause component detection for Chinese micro-blogs. Our research has important scientific values on social network knowledge discovery and data mining. It also has a great potential in analyzing the psychological processes of consumers. Firstly, this paper proposes a rule-based system underlying the conditions that trigger emotions based on an emotional model. Secondly, this paper extracts the corresponding cause events in fine-grained emotions from the results of events, actions of agents and aspects of objects. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to get the proportions of different cause components under different emotions by constructing the emotional lexicon and identifying different linguistic features, and the proposed approach is based on Bayesian probability. Finally, this paper presents the experiments on an emotion corpus of Chinese micro-blogs. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the approach. The existing problems and the further works are also present at the end. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Efficient data mining for local binary pattern in texture image analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Local binary pattern; Frequent pattern mining; Texture image; Feature selection; Classification	MULTIRESOLUTION GRAY-SCALE; FACE RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; IDENTIFICATION; DESCRIPTORS; RETRIEVAL; WAVELET; LBP	Local binary pattern (LBP) is a simple gray scale descriptor to characterize the local distribution of the gray levels in an image. Multi-resolution LBP and/or combinations of the LBPs have shown to be effective in texture image analysis. However, it is unclear what resolutions or combinations to choose for texture analysis. Examining all the possible cases is impractical and intractable due to the exponential growth in a feature space. This limits the accuracy and time- and space-efficiency of LBP. Here, we propose a data mining approach for LBP, which efficiently explores a high-dimensional feature space and finds a relatively smaller number of discriminative features. The features can be any combinations of LBPs. These may not be achievable with conventional approaches. Hence, our approach not only fully utilizes the capability of LBP but also maintains the low computational complexity. We incorporated three different descriptors (LBP, local contrast measure, and local directional derivative measure) with three spatial resolutions and evaluated our approach using two comprehensive texture databases. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach to different experimental designs and texture images. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This functionality is very useful in many applications that require the linkability but still need the anonymity, such as sybil attack detection in a vehicular ad hoc network and privacy-preserving data mining. In this paper, we present a new group signature scheme supporting the controllable linkability. The major advantage of this scheme is that the signature length is very short, even shorter than this in the best-known group signature scheme without supporting the linkability. We have implemented our scheme in both a Linux machine with an Intel Core2 Quad and an iPhone4. We compare the results with a number of existing group signature schemes. We also prove security features of our scheme, such as anonymity, traceability, nonframeability, and linkability, under a random oracle model.

Mines are hazardous places and workers can suffer a wide variety of injuries. Utilizing a database composed of almost 70,000 occupational accidents and fatality reports corresponding to the decade 2003-2012 in the Spanish mining sector, the paper analyzes the main causes of those accidents. To carry out the study, powerful statistical tools have been applied, such as Bayesian classifiers, decision trees or contingency tables, among other data mining techniques. Statistical analyses have been performed using Weka software and behavioral patterns based on certain rules have been obtained. From these rules, some conclusions are extracted which can help to develop suitable prevention policies to reduce injuries and fatalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abnormal transactions in the marketing transactional database are those transactions that should contain some items but do not. However, some abnormal transactions may provide valuable information in the knowledge mining process. The literature on how to efficiently identify abnormal transactions in the database as well as determine what causes the transactions to be abnormal is scarce. This paper proposes a framework to realize abnormal transactions as well as the items that induce the abnormal transactions. Results from one synthetic and two medical data sets are presented to compare with previous work to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

J	Ding, F; Zhuang, Y				Ding, Fei; Zhuang, Yi			Computing contingency tables from sparse ADtrees	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; Contingency tables; Sparse ADtrees; Non-recursive algorithms; Bayesian networks learning		In data-mining algorithms contingency tables are frequently built from ADtrees, as ADtrees have been demonstrated to be an efficient data structure for caching sufficient statistics. This paper introduces three modifications. The first two use a one-dimensional array and a hash map for representing contingency tables, and the third uses the non-recursive approach to build contingency tables from sparse ADtrees. We implement algorithms to construct contingency tables with a two-dimensional array, a tree, a one-dimensional array, and a hash map using recursion and non-recursive approaches in Python. We empirically test these algorithms in five aspects with a large number of randomly generated datasets. We also apply the modified algorithms to Bayesian networks learning and test the performance improvements using three real-life datasets. We demonstrate experimentally that all three of these modifications improve algorithm performance. The improvements are more significant with higher arities and larger arity values.

These trajectories reveal users' driving behaviors for planning routes. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-aware route discovery framework that considers users' preferred routes. The proposed framework is comprised of two components: pattern-aware road map generation and route planning. In the first component, we mine significant road segments from historical trajectories, and generate a pattern-aware road map. We design a route score function that strikes a balance between user preference degrees and the length of the route. For the second component, given a source, a destination, and a user pre-defined value k, we intend to derive the top-k routes that consist of road segments from the source to the destination in the pattern-aware road map. To support on-line route planning in most navigation services, we propose a constrained breadth-first-search (CBFS) algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our framework using real trajectory data, and compare our framework with an existing approach in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.

However, many real-world applications involve samples that are not described as feature vectors, but as (dis) similarity data. Converting vectorial data into (dis) similarity data is more easily performed than converting (dis) similarity data into vectorial data. This study proposes a stochastic iterative distance transformation model for similarity-based learning. The proposed model can be used to identify a clear class boundary in data by modifying the (dis) similarities between examples. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with those of various vector-based and proximity-based learning algorithms.

The problem has important societal applications such as land cover classification for natural resource management. However, the problem is challenging due to the fact that learning samples show spatial autocorrelation in class labels, instead of being independently identically distributed. Related work relies on local tests (i.e., testing feature information of a location) and cannot adequately model the spatial autocorrelation effect, resulting in salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, we recently proposed a focal-test-based spatial decision tree (FTSDT), in which the tree traversal direction of a sample is based on both local and focal (neighborhood) information. Preliminary results showed that FTSDT reduces classification errors and salt-and-pepper noise. This paper extends our recent work by introducing a new focal test approach with adaptive neighborhoods that avoids over-smoothing in wedge-shaped areas. We also conduct computational refinement on the FTSDT training algorithm by reusing focal values across candidate thresholds. Theoretical analysis shows that the refined training algorithm is correct and more scalable. Experiment results on real world data sets show that new FTSDT with adaptive neighborhoods improves classification accuracy, and that our computational refinement significantly reduces training time.

Top-k Similarity Join in Heterogeneous Information Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Heterogeneous network; graph; similarity join	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; ALGORITHMS	As a newly emerging network model, heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have received growing attention. Many data mining tasks have been explored in HINs, including clustering, classification, and similarity search. Similarity join is a fundamental operation required for many problems. It is attracting attention from various applications on network data, such as friend recommendation, link prediction, and online advertising. Although similarity join has been well studied in homogeneous networks, it has not yet been studied in heterogeneous networks. Especially, none of the existing research on similarity join takes different semantic meanings behind paths into consideration and almost all completely ignore the heterogeneity and diversity of the HINs. In this paper, we propose a path-based similarity join (PS-join) method to return the top k similar pairs of objects based on any user specified join path in a heterogeneous information network. We study how to prune expensive similarity computation by introducing bucket pruning based locality sensitive hashing (BPLSH) indexing. Compared with existing Link-based Similarity join (LS-join) method, PS-join can derive various similarity semantics. Experimental results on real data sets show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Collaborative Data Processing in WSN Using Voronoi Fuzzy Clustering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						Clustering; Data aggregation; Compression; Voronoi fuzzy clustering algorithm; Energy; QOS; Throughput; Delivery ratio		In this paper, developed a novel Voronoi Fuzzy Clustering (VF) algorithm for energy efficient collaborative data aggregation in wireless sensor network. VF algorithm is fusion of Voronoi diagram and modified Fuzzy C- Means with respect to distance and Quality of Service. Here throughput, delay time and delivery ratio are considered as QOS parameters. Once clustering of sensor nodes is completed then data management technique such as data aggregation or compression is done for further decision making in sink node. Data mining clustering algorithm reduces overall transmission of data from each sensor to the sink node thus energy spent by individual sensor node is minimized. The cluster heads collects all sensed information from their respective cluster members and performs data aggregation or compression before transmitting the data to the sink node. Finally, the simulations are performed and the results are analyzed within the simulation set up to determine performance of the proposed algorithm in the sensor network. Our proposed approach has achieved 60% efficiency when compare with the K means algorithm.	[Kalyani, S.

J	Wu, CH; Wang, JY				Wu, Chih-Hung; Wang, Jing-Yi			Associative classification with a new condenseness measure	JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS			English	Article						classification; associative classification; association rules; interestingness; condenseness; data mining	MINING FREQUENT PATTERNS; RULES; ALGORITHM; PERFORMANCE	Associative classification (AC) is a branch of data mining that utilizes association rules (ARs) for classification. ARs are extracted from databases that satisfy some statistical criteria such as minimal support. However, in some practical applications, useful ARs may be found among infrequent, but closely related, itemsets that are filtered out by high minimal support. In this study, a new measure, named condenseness, is presented for evaluating whether infrequent ruleitems that are filtered out by minimal support can form strong ARs for classification. For an infrequent ruleitem, the condenseness is the average of lift of all ARs that can be generated from the ruleitem. A ruleitem with a high condenseness means that its elements are closely related and can serve for AC even if it does not have high support. Based on the concept of condenseness, a new associative classifier is developed and presented - condensed association rules for classification (CARC). CARC generates ARs using a modified Apriori algorithm and develops new strategies of rule inference. With the condenseness measure and strategies for rule inference, more useful ARs can be produced and improve the effectiveness of association classification. Empirical evidences show that CARC mitigates the problems caused by setting too high/low minimal support and has a better performance on classification.

An Approach to Identify Site Response Directivity of Accelerometer Sites and Application to the Iranian Area	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Site response; Directional resonance; Arias intensity; HVSR; Iran	STRONG GROUND MOTIONS; SEISMIC RESPONSE; FAULT ZONE; EARTHQUAKE; CALIFORNIA; LANDSLIDE; TARZANA; SLOPES; ARRAY; AMPLIFICATION	In recent years, several workers have found numerous cases of sites characterised by significant azimuthal variation of dynamic response to seismic shaking. The causes of this phenomenon are still unclear, but are possibly related to combinations of geological and geomorphological factors determining a polarisation of resonance effects. To improve their comprehension, it would be desirable to extend the database of observations on this phenomenon. Thus, considering that unrevealed cases of site response directivity can be "hidden" among the sites of accelerometer networks, we developed a two-stage approach of data mining from existing strong motion databases to identify sites affected by directional amplification. The proposed procedure first calculates Arias Intensity tensor components from accelerometer recordings of each site to determine mean directional variations of total shaking energy. Then, at the sites where a significant anisotropy appears in ground motion, azimuthal variations of HVSR values (spectral ratios between horizontal and vertical components of recordings) are analysed to confirm the occurrence of site resonance conditions. We applied this technique to a database of recordings acquired by accelerometer stations in the Iranian area. The results of this investigation pointed out some sites affected by directional resonance that appear to be correlated to the orientation of local tectonic lineaments, these being mostly transversal to the direction of maximum shaking. Comparing Arias Intensities observed at these sites with theoretical estimates provided by ground motion prediction equations, the presence of significant site amplifications was confirmed. The magnitude of the amplification factors appear to be correlated to the results of HVSR analysis, even though the pattern of dispersion of HVSR values suggests that while high peak values of spectral ratios are indicative of strong amplifications, lower values do not necessarily imply lower amplification factors.

This set of genes includes already identified markers such as the ARE family and others not yet associated with the sensitization process (the so-called SENS-IS gene subset). The expression of this set of genes has been measured on reconstituted human epidermis models (Episkin) exposed to various sensitizers and non-sensitizers. Fine analysis of their expression pattern indicates that it is the number of modulated genes rather than the intensity of up-regulation that correlates best with the sensitization potential of a chemical. Moreover, sensitizers that are weak inductors of ARE genes tend to be relevant modulators of the SENS-IS subset. By combining the expression data obtained with both gene subsets, it is now possible to identify a wide variety of sensitizers on a test system (in vitro reconstructed human epidermis) that is very similar to the in vivo situation and compatible with a large variety of test substance characteristics.

In this article, we propose a method to estimate queue profiles that are traffic shockwave polygons in the time-space plane describing the spatiotemporal formation and dissipation of queues. The method integrates the collective effect of dispersed probe vehicle data with traffic flow shockwave analysis and data mining techniques. The proposed queue profile estimation method requires position and velocity data of probe vehicles; however, any explicit information of signal settings and arrival distribution is indispensable. Moreover, the method captures interdependencies in queue evolutions of successive intersections. The significance of the proposed method is that it is applicable in oversaturated conditions and includes queue spillover identification. Numerical results of simulation experiments and tests on NGSIM field data, with various penetration rates and sampling intervals, reveal the promising and robust performance of the proposed method compared with a uniform arrival queue estimation procedure. The method provides a thorough understanding of urban traffic flow dynamics and has direct applications for delay analysis, queue length estimation, signal settings estimation, and vehicle trajectory reconstruction.

In this framework, gradual patterns have been recently proposed to extract covariations of attributes, such as: "When X increases, Y decreases". There exist some algorithms for mining frequent gradual patterns, but they cannot scale to real-world databases. We present in this paper GLCM, the first algorithm for mining closed frequent gradual patterns, which proposes strong complexity guarantees: the mining time is linear with the number of closed frequent gradual itemsets. Our experimental study shows that GLCM is two orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, with a constant low memory usage. We also present PGLCM, a parallelization of GLCM capable of exploiting multicore processors, with good scale-up properties on complex datasets. These algorithms are the first algorithms capable of mining large real world datasets to discover gradual patterns.

The EMR data are largely temporal, often noisy, irregular and high dimensional. This paper constructs a novel ordinal regression framework for predicting medical risk stratification from EMR. First, a conceptual view of EMR as a temporal image is constructed to extract a diverse set of features. Second, ordinal modeling is applied for predicting cumulative or progressive risk. The challenges are building a transparent predictive model that works with a large number of weakly predictive features, and at the same time, is stable against resampling variations. Our solution employs sparsity methods that are stabilized through domain-specific feature interaction networks. We introduces two indices that measure the model stability against data resampling. Feature networks are used to generate two multivariate Gaussian priors with sparse precision matrices (the Laplacian and Random Walk). We apply the framework on a large short-term suicide risk prediction problem and demonstrate that our methods outperform clinicians to a large margin, discover suicide risk factors that conform with mental health knowledge, and produce models with enhanced stability.

With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores a parts per thousand yen0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values a parts per thousand currency sign0.05, R-2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values a parts per thousand currency sign0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.

Decision-tree analysis of control strategies	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Review						Math modeling and model evaluation; Computational modeling; Perception and action; Perceptual attunement	VISUAL CONTROL; BRAKING; INFORMATION; COLLISION; LOCOMOTION	A major focus of research on visually guided action is the identification of control strategies that map optical information to actions. The traditional approach has been to test the behavioral predictions of a few hypothesized strategies against subject behavior in environments in which various manipulations of available information have been made. While important and compelling results have been achieved with these methods, they are potentially limited by small sets of hypotheses and the methods used to test them. In this study, we introduce a novel application of data-mining techniques in an analysis of experimental data that is able to both describe and model human behavior. This method permits the rapid testing of a wide range of possible control strategies using arbitrarily complex combinations of optical variables. Through the use of decision-tree techniques, subject data can be transformed into an easily interpretable, algorithmic form. This output can then be immediately incorporated into a working model of subject behavior. We tested the effectiveness of this method in identifying the optical information used by human subjects in a collision-avoidance task. Our results comport with published research on collision-avoidance control strategies while also providing additional insight not possible with traditional methods. Further, the modeling component of our method produces behavior that closely resembles that of the subjects upon whose data the models were based. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that data-mining techniques provide powerful new tools for analyzing human data and building models that can be applied to a wide range of perception-action tasks, even outside the visual-control setting we describe.

This operation is common in many real-life applications such as GIS, data mining, and recommender systems. Although it has received much attention in the Euclidean space, there is little prior work on the metric space. In this paper, we study the problem of kCP query processing in general metric spaces, namely Metric kCP search, and propose several efficient algorithms using dynamic disk-based metric indexes (e.g., M-tree), which can be applied to arbitrary type of data as long as a certain metric distance is defined and satisfies the triangle inequality. Our approaches follow depth-first and/or best-first traversal paradigm(s), employ effective pruning rules based on metric space properties and the counting information preserved in the metric index, take advantage of aggressive pruning and compensation to further boost query efficiency, and derive a node-based cost model for retrieval.

It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering.	[Esmin, Ahmed A.

J	Chen, YL; Li, FY; Fan, JQ				Chen, Yunliang; Li, Fangyuan; Fan, Junqing			Mining association rules in big data with NGEP	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Big data; Association rules; Gene expression programming; Niche	A-PRIORI ALGORITHM; SIMULATION; KNOWLEDGE	Analyses and applications of big data require special technologies to efficiently process large number of data. Mining association rules focus on obtaining relations between data. When mining association rules in big data, conventional methods encounter severe problems incurred by the tremendous cost of computing and inefficiency to achieve the goal. This study proposes an evolutionary algorithm to address these problems, namely Niche-Aided Gene Expression Programming (NGEP). The NGEP algorithm (1) divides individuals to several niches to evolve separately and fuses selected niches according to the similarities of the best individuals to ensure the dispersibility of chromosomes, and (2) adjusts the fitness function to adapt to the needs of the underlying applications. A number of experiments have been performed to compare NGEP with the FP-Growth and Apriori algorithms to evaluate the NGEP's performance in mining association rules with a dataset of measurement for environment pressure (Iris dataset) and an Artificial Simulation Database (ASD). Experimental results indicate that NGEP can efficiently achieve more association rules (36 vs. 33 vs. 25 in Iris dataset experiments and 57 vs. 44 vs. 44 in ASD experiments) with a higher accuracy rate (74.8 vs. 53.2 vs. 50.6% in Iris dataset experiments and 95.8 vs. 77.4 vs. 80.3% in ASD experiments) and the time of computing is also much less than the other two methods.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most well-known approach. However, existing approaches generally suffer from various weaknesses. For example, sparsity can significantly degrade the performance of traditional CF. If a user only visits very few locations, accurate similar user identification becomes very challenging due to lack of sufficient information for effective inference. Moreover, existing recommendation approaches often ignore rich user information like textual descriptions of photos which can reflect users' travel preferences. The topic model (TM) method is an effective way to solve the "sparsity problem," but is still far from satisfactory. In this paper, an author topic model-based collaborative filtering (ATCF) method is proposed to facilitate comprehensive points of interest (POIs) recommendations for social users. In our approach, user preference topics, such as cultural, cityscape, or landmark, are extracted from the geo-tag constrained textual description of photos via the author topic model instead of only from the geo-tags (GPS locations). Advantages and superior performance of our approach are demonstrated by extensive experiments on a large collection of data.

Mining the change of customer behavior in dynamic markets	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data mining; Change mining; Sequential patterns; Quantitative data; Fuzzy sets	QUANTITATIVE SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; DISCOVERED ASSOCIATION RULES; LARGE DATABASES; KNOWLEDGE; INTERESTINGNESS; UNEXPECTEDNESS	Identification of changes in customer behavior is a major challenge that must be tackled in order to survive in a rapidly changing business environment. For example, because information technology has advanced and data-storage costs have declined, for the purpose of serving customers, numerous enterprises have employed information systems and have directly logged customer behavior in databases. This trend has motivated the development of data mining applications. Fuzzy quantitative sequential pattern mining is a functional data mining technique that is used for discovering customer behavioral patterns over time and determining the quantities of goods or services they purchase. The example term used in shopping aOE (c)[(Beer, Low)(Milk, High)] (Cola, Middle)> means that customers will first buy Beer and Milk in Low and High quantities, respectively, and then purchase Cola in Middle quantities on their next shopping trip, where Low, Middle, and High are predefined linguistic terms assigned by managers. A term such as this one provides managers with general and concise knowledge related to customer behavior and allows them to rapidly make decisions in response, especially in a competitive setting. However, literature searches indicate that no previous study has addressed the issue of changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. The aforementioned example pattern might have been available last year but might not be used this year, and it could have been substituted by aOE (c)(Beer, Middle) {(Cola, Low)(Milk, Low)}>. If this knowledge is not renewed, managers might develop inappropriate marketing plans for their products or services and use inventory strategies that are outdated with respect to time and quantities. To solve this problem, we propose a novel change-mining model that can be used for detecting changes in fuzzy quantitative sequential patterns. We conducted experiments in which we used real-world and synthetic datasets in order to evaluate the proposed model. When the pattern change was detected using the real-world dataset, the results showed that the model reveals 3 considerations that can help managers with their handling of products' marketing and production. When we studied the model's scalability by using the synthetic dataset, the results showed that even though all run times increased when parameter values were decreased, the model remained scalable.

Cost-sensitive feature selection over the past 10 years has seen increasingly rapid advances. Recently, a fast randomized algorithm was designed for this problem. Unfortunately, the performance of algorithms is heavily dependent on the size of datasets. In this paper, we propose an optimal randomized algorithm which adopts the restart strategy in the fast randomized algorithm for minimal test cost feature selection. The restart strategy can effectively address this limitation which depends on the size of datasets. There are two major stages in our algorithm: the addition stage and the deletion stage. In the addition stage, we obtain a subset to represent the original attributes. In this stage, the randomized mechanism helps us to select a subset rapidly. In the deletion stage, we remove redundant attributes by using the restart strategy to further improve the efficiency. Compared with the fast randomized algorithm, the effective of our algorithm increases sharply in the same runtime. Meanwhile, our algorithm reduces about a quarter of the runtime under the same number of experiments.

One of the key concerns in the industry is the management of workers' safety behavior. This paper aims to explore the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of not anchoring a safety harness when working at height. In addition, multiple stepwise linear regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree techniques were applied in the study to assess their usefulness in evaluating survey data of safety cognitive factors. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was adopted to model the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of scaffolders. The TPB postulates that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms affect the intention of workers, which ultimately affects intentional behavior. The unsafe act of not anchoring harnesses while working on a scaffold was selected as the focal behavior based on observations and interviews with safety supervisors. Supervisors also provided their opinions on the underlying reasons for the unsafe act. A questionnaire was then developed based on the site observations, interviews, and literature review. Subsequently, 40 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, and China were surveyed. Stepwise multiple linear regression, neural network, and decision tree analyses were implemented. The analyses revealed that subjective norm was the key variable influencing a worker's decision to anchor the safety harness. The significance of subjective norm was probably affected by the national culture of the migrant workers. In addition, the analyses showed that the relationships between the variables were probably nonlinear, thus neural network and decision tree are suitable techniques. The exploratory study provides the basis for design of an in-depth study on the cognitive factors influencing safety behavior and it expands the choice of analyses techniques.

As an important branch of spatial data mining, spatial outlier mining can be used to find out some interesting and unexpected spatial patterns in many applications. In this paper, a new parallel & distributed spatial outlier mining algorithm (PD-SOM) is proposed to simultaneously detect global and local outliers in a grid environment. PD-SOM is a Delaunay triangulation (D-TIN) based approach, which was encapsulated and deployed in a distributed platform to provide parallel and distributed spatial outlier mining service. Subsequently, a distributed system framework for PD-SOM is designed on top of a geographical knowledge service grid (GeoKSGrid) developed by our research group, a two-step strategy for spatial outlier detection is put forward to support the encapsulation and distributed deployment of the geographical knowledge service, and two key techniques of the geographical knowledge service: parallel and distributed computing of Delaunay triangulation and the implementation of PD-SOM algorithm are discussed. Finally, the efficiency of the spatial outlier mining service is analyzed in theory, the practicality is confirmed by a demonstrative application on the abnormality analyzing of soil geochemical investigation samples from Fujian eastern coastal zone area in China, and the effectiveness and superiority of PD-SOM in a balanced, scalable grid environment are verified through the comparison with the popular spatial outlier mining algorithm SLOM, for the involvement of large amount of computing cores.

An effective multiobjective approach for hard partitional clustering	MEMETIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Data clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary and swarm intelligence; Mutiobjective particle swarm optimization	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; OPTIMIZATION	Clustering is an unsupervised classification method in the field of data mining. Many population based evolutionary and swarm intelligence optimization methods are proposed to optimize clustering solutions globally based on a single selected objective function which lead to produce a single best solution. In this sense, optimized solution is biased towards a single objective, hence it is not equally well to the data set having clusters of different geometrical properties. Thus, clustering having multiple objectives should be naturally optimized through multiobjective optimization methods for capturing different properties of the data set. To achieve this clustering goal, many multiobjective population based optimization methods, e.g., multiobjective genetic algorithm, mutiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), are proposed to obtain diverse tradeoff solutions in the pareto-front. As single directional diversity mechanism in particle swarm optimization converges prematurely to local optima, this paper presents a two-stage diversity mechanism in MOPSO to improve its exploratory capabilities by incorporating crossover operator of the genetic algorithm. External archive is used to store non-dominated solutions, which is further utilized to find one best solution having highest F-measure value at the end of the run. Two conceptually orthogonal internal measures SSE and connectedness are used to estimate the clustering quality. Results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method over its competitors MOPSO, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, and multiobjective artificial bee colony on seven real data sets from UCI machine learning repository.

They boast a robustness that has spearheaded their application in many practical classification problems, especially when there is a significant diversity among the ensemble members. Actually, they replace traditional machine learning techniques in many applications and special attention has been devoted to them as a mean to improve the prediction accuracy for problems of high complexity. Several combination rules have been investigated in this context. However, it is claimed that no rule is always better than others for designing an optimal decision. The present study evaluates the performance of two different ensemble methods for protein secondary structure prediction. We focus on weighted opinions pooling and the most common aggregation rules for decisions inference. The ensemble members are accurate protein secondary structure single model predictors namely, Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. Experiments are carried out using cross-validation tests on RS126 and CB513 benchmark datasets. Our results clearly confirm that ensembles are more accurate than a single model and the experimental comparison of the investigated ensemble schemes demonstrates that the newly introduced rule called Exponential Opinion Pool competes well against state-of-the-art fixed rules, especially the sum rule which in some cases is able to achieve better performance.

Agents present within the general population remain common in recurrent infections among renal transplant recipients. Data mining methodology has become a promising source of information about patterns in the organ transplant recipient population. The aim of the study was to use data mining to describe the factors influencing single and recurrent infections in kidney transplant recipients. A group of 159 recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between 2005 and 2008 was analysed. RapidMiner and Statistica softwares were used to create decision tree models based on CART Quinlan and C&RT algorithms. There were 171 microbiologically confirmed episodes among 67 recipients (41%), and 191 separate species isolations were performed. Over 50% of the infected patients underwent two or more infectious episodes. Two classification decision tree models were created. The following features were enabled to differentiate the groups with single or recurrent infections: the duration of cold ischaemia, the post-transplant hospitalization period, the cause of chronic kidney disease and pathogens. The post-transplant hospitalization period and the length of cold ischaemia appear to be the principal parameters differentiating the subpopulations analysed. These coexisting factors, connected with recurrent infections in kidney transplant recipients, resemble a network which requires an advanced analysis to support the traditional statistics.

How can we best support this process? In the field of software engineering, transfer learning has been shown to be effective for defect prediction. This paper checks whether it is possible to build transfer learners for software effort estimation. We use data on 154 projects from 2 sources to investigate transfer learning between different time intervals and 195 projects from 51 sources to provide evidence on the value of transfer learning for traditional cross-company learning problems. We find that the same transfer learning method can be useful for transfer effort estimation results for the cross-company learning problem and the cross-time learning problem. It is misguided to think that: (1) Old data of an organization is irrelevant to current context or (2) data of another organization cannot be used for local solutions. Transfer learning is a promising research direction that transfers relevant cross data between time intervals and domains.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of DNAJC12 expression in patients with rectal cancers receiving neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery. Through data mining from a public transcriptomic dataset of rectal cancer focusing on genes associated with protein folding, we found that DNAJC12, a member of the HSP40/DNAJ family, was the most significant such gene correlated with the CCRT response. We further evaluated the expression of DNAJC12 by immunohistochemistly in the pre-treatment tumor specimens from 172 patients with rectal cancers. From this set, we statistically analyzed the association of DNAJC12 expression with various clinicopathological factors, tumor regression grade, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). High expression of DNAJC12 was significantly associated with advanced pre- and post-treatment tumor status (P < 0.001), advanced pre- and post-treatment nodal status (P < 0.001), increased vascular invasion (P = 0.015), increased perineural invasion (P = 0.023) and lower tumor regression grade (P = 0.009). More importantly, high expression of DNAJC12 was found to be correlated with poor prognosis for OS (P = 0.0012), DFS (P < 0.0001) and LRFS (P = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, DNAJC12 overexpression still emerged as an independent prognosticator for shorter OS (P = 0.040), DFS (P < 0.001) and LRFS (P = 0.016). The data indicate that DNAJC12 overexpression acts as a negative predictive factor for the response to neoadjuvant CCRT and was significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with rectal cancers receiving neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery.

How to cluster high-dimensional data is still a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we try to address this problem using joint dimensionality reduction and clustering. Different from traditional approaches that conduct dimensionality reduction and clustering in sequence, we propose a novel framework referred to as discriminative embedded clustering which alternates them iteratively. Within this framework, we are able not only to view several traditional approaches and reveal their intrinsic relationships, but also to be stimulated to develop a new method. We also propose an effective approach for solving the formulated nonconvex optimization problem. Comprehensive analyses, including convergence behavior, parameter determination, and computational complexity, together with the relationship to other related approaches, are also presented. Plenty of experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms related state-of-the-art clustering approaches and existing joint dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.

J	Reiner, B				Reiner, Bruce			Strategies for Medical Data Extraction and Presentation Part 2: Creating a Customizable Context and User-Specific Patient Reference Database	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Data mining; Decision support; Imaging informatics	PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY; FILMLESS RADIOLOGY	One of the greatest challenges facing healthcare professionals is the ability to directly and efficiently access relevant data from the patient's healthcare record at the point of care; specific to both the context of the task being performed and the specific needs and preferences of the individual end-user. In radiology practice, the relative inefficiency of imaging data organization and manual workflow requirements serves as an impediment to historical imaging data review. At the same time, clinical data retrieval is even more problematic due to the quality and quantity of data recorded at the time of order entry, along with the relative lack of information system integration. One approach to address these data deficiencies is to create a multi-disciplinary patient referenceable database which consists of high-priority, actionable data within the cumulative patient healthcare record; in which predefined criteria are used to categorize and classify imaging and clinical data in accordance with anatomy, technology, pathology, and time. The population of this referenceable database can be performed through a combination of manual and automated methods, with an additional step of data verification introduced for data quality control. Once created, these referenceable databases can be filtered at the point of care to provide context and user-specific data specific to the task being performed and individual end-user requirements.

Symbolic data analysis (SDA) aims at the treatment of such kinds of data, allowing the description and the analysis of conceptual data or of macrodata summarizing classical data. In the conceptual framework of SDA, the paper aims at presenting new basic statistics for distribution-valued variables, i.e., variables whose realizations are distributions. The proposed measures extend some classical univariate (mean, variance, standard deviation) and bivariate (covariance and correlation) basic statistics to distribution-valued variables, taking into account the nature and the variability of such data. The novel statistics are based on a distance between distributions: the Wasserstein distance. A comparison with other univariate and bivariate statistics presented in the literature points out some relevant properties of the proposed ones. An application on a clinic dataset shows the main differences in terms of interpretation of results.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Ebola outbreak; Social media; Data mining	PUBLIC-HEALTH SURVEILLANCE; VIRUS DISEASE OUTBREAK; WEST-AFRICA; TWITTER	Background: Twitter can address the challenges of the current Ebola outbreak surveillance. The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread, capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and attitudes. Methods: We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes. Results: A total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion. Conclusion: Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education. Copyright (C) 2015 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

Intelligent engineering asset management system for power transformer maintenance decision supports under various operating conditions	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Engineering asset management; Artificial neural network; Principal component analysis; Intelligent fault prediction; Gases in oil; Maintenance decision support	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DISSOLVED-GAS ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; HEALTH INDEX; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Large sized transformers are an important part of global power systems and industrial infrastructures. An unexpected failure of a power transformer can cause severe production damage and significant loss throughput the power grid. In order to prevent power facilities from malfunctions and breakdowns, the development of real-time monitoring and fault prediction tools are of great interests to both researches and practitioners. This research develops an intelligent engineering asset nianagement system for power transformer maintenance. The system performs real-time monitoring of key parameters and uses data mining and fault prediction models to detect transformers' potential failure under various operating conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) are the algorithms adopted for the prediction model. Historical industrial power transformer data from Taiwan and Australia are used to train and test the failure prediction models and to verify the proposed general methodology as comparative case studies. The PCA algorithm reduces the number of the primary dissolved gasses as the key factor values for BP-ANN prediction modeling inputs. The system yields effective predictions when verified using various operating condition data from Australia and Taiwan power companies. The accuracy rates are much higher when compared to the fault prediction results without using PCA. The intelligent system combining PCA and BP-ANN algorithms, developed in this research, can be adopted by asset managers in different regions to develop suitable maintenance and repair strategies for transformer failure preventions., (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nurses make diagnoses according to professional knowledge, clinical experience, and even instinct. Without comprehensive knowledge and thinking, diagnostic accuracy can be compromised and decisions may be delayed. We used a back-propagation neural network and other tools for data mining and statistical analysis. We further compared the prediction accuracy of the previous methods with an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system and the back-propagation neural network, identifying differences in the questions and in nurse satisfaction levels before and after using the nursing information system. This study investigated the use of artificial intelligence to generate nursing diagnoses. The percentage of agreement between diagnoses suggested by the information system and those made by nurses was as much as 87 percent. When patients are hospitalized, we can calculate the probability of various nursing diagnoses based on certain characteristics.

The purpose of this online monitoring system is to accurately assess its condition while under operation, and to foresee any risk of failure. Consequently, it would be possible to plan for the required maintenance on the CB sufficiently ahead of a failure occurrence. To fulfill this, a framework is proposed to precisely assess the SF CBs' condition using its control circuit signals' waveforms as easy-to-access, easy-to-measure, and noninvasive diagnosis parameters. The features found in these waveforms match the characteristics essential for diagnostic purposes, and could cover 50%-60% of CB failures. A data-mining process is employed to cluster the captured data against past-recorded data (in terms of faulty or healthy condition) of circuit breakers (CBs) diagnosis. To determine the probability distribution function of a CB condition cluster, a classifier is developed. In this model, the CB condition (based on its failure risk) is qualitatively classified into normal, alarm, and emergency states. In addition, to avoid any unnecessary maintenance activities during an alarm state, the condition of CBs in each state is quantified in terms of some probabilistic-based indices. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methodology are verified using recorded data.

A Novel Method Based on Fuzzy Logic and Data Mining for Synchronous Generator Digital Protection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						Data mining; fuzzy logic; protection; synchronous generator	WINDING PROTECTION; SCHEME; PLATFORM	A new internal fault protection scheme for synchronous generators, based on the fuzzy inference system, is proposed. The proposed method is developed and tested by using an oscillogram dataset gathered from fault simulations and experiments conducted on real-life synchronous generators. Data mining is used to support the choice of the most relevant variables to identify synchronous generator internal faults. The selected variables are used as inputs to a fuzzy-logic system designed to identify and detect faults. A part of the oscillogram dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protection. The results show that the proposed protection scheme is more sensitive in detecting ground faults in synchronous generators with high-impedance grounding compared to conventional devices. It is also shown that the proposed scheme is able to identify interturns and interpath faults. The proposed method was embedded in a PC104 processor and tested in a real-time environment to show its practical feasibility.

Demystifying Iddq Data With Process Variation for Automatic Chip Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS			English	Article						Circuit testing; data mining; Iddq	INPUT VECTOR CONTROL; I-DDQ DATA; REDUCTION	Iddq testing is an integral component of test suites for the screening of unreliable devices. As the scale of silicon technology continues shrinking, Iddq values and associated fluctuations increase. In addition, increased design complexity makes defect-induced leakage currents difficult to differentiate from full-chip currents. Consequently, traditional Iddq methods result in more test escapes and yield loss. This brief proposes a new test method, called s-Iddq to provide the following: 1) Iddq analysis with process-parameter deduction and 2) the algorithm for automatic chip-classification called collective analysis without the need to manually determine threshold values. We randomly inserted a number of multiple defects into samples of ISCAS' 89 and IWSL'05 benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed s-Iddq method can achieve higher classification accuracy than single-threshold Iddq testing or sigma-Iddq in a 45-nm technology. The overall classification accuracy of the collective analysis achieve averaged 99.28% and 99.70% on s-Iddq data from process-parameter deductions with average-case search and multilevel search, respectively, demonstrating that the influence of process variation and design scaling can be significantly reduced to enable a better identification of defective chips.

Proteins are one important player in the host-pathogen interaction. A comprehensive list of such proteins will benefit our understanding of pathogenesis of Mtb. Methods: A genome-scale dataset was created from different sources of published data: global gene expression studies in disease models; genome-wide insertional mutagenesis defining gene essentiality under different conditions; genes lost in clinical isolates; subcellular localization analysis and nonhomology analysis. Using data mining and meta-analysis, expressed proteins critical for intracellular survival of Mtb are first identified, followed by subcellular localization analysis, finally filtering a series of subtractive channel of analysis to find out promising drug target candidates. Results: The analysis found 54 potential candidates essential for the intracellular survival of the pathogen and non-homologous to host or gut flora, and might be promising drug targets. Conclusion: Based on our meta-analysis and bioinformatics analysis, 54 hits were found from Mtb around 4000 open reading frames. These hits can be good candidates for further experimental investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cloud-based video solutions are proposed to meet many technical challenges in the real world. However, the data security is a vital problem, especially about video data. This paper proposed an architecture to mine the huge amount 3D video data. Meanwhile, we designed a model, called Key Encryption Model, to protect the privacy video data. In the meantime, the video mining cloud can decrypt the video data to make sure that the video data is safe and the mining results won't be stolen by the third party. The result proves that transmitting the encrypted video is feasible. Besides, the outlook in this field is also pointed out.

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed, Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing technique. Selection criteria: For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data. Methods: The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed. Results: Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were discussed. Conclusions: The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.

J	Saha, D; Alluri, P; Gan, A				Saha, Dibakar; Alluri, Priyanka; Gan, Albert			Prioritizing Highway Safety Manual's crash prediction variables using boosted regression trees	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Highway Safety Manual; Data mining; Boosted regression trees; Variable importance; Crash predictions; Calibration factor	TRAFFIC INJURY SEVERITY; CLASSIFICATION TREES; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; ROADS	The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) recommends using the empirical Bayes (EB) method with locally derived calibration factors to predict an agency's safety performance. However, the data needs for deriving these local calibration factors are significant, requiring very detailed roadway characteristics information. Many of the data variables identified in the HSM are currently unavailable in the states' databases. Moreover, the process of collecting and maintaining all the HSM data variables is cost-prohibitive. Prioritization of the variables based on their impact on crash predictions would, therefore, help to identify influential variables for which data could be collected and maintained for continued updates. This study aims to determine the impact of each independent variable identified in the HSM on crash predictions. A relatively recent data mining approach called boosted regression trees (BRT) is used to investigate the association between the variables and crash predictions. The BRT method can effectively handle different types of predictor variables, identify very complex and non-linear association among variables, and compute variable importance. Five years of crash data from 2008 to 2012 on two urban and suburban facility types, two-lane undivided arterials and four-lane divided arterials, were analyzed for estimating the influence of variables on crash predictions. Variables were found to exhibit non-linear and sometimes complex relationship to predicted crash counts. In addition, only a few variables were found to explain most of the variation in the crash data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A scientist must first formulate a hypothesis based on what he or she sees and then devise a variety of experiments to test it. Given the rapid growth of data, it has become virtually impossible for a person to manually inspect all data to find all of the interesting hypotheses for testing. In this article, we propose and develop a data-driven framework for automatic hypothesis testing and analysis. We define a hypothesis as a comparison between two or more subpopulations. We find subpopulations for comparison using frequent pattern mining techniques and then pair them up for statistical hypothesis testing. We also generate additional information for further analysis of the hypotheses that are deemed significant. The number of hypotheses generated can be very large, and many of them are very similar. We develop algorithms to remove redundant hypotheses and present a succinct set of significant hypotheses to users. We conducted a set of experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that our system can help users (1) identify significant hypotheses efficiently, (2) isolate the reasons behind significant hypotheses efficiently, and (3) find confounding factors that form Simpson's paradoxes with discovered significant hypotheses.

Datasets created for administration of the healthcare system provide a wealth of information from different healthcare sectors, and Canadian provinces' single-payer universal healthcare systems mean that data are more comprehensive and complete in this country than in many other jurisdictions. The increasing ability to also link clinical information, such as electronic medical records, laboratory test results and disease registries, has broadened the types of data available for analysis. Data-mining methods have been used in many different areas of diabetes clinical research, including classic epidemiology, effectiveness research, population health and health services research. Although methodologic challenges and privacy concerns remain important barriers to using these techniques, data mining remains a powerful tool for clinical research.

The problem of periodicity analysis (or period detection) is a research topic in several areas, such as signal processing and data mining. However, period detection is a very challenging problem, due to the sparsity and noisiness of observational datasets of periodic events. This paper focuses on the problem of period detection from sparse and noisy observational datasets. To solve the problem, a novel method based on the approximate greatest common divisor (AGCD) is proposed. The proposed method is robust to sparseness and noise, and is efficient. Moreover, unlike most existing methods, it does not need prior knowledge of the rough range of the period. To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments on synthetic data are conducted. Experimental results show that our method can yield highly accurate results with small datasets, is more robust to sparseness and noise, and is less sensitive to the magnitude of period than compared methods.

By making use of sparse and non-negative tensor structure, we develop Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving tensor equations. The multiplication of tensors with vectors are required at each iteration of these iterative methods, the cost per iteration depends on the number of non-zeros in the sparse tensors. We show linear convergence of the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods under suitable conditions, and therefore, the set of sparse non-negative tensor equations can be solved very efficiently. Experimental results on information retrieval by query search and community discovery in multi-dimensional networks are presented to illustrate the application of tensor equations and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Visual interactive methods integrate mathematical and symbolic models with runtime interaction and real-time graphic display, which allow visualizing the underlying physical relationships among process parameters. The proposed method is based on a parallel coordinates data mining tool that relies on an innovative pruning procedure which, on the basis of a proper selection of characteristic features of the accident sequences, retrieves the PIs among the whole set of implicants in terms of process parameter values or component failure states or both. The method is exemplified on an artificial case study, and then applied to the dynamic reliability analysis of the Airlock System of a Canadian Deuterium Uranium reactor.

Toward high-content screening of mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in living cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Mitochondrial pathophysiology; TMRM; Data mining; Machine learning; Multivariate analysis	OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; FUSION; DYNAMICS; QUANTIFICATION; BIOENERGETICS; DEGRADATION; DYSFUNCTION; DEFICIENCY; MUTATIONS; AUTOPHAGY	Mitochondria are double membrane organelles involved in various key cellular processes. Governed by dedicated protein machinery, mitochondria move and continuously fuse and divide. These "mitochondrial dynamics" are bi-directionally linked to mitochondrial and cell functional state in space and time. Due to the action of the electron transport chain (ETC), the mitochondrial inner membrane displays a inside-negative membrane potential (Delta psi). The latter is considered a functional readout of mitochondrial "health" and required to sustain normal mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial fusion. During the last decade, live-cell microscopy strategies were developed for simultaneous quantification of Delta psi and mitochondrial morphology. This revealed that ETC dysfunction, changes in Delta psi and aberrations in mitochondrial structure often occur in parallel, suggesting they are linked potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we discuss how combining high-content and high-throughput strategies can be used for analysis of genetic and/or drug-induced effects at the level of individual organelles, cells and cell populations.

The current article compares such actuarial modeling methods with a traditional logistic regression risk-assessment development approach. Utilizing a large purposive sample of Washington State offenders (N = 297,600), the current study examines and compares the predictive validity of the currently used Washington State Static Risk Assessment (SRA) instrument to classification tree analysis/random forest and neural network models. Overall findings varied, being dependent on the outcome of interest, with the best model for each method resulting in AUCs ranging from 0.732 to 0.762. Findings reveal some predictive performance improvements with advanced machine-learning methodologies, yet the logistic regression models demonstrate comparable predictive performance. The study concluded that while data-mining techniques hold potential for improvements over traditional methods, regression-based models demonstrate comparable, and often improved, prediction performance with noted parsimony and greater interpretability.

Numerous studies on bentonites, focussing on bentonite interaction with other components of the engineered barrier system and a range of host rock environments, are present in the literature. In this article, recent bentonite natural analogue studies are briefly reviewed, and gaps in the current literature identified, with the aim of (1) suggesting where relevant new information could be obtained by data mining published bentonite natural analogue studies with a new focus on current safety case requirements, (2) collecting relevant information by revisiting known bentonite analogue sites and conducting investigations with more appropriate analytical techniques, and (3) identifying novel study sites where, for example, bentonite longevity in very dilute to highly saline groundwater conditions can be studied. It must be noted that the use of natural analogues in safety case development is likely to be site and repository design-specific in nature and thus emphasis is placed on the appropriate use of relevant natural analogue data on bentonite longevity.

A series of 155 PPA patients observed in a clinical setting and subjected to at least one neuropsychological/language assessment was studied. Several demographic, clinical and neuropsychological attributes, grouped in distinct sets, were introduced in unsupervised learning methods (Expectation Maximization, K-Means, X-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and Consensus Clustering). Results demonstrated that unsupervised learning methods revealed two main groups consistently obtained throughout all the analyses (with different algorithms and different set of attributes). One group included most of the agrammatic/non-fluent and some logopenic cases while the other was mainly composed of semantic and logopenic cases. Clustering the patients in a larger number of groups (k > 2) revealed some clusters composed mostly of non-fluent or of semantic cases. However, we could not evidence any group chiefly composed of logopenic cases. In conclusion, unsupervised data mining approaches do not support a clear distinction of logopenic PPA as a separate variant.

Although prior research has shown that diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment, this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models. Comparison of the results shows that having more information about comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power, which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Contrast set mining in temporal databases	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						software engineering; artificial intelligence; knowledge acquisition; knowledge representation; knowledge base < system	DISCOVERING SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS	Understanding the underlying differences between groups or classes in certain contexts can be of the utmost importance. Contrast set mining relies on discovering significant patterns by contrasting two or more groups. A contrast set is a conjunction of attribute-value pairs that differ meaningfully in its distribution across groups. A previously proposed technique is rules for contrast sets, which seeks to express each contrast set found in terms of rules. This work extends rules for contrast sets to a temporal data mining task. We define a set of temporal patterns in order to capture the significant changes in the contrasts discovered along the considered time line. To evaluate the proposal accuracy and ability to discover relevant information, two different real-life data sets were studied using this approach.

In many applications such as fraud detection and intrusion detection, this issue becomes more important. Most existing techniques are unsupervised. On the other hand, semi-supervised approaches use both negative and positive instances to detect outliers. However, in many real world applications, very few positive labeled examples are available. This paper proposes an innovative approach to address this problem. The proposed method works as follows. First, some reliable negative instances are extracted by a kappa NN-based algorithm. Afterwards, fuzzy clustering using both negative and positive examples is utilized to detect outliers. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous unsupervised state-of-the-art methods in detecting outliers.

Adding significant predictors (i.e., soil structure), and implementing more flexible regression algorithms are among the main strategies of PTFs improvement. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the improved effect of categorical soil structure information on estimating soil-water content at various matric potentials, which has been reported in literature, could be enduringly captured by regression techniques other than the usually applied linear regression. Two data mining techniques, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which have been recently introduced as promising tools for PTF development, were utilized to test if the incorporation of soil structure will improve PTF's accuracy under a context of rather limited training data. The results show that incorporating descriptive soil structure information, i.e., massive, structured and structureless, as grouping criterion can improve the accuracy of PTFs derived by SVM approach in the range of matric potential of 6 to 33 kPa (average RMSE decreased up to 0.005 m(3) m(-3) after grouping, depending on matric potentials). The improvement was primarily attributed to the outperformance of SVM-PTFs calibrated on structureless soils. No improvement was obtained with kNN technique, at least not in our study in which the data set became limited in size after grouping. Since there is an impact of regression techniques on the improved effect of incorporating qualitative soil structure information, selecting a proper technique will help to maximize the combined influence of flexible regression algorithms and soil structure information on PTF accuracy.

Recent studies have examined the relationship between endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms and ED. However, the results remain inconclusive. The present study aimed to offer an actual view of estimating the correlation between eNOS polymorphisms and ED. MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis to estimate the association between eNOS polymorphisms and ED risk. Databases employed for data mining until December 1, 2014 included PubMed, Web of Science, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. Two study investigators independently conducted a literature search and data extraction. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals for the risk were calculated by using a random effects model or fixed effects model. ResultsA total of 20 studies in 13 publications were included in the meta-analysis. In the overall comparison, the eNOS G984T polymorphism was associated with an increased ED risk in allele contrast, dominant, heterozygote, and homozygote models (allele contrast: OR=1.514, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.019-2.248). For 4 VNTR polymorphisms, the overall analysis showed a significant association between homozygote comparison and recessive genetic model (homozygote comparison: OR=1.917, CI: 1.073-3.424). The eNOS T786C polymorphism increased ED risk in allele contrast, homozygote, and recessive models (allele contrast: OR=1.588, CI: 1.316-1.915). Significant heterogeneity was mainly observed in studies on the G894T polymorphism. No publication bias was detected in all of the variants. ConclusionThe eNOS polymorphisms G894T, 4 VNTR, and T786C were associated with an increased risk for ED. However, these results are still preliminary. Further studies based on different confounders and using a large population size should be conducted to generate more accurate and reliable conclusions.

The manuscript discusses the study background, hardware development, alternative algorithms used for the sensor data processing and fusion for identification of the most efficient solution and the final results from testing the Android application on smartphone. The test was performed in four 6-h sessions (two sessions with female participants at the age of 28 years, one session with male participants aged 28 years and one involving a man at the age of 49 years) and showed correct detection of all 40 simulated falls with only three false alarms. Our results confirmed the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to be 100% with a nominal false alarm rate (one false alarm per 8 h).

The Smart Therapist: A Look to the Future of Smartphones and mHealth Technologies in Psychotherapy	PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article						mobile phone; smartphone; mHealth; e-mental health; technological adjuncts	ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT; TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS; MOBILE PHONE; ADOLESCENTS; INTERVENTION; FEASIBILITY; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; USABILITY; ADHERENCE	mHealth refers to the use of mobile technologies in the provision of health care and is an expanding field within psychotherapy research. Mobile technologies have the capacity to greatly enhance patient access, uptake, and engagement in psychological treatment. The purpose of the present article is to define mHealth within clinical psychology, provide a review and discussion of the functionality of mHealth devices, current trends within the field of psychological mHealth, the challenges faced by researchers and clinicians in this field, and examine directions for future research. The main areas of research identified included the use of SMS technologies, ecological momentary assessment, online and software application-based interventions and the recent integration of sensor and data mining technologies. Much of the research to date is lacking in methodological rigor, and reliance on standard research designs often used in other areas of psychological research may constrain development of interventions. Research indicates that consumers want to engage in mHealth interventions, although only a limited number of empirically supported options currently exist. Future research incorporating innovative trial designs is required to meet consumer demand and provide users with evidence-based treatment options.

Analyzing Datasets Sampled from Twitter's Stream API	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB			English	Article						Twitter API; sample; data mining	CENTRALITY MEASURES; NETWORKS	Researchers have begun studying content obtained from microblogging services such as Twitter to address a variety of technological, social, and commercial research questions. The large number of Twitter users and even larger volume of tweets often make it impractical to collect and maintain a complete record of activity; therefore, most research and some commercial software applications rely on samples, often relatively small samples, of Twitter data. For the most part, sample sizes have been based on availability and practical considerations. Relatively little attention has been paid to how well these samples represent the underlying stream of Twitter data. To fill this gap, this article performs a comparative analysis on samples obtained from two of Twitter's streaming APIs with a more complete Twitter dataset to gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of Twitter data samples and their potential for use in various data mining tasks.

Time series motifs, which are similar subsequences or frequently occurring patterns, have significant meanings for researchers especially in medical domain. With the fast growth of time series data, traditional methods for motif discovery are inefficient and not applicable to large-scale data. This work proposes an efficient Motif Discovery method for Large-scale time series (MDLats). By computing standard motifs, MDLats eliminates a majority of redundant computation in the related arts and reuses existing information to the maximum. All the motif types and subsequences are generated for subsequent analysis and classification. Our system is implemented on a Hadoop platform and deployed in a hospital for clinical electrocardiography classification. The experiments on real- world healthcare data show that MDLats outperform the state-of-the-art methods even in large time series.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called "health factors," or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.
