While being applied in data mining, the time required to induce models from large data sets are one of the most important considerations. In this paper, we introduce a query-based learning scheme to improve neural networks' performance in data mining. Results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the training set cardinality. Additionally, the quality of training results can be also ensured. Our future work is to apply this concept to other data mining schemes and applications.

We apply a recently developed approach utilizing artificial neural networks as a data mining tool to identify and characterize the best subset of biomarkers associated with melanoma. These were capable of predicting whether a sample is from a patient diagnosed with stage I or stage IV melanoma to median accuracies of 98 % on an independent subset of data used for validation. Furthermore, individual response curves have been generated allowing the investigation of whether these markers are up or down regulated with regards to tumor progression.

Given this framework, it contributes to the theory of local patterns by providing the definition of local patterns, and a set of objective and subjective measures for evaluating the quality of induced patterns. These notions are illustrated on a description task of subgroup discovery, taking a propositionalization. approach to relational subgroup discovery (RSD), based on adapting rule learning and first-order feature construction, applicable in individual centered domains. It focuses on the use of constraints in RSD, both in feature construction and rule learning. We apply the proposed RSD approach to the Mutagenesis benchmark known from relational learning and a real-life telecommunications dataset.

DEA - Data Envelopment Analysis is one of these tools and its use is increasing in research and in new developments. The problem is how to improve the quality of DEA analysis when the DNM (decision-making unit) it analyzes is considered efficient, and how to guarantee the analysis if the input and output parameters that contain a lot of zeros? Probably these parameters have not been considered in how to visualize the inputs and outputs in n-dimensional space? This paper proposes combining another tool with DEA based in data mining, CLUSTERING, to evaluate the efficiency analyses made for DEA tools, and visualize groups which have inefficient DMUs, based on the K-Means algorithm, and apply over a telecommunication database that contains an indicator of efficiency of the telephone installation in the Brazilian market.

This paper focuses on the problem of knowledge reduction in incomplete decision tables. Based on a concept of incomplete conditional entropy, a new reduct definition is presented for incomplete decision tables and its properties are analyzed. Compared with several existing reduct definitions, the new definition has a better explanation for knowledge uncertainty and is more convenient for application of the idea of approximate reduct in incomplete decision tables.

Based on the Calois closed operators, a mathematical relationship between the fixed point and closed itemset in association rule mining is discussed and several properties are obtained. To mine all frequent closed itemsets is equal to build the fixed point lattice and mine its all points that satisfy support constraints. A new method for visualization of association rules based on the generalized association rule base is also proposed.

The purpose of this study is to extend our recently developed gene mining approach to extracting the relevant SNPs for alcoholism using sib-pair IBD profiles of pedigrees. Application to a publicly available large dataset of 100 simulated replicates for three American populations demonstrates that the proposed ensemble decision approach has successfully identified most of the simulated true loci, thus implicating that IBD statistic could be used as one of the informatics for mining the genetic underpins for complex human diseases.

To support very high dimensionality and the sparsity of document feature, the model-based clustering has been proved to be an intuitive choice for document clustering. However, the current model-based algorithms are prone to generating the skewed clusters, which influence the quality of clustering seriously. In this paper, the reasons of skew generating are examined and determined as the inappropriate initial model, and the interaction between the decentralization of estimation samples and the over-generalized cluster model. An effective clustering skew prevention method (ESPClust) is proposed to focus on the last reason. To break this interaction, for each cluster, ESPClust automatically selects a part of documents that most relevant to its corresponding class as the estimation samples to re-estimate the cluster model. Based on the ESPClust, two algorithms with respect to the quality and efficiency are provided for different kinds of applications. Compared with balanced model-based algorithms, the ESPClust method has less restrictions and more applicability. The experiments show that the ESPClust can avoid the clustering skew in a great degree and its Macro-F1 measure outperforms the previous methods' measure.

In each rule, there are many parameters. The users often want to get the best signal series from the in-sample sets, (Here, the best means they can get the most profit, return or Sharpe Ratio, etc), but the best one will not be the best in the out-of-sample sets. Sometimes, it does not work any more. In this paper, the authors set the parameters a sub-range value instead of a single value. In the sub-range, every value will give a better prediction in the out-of-sample sets. The improved result is robust and has a better performance in experience.

This model, based on C4.5, is improved on attribution selection and partitioning rules. In R-C4.5, for every attribute, entropies of corresponding subsets and average entropy are calculated. Then, the subsets whose entropies are not less than the average are united to produce a temporary compositive subset, that is to say, the branches which have poor classified effect are united. Entropies of temporary compositive subset and the other subsets are used to modify the information gain of certain node, and attribute with the highest modified information gain is chosen as the test attribute for the current node. R-C4.5 enhances interpretability of test attribute selection, reduces the number of insignificant or empty branches and avoids the appearance of over fitting.

Many of the traditional clustering algorithms falter when the dimensionality of the feature space becomes high, relativing to the size of the document space, So it is important to precondition for modeling Secondly, we are usually disappointed to their clustering speed when having very large complex data sets, and another defect is that they always fit some static model, so if the user doesn't select appropriate static-model parameters, these algorithms can break down. In this paper*, we introduce a new clustering algorithm to improve the speed of clustering, this clustering technique, which is based on granular computing and hypergraph partition, and it is capable of automatically discovering document similarities or associations, and this approach considers the internal characteristics of the clusters themselves, thus it doesn't depend on a static model. Finally, we conduct several experiments on real Web data searched by ordinary search engine and received the satisfied results..

However, finding a consensus clustering front multiple clusterings is a challenging task because there is no explicit correspondence between the classes from different clusterings. We present a new framework based on soft correspondence to directly address the correspondence problem in combining multiple clusterings. Under this framework, we propose a novel algorithm that iteratively computes the consensus clustering and correspondence matrices using multiplicative updating rules. This algorithm provides a final consensus clustering as well as correspondence matrices that gives intuitive interpretation of the relations between the consensus clustering and each clustering from clustering ensembles. Extensive experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this framework as well as the algorithm for discovering a consensus clustering from multiple clusterings.

Due to this reason, traditional data mining approach is replaced by systems that are able to mine continuous, high-volume, open-ended data streams as they arrive. In this paper, we survey three data stream clustering algorithms, namely clustering data streams using K-Means, statistical grid-based, and regression analysis. We compare and contrast these techniques as well.

Inexperienced teams unfamiliar with XP can face difficulties in adopting at once all twelve XP practices in a "big bang" implementation strategy. Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP. This work has value in both industrial and educational contexts.

In this paper, a framework for efficiently calculating frequent itemsets in voluminous data is presented. The algorithm FIT [LR] is a practical implemention of the framework. A theoretical comparison between FIT and Eclat [ZPOW] is also explored. The analysis asserts that the performance of FIT is much more efficient than that of Eclat. Experimental results confirmed the assertion with data from [AS].

Experimental data obtained from reactions which involve known concentrations of two or more components are used to calibrate a model that, later, will be used to predict the (unknown) concentrations of those components in a new reaction. This problem can be seen as a selection + prediction one, where the goal is to obtain good values for the variables to predict while minimizing the number of the input variables needed, taking a small subset of really significant ones. Initial approaches to the problem were Principal Components Analysis and Filtering. Then we used methods to make smarter reductions of variables, by means of parallel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) to choose collections of variables that yield models with less average prediction errors. A final step was to use multi-objective parallel EDAs, in order to present a set of optimal solutions instead of a single solution.

However, there has not been much research on how condensed representations should actually be represented. In this paper we study how condensed representations of frequent itemsets can be concretely represented: we propose the use of deterministic finite automata to represent pattern collections and study the properties of the automata representation. The automata representation supports visualization of the patterns in the collection and clustering of the patterns based on their structural properties and interestingness values. Furthermore, we show experimentally that finite automata provide a space-efficient way to represent itemset collections.

However, there has not been much research on how condensed representations should actually be represented. In this paper we study implicit enumeration of patterns, i.e., how to represent pattern collections by listing only the interestingness values of the patterns. The main problem is that the pattern classes are typically huge compared to the collections of interesting patterns in them. We solve this problem by choosing a good ordering of listing the patterns in the class such that the ordering admits effective pruning and prediction of the interestingness values of the patterns. This representation of interestingness values enables us to quantify how surprising a pattern is in the collection. Furthermore, the encoding of the interestingness values reflects our understanding of the pattern collection. Thus the size of the encoding can be used to evaluate the correctness of our assumptions about the pattern collection and the interestingness measure.

This intersection can take two forms: a) the more mundane use of intelligent agents for improved knowledge discovery and b) the use of data mining techniques for producing smarter, more efficient agents. The paper focuses on the second approach. Knowledge, hidden in voluminous data repositories routinely created and maintained by today's applications, can be extracted by data mining. The next step is to transform this knowledge into the inference mechanisms or simply the behavior of agents in multi-agent systems. We call this procedure "agent training." We define different levels of agent training and we present a software engineering methodology that combines the application of deductive logic for generating intelligence from data with a process for transferring this knowledge into agents. We introduce Agent Academy, an integrated open-source framework, which supports data mining techniques and agent development tools. We also provide several examples of multi-agent systems developed with this approach.

Frequent pattern mining is often regarded as advanced querying where a user specifies the source dataset and pattern constraints using a given constraint model. A significant amount of research on efficient processing of frequent pattern queries has been done in recent years, focusing mainly on constraint handling and reusing results of previous queries. In this paper we tackle the problem of optimizing a sequence of frequent pattern queries, submitted to the system as a batch. Our solutions are based on previously proposed techniques of reusing results of previous queries, and exploit the fact that knowing a sequence of queries a priori gives the system a chance to schedule and/or adjust the queries so that they can use results of queries executed earlier. We begin with simple query scheduling and then consider other transformations of the original batch of queries.

If the environments surrounding us could recognize our activities indirectly by sensors, the novel services, which respect our activities, can be possible. In this paper, we propose human activity recognition system, which infers the next human action by taking account of the past human behaviors observed so far. We also developed cooking support system by using an LCD touch panel on the kitchen counter and a mobile robot on the floor, which suggest what the human should do next by voice and gestures. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the inference system and the quality of support.

The approach is based on an adaptation of rough set theory to multidimensional data, and offers cube exploration and mining facilities. Since data in a data warehouse come from multiple heterogeneous sources with various degrees of reliability and data formats, users tend to be more tolerant in a data warehouse environment and prone to accept some information loss and discrepancy between actual data and manipulated ones. The objective of this work is to integrate approximation mechanisms and associated operators into data cubes in order to produce views that can then be explored using OLAP or data mining techniques. The integration of data approximation capabilities with OLAP techniques offers additional facilities for cube exploration and analysis. The proposed approach allows the user to work either in a restricted mode using a cube lower approximation or in a relaxed mode using cube upper approximation. The former mode is useful when the query output is large, and hence allows the user to focus on a reduced set of fully matching tuples. The latter is useful when a query returns an empty or small answer set, and hence helps relax the query conditions so that a superset of the answer is returned. In addition, the proposed approach generates classification and characteristic rules for prediction, classification and association purposes.

Our approach is to reconstruct a dataset according to the classification rules that have been checked and agreed by the data owner for releasing to data sharing. Unlike the other heuristic modification approaches, firstly, our method classifies a given dataset. Subsequently, a set of classification rules is shown to the data owner to identify the sensitive rules that should be hidden. After that we build a new decision tree that is constituted only non-sensitive rules. Finally, a new dataset is reconstructed. Our experiments show that the sensitive rules can be hidden completely on the reconstructed datasets. While non-sensitive rules are still able to discovered without any side effect. Moreover, our method can also preserve high usability of reconstructed datasets.

We found that number of combinations derived from data mining (association rule method) was greater than that derived from conventional method (logistic regression analysis). Moreover, values of both "confidence" and "odds ratio" derived from association rule were greater than that derived from logistic regression. We found that "the association rule method" was more and useful to elucidate effective combinations of risk factors in terms of lifestyle diseases.

To extract the normal behavior as a profile, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams. As a result, without maintaining any historical activity of a user physically, new activities of the user can be continuously reflected to the on-going result of clustering.

In each iteration a comparatively small batch of documents is evaluated for relating to the human interest. We apply active learning techniques based on Support Vector Machine for evaluating successive batches, which is called relevance feedback. Our proposed approach has been very useful for document retrieval with relevance feedback experimentally. In this paper, we adopt several representations of the Vector Space Model and several selecting rules of displayed documents at each iteration, and then show the comparison results of the effectiveness for the document retrieval in these several situations.

Age at onset or several other quantitative variables could allow for categorizing more homogeneous subgroups of patients, although there is little information on which are the boundaries for such categories. The Bayesian networks classifier approach is one of the most popular formalisms for reasoning under uncertainiy. We used this approach to determine the best cut-off point for three continuous variables (i.e. age at onset of schizophrenia (AFC* & AFE**) and neurological soft signs (NSS)) with a minimal loss of information, using a data set including genotypes of selected candidate genes for schizophrenia.

Two objectives are employed in the process: minimizing the within cluster similarity and maximizing the difference between the clusters: inter-cluster distance (average linkage, centroid linkage, complete linkage and average to centroid linkage) versus intra-cluster distance (total within cluster variation). The proposed approach is iterative in the sense that it basically tries possible partitioning of the dataset for the given range of clusters one by one; the result of the previous partitioning n favors that of the current solution n+1. In order to achieve this, we identified a global k-means operator and we do "what if' analysis in the aspect of the objectives to see the better initialization in case the number of clusters is increased by one. After evaluating all, a feedback mechanism is supplied at the back-end to analyze the partitioning results with different indices. The entire system has been tested with a real world dataset: glass. The reported results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, a system faces a challenge of selecting the most appropriate technique(s) for a problem at hand, since in the real domain area it is infeasible to perform a comparison of all applicable techniques. The main goal of this paper is to consider the limitations of data-driven approaches and propose a knowledge-driven approach to enhance the use of multiple data-mining strategies in a knowledge discovery system. We introduce the concept of (meta-) knowledge management, which is aimed to organize a systematic process of (meta-) knowledge capture and refinement over time.

However, the efficiency of these algorithms needs to be improved to handle large datasets. In this paper, we present an algorithm named STBAR for mining association rules, which is improved from TBAR. STBAR employs dynamic pruning, which can effectively cut down the infrequent concatenations. Experiments with UCI dataset show that STBAR is more efficient in speed about 10%similar to 30% than TBAR, which outperforms Apriori, a famous and widely used algorithm.

Our approach does not rely on a-priori assumptions or human intuition about the dominant aspects enabling this way the investigation of highly complex COTS-based systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a commercial data mining tool from IBM on the data obtained from experiments conducted using the DBench-OLTP dependability benchmark. Results obtained with the proposed technique identified important key factors impacting performance and dependability that could not have been revealed by the dependability benchmark measures.

Gaussian Processes for Active Data Mining of Spatial Aggregates	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 21-23, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc		spatial mining; active mining; sparse data; spatial aggregation; Gaussian processes	SOFTWARE	Active data mining is becoming prevalent in applications requiring focused sampling of data relevant to a high-level mining objective. It is especially pertinent in scientific and engineering applications where we seek to characterize a configuration space or design space in terms of spatial aggregates, and where data collection can become costly. Examples abound in domains such as aircraft design, wireless system simulation, fluid dynamics, and sensor networks. This paper develops an active mining mechanism, using Gaussian processes, for uncovering spatial aggregates from only a sparse set of targeted samples. Gaussian processes provide a unifying framework for building surrogate models from sparse data, :reasoning about the uncertainty of estimation at unsampled points, and formulating objective criteria for closing-the-loop between data collection and data mining. Our mechanism optimizes sample selection using entropy-based functionals defined over spatial aggregates instead of the traditional approach of sampling to minimize estimated variance. We apply this mechanism on a global optimization benchmark comprising a testbank of 2D functions, as well as on data from wireless system simulations. The results reveal that the proposed sampling strategy makes more judicious use of data points by selecting locations that clarify high-level structures in data, rather than choosing points that merely improve quality of function approximation.

Likewise, much of the world's data is in the form of time series, and as will be shown, many other types of data, such as video, image, and handwriting, can be transformed into time series. This fact has fueled enormous interest in time series retrieval in the database and data mining community. However, much of this work's narrow focus on efficiency and scalability has come at the cost of usability and effectiveness. In this work, we explore the utility of the multimedia data transformation into a much simpler one-dimensional time series representation. With this time series data, we can exploit the capability of Dynamic Time Warping, which results in a more accurate retrieval. We can also use a general framework that learns a distance measure with arbitrary constraints on the warping path of the Dynamic Time Warping calculation for both classification and query retrieval tasks. In addition, incorporating a relevance feedback system and query refinement into the retrieval task can further improve the precision/recall to a great extent.

However, the reality seems to not to have matched the hopes. The DM models used in DW are largely trivial, and the data-structures used in DM are trivial: a schism seems to have developed between DM and D W. Furthermore there seems to be no coherent DM methodology to guide the choice of models and their appraisal. It is proposed that linked ontologies of data, and models will provide such guidance, and a theory of knowledge (an epistemology) needs to be developed in order to enable appraisal of discovered knowledge. Between these front-end and back-end suggestions for the development of a coherent KDD methodology it is also suggested that DM toolkit needs major overhaul by the inclusion of the extensive use of search and sampling techniques at the strategic DM level.

Due to incomplete biomedical information databases, the extraction cannot be done straightforward using dictionaries, so several approaches using contextual rules and machine learning have previously been proposed. Our work is inspired by the previous approaches, but is novel in the sense that it combines Google and Gene Ontology for annotating protein interactions. We got promising empirical results - 57.5% terms as valid GO annotations, and 16.9% protein names in the answers provided by our system gProt. The total error-rate was 25.6% consisting mainly of overly general answers and syntactic errors, but also including semantic errors, other biological entities (than proteins and GO-terms) and false information sources.

The result of KeyGraph analysis is shown like network diagrams; the analyst tries to understand the meaning of links and make reasonable scenarios. In this process, the more complex the link structure is, the more difficult to understand its meaning. For this difficulty, we developed a preprocessing method enabling to generate simpler link structure at first and also generate more complex structure gradually. By this method, we could obtain more detailed and various scenarios.

Temporal Web mining is a new approach, which deals with real time data. Temporal Web mining extends temporal data mining and Web mining. It concerns the Web mining of data with significant temporal information. It can be used in different areas, such as finance, engineering, environmental sciences, earth sciences, and medicine. Its main goal is to analyze local and Web data in real time in order to discover relevant temporal information. This paper presents the new concept Temporal Web Mining (TWM), focuses on its architecture, and discusses some of its application scenarios, such as volcanism and seismology, and flooding.

To this scenario should be added the latency times between the sampling moment and the outcome of the laboratory analyses. Although the idea of considering sensors for remote acquisition of data is not new, there are some constraints to be addressed, like the existence of sensors to measure the pertinent parameters and their efficiency, the costs involved and the possibility of remote sensing. The application of this alternative is highly dependent on the relevance of the candidate parameters. At this point, the Data Mining (DM) approach assumes an important role, in the sense that it can reveal the relative importance of the parameters, as well the prediction models to determine the water quality and finally the associated accuracies. This paper introduces a decision framework to support the selection of biochemical parameters to be considered in remote sensing of water contained in barrages. The framework enables the comparison of the efficiency of two kinds of models, using; decision trees. The first one uses all the water quality indicators, including the time and cost consuming variables, while the second model is based only on remotely real-time acquired parameters. When comparing both strategies under several criteria (e.g., cost, time and confidence), the latter method was showed to be the best alternative.

A promising approach to organisation of MAS is the theory of holonic multiagent systems (HMAS), which allows different kinds of recursive agent groupings (holons) whose members temporarily collaborate to solve a certain subproblem. We present a holonic multiagent system based on a probabilistic agent architecture which is efficient for agent-based distributed data mining and simulation. We illustrate its ability to build different kinds of high-performance holons which are useful for different simulation aspects. The holons are built using cloning and merging of probabilistic networks representing the behaviour and knowledge of the agents. Finally, we show their benefits within the project SimMarket concerning supermarket simulation based on a framework for probabilistic HMAS.

Classical partitioning clustering methods, such as k-means algorithm, start with a known set of objects, and all features are considered simultaneously when calculating objects' similarity. But there are numerous applications where an object set already clustered with respect to an initial set of attributes is altered by the addition of new features. Consequently, a re-clustering is required. We propose in this paper an incremental, k-means based clustering method, Core Based Incremental Clustering (CBIC), that is capable to re-partition the objects set, when the attribute set increases. The method starts from the partitioning into clusters that was established by applying k-means or CBIC before the attribute set changed. The result is reached more efficiently than running k-means again from the scratch on the feature-extended object set. Experiments proving the method's efficiency are also reported.

It is used to identify the pay zones of gas or oil in the reservoir formations. This paper applies intelligent technology for well logging analysis, particular combining data mining and expert system together, and proposes an intelligent system for well log analysis called IntWeL Analyzer in terms of data mining platform MSMiner and expert system tool OKPS. The architecture of IntWeL Analyzer and data mining algorithms, including Ripper algorithm and MOUCLAS algorithm are also presented. MOUCLAS is based on the concept of the fuzzy set membership function that gives the new approach a solid mathematical foundation and compact mathematical description of classifiers. The aim of the study is the use of intelligent technology to interpret the pay zones from well logging data for the purpose of reservoir characterization. This approach is better than conventional techniques for well logging interpretation that cannot discover the correct relation between the well logging data and the underlying property of interest.

However, we still have a limited capacity for extracting information from large remote sensing image databases. There are currently very few techniques for image data mining and information extraction in large image data sets, and thus we are failing to exploit our large remote sensing data archives. This paper proposes a methodology to provide guidance for mining remote sensing image databases. The basic idea is to use domain concepts to build generic description of patterns in remote sensing images, and then use structural approaches to identify such patterns in images. We illustrate our proposal with a case study for detecting land use patterns in Amazonia from INPE's remote sensing image database.

The data mining algorithm for reverse engineering uses a genetic program (GP) as a data mining function. A GP is an evolutionary algorithm that automatically evolves populations of computer programs or mathematical expressions, eventually selecting one that is optimal in the sense it maximizes a fitness function. The system to be reverse engineered is typically a sensor that may not be disassembled and for which there are no design documents. The sensor is used to create a database of input signals and output measurements. Rules about the likely design properties of the sensor are collected from experts. The rules are used to create a fitness function for the GP allowing GP based data mining. This procedure incorporates not only the experts' rules into the fitness function, but also the information in the database. The information extracted through this process is the internal design specifications of the sensor. These design properties can be used to create a fitness function for a genetic algorithm, which is in turn used to search for defects in the digital logic design.

The notion of convertible constraints has been raised in some research. By using the technique some constraints can be pushed into a algorithm for frequent itemsets mining. In this paper, we study multiple convertible constraints and develop technique which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside a algorithm for frequent itemsets mining. By using a sample database we analyze the constraints and then select a optimal method to convert them to convertible constraints for data mining. Results from our detailed experiment show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Numerous attempts Made at classification of symptoms and characteristic features of disorders have rarely used neural networks due to the inherent difficulty of training with sufficient data. But, the inherent robustness of neural nelworks and their adaptability in varying relationships of input and output justifies their use in clinical databases. To overcome the problem of training under conditions of insufficient and incomplete data, we propose to use three different neural network classifiers, each using a different learning function. Consequent combination of their beliefs by Dempster-Shafer evidence combination overcomes weaknesses exhibited by any one classifier to a particular training set. We prove with conclusive evidence that such all approach would provide a significantly higher accuracy in the diagnosis of disorders and diseases.

The method proposes to use samples of confidence in proper size as the training data to generate comprehensible trees as well as to save time. For medium or small databases direct use of original data with some harsh pruning may be used, because the pruning generates trees of similar size with smaller error rates.

In this paper, we focus on the privacy preserving on decision tree in multi party environment when data are vertically partitioned. We propose novel private decision tree algorithms applied to building and classification stages. The main advantage of our work over the existing ones is that each party cannot use the public decision tree to infer the other's private data. With our algorithms, the communication cost during tree building stage is reduced compared to existing methods and the number of involving parties could be extended to be more than two parties.

They only have a few uniform structures and contain various authoring styles compared to traditional text-based documents. However, users usually focus on a particular section of the page that presents the most relevant information to their interest. Therefore, Web documents classification needs to group and filter the pages based on their contents and relevant information. Many researches on Web mining report on mining Web structure and extracting information from web contents. However, they have focused on detecting tables that convey specific data, not the tables that are used as a mechanism for structuring the layout of Web pages. Case modeling of tables can be constructed based on structure abstraction. Furthermore, Ripple Down Rules (RDR) is used to implement knowledge organization and construction, because it supports a simple rule maintenance based on case and local validation.

A supervised tensor learning (STL) framework is established for convex optimization based learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and minimax probability machines (M P M). Within the STL framework, many conventional learning machines can be generalized to take n(th)-order tensors as inputs. We also study the applications of tensors to learning machine design and feature extraction by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our method for tensor based feature extraction is named the tenor rank-one discriminant analysis (TRIDA). These generalized algorithms have several advantages: 1) reduce the curse of dimension problem in machine learning and data mining; 2) avoid the failure to converge; and 3) achieve better separation between the different categories of samples. As an example, we generalize MPM to its STL version, which is named the tensor MPM (TMPM). TMPM learns a series of tensor projections iteratively. It is then evaluated against the original MPM. Our experiments on a binary classification problem show that TMPM significantly outperforms the original MPM.

The main idea of this method is to divide a great large dataset into several sub-datasets, mine on sub-datasets separately to construct different sub-decision trees, detect TCP data by different sub-decision trees, and then nonlinearly combine the results from multiple sub-decision trees by fuzzy integral. The experiment results show that this technique is superior to individual decision trees for intrusion detection in terms of classification accuracy.

We describe hierarchical cluster analysis of DNA microarray data using structure of weighted trees in two manners : classifying the degree of overlap between different microarrays and classifying the degree of expression levels between different genes. These are most efficiently done by finding the characteristic genes and microarrays with the maximum degree of overlap and determining the group of candidate genes suggestive of a pathology.

Each activity in data mining process is viewed as a web service operated on Internet. The web services provide functions of data preprocessing, data mining algorithms, and visualization analysis. Depending on user's requirement, the web services are dynamically linked using Business Process Execution Language for Web Service (BPEL4WS) to construct a desired data mining process. Finally, the result model described by Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is returned for further analysis. A practical credit card data set provided by a commercial bank is implemented using the proposed system.

Earlier work on mining generalized association rules ignore the fact that the taxonomies of items cannot be kept static while new transactions are continuously added into the original database. How to effectively update the discovered generalized association rules to reflect the database change with taxonomy evolution and transaction update is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose a novel algorithm, called IDTE, which can incrementally update the discovered generalized association rules when the taxonomy of items is evolved with new transactions insertion to the database. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can maintain its performance even in large amounts of incremental transactions and high degree of taxonomy evolution, and is more than an order of magnitude faster than applying the best generalized associations mining algorithms to the whole updated database.

With the capabilities of pervasive surveillance, sensor networks can be very useful in a lot of commercial and military applications for collecting and processing the environmental data. One of the very interesting research issues is the energy saving in object tracking sensor networks (OTSNs). However, most of the past studies focused only on the aspect of movement behavior analysis or location tracking and did not consider the temporal characteristics, which are very critical in OTSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining method named TMP-Mine with a special data structure named TMP-Tree for discovering temporal moving patterns efficiently. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that explores the issue of discovering temporal moving patterns that contain both movement and time interval simultaneously. Through empirical evaluation on various simulation conditions, TMP-Mine is shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of accuracy, execution efficiency, and scalability.

In our approach, we first conduct the hierarchical clustering to form a hierarchical model for the sensor nodes. Secondly, the movement logs of the moving objects are analyzed by a data mining algorithm to obtain the movement rules, which are then used to predict the next position of a moving object. Besides, we use the multi-level structure to represent the hierarchical relations among sensors so as to achieve the goal of keeping tracking of moving objects in real-time. Through experimental evaluation on various simulation conditions, the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of both energy efficiency and timeliness.

Our ability to collect data, be it in business, government, science, and perhaps personal, has been increasing at a dramatic rate, which we call "information flood". However, our ability to analyze and understand massive data lags far behind our ability to collect them. The value of data is no longer in "how much of it we have". Rather, the value is in how quickly and effectively can the data be reduced, explored, manipulated and managed. For this purpose, Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) emerges as a technique that extracts implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information (or patterns) from data. However, recent extensive studies and real world applications show that the following requirements are indispensable to overcome information flood: (1) identifying and collecting the relevant data from a huge information search space (active information collection), (2) mining useful knowledge from different forms of massive data efficiently and effectively (user-centered active data mining), and (3) promptly reacting to situation changes and giving necessary feedback to both data collection and mining steps (active user reaction). Active mining is proposed as a solution to these requirements, which collectively achieves the various mining need. By "collectively achieving" we mean that the total effect outperforms the simple add-sum effect that each individual effort can bring.

Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy, which is often not achievable with single models. One technique, which proved to be effective for constructing an ensemble of diverse classifiers, is the use of feature subsets. Among different approaches to ensemble feature selection, genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. In this paper, a new strategy GAS-SEFS, Genetic Algorithm-based Sequential Search for Ensemble Feature Selection, is introduced. Instead of one genetic process, it employs a series of processes, the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier. Experiments on 21 data sets are conducted, comparing the new strategy with a previously considered genetic strategy for different ensemble sizes and for five different ensemble integration methods. The experiments show that GAS-SEFS, although being more time-consuming, often builds better ensembles, especially on data sets with larger numbers of features.

This is crucial for the identification of valid; novel, potentially useful, and understandable patterns (regularities; oddities, etc.). A Virtual Reality (VR) approach for large heterogeneous, incomplete and imprecise information is introduced for the problem of visualizing and analyzing astronomic data. The method is based on mappings between one heterogeneous space representing the data, kind a homogeneous virtual reality space. This VR-based visual data mining technique allows the incorporation of the unmatched geometric capabilities of the human brain into the knowledge discovery process, and helps in understanding dates structure and patterns. This approach has been applied successfully to a wide variety of real-world domains, and it has a large potential in astronomy. Examples are presented from the domain of galaxy research.

Since the volume of data to be analyzed is sometimes quite significant, there is the need for efficient data mining algorithms to be implemented. The market-basket algorithm can represent a breakthrough in data mining techniques. As the associations that are to be analyzed grow more and more abstract, the market-basket approach is unable to deal with imprecise temporal associations, leaving a big area uncharted This research is dedicated to the analysis of temporal imprecise associations through the modification of a standard a-priori approach by means of fuzzy set relations to classify the associations relating different sources of data.

The concept of cognition of the domain theory is derived for the reprehensive measurement theory (RMT). We show that a Relational Data Mining approach we proposed previously performs cognition of domain theories in accordance with the RMT and produces the relational methodology for analysis of cognitive capabilities of data mining methods. In this methodology a domain theory includes a metadata ontology. This ontology contains various data types formalized in the first-order logic in accordance with the RMT. To represent the knowledge theory we use the concept of the Logical Empirical Theory that is defined in the paper.

This paper introduces the research of current spatial cluster algorithms, and we propose a new and efficient algorithm based on the theory of partitioning methods, grid-based methods and density methods. This algorithm can rind arbitrarily-shape clusters without any previous knowledge, and scale well for large data sets due to its computational complexity not to connect with the number of objects. This paper employs spatial cluster in the customer partitioning of business management so as to solve spatial analysis and location.

An IRS is defined as the smallest subset of an association rule set such that it has the same prediction sequence by confidence priority as the association rule set. A top-down level-wise approach for the discovery of IRS on static database has been proposed in [9]. Based on the Fast UPdating technique (FUP2) [5] for the updating of discovered association rules, we present here an algorithm to maintain the discovered IRS, under incremental deletion. Numerical comparison with the non-incremental informative rule set approach is shown to demonstrate that our proposed technique requires less computation time, in terms of number of database scanning, number of candidate rules generated and processing time, to maintain the discovered informative rule set.

This paper presents a novel anomaly detection framework, which uses data mining technologies to build four independent detection models. In the training phase, these models mine specialty of every web program using web server log files as data source, and in the detection phase, each model takes the HTTP requests upon detection as input and calculates at least one anomalous probability as output. All the four models totally generate eight anomalous probabilities, which are weighted and summed up to produce a final probability, and this probability is used to decide whether the request is malicious or not. Experiments prove that our detection framework achieves close to perfect detection rate under very few false positives.

Traditionally single words occurring in the documents are identified to determine the similarities among documents. In this work, we investigate using compound words as features for document clustering. Our experimental results demonstrate that using compound words alone cannot improve the performance of clustering system. Promising results are achieved when the compound words are combined with the original single words to be the features. An evaluation of several basic clustering algorithms is also performed in our work for algorithm selection. Although the bisecting K-means method has been proposed as a good document clustering algorithm by other investigators, our experimental results demonstrated that for small datasets, a traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm still achieves the best performance.

But most of the current mining algorithms can't be used in very large text database. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient parallel algorithm parTFI which is used to find top-k frequent itemsets with specified minimum length in very large text database. Base on a simple data structure H-struct, parTFI uses a novel logical vertical data partition technique to mine top-k frequent itemsets at each mining server parallel. Our performance study shows that when processing very large sparse text database, parTFI outperforms Apriori and FP-growth, two efficient frequent iemsets mining algorithms, even when both are running with the better tuned min-support. Furthermore, by creating H-struct dynamically, parTFI can suit even huge dataset that most other algorithms can't process.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework which allows visualization to take place in the background of normal day to day operations of any GUI based operating system such as MS Windows, OS X or Linux. Our system works by replacing the standard file icons with automatically generated icons that reflect the contents of the files in a principled way. We call such icons Intelligent Icons. While there is little utility in examining an individual icon, examining groups of them provides a greater possibility of unexpected and serendipitous discoveries. The utility of Intelligent Icons can be further enhanced by arranging them on the screen in a way that reflects their similarity/differences. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on data as diverse as DNA, text files, electrocardiograms, and Space Shuttle telemetry. In addition we show that our system is unique in also supporting fast and intuitive similarity search.

The semi-structured data appears in a wide range of applications, such as digital libraries, on-line documentations, electronic commerce. After we have obtained enough data from WWW, we then use data mining method to mine schema knowledge from the data. Therefore, it is very important for us to utilize schema information effectively. This paper proposes a method of schema mining based on fuzzy decision tree to get useful schema information on the web. This algorithm includes three stages, represented using Datalog, incremental clustering, determining using fuzzy decision tree. Using this algorithm, we can discover schema knowledge implicit in the semi-structured data. This knowledge can make users understand the information structure on the web more deeply and thoroughly. At the same time, it can also provide a kind of effective schema for the querying of web information. In the future, we will further the work on extract association rules using machine learning method and study the clustering method in semi-structured data knowledge discovery.

In particular, along with system security and fault tolerance, memory management is perhaps the most frequently observed challenge that the IS/IT manager faces on a daily basis. A framework for building an automated intelligent agent for memory management under the client-server architecture is suggested in this paper. Further, possible applications of the framework in terms of data mining are suggested.

Due to memory limitations, not all data mining queries in a batch can be executed together. In this paper we introduce a heuristic algorithm called CCFull, which suboptimally schedules the data mining queries into a number of execution phases. The algorithm significantly outperforms the optimal approach while providing a very good accuracy.

Generally these systems are designed to capture specific information in human readable form for direct investigation by subject matter experts and engineers. The data is intended to be scanned for a specific condition, or look for an indicator to solve a specific issue. Interestingly, only a small percentage of the data is ever used. However, as these data stores grow, they incidentally capture information that can be even more valuable. This paper is intended to assist an uninitiated person or team to preparing data collected in an automated test environment for data mining supporting an intelligent system.

Subsequently, we carry out data mining using association rules algorithm. We measure the similarity, difference and modified difference of mined association rules based on three rules, i.e. Emerging Patten Rule, Unexpected Change Rule, and Added/Perished Rule. In the meantime, we use rule matching threshold to derive all types of rules and explore the rules with significant change based on the degree of change measured. In this paper, we employ data mining tools and effectively discover the current spending pattern of customers and trends of behavioral change, which will allow management to detect in a large database potential changes of customer preference, and provide as early as possible products and services desired by the customers to expand the clientele base and prevent customer attrition.

In order to maximize outlet profit levels, it is necessary to seek such pricing strategies after achieving an in-depth understanding of the various features of consumer purchase behavior concerning a wide range of products and their related prices. We authors have used a very large amount of consumer purchase behavior data in order to clarify the effects on store-level profits of a wide range of specific products to develop a support system for pricing specialists. At the end of this paper, we analyze the framework that has been presented for the system from the standpoint of its utility for discovery of new business chances and discuss the need to clarify the problems connected with the use of data mining-based pricing strategies.

Instead of a traditional approach of principal component analysis (PCA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Hopfield models are employed to analyze the time series. To illustrate the feasibility and simplicity of the above procedures for time series data mining, the problem of measuring normality in HTYP traffic for the purpose of anomaly-based network intrusion detection is addressed. The detection results provided by our approach show important improvements, both in detection ratio and regarding false alarms, in comparison with those obtained using other current techniques..

J	Yen, SJ				Yen, SJ			Mining interesting sequential patterns for intelligent systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							ALGORITHM	Mining sequential patterns means to discover sequential purchasing behaviors of most customers from a large number of customer transactions. Past transaction data can be analyzed to discover customer purchasing behaviors such that the quality of business decisions can be improved. However, the size of the transaction database can be very large. It is very time consuming to find all the sequential patterns from a large database. and users may be only interested in some sequential patterns. Moreover, the criteria of the discovered sequential patterns for user requirements may not be the same. Many uninteresting sequential patterns for user requirements can be generated when traditional mining methods are applied. Hence, a data mining language needs to be provided such that users can query only knowledge of interest to them from a large database of customer transactions. In this article. a data mining language is presented. From the data mining language. users can specify the items of interest and the criteria of the sequential patterns to be discovered. Also, an efficient data mining technique is proposed to extract the sequential patterns according to the users' requests. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

The sensory time-series data present new challenges to data mining, including uneven sequence lengths, multi-dimensionality and high levels of noise. We adopt a principled approach, by first transforming all the data into an equal-length vector form while keeping as much temporal information as we can, and then applying dimensionality and noise reduction techniques such as spectral clustering to the transformed data. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our proposed approach outperforms standard model-based clustering algorithms for time series data.

In this paper we propose MDBM, an accurate and efficient approach for classification on multiple heterogeneous databases. We propose a regression-based method for predicting the usefulness of inter-database links that serve as bridges for information transfer, because such links are automatically detected and may or may not be useful or even valid. Because of the high cost of inter-database communication, MDBM employs a new strategy for cross-database classification, which finds and performs actions with high benefit-to-cost ratios. The experiments show that MDBM achieves high accuracy in cross-database classification, with much higher efficiency than previous approaches.

Especially, EP have been applied to the production of new types of classifiers during classification in data mining. Traditional clustering and pattern mining algorithms are inadequate for handling the analysis of high dimensional gene expression data or the analysis of multi-source data based on the same variables (e.g. genes), and the experimental results are not easy to understand. In this paper, a simple scheme for using EP to improve the performance of classification procedures in multi-source data is proposed. Also, patterns that make multi-source data easy to understand are obtained as experimental results. A new method for producing EP based on observations (e.g. samples in microarray data) in the search of classification patterns and the use of detected patterns for the classification of variables in multi-source data are presented.

Firstly, for each time series X={x(1),x(2),...,x(1)}, the approach develops a granular time series induced by the original time series, and a trend granular time series induced by the trend time series partial derivative X = {x(2)- x(1), x(3)-x(2), ... ,x(n)-x(n-1)}. Secondly, it compares the two original time series by comparing the corresponding two (trend) granular time series. In order to compare two (trend) granular time series, an index, named degree of similarity, is defined to reflect the similarity of them. By the granulation-based method, we can deal With the temporal data mining tasks such as similar subsequence searching, clustering and indexing etc. on the granular level. Experiments show that our method is effective and applicable.

Clustering techniques have been studied extensively in E-Commerce, statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning. This increases the need for efficient and effective analysis methods to make use of this information. Traditional DENCLUE is an important clustering algorithm. But it is difficult to make its two global parameters (sigma, xi) be globally effective. A new Algorithm based on KNN and DENCLUE is proposed in this paper, which offers DENCLUE the appropriate and globally effective parameters based on KNN and DENCLUE. At the first, the window-width (WW) of each data point is determined and the whole data set is partitioned into some fuzzy cluster (FC) by KNN based on KDE. Then, the local a of each FC is unsupervised determined according to the entropy theory. At the last, each local a is mapped to the global sigma and each FC is independently clustered, which makes the global sigma and xi have the global validity. The analysis and experiment prove that our clustering method achieves better performance on the quality of the resulting clustering and the results are not sensitive to the parameter k.

The model constructs RDM algorithm and optimize the strategy of region matching using Q-learning to obtain better motion information of regions. Moreover, OMDB utilizes NEA algorithm to detect and merge gradually object regions of foreground based on the characteristics that there is motion difference between foreground and background and the regions of an object maintain integrality during moving. Experimental results on extracting region information of foreground object and tracking the object are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

Our focus is data sharing among two parties involved in a data mining task. We study how to share private or confidential data in the following scenario: two parties, each having a private data set, want to collaboratively conduct association rule mining without disclosing their private data to each other or any other parties. To tackle this demanding problem, we develop a secure protocol for two parties to conduct the desired computation. The solution is distributed, i.e., there is no central, trusted party having access to all the data. Instead, we define a protocol using homomorphic encryption techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private. All the parties are treated symmetrically: they all participate in the encryption and in the computation involved in learning the association rules.

It is also the basis to obtain the shape characteristic of daily power consumption of a trade and conduct researches in the state estimate of distribution networks etc. Traditional analytical approaches are limited to qualitative analysis with a small coverage only. We propose a model which can perform in-depth analysis of customer power consumption behaviors by data mining through similar sequence analysis to overcome the drawbacks of traditional approaches. The model uses real-time sampling of the energy data of consumers to form the shape characteristic curves. The application and testing of the model under an instance is analyzed in this paper.

However, they are often criticised and regarded as a "black box" due to the lack of interpretation ability. This chapter describes a domain independent approach to the use of neural networks for mining multiple class, small objects in large images. In this approach, the networks are trained by the back propagation algorithm on examples which have been cut out from the large images. The trained networks are then applied, in a moving window fashion, over the large images to mine the objects of interest. During the mining process, both the classes and locations of the objects are determined. The network behaviour is interpreted by analysing the weights in learned networks. Visualisation of these weights not only gives an intuitive way of representing hidden patterns encoded in learned neural networks for object mining problems, but also shows that neural networks are not just a black box but an expression or a model of hidden patterns discovered in the data mining process.

The performance is measured in terms of the accuracy of data mining results and the privacy protection of sensitive data. On the accuracy side, we address the problem of previous measures and propose a new measure, named "effective sample size", to solve this problem. We show that our new measure can be bounded without any knowledge of the data being mined, and discuss when the bound can be met. On the privacy protection side, we identify a tacit assumption made by previous measures and show that the assumption is unrealistic in many situations. To solve the problem, we introduce a game theoretic framework for the measurement of privacy.

Most existing data-mining algorithms assume that the database is static, and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new data. While there are many efficient mining techniques for data additions to databases, in this paper, we propose a decremental algorithm for pattern discovery when data is being deleted from databases. We conduct extensive experiments for evaluating this approach, and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can well model and capture useful interactions within data when the data is decreasing.

Based on the results of [1], [2] and [3], this paper uses rough set theory to mine rules in ordered information table. Compared with traditional rough set theory based methods, applications in ordered information table deal with ordering objects instead of classifying them, in which objects are ordered both by descriptive and overall attributes, and rules to be mined are actually the association between them. In order to mine rules of such form, this paper generalizes rough set theory under the core relation in ordered information table----partial order. Subsequent experiments show that efficiency of the method in this paper is higher than that of previous approaches.

Common practices include data cleansing, error detection and classifier ensembling. The essential goal is to reduce noise impacts and enhance the learners built from the noise corrupted data, so as to benefit further data mining procedures. In this paper, we present a novel framework that unifies error detection, correction and data cleansing to build an aggressive classifier ensemble for effective learning from noisy data. Being aggressive, the classifier ensemble is built from the data that has been preprocessed by the data cleansing and correcting techniques. Experimental comparisons will demonstrate that such an aggressive classifier ensemble is superior to the model built from the original noisy data, and is more reliable in enhancing the learning theory extracted from noisy data sources, in comparison with simple data correction or cleansing efforts.

In high dimensions this is typically difficult because of the computational work involved in searching over the data space. In this paper we outline a tool called PEAKER which can detect patterns efficiently in high dimensions. We approach the subject through the two aspects of pattern discovery, detection and verification. We demonstrate various ways of using PEAKER as well as its various inherent properties, emphasizing the exploratory nature of the tool.

These techniques mostly focus on normal price forecasting, not on the forecasting of price spikes. Data mining techniques have been successfully applied to forecast the value of price spikes under the condition that a spike appears. However, an effective method of predicting the occurrence of the spikes is yet to be seen. In this paper, a data mining based approach is presented to give a reliable forecast of the occurrence of price spikes. Combined with spike value prediction techniques, the proposed approach can give a comprehensive price spike forecasting. In this paper, data pre-process techniques are described to find the attributes relevant to the spikes. Then a simple introduction to the classification techniques is given for completeness. Two algorithms: support vector machine and probability classifier are chosen and discussed in detail. Actual market data are used to test the proposed model, and promising results have been obtained.

One method of computing the conditional probability is presented. We call this fuzzy model as the fuzzy inference system with probability factor (FISP). One learning process of FISP is also presented in this paper. The application of FISP in time series predication manifests that FISP is very effective.

Many clustering methods have been proposed in the last few decades with different backgrounds. An open problem in clustering field is the lack of a benchmark for contrasting all these algorithms as well as other available ones. In this paper, we use the well-known Log Marginal Likelihood (LML) score and classification accuracy as two criteria of comparison. Experiment results on K-Means, Expectation Maximization (EM) and Farthest-First in the t-test show that EM outperforms other two algorithms on most of the benchmark data sets with respect to both criteria. Considering the performance and comprehensibility of EM, it is an ideal model that could be used in many real world applications.

Moreover, a warehouse is used to collect transformers' testing data, and a multi-agent system is used to design the framework of the software. The present framework is open and flexible, so the objective system is easy to be developed and maintained. The system can support transformers' condition-based maintenance to reduce electric utility's cost. The condition or a transformer depends on its design, present and historical data relating to its installation environment, load amounts, being switched number and so on. Usually the off-line testing results, operational data, fault records and weather conditions have been stored in different systems, so finding an effective method to utilize all this information for condition assessment is difficult. Therefore, a data warehouse has been used to integrate all of the above data, and some data mining techniques have been used to find the pattern and trend of the condition of a transformer. Then whether it is healthy can be determined. In order to make the system open and flexible, Open Agent Architecture (OAA) is employed to compose the multiagent system. Seven application agents are designed to evaluate transformers' conditions synthetically. The Grey correlation method, grey theory prediction model GM(1,1), Bayesian network classifier and Bayesian network are employed in the agents.

A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Two types of the similarity join are wellknown, the distance range join, in which the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest pair query or k-distance join, which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we propose an important, third similarity join operation called the k-nearest neighbour join, which combines each point of one point set with its k nearest neighbours in the other set. We discover that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbour classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining, etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. We propose a new algorithm to compute the k-nearest neighbour join using the multipage index (MuX), a specialised index structure for the similarity join. To reduce both CPU and I/O costs, we develop optimal loading and processing strategies.

A strong feature of FCA is its capability of producing graphical visualizations of the inherent structures among data. High-risk systems have some special characteristics that result in inevitable accidents. This research utilizes FCA to investigate vessel accidents on the lower Mississippi river. FCA identifies the concepts that are vital indicators of a special type of accident, a collision. It is possible to analyze navigation environments and thereby gain a better understanding of these accidents. Such accidents may not be completely eliminated, though it is beneficial to identify when they were most likely to occur and take appropriate control measures. Furthermore, identification of the most dangerous environments might suggest specific safety regimens and regulatory control designs. The FCA suggests three groups of policy decisions, representing a series of increasingly dangerous situations for vessel traffic in a treacherous inland waterway. The three groups are made of: two sets of "cautionary" conditions, three sets of "serious" conditions, and one set for "prohibitive" action, respectively. The FCA does not make decisions; it clearly identifies distinct environments that require guidelines (i.e. regimens) for safe navigation to lessen or eliminate normal or system accidents.

J	Lee, SM; Olson, DL				Lee, SM; Olson, DL			Goal programming formulations for a comparative analysis of scalar norms and ordinal vs. ratio data	INFOR			English	Article						data mining; ordinal data; scalar norms	MODELS	Goal programming has proven a valuable mathematical programming form in a number of venues. There has been a similar rapid growth in interest in data mining, where a variety of different data types are encountered. This paper applies goal programming formulations to compare relative performance of L(1), L(2), and L(infinity) norms as well as ordinal and ratio data types in a dynamic predictive environment. The models are applied to compare relative accuracy and stability in forecasting a professional athletic environment. Results confirm that ratio data provide more accurate forecasts than ordinal data. Responsiveness to error can be good and bad in prediction. Too much response to outlying events makes the predictor "nervous" and unreliable. L(1) metric models are much easier and faster to solve, but involve higher levels of ambiguity than nonlinear models. L(1) metric models also were more responsive to changes, but correspondingly tend to be more affected by unexpected outcomes.

J	Tseng, VSM; Kao, CP				Tseng, VSM; Kao, CP			An efficient approach to identifying and validating clusters in multivariate datasets with applications in gene expression analysis	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; clustering; gene expression; microarray; validation technique	PATTERNS; MICROARRAY	Gene expression data analysis has become an important topic in bioinformatics due to its wide application in the biomedical industry. Effective analysis of gene expression data is an essential part of various data mining methods, especially the clustering techniques. Various kinds of clustering methods have been proposed, yet they do not satisfy for the requirements of high efficiency, high quality and automation in the mining of gene expression data. In this paper, we propose an efficient and automatic clustering approach that is suitable for gene expression analysis. The proposed approach primarily employs similarity-matrix based clustering techniques, complemented by new heuristics for reducing the computation cost. In particular, a novel validation technique is incorporated for evaluating the quality of the discovered gene expression patterns. Because it includes empirical evaluation of different gene expression datum, the proposed approach is able perform better than other methods in terms of efficiency, Clustering quality and automation.

While some ILP systems use such transformations, relatively little is known about them or how they relate to each other. This paper describes a number of such transformations. Not all of them are novel, but there have been no studies comparing their efficacy. The main contributions of the paper are: (a) it clarifies the relationship between the transformations; (b) it contains an empirical study of what can be gained by applying the transformations; and (c) it provides some guidance on the kinds of problems that are likely to benefit from the transformations.

J	Sef, T; Gams, M				Sef, T; Gams, M			Data mining for creating accentuation rules	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								One of the important tasks in language analysis, speech synthesis, and recognition is stress assignment within words. The task is particularly difficult in languages where lexical stress can be located almost arbitrarily on every syllable in the word, such as in the Slovenian language. Although humans may pronounce very well even words they have never heard before, human experts have not been able to synthesize accurate rules for accentuation in phonetically complex languages. We have performed several experiments with different machine-learning and data-mining tools to create accentuation rules for the Slovenian language. We wanted to find out if it is possible to design better accentuation rules than the ones defined by the experts, and to test if these rules are complex or compact. The MULTEXT-East Slovene Lexicon was used for data sets, supplemented with lexical stress marks. The accuracy achieved by decision trees significantly surpassed all previous results. However, the sizes of the trees indicate that accentuation in Slovene is a very complex problem. We were not able to find a simple solution in the form of relatively compact rules using several ML and DM systems. It also indicates that creating accurate accentuation rules is a task that might require artificial intelligence (AI).

Proper sacrifices to the gods were thought to bring rewards; failure to make suitable observations were thought to lead to disaster. Today, data mining holds the promise of extracting unsuspected information from very large databases. Methods have been developed to build association rules from large data sets. Association rules indicate the strength of association of two or more data attributes. In many ways, the interest in association rules is that they offer the promise (or illusion) of casual, or at least, predictive relationships. However, association rules only calculate a joint probability; they do not express a casual relationship. If casual relationships could be discovered, it would be very useful. Our goal is to explore casuality in the data mining context.

More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology...). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information. Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers, that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper proposes to solve supervised learning problems expressed as Sat ones. This is done to take advantage of an existing environment that allows experimenting different heuristics, such as: Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm, Ant colonies, etc., in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally the best solutions are back-translated into rules that are applied to the data sets in order to verify that they really satisfy a maximum number of instances in the original learning problem..

The principle of information granules, granular computing and the machine oriented model for data mining are investigated firstly. In addition, the approach to identify the classical functional dependencies, identity dependencies and partial dependencies is discussed and some conclusions on extensional functional dependencies are obtained. The information granules are represented with bit, then the data format can be closed to the inner representations of the computer, hence, the patterns contained in the information system can be directly mined.

It is non-trivial problem due their peculiar structure, high dimensionality [6], noise, and high feature correlation; it is also the heart of many data mining applications, like clustering, classification, rule discovery and query by content. In general, similarity has been measured with the Euclidean metric, but the dimensionality curse problem remains [5]. Basically, there are four mayor techniques that have been proposed in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data [1], Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Discrete Wavelets Transform (DWT), and the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation PAA [2]. In this work we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and PAA dimensionality reduction technique as a new approach to find the similarity between seismological signals.

However, discovery of such hidden patterns has statistical meaning and may often disclose some sensitive information. As a result privacy becomes one of the prime concerns in data mining research community. Since distributed association mining discovers global association rules by combining local models from various distributed sites, breaching data privacy happens more often than it does in centralized environments. In this work we present a methodology that generates global association rules without revealing confidential inputs such as statistical properties of individual sites and yet retains high level of accuracy in resultant rules. One of the important outcomes of the proposed technique is that it reduces the overall communication costs. Performance evaluation of our proposed method shows that it reduces the communication cost significantly when we compare with some well-known distributed association rule mining algorithms. Furthermore, the global rule model generated by the proposed method is based on the exact global support of each itemsets, and hence diminished inconsistency, which indeed occurs when global models are generated from partial support count of an itemset.

To better handle the noises and fuzziness in time series data, we propose a new data mining technique to mine Fuzzy rules in the data. The fuzzy rules discovered employ fuzzy sets to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions. The resilience of fuzzy sets to noises allows the proposed approach to better handle the noises embedded in the data. Furthermore, it uses the adjusted residual as an objective measure to evaluate the interestingness of association relationships hidden in the data. The adjusted residual analysis allows the differentiation of interesting relationships from uninteresting ones without any user-specified thresholds. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we applied it to several well-known time series datasets. The experimental results showed that our approach is very promising.

Recently, they have begun to attempt to apply data mining to extract additional insights from their collections. This paper examines four areas that particularly affect data mining in the U.S. government: data quality, mathematical ways to find representative cases, methods to screen out datasets for which data mining efforts are unlikely to be successful, and estimation of risk in databases of spontaneous reports. These are non-trivial problems, but progress on any of these fronts could significantly improve the quality of data analysis for the benefit of the public.

Nevertheless, the data sets often contain clusters which are hidden in various subspaces of the original feature space. In this paper, we present a feature selection technique called SURFING (SUbspaces Relevant For clusterING) that finds all subspaces interesting for clustering and sorts them by relevance. The sorting is based on a quality criterion for the interestingness of a subspace using the k-nearest neighbor distances of the objects. As our method is more or less parameterless, it addresses the unsupervised notion of the data mining task "clustering" in a best possible way. A broad evaluation based on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that SURFING is suitable to find all relevant subspaces in high dimensional, sparse data sets and produces better results than comparative methods.

Key insights into the action and effects of a disease can be obtained by comparison of the expression of the expressed proteins in normal versus diseased tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) of peptides is a central technology for Proteomics, enabling the identification of thousands of peptides from a complex mixture. With the increasing acquisition rate of tandem mass spectrometers, there is an increasing potential to solve important biological problems by applying data-mining and machine-learning techniques to MS/MS data. These problems include (i) estimating the levels of the thousands of proteins in a tissue sample, (ii) predicting the intensity of the peaks in a mass spectrum, and (iii) explaining why different peptides from the same protein have different peak intensities. In other works, we have focussed on the first two problems. In this paper, we focus on the last problem. In particular, we try to explain why some peptides produce peaks of great intensity, while others produce peaks of low intensity, and we treat this as a classification problem. That is, we experimentally evaluate and compare a variety of discrimination methods for classifying peptides into those that produce high-intensity peaks and those that produce low-intensity peaks. The methods considered include K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Naive Bayes, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Experiments using these methods were conducted on three real-world datasets derived from tissue samples of Mouse. The methods were then evaluated using ROC curves and cross validation.

We show how a data mining system can be used by end-users in this application. Traceroute packet probing technique is used for Internet measurements. The data set is mined using neural clustering and tree classification mining functions available in IBM Intelligent Miner. We discover from the measured data sets how the round-trip times of the packets and the number of hops they pass vary with the day of the week and the time of the measurement. The decision tree model shows good accuracy of 97% and may be useful to predict Internet path performance.

With an IDB, the user/analyst performs a set of very different operations on data using a query language, powerful enough to support all the required manipulations, such as data preprocessing, pattern discovery and pattern post-processing. We provide a comparison between three query languages (MSQL, DMQL and MINE RULE) that have been proposed for descriptive rule mining and discuss their common features and differences. These query languages look like extensions of SQL. We present them using a set of examples, taken from the real practice of rule mining. In the paper we discuss also OLE DB for Data Mining and Predictive Model Markup Language, two recent proposals that like the first three query languages respectively provide native support to data mining primitives and provide a description in a standard language of statistical and data mining models.

In applied computing, theoretical elements are used only when strictly relevant to the practical problem at hand. Theory is often combined judiciously with empiricism. And increasingly, theory is most useful when cross-pollinated with ideas and methods from other fields. We will illustrate these points by describing several recent projects at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs that have heavy mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings. These projects include new algorithms for: traffic analysis; geometric layout; belief propagation in graphical models; dimensionality reduction; and shape representation. Practical applications of this work include elevator dispatch, stock cutting, error-correcting codes, data mining, and digital typography. In all cases theoretical concepts and results are used effectively to solve practical problems of commercial import.

Besides the classical sparse grid application, the numerical solution of partial differential equations, sparse grids have been used for various topics such as Fourier transform, image compression, numerical quadrature, or data mining, so far. In this paper, we summarize and assess recent results concerning the application of sparse grids to integrate functions of higher dimensionality, the focus being on the explicit and adaptive use of higher order basis polynomials.

Recent theoretical advancements show that the system can scale-up polynomially in the problem complexity and problem size given the problem is a k-DNF with certain properties. This paper addresses two major issues in XCS: (1) knowledge extraction and (2) structure identification. Knowledge extraction addresses the issue of mining problem knowledge from the final solution developed by XCS. The goal is to identify most important features in the problem and the dependencies among those features. The extracted knowledge may not only be used for further data mining, but may actually be re-fed into the system giving it further competence in solving problems in which dependent features, that is, building blocks, need to be processed effectively. This paper proposes to extract a feature dependency tree out of the developed rule-based problem representation of XCS. The investigations herein focus on Boolean function problems. The extension to nominal and real-valued features is discussed.

As a result, BI system users are transferred to a reporting system with reports, data models, dimensions and measures predefined by system designers. As a result of survey, 85% of DW projects failed to meet their intended objectives. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate BI packages into an adaptive and flexible knowledge portal by constructing an internal link and communication channel from top-level business concepts to underlying enterprise information systems (EIS). An approach of three-level ontology services is developed, which implements unified naming, directory and transport of ontology-services, and ontology mapping and query parsing among conceptual view, analytical view and physical view from user interfaces through DW to EIS. Experiments oil top of real telecom EIS shows that our solution for integrating BI presents much stronger power to support operational decision making more user-friendly and adaptively compared with those simply combining BI products presently available together.

The architecture is designed on the Model-View-Controller pattern in order to get a clear separation of the component functionalities and covers the whole process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and in Text (KDT) for the extraction of patterns starting from structured and unstructured data. When a service request comes to the system, this is received by a Controller that will call one or more Miners to provide the results. The Miners represent the Model of the system and, by using a Kernel, dynamically activate either the KDD or the KDT process, depending on the typology of the service. As View, the system makes use of the CWM standard for the representation of metadata about models and results of the mining processes. The Kernel includes two different Focuses, for the selection of structured and unstructured data. The results of the Focuses are passed to a unique Pattern Extraction step, where Web and Data Mining algorithms are collected for the analysis. Finally, an Evaluation step interprets the utility of the extracted patterns. The proposed solutions can be suited in a distributed mining environment, where a set of services are managed and made available as a means of meeting the diverse needs of the e-business world.

J	Chan, CC				Chan, CC			Learning rules from very large databases using rough multisets	TRANSACTIONS ON ROUGH SETS I	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article							SET APPROACH; SYSTEMS	This paper presents a mechanism called LERS-M for learning production rules from very large databases. It can be implemented using object-relational database systems, it can be used for distributed data mining, and it has a structure that matches well with parallel processing. LERS-M is based on rough multisets and it is formulated using relational operations with the objective to be tightly coupled with database systems. The underlying representation used by LERS-M is multiset decision tables, which are derived from information multisystems. In addition, it is shown that multiset decision tables provide a simple way to compute Dempster-Shafer's basic probability assignment functions from data sets.

This is caused by so-called 'curse of dimensionality' and the limitation of available memory. In this paper, we propose an efficient clustering method for handling of large amounts of high-dimensional data. Our clustering method provides both an efficient cell creation and a cell insertion algorithm. To achieve good retrieval performance on clusters, we also propose a filtering-based index structure using an approximation technique. We compare the performance of our clustering method with the CLIQUE method. The experimental results show that our clustering method achieves better performance on cluster construction time and retrieval time.

We propose to refine the query by adding a set of query concepts that are meant to precisely denote the user's information need. To extract the most probable query concepts, we first extract a set of features from each document using summarization, and classify the extracted features into a set of predefined categories from Yahoo!. Finally, we cluster these features into primitive (basic) concepts. For a new query, we select its most associated primitive concepts and generate all possible interpretations of the query. The most probable interpretations are chosen as query concepts and are added to the initial query during the reformulation process. Our experiments are performed on the TREC 8 collection. The experimental evaluation shows that our query concept approach is as good as current query reformulation approaches, while being particularly effective for poorly performing queries. We also show that various data mining techniques could be helpful to generate the primitive concepts more effectively.

However, building a mining system is a nontrivial task, especially for a data mining novice. In this paper, we present an online interactive data mining toolbox - OIDM, which provides three categories (classification, association analysis, and clustering) of data mining tools, and interacts with the user to facilitate his/her mining process. The interactive mining is accomplished through interviewing the user about his/her data mining task. OIDM can help the user find the appropriate mining algorithm, refine the mining process, and finally get the best mining results. To evaluate the system, the website of OIDM (2003) has been released. The feedback is positive. Both students and senior researchers found that OIDM would be useful in conducting data mining research.

Many approaches have been proposed to extract information, and one of the most important ones is finding frequent patterns in databases. Although much work has been done to this problem, to the best of our knowledge, no previous research studies how to find frequent DAG (directed acyclic graph) patterns from DAG data. Without such a mining method, the knowledge cannot be discovered from the databases storing DAG data such as family genealogy profiles, product structures, XML documents and course structures. Therefore, a solution method containing four stages is proposed in this paper to discover frequent DAG patterns from DAG databases.

In this paper, we present a new type of incremental clustering algorithm, which is based, on the swarm intelligence theory. The new type of incremental clustering algorithm implements the clustering process by the actions of clustering agents. The clustering agents, which move in a three-dimensional space, have the. abilities of memory, communication, analysis, judgment, coordination and soon. This new type of incremental clustering algorithm is applicable in periodically incremental environment. Experimental results have shown that this algorithm has many merits such as insensitivity to the order of the data, capability of dealing with the exceptional, high-dimensional and complicated data.

To address these challenges, we seek learning techniques and models that are robust to noise and can adapt to changes in timely fashion. In this paper, we approach the stream-mining problem using a statistical estimation framework, and propose a discriminative model for fast mining of noisy data streams. We build an ensemble of classifiers to achieve adaptation by weighting classifiers in a way that maximizes the likelihood of the data. We further employ robust statistical techniques to alleviate the problem of noise sensitivity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this new discriminative model.

A case-based reasoning system has been developed for identifying critical situations in business processes. The CBR system can be used to categorize the necessities for the Acquisition, Transfer and Updating of Knowledge of the different departments of a firm. This technique is used as a tool to develop a part of a Global and Integral Model of Business Management, which brings about a global improvement in the firm, adding value, flexibility and competitiveness. From this perspective, the data mining model tries to generalize the hypothesis of organizational survival and competitiveness, so that the organization that is able to identify, strengthen, and use key knowledge will reach a pole position. This case-based reasoning system incorporates a novel artificial neural architecture called Beta-Cooperative Learning in order to categorize the necessities for the Acquisition, Transfer and Updating of Knowledge of the different departments of a firm. This architecture is used to retrieve the most similar cases to a given subject.

Problems with current common practice Centre around the obtrusive and rigid nature of this process. These include the length, timing and location of the diagnostic recording session, transfer of data to clinical staff, liaison between clinical staff and subjects and the integration of such diagnostic check-ups into the overall health care process. We have designed a modular diagnostic monitor that is centered around a wearable computer system which, when integrated into a suitable computer network and database architecture, is capable of addressing the above problems. The system is modular allowing researchers and practitioners to utilise various sensor modules, reconfigure the unit in terms of its on-board storage and wireless telemetry capabilities, select the appropriate level of data preprocessing (before archiving data) and choose the appropriate level and nature of feedback to the subject. The system is GRID enabled, supporting e-clinical-trials. GRID clients can display live data, historical data, or perform data mining.

Due to its computing-intensive nature, these applications are natural candidates for execution on high performance, high throughput platforms such as PC clusters and computational grids. Many data mining algorithms can be implemented as bag-of-tasks (BoT) applications, i.e., parallel applications composed of independent tasks. This paper discusses the use of computing grids for the execution of DM algorithms as BoT applications, investigates the scalability of the execution of an application and proposes an approach to improve its scalability.

The approach is inductive and the models have to be predictive and executable. The data is gathered through the online logistical benchmarking tool Webscan. This tool has been set up last year and is aimed to SME's to measure their logistical performances. At the very moment we limited our research to build decision trees using the c4.5 programs from Quinlan. C4.5 is based on the Information Theory and the algorithm uses the Gain criterion i.e. the attribute with the highest information gain is selected. In order to meet the key requirements for this inductive approach the benchmarking data has been transformed and restructured. A decision tree is built by decision nodes, branches and leafs. As a result the branches and the decision nodes produce the required knowledge expressed by the leafs, i.e. branches and nodes indicate which best practices to apply in order to become Best-in-Class in one particular part of the supply chain.

However, data mining for high level concepts is more complex because the search space is generally too big. Some data mining systems require the database to be pre-generalized to reduce the space, what makes difficult to discover knowledge at arbitrary levels of abstraction. To efficiently induce high-level rules at different levels of generality, without pre-generalizing databases, fast access to concept hierarchies and fast query evaluation methods are needed. This work presents the NETUNO-HC system that performs induction of classification rules using concept hierarchies for the attributes values of a relational database, without pre-generalizing them or even using another tool to represent the hierarchies. It is showed how the abstraction level of the discovered rules can be affected by the adopted search strategy and by the relevance measures considered during the data mining step. Moreover, it is demonstrated by a series of experiments that the NETUNO-HC system shows efficiency in the data mining process, due to the implementation of the following techniques: (i) a SQL primitive to efficient execute the databases queries using hierarchies; (ii) the construction and encoding of numerical hierarchies; (iii) the use of Beam Search strategy, and (iv) the indexing and encoding of rules in a hash table in order to avoid mining discovered rules.

Many classical machine learning methods may result inadequate in this scenario because they seldom allow to make use of all the knowledge that we might have at hand. Visualization techniques, that have been used for a long time for data visualization, can also be used to visualize certain forms of knowledge, resulting in a more efficient data mining process. In this paper we present a unifying approach for knowledge visualization based on dimension reduction (DR) that allows to represent rules, cases, models and correlations on a low-dimensional visualization space in a consistent way.

Inductive Queries (IQs) are used to access, generate and manipulate the patterns in the IDB. IQs are conjunctions of primitive constraints that have to be satisfied by target patterns: they can be different for different types of patterns. Constraint-based data mining algorithms are used to answer IQs. So far, mostly the problem of mining frequent patterns has been considered in the framework of IDBs: the types of patterns considered include frequent itemsets, episodes, Datalog queries, sequences, and molecular fragments. Here we consider the problem of constraint-based mining for predictive models, where the data mining task is regression and the models are polynomial equations. More specifically, we first define the pattern domain of polynomial equations. We then present a complete and a heuristic solver for this domain. We evaluate the use of the heuristic solver on standard regression problems and illustrate its use on a toy problem of reconstructing a biochemical reaction network.

PubMiner utilize natural language processing and machine learning based data mining techniques for mining useful biological information such as protein-protein interaction from the massive literature data. The system recognizes biological terms such as gene, protein, and enzymes and extracts their interactions described in the document through natural language analysis. The extracted interactions are further analyzed with a set of features of each entity which were constructed from the related public databases to infer more interactions from the original interactions. An inferred interaction from the interaction analysis and native interaction are provided to the user with the link of literature sources. The evaluation of system performance proceeded with the protein interaction data of S.cerevisiae (bakers yeast) from MIPS and SGD.

The approach involves validation and elimination of irrelevant data, extensive data pre-processing, data visualization, exploratory clustering, pattern recognition and model summarization. We have evaluated our method using data from microarray experiments in a Hepatitis C Virus transgenic mouse model. We demonstrate that from a total of 15311 genes (attributes) we can generate simple models and identify a small number of genes that can be used for future classifications. The approach has potential for future disease classification, diagnostic and virology applications.

We pioneered this work while at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, initially for color fused night vision (low-light visible and uncooled thermal imagery) and later extended it to multispectral IR and 3D ladar. We also developed a proof-of-concept system for EO, K SAR fusion and mining. Over the last year we have generalized this approach and developed a user-friendly system integrated into a COTS exploitation environment known as ERDAS Imagine. In this paper, we will summarize the approach and the neural networks used, and demonstrate fusion and interactive mining (i.e., target learning and search) of low-light Visible/SWIR/MWIR/LWIR night imagery, and IKONOS multispectral. and high-resolution panchromatic imagery. In addition, we will demonstrate how target learning and search can be enabled over extended operating conditions by allowing training over multiple scenes. This will be illustrated for the detection of small boats in coastal waters using fused Visible/MWIR/LWIR imagery.

In this paper, a reduction-based algorithm for helping us to check the mistakes hidden in inconsistent examples is presented, i.e., firstly, through reduction to eliminate the attributes which have no relation to the inconsistencies and leave behind the ones which have some relations to the inconsistencies; secondly, to examine whether there are some mistakes of the core attribute values of the inconsistent examples in the reduction; finally, to examine the non-core attribute values of the inconsistent examples. When the amount of the inconsistent examples is large, the algorithm is especially necessary. In addition, a SVM based algorithm is presented for eliminating the inconsistent examples in which there are mistakes. Using SVM, trains the consistent examples first, then test the inconsistent examples, and leaves behind the inconsistent examples that fall into the test class, and eliminates the inconsistent examples that do not belong to the test class.

Several approaches have been proposed to tackle the challenges of limited capabilities for small devices that generate or receive data streams. These approaches try to approximate the mining results with acceptable accuracy and efficiency in space and time complexity. However these approaches are not resource-aware. In this paper, a thorough discussion about the state of the art of mining data streams is presented followed by a formalization of our Algorithm Output Granularity (AOG) approach in mining data streams. The incorporation of AOG within a generic ubiquitous data mining system architecture is shown and discussed. The industrial applications of AOG-based mining techniques are given and discussed.

Association has been applied in knowledge discovery and classification in predictive tasks. Recent studies have shown that knowledge discovery algorithms can be successfully used for prediction in classification problems. The improvement of association rules algorithms is the subject of many works in the literature, whereas little research has been done concerning their classification aspect. On the other hand, methods for solving the problems of the association rules must be tailored to the particularities of the application domain. This work deals with the predictive use of association rules and addresses the problem of reducing the number of rules generated in the software project management field. We propose an algorithm for refining association rules based on incremental knowledge discovery. It provides managers with strong rules for decision making without need of domain knowledge.

This paper presents a case study where Web and Text mining techniques were used to add semantics to data that is stored in transactional databases of retailers. In many domains, semantic information is implicitly available and can be extracted automatically to improve data mining systems. This is a case study of a system that is trained to extract semantic features for apparel products and populate a knowledge base with these products and features. We show that semantic features of these items can be successfully extracted by applying text learning techniques to the descriptions obtained from websites of retailers. We also describe several applications of such a knowledge base of product semantics that we have built including recommender systems and competitive intelligence tools and provide evidence that our approach can successfully build a knowledge base with accurate facts which can then be used to create profiles of individual customers, groups of customers, or entire retail stores.

We adopt the notion of user-defined aggregate to model typical data mining tasks as operations unveiling unseen knowledge. We illustrate the use of aggregates to model specific data mining tasks, such as frequent pattern discovery, classification, data discretization and clustering, and show how the resulting data mining query language allows the modeling of typical steps of the knowledge discovery process, that range from data preparation to knowledge extraction and evaluation.

We propose a novel technique for obtaining knowledge - by, way of a data mining model from a data grid, while ensuring that the privacy is cryptographically secure. To the best of our knowledge, all previous approaches for solving this problem fail in the presence of malicious participants. In this paper we present an algorithm which, in addition to being secure against malicious members, is asynchronous, involves no global communication patterns, and dynamically adjusts to new data or newly added resources. As far as we know this is the first privacy-preserving data mining algorithm to possess these features in the presence Of Malicious participants. Simulations of thousands of resources prove that our algorithm quickly converges to the correct result. The simulations also prove that the effect of the privacy parameter on the convergence time is logarithmic.

This paper presents a tool designed and implemented in MatLab(TM) to facilitate visual mining of a large set of macroeconomics data on the world import and export activity of seven countries, in order to extend an analysis already performed with the aim of building models of national specialization and identifying possible market outlets. A model of the "market" is built, by using a Multilayer Perceptron; then it is fed to a graphical interface which supports queries such as: can country X expand towards country Y in one particular sector? Answer messages point out, for the selected countries, sectors in which the market could be expanded, and for what specific products. As an aid to making sense of a given suggestion, a detailed market analysis can be carried out by resorting to a set of tabular and graphical views that are able to map the productive structure of each country and also the dynamics of its evolution through the years. The advantages of MatLab(TM) as a development environment are pointed out. It is argued that the additional effort for developing ad-hoc task oriented interfaces is especially justified in the case of frequent and interactive mining to be performed by decision makers.

In which an important issue but remains underdeveloped is to reveal and handle the uncertainties in spatial data mining.. In this paper, uncertainty of spatial data is briefly analyzed firstly, including the types and origins of uncertainty, their models of measurement and propagation. Then, some uncertainty factors in operation of spatial data mining are discussed and some uncertainty handling methods are adopted, including Maximum Variance data discretization and fuzzy belief function. Finally, we think the process of spatial data mining can be regarded as a complex system, a linear serial processing system in engineering control systems. An uncertainty propagation model of spatial data mining - fuzzy logic uncertainty propagation model with Creditability factor is developed. Moreover, several key problems about uncertainty handling and propagation in spatial data mining are put forward.

However, most existing methods are designed for mining outliers from a single dataset without considering the class labels of data objects. In this paper, we consider the class outlier detection problem, i.e., "given a set of observations with class labels, find those that arouse suspicions, taking into account the class labels." By generalizing two pioneering contributions in this field, we propose the notion of class outliers and practical solutions by extending existing outlier detection algorithms to detect class outliers. Furthermore, its potential applications in CRM (customer relationship management) are discussed. The experiments on real datasets have shown that our method can find interesting outliers and can be used in practice.

All the coverage rules gathered together can cover all the given training examples. Unknown values are first assumed to be any possible values and are gradually refined according to the incomplete lower and upper approximations derived from the given incomplete training examples. One of the best equivalence classes in incomplete lower or upper approximations is chosen according to some criteria. The objects covered by the incomplete equivalence class are then removed from the incomplete training set. The same procedure is repeated to find the coverage set of rules. The training examples and the approximations then interact on each other to find the maximally general coverage rules and to estimate appropriate unknown values. The rules derived can then be used to build a prototype knowledge base.

If it were possible to identify the subset of the data that collectively expresses a strong signal, then one would have a robust tool for uncovering structure in problematic datasets. This paper describes a search strategy for finding large subsets of data with strong signals. The methodology is illustrated for problems in regression. This work is part of a year-long program in statistical data mining that has been organized by SAMSI, the new National Science Foundation center for research at the interface of statistics and applied mathematics.

In this paper we present an ontology-based scalable and portable information extraction system to automatically extract biological knowledge from huge collection of online biomedical web documents. Our method integrates ontology-based semantic tagging, information extraction and data mining together, automatically learns the patterns based on a few user seed tuples, and then extract new tuples from the biomedical web documents based on the discovered patterns. A novel system SPIE (Scalable and Portable Information Extraction) is implemented and tested on the PuBMed to find the chromatin protein-protein interaction and the experimental results indicate our approach is very effective in extracting biological knowledge from huge collection of biomedical web documents.

Those fuzzy systems are designed in a heuristic manner using rule selection criteria. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy rule-based classification. Next we describe heuristic rule selection criteria using the terminology in data mining: confidence and support. A small number of fuzzy rules are extracted from numerical data based on each rule selection criterion. Then we examine the classification performance of extracted fuzzy rules through computational experiments on a number of benchmark data sets from the UCI ML Repository. Our results should be viewed as the lowest benchmark performance of fuzzy rule-based classification systems because fuzzy rules are extracted using a simple heuristic method with no optimization or tuning L, procedures. Nevertheless our results on some data sets are comparable to reported results by the C4.5 algorithm in the literature.

J	Jamil, HM				Jamil, HM			Declarative data mining using SQL3	DATABASE SUPPORT FOR DATA MINING APPLICATIONS: DISCOVERING KNOWLEDGE WITH INDUCTIVE QUERIES	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article							ASSOCIATION RULES	Researchers convincingly argue that the ability to declaratively mine and analyze relational databases using SQL for decision support is a critical requirement for the success of the acclaimed data mining technology. Although there have been several encouraging attempts at developing methods for data mining using SQL, simplicity and efficiency still remain significant impediments for further development. In this article, we propose a significantly new approach and show that any object relational database can be mined for association rules without any restructuring or preprocessing using only basic SQL3 constructs and functions, and hence no additional machineries are necessary. In particular, we show that the cost of computing association rules for a given database does not depend on support and confidence thresholds. More precisely, the set of large items can be computed using one simple join query and an aggregation once the set of all possible meets (least fixpoint) of item set patterns in the input table is known. We believe that this is an encouraging discovery especially compared to the well known SQL based methods in the literature. Finally, we capture the functionality of our proposed mining method in a mine by SQL3 operator for general use in any relational database.

In this paper we first investigate the architecture Of a B2C portal from the viewpoint of conceptual levels of WI. Aiming at data mining of knowledge-level in a B2C portal, we present a new improved learning algorithm of Bayesian Networks, which consists of two major contributions, namely, making the best of lower order Conditional Independence (CI) tests and accelerating search process by means of sort order for parent nodes. By a number of experiments on ALARM datasets, we find that the proposed algorithm is both more efficient and effective than others. We have applied this algorithm to a commodity recommendation system in a B2C portal. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recommendation method based on a Customer Shopping Model (CSM) produced by the new algorithm outperforms some traditional ones in rates of coverage and precision.

Existing clustering based automated methods are not satisfactory because they do not consider the optimization of the discovered membership functions. To tackle this problem, we propose Genetic Algorithms (GAs) based clustering method, which dynamically adjusts the fuzzy sets to provide maximum profit based on minimum support and confidence specified as linguistic terms. This is achieved by tuning the base values of the membership functions for each quantitative attribute in a way that maximizes the number of large itemsets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in this direction. Experimental results on 100K transactions taken from the adult database of US census in year 2000 demonstrate that the proposed clustering method exhibits good performance in terms of the number of produced large itemsets and interesting association rules.

Whenever a new type of constraint is discovered, a specialized algorithm is proposed to handle it. All of these algorithms are highly tuned to take advantage of the unique properties of their associated constraints, and so they are not very compatible with other constraints. We present a more unified view of mining constrained itemsets such that most existing algorithms can be easily extended to handle constraints for which they were not designed a-priori. We apply this technique to mining itemsets with restrictions on their variance - a problem that has been open for several years in the data mining community.

In addition, fuzzy rules allow us to effectively classify data having non-axis-parallel decision boundaries, which is difficult for the conventional attribute-based methods. In this paper, we propose an optimized fuzzy rule generation method for classification both in accuracy and comprehensibility (or rule complexity). We investigate the use of genetic algorithm to determine an optimal set of membership functions for quantitative data. In our method, for a given set of membership functions a fuzzy decision tree is constructed and its accuracy and rule complexity are evaluated, which are combined into the fitness function to be optimized. We have experimented our algorithm with several benchmark data sets. The experiment results show that our method is more efficient in performance and comprehensibility of rules compared with the existing methods including C4.5 and FID3.1.

Application of the RS-based approach offered additional valuable insights that contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between investments in IT and organizational productivity. For example, the results of this study suggest that investments in the IT Stock has a positive impact on productivity only under certain conditions, and that this impact of IT is not uniform but is conditioned both by the amount invested in the IT Stock and the investments in Non-IT Capital.

Although, many methods of ensemble creation have been proposed, there is as yet no clear picture of which method is best. In this work, we propose Bagged Voting using different subsets of the same training dataset with the concurrent usage of a voting methodology that combines a Bayesian and a decision tree algorithm. In our algorithm, voters express the degree of their preference using as confidence score the probabilities of classifiers' prediction. Next all confidence values are added for each candidate and the candidate with the highest sum wins the election. We performed a comparison of the presented ensemble with other ensembles that use either the Bayesian or the decision tree classifier as base learner and we took better accuracy in most cases.

We empirically studied the performance of the algorithms under different distance situations.

In this paper, we proposed a generic framework for spatio-temporal pattern mining in sports video. Specifically, the periodicities in sports video are identified using unsupervised clustering and data mining method. In this way sports video analysis never needs priori domain knowledge about video genres, producers or predefined models. Therefore, such framework is easier to apply to various sports than supervised learning based approaches. In this framework, a hierarchical spatial pattern clustering routine, including scene-level clustering, field-level clustering and motion pattern clustering from top to bottom, is designed to label each subshot with coherent dominant motion. Then the temporal patterns are identified from such label sequence using data mining method. These mined probabilistic patterns are presented as basic structural elements of sports video.

The key idea is to consider the similarity of a given attribute-value pair as the probability of picking randomly a value pair that is less similar than or equally similar in terms of order relations defined appropriately for data types. Similarities of attribute value pairs are then integrated into similarities between data objects using a statistical method. Applying our method in combination with distance-based clustering to real data shows the merit of our proposed method.

Calendar algebra has been studied for years to provide a formal specification for constructing temporal expressions. However, temporal requirements specified by human beings tend to be ill-defined or uncertain. To deal with such kind of uncertain information, we propose the fuzzy calendar algebra which allows users to describe desired temporal expressions easily and naturally. The operations provided reflect the way in which people reason about temporal requirements in daily life. By using the fuzzy calendar algebra, users can define complicated calendars with multiple time granularities in which different time intervals can have different weights according to their matching degrees to the specified calendar. This can help users to discover the knowledge in the time intervals that are of interest to them. We show the usefulness of the algebra by incorporating it with an incremental data miner to mine fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases.

We can take advantage of semantic clustering to enhance the performance of traditional content-based video retrieval. In this paper, text feature and color feature are first extracted directly from shots. Subsequently, a two-level hierarchical clustering structure that provides indexing scheme for retrieval is constructed by incorporating text and color features. The top level is clustered by text features while the bottom level is clustered by color features. The constructed structure is then used for the cluster-based retrieval. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated by the experimental results in retrieving and ranking similar video shots.

In such scenario, semi-supervised learning can often improve classification performance by utilizing unlabeled data for learning. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to semi-supervised learning as as an optimization of both the classification energy and cluster compactness energy in the unlabeled dataset. The resulting integer programming problem is relaxed by a semi-definite relaxation where efficient solution can be obtained. Furthermore, the spectral graph methods provide improved energy minimization via the incorporation of additional criteria. Results on UCI datasets show promising results.

Typical method requests applicants to fill a form and give each item a suitable score according to a predermed scoring table. The sum will direct a bank to determine whether the applicant is accepted. Each item's score in the scoring table is given by experts, as something of experience it is subjective and the rightness of it is unknown. Additionally, if condition changes, adjusting the scoring table is difficult. In this paper, a data mining-based approach IGCSM is introduced to solve the problem of assessing credit card applicants. It works on personal information and consumptive data. Firstly, a decision tree is constructed by ID3 algorithm. Then the tree plus its information gain of each non-leaf node are used to give an objective estimation of each attribute's classification contribution i.e. score. Experiment on real-life data shows that this method has higher correctness than the typical method and can be modified automatically when condition changes.

Sampling can significantly reduce the cost of mining, since the mining algorithms need to deal with only a small dataset compared to the original database. Especially, if data comes as a stream flowing at a faster rate than can be processed, sampling seems to be the only choice. How to sample the data and how big the sample size should be for a given error bound and confidence level are key issues for particular data mining tasks. In this paper, we derive the sufficient sample size based on central limit theorem for sampling large datasets with replacement. This approach requires smaller sample size than that based on the Chernoff bounds and is effective for association rules mining. The effectiveness of the method has been evaluated on both dense and sparse datasets.

This paper proposes an intelligent query answering technique that integrates neighborhood information and data mining rules discovered from the databases. Neighborhood systems handle the notions of close to, analogous to and approximate t, and provide the user's background information such as preference, interests, needs etc, while the knowledge rules discovered by the data mining methods have the summary, statistical or generalized information about the databases. The neighborhood information is incorporated into the query rewriting process to help the systems rewrite the original query, and data mining rules are used to help answer the queries more intelligently, effectively and efficiently.

It really demands a fast and low cost manufacture process design and improvement model. The article indicates that the core process of quality improvement is to define the relationship of KIV-KOV and to optimize. With the data warehouse and data mining techniques, this article offers the KIV-KOV based new quality improvement model, functional structure and process as well as the practical experience.

Sometimes the outliers are more interesting than the rest of the data. Outlier identification has lots of applications, such as intrusion detection, and unusual usage of credit cards or telecommunication services. In this paper, we propose a novel method for outlier identification which is based on network flow We use the well known Maximum Flow Minimum Cut theorem from graph theory to find the outliers and strong outlier groups, and evaluate the outliers by the volume of the flow This outlier detection occurs in a novel setting: to repair poor quality clusters generated by a clustering algorithm.

We shortly describe some tools implemented by the AstroNeural collaboration (Napoli-Salerno) aimed to perform complex tasks such as, for instance, unsupervised and supervised clustering and time series analysis. Two very different applications to the analysis of photometric redshifts of galaxies in the Sloan Early Data Release and to the telemetry of the TNG (telescopio nazionale Galileo) are also discussed as template cases.

A relational table is considered as a (knowledge) representation of a universe (= the set of real world entities) A pattern is said to be realizable, if there is a real world phenomenon corresponding to it. The central two issues are: Why do unrealizable data patterns appear? How could they be pruned away? For this purpose, the semantics of the original schema are considered. In additions, semantic is included into the knowledge representation of the universe. Based on model theory, two new relational structures, functions and binary relations, are added to represent some additional semantics of the given universe. Association rule mining based on such additional semantics are considered.

The RSASM algorithm is introduced for mining of single-dimensional association rules, which is constituted of three steps mainly. At first, generalizing database to discretize quantitative attributes and decrease quantity of data. Secondly, finding candidate itemsets with the concept of equivalence class, derived from indiscernibility relation in rough set theory. Thirdly, finding frequent itemsets with multiple minimum supports. The RSASM can be expanded to multidimensional association rules mining easily. It can be seen from experiments that the mining algorithm is degant and efficient, which can obtain more rapid computing speed and sententious rules at the same time.

Only few approaches exist to deal with heterogeneous patterns, even if this is an hot topic in most data-intensive and distributed applications. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the potentiality of pattern-based management. In particular, we plan to define sufficiently expressive pattern data models and languages to cope with different types of patterns. Besides, investigation of architectural issues concerning the usage of the proposed model and languages in centralized and advanced distributed environments will be exploited.

Researchers have usually focused on extracting new knowledge from raw data, using a large number of methods and algorithms. In areas such as medicine, few of these DM systems have been widely accepted and adopted. In contrast, DM has obtained a considerable success in recent genomic research, contributing to the huge tasks of data analysis linked to the human genome project and related research. This paper presents a study of relevant past research in biomedical DM. It is proposed that traditional approaches used in medical DM should apply. some of the lessons learned in decades of research in disciplines such as epidemiology and medical statistics. In this context, novel methodologies will be needed for data analysis in the areas related to genomic medicine, where genomic and clinical data will be tightly collected and studied. Some ideas are proposed for new research design, considering those lessons learned during the last decades.

This technique allows identifying intra-transactions patterns in a database. An association rule describes how much the presence of a set of attributes in a database's record implicates in the presence of other distinct set of attributes in the same record. The possibility of discovering all the existent associations in a database transaction is the most relevant aspect of the technique. However. this characteristic determines the generation of a large number of rules. hindering the capacity of a human user in analyzing and interpreting the extracted knowledge. The use of rule measures is important to analyze the knowledge. In this context we investigate, firstly, the intensity of several objective measures to act as filters for rule sets. Next, we analyze how the combination of these measures can be used to identify, the more interesting rules. Finally, we apply the proposed technique to a rule set. to illustrate its use in the post-processing phase.

As far as concerns the Web domain, we have considered the enriched XML Web logs, that we call conceptual logs, produced by specific Web applications. These ones have been built by using a conceptual model, namely WebML, and its accompanying CASE tool, WebRatio. The Web conceptual logs integrate the usual information about user requests with meta-data concerning the Web site structure. As far as concerns the analysis of financial data, we have considered the trade stock exchange index Dow Jones and studied its component stocks from 1997 to 2002 using the so-called technical analysis. Technical analysis consists in the identification of the relevant (graphical) patterns that occur in the plot of evolution of a stock quote as time proceeds, often adopting different time granularities. On the plots the correlations between distinctive variables of the stocks quote are pointed out, such as the quote trend, the percentage variation and the volume of the stocks exchanged. In particular we adopted candle-sticks, a figurative pattern representing in a condensed diagram the evolution of the stock quotes in a daily stock exchange. In technical analysis, candle-sticks have been frequently used by practitioners to predict the trend of the stocks quotes in the market. We then apply a data mining language, namely MINE RULE, to these data in order to identify different types of patterns. As far as Web data is concerned, recurrent navigation paths, page contents most frequently visited, and anomalies such as intrusion attempts or a harmful usage of the resources are among the most important patterns. As far as concerns the financial domain, we searched for the sets of stocks which frequently exhibited a positive daily exchange in the same days, so as to constitute a collection of quotes for the constitution of the customers' portfolio, or the candle-sticks frequently associated to certain stocks, or finally the most similar stocks, in the sense that they mostly presented in the same dates the same typology of candle-stick, that is the same behaviour in time. The purpose of this paper is to show that the exploitation of the nuggets of information embedded in the data and of the specialised mining constructs provided by the query languages, enables the rapid customization of the mining procedures following to the users' need. Given our experience, we also claim that the use of queries in advanced languages, as opposed to ad-hoc heuristics, eases the specification and the discovery of a large spectrum of patterns.

Since web-based educational systems collect vast amounts of student profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships between attributes of students, assessments, and the solution strategies adopted by students. This paper focuses on the discovery of interesting contrast rules, which are sets of conjunctive rules describing interesting characteristics of different segments of a population. In the context of webbased educational systems, contrast rules help to identify attributes characterizing patterns of performance disparity between various groups of students. We propose a general formulation of contrast rules as well as a framework for finding such patterns. We apply this technique to an online educational system developed at Michigan State University, called LOA-CAPA.

As the problem of finding the nearest neighbour of an unknown sample is also of interest in other scientific communities (very large databases, data mining, computational geometry, ...), a vast number of fast nearest neighbour search algorithms have been developed during the last years. In order to improve classification rates, the k-NN rule is often used instead of the NN rule, but it yields higher classification times. In this work we introduce a new classification rule applicable to many of those algorithms in order to obtain classification rates better than those of the nearest neighbour (similar to those of the k-NN rule) without significantly increasing classification time.

Users issue series of similar queries until they receive satisfying results, yet currently available data mining systems do not support iterative processing of data mining queries and do not allow to re-use the results of previous queries. Consequently, mining algorithms suffer from long processing times, which are unacceptable from the point of view of interactive data mining. On the other hand, the results of consecutive data mining queries are usually very similar. This observation leads to the idea of reusing materialized results of previous data mining queries. We present the notion of a materialized data mining view and we propose two novel algorithms which aim at efficient discovery of association rules in the presence of materialized results of previous data mining queries.

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a well known Exploratory Data Analysis family of techniques that produce one display on which inter-object similarity relationships are preserved. The algorithm scales with the square of the number of visualized data, which limits its application to small datasets. In order to alleviate this limitation, we associate MDS with three different clustering models, namely the Learning Vector Quantization, the k-means and the dendrograins. We propose to perform dimensionality reduction on a reduced set of cluster centers, to which the data are added using a relative MDS mapping. Our experiments show that this approach allows to obtain displays of large datasets with fairly good visualization properties, when compared with the display obtained by a direct mapping of the whole dataset.

We investigate a method for mining fragments which consists of three phases: first, a preprocessing phase for turning molecular databases into graph databases; second, the GASTON frequent graph mining phase for mining frequent paths, free trees and cyclic graphs; and third, a postprocessing phase in which redundant frequent fragments are removed. We will devote most of our attention to the frequent graph mining phase, as this phase is computationally the most demanding, but will also look at the other phases.

The basic data mining algorithms of decision tree, regression-based, and neural network models are considered, using both categorical and continuous data. Two of the data sets have binary outcomes, while the third has a set of four possible outcomes. Key findings are that when the data is highly unbalanced, algorithms tend to degenerate by assigning all cases to the most common outcome. When data is balanced, accuracy rates tend to decline. If data is balanced, that reduces the training set size, and can lead to the degeneracy of model failure through omission of cases encountered in the test set. Decision tree algorithms were found to be the most robust with respect to the degree of balancing applied.

A given job can only be started if all its input files are preloaded into a disk cache. Examples of applications where Multi-File caching may be required are scientific data mining, bit-sliced indexes, and analysis of sets of vertically partitioned files. The difference between this type of caching and traditional file caching systems is that in this environment, caching and replacement decisions are made based on "combinations of files (file bundles)," rather than single files. In this work we propose new algorithms for Multi-File caching and analyze their performance. Extensive simulations are presented to establish the effectiveness of the Multi-File caching algorithm in terms of job response time and job queue length.

Our aim was two-fold. First, to compare the performance of models built using the above-mentioned techniques and, second, to analyze the characteristics of the input sensitivity in order to better understand the relationship between the performance evaluation process and the actual performance and in this way help improve the performance of call centers.

In routine learning, already recognized contexts are utilized in modeling the user behavior. The methodology is presented via a use case scenario. Data collected from various ubiquitous sensors are used in recognizing and defining contexts, and association rules determine the routines. The focus is on testing the suitability of the Apriori algorithm for this application area. Several useful routines were derived from the user data, and the results show that data mining can be utilized in pervasive computing.

J	Rodas-Osollo, J				Rodas-Osollo, J			Knowledge discovery in repeated and very short serial measures with a blocking factor	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; Serial Measures; data mining; Ill-structured domains		A new KDD methodology specially designed to analyze repeated very short serial measures called Knowledge Discovery in Serial Measures (KDSM) is introduced. In domains where serial measures are repeated and very short (i.e., very few parameters), traditional methods for series analysis are inappropriate. Moreover, some information is non-serial but is closely connected to serial measures. For this reason, it is necessary to find a suitable way of analyzing these situations. Such an objective is reached with the use of KDSM. The use of KDSM yielded some very interesting results in each of the domains where it was applied (e.g., psychiatry and labor domain). The analysis of these case studies' data with Artificial Intelligence techniques or Statistics in isolation would never have provided such relevant results. While analyzing problems inherent in domains related to the context of serial measures, we found that according to most experts in these domains, it is practically impossible to obtain significant results by using isolated methods or techniques due to the singular structure of these domains. Moreover, if it were possible to obtain some results, they might well be too difficult to be interpreted by the experts. Thus, the main goal of this thesis work is to overcome the limitations of Artificial Intelligence or Statistics techniques. A hybrid methodology which uses the best combination of other more simple techniques, thus facilitating the study of this kind of domains, was chosen.

Knowledge may be provided from many diverse sources including electronic sources such as knowledge-based diagnostic or decision support systems or through data mining techniques. As the decision maker becomes more dependent on these electronic information sources, detecting deceptive information from these sources becomes vital to making a correct, or at least more informed, decision. This applies to unintentional disinformation as well as intentional misinformation. Our ongoing research focuses on employing models of deception and deception detection from the fields of psychology and cognitive science to these systems as well as implementing deception detection algorithms for probabilistic intelligent systems. The deception detection algorithms are used to detect, classify and correct attempts at deception. Algorithms for detecting unexpected information rely upon a prediction algorithm from the collaborative filtering domain to predict agent responses in a multi-agent system.

We gather a series of interesting facts and relationships using a variety of data mining techniques. In particular, we concentrate on attributes relevant to the user ratings of movies, such as discovering if big-budget films are more popular than their low budget counterparts, if any relationship between movies produced during the "golden age" (i.e. Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, etc.) can be proved, and whether any particular actors or actresses are likely to help a movie to succeed. The paper also reports on the techniques used, giving their implementation and usefulness. We have found that the IMDb is difficult to perform data mining upon, due to the format of the source data. We also found some interesting facts, such as the budget of a film is no indication of how well-rated it will be, there is a downward trend in the quality of films over time, and the director and actors/actresses involved in a film are the most important factors to its success or lack thereof. The data used in this paper is not freely distributable, but remains copyright to the Internet Movie Database inc. It is used here within the terms of their copying policy.

We show how traditional clustering and classification methods, which usually operate on vector representations of data, can be extended to work with graph-based data. Specifically, we give graph-theoretic extensions of the k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm and the k-means clustering algorithm that process graphs, and show how the retention of structural information can lead to improved performance over the case of the vector model approach. We introduce several different types of web document representations that utilize graphs and compare their performance for clustering and classification.

We propose a unique approach for obtaining knowledge - by way of a data mining model - from a Data Grid, while ensuring that the data is cryptographically safe. This is made possible by an innovative, yet natural generalization for the accepted trusted third party model and a new privacy-preserving data mining algorithm that is suitable for Grid-scale systems. The algorithm is asynchronous, involves no global communication patterns, and dynamically adjusts to changes in the data or to the failure and recovery of resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving mining algorithm to possess these features. Simulations of thousands of resources prove that our algorithm quickly converges to the correct result while using reasonable communication. The simulations also prove that the effect of the privacy parameter on both the convergence time and the number of messages, is logarithmic.

However, the number of discovered rules is often so large, so the user cannot analyze all discovered rules. To overcome that problem several methods for mining interesting rules only have been proposed. Many measures have been proposed in literature to determine the interestingness of the rule. In this paper we have selected a total of eight different measures, we have compared these measures by using a data set, and we have made some recommendation about the use of the measures for discovering the most interesting rules.

These parameters permit quantitative comparisons across imaging studies (as opposed to raw image intensity values) and are important markers of neurological diseases. The development includes fast sequences to generate three parameters (T1: spin-lattice relaxation, T2: spin-spin relaxation, and Diffusion Tensor) covering the whole brain with isotropic and high-resolution images. The analysis of raw data to generate the parametric images is followed by registration algorithms to bring the image studies acquired on normal subjects aligned to a common frame of reference. The registration method includes both linear and non-linear algorithms. Two atlas schemes are discussed: an average atlas and a probabilistic atlas. Initial results on sequence development and registration are presented. The atlases are envisaged as an integral part of an imaging informatics infrastructure that enables image analysis across imaging studies to perform automated image data mining.

The rough set theory is a well-understood formal framework for building data mining models in the form of logic rules, on the basis of which it is possible to issue predictions that allow classifying new cases. The indiscernibility relation and approximations based on this relation form the mathematical basis of the rough set theory. The classical topological definitions of rough approximations are based on the indiscernibility relation. Unlike the classical approaches, in this paper we define rough approximations in an algebraic way. We use a set of predicates and predicate operations, which we call the approximation language. We introduce the terms "exact upper approximation" and "exact lower approximation" to stress the fact that there can exist a variety of approximations but it is always possible to select the approximations that cannot be improved in the terms of the approximation language. These new definitions are compared to the classical ones (which use an equivalence relation) and are shown to be more general in the sense that the classical definitions can be deduced from them if we put some restrictions on our model. The process of generating logic rules based on the exact approximations has also been considered. Logic rules are naturally obtained from predicate formulae for the exact approximations. The introduced approach allows generating logic rules quickly and efficiently since only Boolean operations with binary strings are used to produce logic formulae.

For example, 1) The next generation Internet; 2) Real-time clinical decision support systems; 3) Off-line, population-based systems; 4) Large, integrated, individual patient-level phenotypic and genotypic databases with intelligent data mining capabilities; 5) Wireless, invasive and non-invasive physiologic monitoring devices; 6) Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems; and 7) Mathematical models of complex biological systems have the potential to impact significantly the future healthcare delivery system. While new information management and communication techniques and technologies will reduce many of the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of our present systems, there will be an equal, and potentially far more dangerous, set of unintended consequences. Informatics investigators and health system administrators must focus on the study of what is working and what is not, as well as, on development and testing of the new clinical information management and communication technologies, if we are to be ready for the future.

A genetic program is an algorithm that evolves other algorithms or mathematical expressions. Methods of accelerating convergence of the data mining procedure including a new innovation based on computer algebra are examined. Experimental results related to using computer algebra are given. A comparison between a tree obtained using a genetic program and one constructed solely by interviewing experts is made. A genetic program evolved tree is shown to be superior to one created by hand using expertise alone. Finally, additional methods that have been used to validate the data mining algorithm are discussed.

The data were collected as part of the Shipboard Automatic Liquid (Chemical) Agent Detection (SALAD) system. This system is designed to detect chemical agents onboard naval vessels. We explore the intricacies associated with the construction of various classification systems. Along the way we take time to explore some applications of recently developed statistical procedures in visualization and density estimation to this discriminant analysis problem. We focus our discussion on all phases of the discriminant analysis problem. In the exploratory data analysis phase we provide results that detail the use of histograms, scatter plots and parallel coordinate plots for the selection of feature subsets that are fortuitous to the discriminant analysis problem and the discernment of high dimensional data structure. In the discriminant analysis phase we discuss several semiparametric density estimation procedures along with classical kernel, classification and regression trees, and k-nearest-neighbors based approaches. These discussions include some illustrations of the use of a new parallel coordinates framework for the visualization of high dimensional mixture models. We close our discussions with a comparison of the performance of the various techniques through a study of the associated confusion matrices.

The vacillating nature of the stock market requires the use of data mining techniques like clustering for stock market analysis and prediction. Genetic algorithms and neural networks have the ability to handle complex data and are immune to noise in the input. In this paper, we propose an algorithm Evolutionary Approach to Self Organizing Map(EASOM) to cluster stock market data. Genetic algorithms are used to train the Kohonen network for better and effective prediction. Fuzzy logic is used to fix learning rate for faster convergence. The algorithm was tested on real stock market data of companies like Intel, General Motors, Infosys, Wipro, Microsoft, IBM, etc. The algorithm consistently outperformed regression model, backpropagation algorithm and Kohonen network in predicting the stock market values.

In our case we were challenged with the task to model the shopping behaviour of customers and the sales behaviour of items within a real supermarket store in order to forecast product sales figures on the basis of 'what-if'-scenarios. To forecast the scenarios we represent and simulate all entities of a store as holonic probabilistic agents. The knowledge bases of the agents consist of behaviour networks which are data mined from real store data. For simulation we integrate on demand global coherences in our models without loosing the level of detail. This is realised by a process where the agents merge to a so called holon. In this paper we present an algorithm to merge the agents' behaviour networks where global coherences between the behaviour of different agents evolve as an effect of emergence.

Building on the study of selective private function evaluation and the efforts towards practical algorithms for privacy-preserving data mining solutions, we analyze and implement solutions to an important primitive, that of computing statistics of selected data in a remote database in a privacy-preserving manner. We examine solutions in different scenarios ranging from a high speed communications medium, such as a LAN or highspeed Internet connection, to a decelerated communications medium to account for worst-case communication delays such as might be provided in a wireless multihop setting. Our experimental results show that in the absence of special-purpose hardware accelerators or practical optimizations, the computational complexity is the performance bottleneck of these solutions rather than the communication complexity. We also evaluate several practical optimizations to amortize the computation time and to improve the practical efficiency.

We show how our proposal of clustering organizational units based on both efficiency and input/output parameters turns out to be effective in identifying groups of similar organizational units. We also propose the replacement of an expensive efficiency measurement, based on the solution of linear programs, with a simple but more efficient formula to be exploited in the clustering process. Preliminary experimental results, obtained from an analysis of research centers in the agro-food sector, show the effectiveness of our approach.

This paper presents a dynamic load balancing for the parallel processing of Modified PrefixSpan to extract frequent patterns from the amino acid sequences on a PC cluster. The parallel Modified PrefixSpan exploits a task-based parallelism that distributes tasks among the computers on the PC cluster. We present a dynamic load balancing methodology called mastertask-steal. The master- task- steal- based dynamic load balancing minimizes idle time when the distributed workload is unbalanced on the PC cluster.

This information is stored in log files, which can contain many registers but part of them do not contain relevant information. In such cases, user behavior analysis turns out to be a complex and time-consuming task. In order to analyze Web site visits, the relevant information has to be filtered and studied in an efficient way. We introduce a generic Data Mart architecture to support advanced Web mining, which is based on a Star model and contains the relevant historical data from visits to the Web site. Its fact table contains various additive measures that support the intended data mining tasks, whereas the dimension tables store the parameters necessary for such analysis, e.g. period of analysis, range of pages within a session. This generic repository allows one to store different kinds of information derived from visits to a Web site, such as e.g. time spent on each page in a session and sequences of pages in a session. Since the Data Mart has a flexible structure that allows one to add other interesting parameters describing visitors navigation, it provides a flexible research platform for various kinds of analysis. Based on these sources, user behavior can be characterized and stored in user behavior vectors that serve as input for data mining. For example, similar visits can be grouped together and typical user behavior can be identified, which allows improvement of Web sites and an understanding of user behavior. The application of the presented methodology to the Web site of a Chilean university shows its benefits. We analyzed visits to the respective Web site and could identify clusters of typical visitors. The analysis of these clusters is used for improved online marketing activities.

The transition probabilities of the Markov chain are learned from the musical sequences from which the patterns were extracted. These transitions determine which of the extracted patterns can follow other patterns. Our pattern matching phase considers three dimensions: time, pitch, and duration. Patterns of notes are considered to be equivalent under shifts in time, the baseline note of the pattern, and multiplicative changes of duration across all notes in the pattern; We give experimental results using classical music as training sequences to show the viability of our method in composing novel musical sequences.

It has recently gained popularity as a privacy technique in data mining. To our knowledge, attacks on binary RDP have not been completely characterized, its security has not been analyzed from a complexity-theoretic or information-theoretic perspective, and there is no privacy measure of binary RDP that is related to the complexity of an attack. We characterize all inference attacks on binary RDP, and show that if it is possible to reduce estimation error indefinitely, a finite number of queries per bit of entropy is enough to do so. We define this finite number as the privacy measure of the binary RDP.

In this paper, we analyzed existing clustering algorithm and raised a new grid density clustering algorithm based on binary subspace division. Region quadtree is a type of spatial data structure based on binary division, we used this structure to 2-dimensional clustering. We also gave out the construction algorithm of region-density tree (RD-Quadtree), the region merging algorithm, and the algorithm of calculating the connect component of RD-Quadtree, then extended the algorithm to high-dimensional data space and analyzed the space and time complexity of the RD-Quadtree based clustering algorithm. We further proved that the RD-Quadtree based clustering algorithm only did grid division of the non-empty space in the high-dimensional data space. It will lower the number of the grid unit drastically and gain higher space and time efficiency.

For example, through data mining, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information or even patterns, from non-sensitive information or unclassified data. There have been two broad approaches for privacy-preserving data mining. The first approach is to alter the data before delivery to the data miner so that real values are obscured. The second approach assumes the data is distributed between two or more sites, and these sites cooperate to learn the global data mining results without revealing the data at their individual sites. Given specific rules to be hidden, many data altering techniques for hiding association, classification and clustering rules have been proposed. However, to specify hidden rules, entire data mining process needs to be executed. For some applications, we are only interested in hiding certain sensitive items. In this work, we assume that only sensitive items are given and propose two algorithms to modify data in database so that sensitive items cannot be inferred through association rules mining algorithms. Examples illustrating the proposed algorithins are given. The efficiency of the proposed approach is further compared with Dasseni etc's [9] approach. It is shown that our approach required less number of databases scanning and prune more number of hidden rules. However, our approach Must hide all rules containing the hidden items on the right hand side, where Dasseni's approach can hide specific rules.

However, most algorithms based on the frequent itemsets have to scan databases many times. This paper presents an algorithm that can find association rules quickly. The algorithm is based on the concept lattice and can certify all association rules with only one scan of databases. Firstly, this paper discusses the principle of building the concept lattice, and then it describes the association rules mining algorithm based on concept lattice. At last the paper proves the efficiency and advantages of this algorithm by several experiments.

Emerging Patterns (EPs) are itemsets whose supports change significantly from one data class to another. Previous studies have shown that classifiers based on EPs are competitive to other state-of-the-art classification systems. In this paper, we propose a new type of Emerging Patterns, called Maximal Emerging Patterns (MaxEPs), which are the longest EPs satisfying certain constraints. MaxEPs can be used to condense the vast amount of information, resulting in a significantly smaller set of high quality patterns for classification. We also develop a new "overlapping" or "intersection" based mechanism to exploit the properties of MaxEPs. Our new classifier, Classification by Maximal Emerging Patterns (CMaxEP), combines the advantages of the Bayesian approach and EP-based classifiers. The experimental results on 36 benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository demonstrate that our method has better overall classification accuracy in comparison to JEP-classifier, CBA, C5.0 and NB.

Some researchers are now focusing on the application of association rules. In this paper, we will study one of the application called Item Selection for Marketing (ISM) with cross-selling effect consideration. The problem ISM is to find a subset of items as marketing items in order to boost the sales of the store. We prove a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose an algorithm to deal with this problem. Experiments are conducted to show that the algorithms are effective and efficient.

Variation or extension of Euclidean distance is generally used. However Euclidean distance will vary much when time series is to be stretched or compressed along the time-axis. Dynamic time warping distance has been proposed to deal with this case, but its expensive computation limits its application. In this paper, a novel distance based on a new linear segmentation method of time series is proposed to avoid such drawbacks. Experiment results in this paper show that the proposed method achieves significant speedup up to about 20 times than Dynamic time warping distance without accuracy decrease.

To remedy these problems, this paper presents a novel algorithm, namely classification based on atomic association rules. Atomic rule mining generates the smallest and simplest rule set for classification. The strong atomic rules with the highest and near-highest confidences can realize partial classification accurately. Multiple passes of partial classifications generate the concise and accurate classifier. The experiments are performed on 26 standard datasets. The new approach is compared with decision tree induction and the existing associative classification. The results show that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the highest classification accuracy but also generates the smallest classification rule set; furthermore, it runs far faster than the existing associative classification algorithm.

The hard core of this framework is a data mining algorithm based on rough set theory. The decision table mining from SCADA system is expressed directly by variables in its database, it is easy for engineers to understand and apply. This makes it possible to eliminate additional test or experiments for fault diagnosis which are usually expensive and involve some risks to boilers. This approach is tested in a thermal power plant, the decision accuracy is varied from 91.6 percent to 96.7 percent in different months.

Data-mediated knowledge discovery, especially from multiple heterogeneous data resources, is a tedious process and imposes significant operational constraints on end-users. We demonstrate that autonomous, reactive and proactive intelligent agents provide an opportunity to generate end-user oriented, packaged, value-added decision-support/strategic planning services for professionals, managers and policy makers of an organization, without the need for a priori technical knowledge. Since effective progress of an organization is grounded in good communication, experience sharing, continuous learning and proactive actions, we present an Agent-based Data Mining Info-structure (ADMI) that deploys a suite of Data Mining (DM) algorithms coupled with intelligent agents to facilitate data access, DM query specification, DM algorithm selection and DM result visualisation-i.e. automated generation of data-mediated decision-support/strategic-planning services.

An auto-index selection tool capable of analyzing large amounts of data and suggesting a good set of indexes for a database is the goal of auto-administration. Clustering is a data mining technique with broad appeal and usefulness in exploratory data analysis. This idea provides a motivation to apply clustering techniques to obtain good indexes for a workload in the database. In this paper we describe a technique for auto-indexing using clustering. The experiments conducted show that the proposed technique performs better than Microsoft SQL Server Index Selection Tool (IST) and can suggest indexes faster than Microsoft's IST.

There are studies on XML query languages as well as XML algebras in literature. However, attention has not been paid to research on XML algebras for data mining due to partially the fact that there is no widely accepted definition of XML mining tasks. This paper tries to examine the XML mining tasks and provide guidelines to design XML algebras for data mining. Some summarization and comparison have been done to existing XML algebras. We argue that by adding additional operators for mining tasks, XML algebras may work well for data mining with XML documents.

Different from the existing studies, our data are derived from core routers on the Internet. Our study focuses on the three periodic peak value groups in the aggregation flow traffic, the heavy-tailed property in the distribution of traffic by different hosts and the long range dependence (LRD) in p2p traffic. Moreover we propose a novel data mining approach, ADTE to differentiate signaling and data traffic. Our study also shows that Napster dominates p2p traffic. In addition, we observe that the aggregation of p2p traffic is less than 1% of the total Internet traffic, much different from the observations in other studies. We analyze the possible reasons and wish that our conclusion could be a good guideline for the software developers.

In this paper, we discover knowledge from XML data by taking account its dynamic nature. We present a novel approach to extract pattern-based dynamic structures from versions of unordered XML documents. With the proposed dynamic metrics, the pattern-based dynamic structures are expected to summarize and predict interesting change trends of certain structures based on their past behaviors. Two types of pattern-based dynamic structures, increasing dynamic structure and decreasing dynamic structure are considered. With our proposed data model, SMH-Tree, an algorithm for mining such pattern-based dynamic structures with only two scans of the XML sequence is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract the pattern-based dynamic structures efficiently with good scalability.

The problem of cluster-grouping can be regarded as a new type of inductive optimization query that asks for the k best patterns according to a convex criterion. The algorithm CG for solving cluster-grouping problems is presented and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. The approach is experimentally evaluated on a number of real-life data sets. The results indicate that the algorithm improves upon the subgroup discovery algorithm CN2-WRAcc and is competitive with the clustering algorithm Cob Web.

Increasingly, vehicle diagnostic information is made available online to both professional repairers and vehicle owners. Traditional case-based reasoning (CBR) has been applied to fault diagnosis, but lacks efficiency in information retrieval due to the organization of data. In this paper, we present a hybrid data mining process that combines neural networks (NN) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) within the CBR cycle to effectively mine data stored in a vehicle service database, which contains past service records. The data mining process entails offline knowledge extraction and online fault diagnosis. Performance evaluation of our system confirms its advantages over traditional CBR techniques both in terms of speed and accuracy.

This simple type of rule is theoretically interesting, because it supports reasoning, similar to functional dependencies in database theory, and it may be of practical significance because the size of the set of implication rules that hold in a relation can remain substantially high even when mining real data and considering only most general covers; i.e., covers containing rules with unredundant right and left sizes. Motivated by these observations, we focus on the extraction of short-rule covers, which cannot be efficiently mined by standard rule miners. We present an algorithm driven by "negative examples" (i.e., satisfy Q but not R) to prune the rule-candidate lattice associated with each "positive example" (i.e., satisfies both Q and R). The algorithm scales up quite well with respect to the number of objects and it is particularly suitable for databases with attributes described by large domains. Furthermore, a perfect hash function ensures extraction of short-rule covers even from databases containing a large number of attributes.

The execution of a program now entails the complex interaction of code, compiler and processor architecture. The current generation of microprocessors is optimized to an existing set of commercial and scientific benchmarks but new applications such as data mining are becoming a significant part of the workload. In this paper we explore the use of performance monitoring hardware to analyze the execution of C4.5, a data mining application, on the IBM Power2 architecture. We see how the data gathered by the hardware can be used to identify potential changes that can be made to the program and the processor micro-architecture to improve performance. We then go on to evaluate changes to C4.5 and to the micro-architecture. Based on our experience, we identify issues that limit the use of performance monitoring hardware in user level tuning and in extending its use to high performance computing environments.

Intelligent Data Analysis offers the possibility of analysing this data in an automatic fashion to map characteristics, identify trends and offer guidance for conservation action. This paper is concerned with the use of techniques of Intelligent Data Analysis for an important task in animal conservation: the identification of the species and origin of illegally traded or confiscated African rhino horn. It builds on an earlier analysis by the African Rhino Specialist Group. It is demonstrated that it is possible to distinguish between both species and country of origin with a high degree of accuracy and that the results are also likely to be suitable for use in court.

An important real-world problem of this nature is motif discovery in DNA sequences. There are a number of fundamental aspects of this data mining problem that can make discovery "easy" or "hard" we characterize the difficulty of this problem using an analysis based on the Bayes error rate under a Markov assumption. The Bayes error framework demonstrates why certain patterns are much harder to discover than others. It also explains the role of different parameters such as pattern length and pattern frequency in sequential discovery. We demonstrate how the Bayes error can be used to calibrate existing discovery algorithms, providing a lower bound on achievable performance. We discuss a number of fundamental issues that characterize sequential pattern discovery in this context, present a variety of empirical results to complement and verify the theoretical analysis, and apply our methodology to real-world motif-discovery problems in computational biology.

It is based on a binary representation of data records in rows where column entries, either '1' or '0', correspond to all possible data values that tributes may take. A new group similarity index (GSI) is devised which takes into account only the positive attributes as basis for the grouping and clustering algorithm. The model is compared with standard clustering models. For the comparison we define an objective measure about two similarity factors: within-class similarity (WCS) and between-class similarity (BCS), seeking a maximum intra-goup and minimum inter-group proximity, respectively. A coefficient of variation (CV) statistic is then employed to combine the two factors into a measure of relative diversity between records and groups. When applied to a common data set our binary clustering shows significant advantages over standard clustering models.

First, we describe a data cube OLAP architecture which facilitates effective storage and processing of the state information reported by agents. This way, the action of the other agent, even not in the visual environment of the agent under consideration, can simply be estimated by extracting online association rules, a well-known data mining technique, from the constructed data cube. Then, we present a new action selection model which is also based on association rules mining. Finally, we generalize states which are not experienced sufficiently by mining multiple-levels association rules from the proposed data cube. Experiments conducted on a well-known pursuit domain show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed learning approach.

Due to the growing number of malicious usage, attacks, stealing of sensitive information and sabotage, information security has become one of the prime concerns for many governments as well as corporate organizations, the world over. There exists a constant need for improvement and innovation in detection of intrusions and adoption of efficient countermeasures against security breaches. In a new approach, this paper focuses on applying multi class support vector machine classifiers, using one-versus-one method, for anomalous as well as misuse detection to identify attacks precisely by type.

In fact, there still is a lack of consensus on the concept of FD and many efforts are done at present to forward research on this field, even from the World Health Organization (WHO). On the other hand, in the context of Data Mining it is well known that some complex Knowledge Discovery (KDD) problems require combination of several techniques coming from different research areas to be properly solved. In this work a hybrid KDD technique called clustering based on rules (ClBR) has been used to analyze a database referent to the assessment of FD by means of the WHO-DASII scale, which is a new assessment scale proposed by the WHO for validating functional disability degree. After analysis and interpretation of the results, a proposal of a new taxonomy of disabilities from a real functional point of view is presented as well as its relationship with the total score of the WHO-DASII scale.

This technique had been used in numerous practical applications, including consumer market basket analysis, inferring patterns from web page access logs, network intrusion detection and pattern discovery in biological applications. Most of the traditional association-mining algorithms assume that whole dataset can be loaded in the main memory. Hence, problem arise when such algorithms is applied in large dataset. In this paper we present a new algorithm for association mining. Our algorithm is efficient when the size of dataset is huge that cannot be load in the main memory. The proposed algorithm also reduces the frequent itemsets search space, by eliminating non-frequent 1-itemsets after the first pass. Our performance evaluation shows algorithm outperforms Apriori algorithm in different datasets.

Typical portfolio decisions like resource allocation, effort estimation and risk valuation are to be based on complex, high-dimensional software project portfolio data. Handling and understanding this vast amount of data is difficult. Classic analysis approaches-like ABC-analysis for project prioritization, or interactive data mining tools-mostly analyze specific and separate subsets of the information for a given purpose. This paper (i) applies multidimensional scaling methods for visualizing high-dimensional portfolio information, involving data from many different sources, and describes promising applications of the approach in this domain, (ii) proposes a simple method to prepare raw software metric data for MDS analysis and processing with interactive tools, and (iii) provides a feasibility study based on a small set of open-source software projects to demonstrate the usability of the proposed approach for software project portfolio decision support. The approach enhances explorative analysis of historic portfolio information, allows for interactive data analysis with intelligent tools, and thus directly supports portfolio assessment and prediction decisions.

The experiments are performed on the Forest Cover Type database, a large data set available at the UCI KDD Archive [13]. The first objective of this paper is to highlight the potential of XCS as a data mining tool. The second objective is to provide extensive benchmarking results for experiments performed under randomised conditions for several modelling techniques. We find that C5 Decision trees perform significantly better than other techniques, and that the learning classifier system performs better or as well as three of the eight classifiers used. We discuss why C5 outperforms the other classifiers and identify ways in which XCS could be adapted to make it more suitable for data mining.

With rapidly growing unauthorized activities in network, Intrusion Detection (ID) as a component of defense-in-depth is very necessary because traditional firewall techniques cannot provide complete protection against intrusion. ID is an active and important research area of network security. A survey on ID technology is shown in this paper. It is involved with several main aspects of ID technology. Analyses on intrusion detection techniques and data collection techniques are emphasized. Some novel developments in ID Systems, such as both data mining based ID Systems and data fusion based ID Systems, also are discussed Current ID technology faces some powerful challenges, some main challenges and future promising directions are presented.

In our previous research we found a new formula, similar to the original ABCD formula, that yielded fewer diagnostic errors. This new ABCD formula was developed using data mining techniques, in particular, the rule induction algorithm LEM2, a part of the data mining system LERS. In this paper we compare the quality of the old and new ABCD formulas, measured by the number of diagnostic errors, using three other data mining techniques: two rule induction algorithms, LEM1 and a modified version of LEM2 called MLEM2, and the decision tree generating system C4.5. Additionally, we compare the quality of diagnosis using TDS (original and new) and diagnosis without using TDS at all, to address complaints by some diagnosticians that TDS does not improve diagnosis of melanoma. Our experiments show that TDS is a valuable tool, significantly increasing melanoma diagnosis accuracy.

Within this paper an importance based interestingness measure is introduced that can be applied as a posterior phase. In addition three manipulative operations (balancing, boosting and inversion) are outlined operating upon results of data mining exercises to allow the interpretation of the same result from different viewpoints. The overall framework represents a novel user-driven ranking procedure, allowing measuring the interestingness of knowledge patterns utilising a combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators as well as a user driven importance or interestingness value.

One interesting approach to the distillation of such knowledge is to detect strings in DNA sequences which are very repetitive within a given sequence (eg for a particular patient) or across sequences (eg from different patients who have been classified in some way eg as sharing a particular medical diagnosis). Motifs are strings that occur relatively frequently. In this paper we present basic theory and algorithms for finding such frequent and common strings.

Because this technique in no proof of correctness, it is important to test the design as complete as possible. But this is a hard to reach goal, that needs a lot of computing power and much human , interaction. There had been a proposal for using Bayesian Networks to implement an automatic feedback loop [5]. In addition, this paper will introduce another implementation of an automatic feedback loop using Data Mining techniques. Both approaches are applied to the same design and the results will be compared.	STZ Softwaretech, Esslingen, Germany	Braun, M (reprint author), STZ Softwaretech, Esslingen, Germany.

The vertical photographs are normally collected for an overview of a disaster area or for more detailed assessment. Damage on roof.. especially for shingles torn off, is expected to be discovered in a more efficient and automatic way instead of going through the high-resolution aerial photograph for numerous details. The discovered damage patterns can then be used for hurricane damage assessment and impacts on different geographical areas. Our methodology is: (1) applying a novel and effective segmentation method on each residential house on the aerial photograph of one community, (2) using the segmentation results to obtain a set of indexing parameters for each house representing the damage level of roof cladding as well as the patterns of damage, (3) using these parameters to select several templates representing the damage patterns so that users can issue query-by-example (QBE) queries. The proposed segmentation method is an unsupervised simultaneous partition and class parameter estimation algorithm that considers the problem of segmentation as a joint estimation of the partition and class parameter variables. By utilizing this segmentation method; the indexing parameters can be obtained automatically. The QBE capability can assist in finding similar damage patterns on the roof of the residential houses in different locations in the image databases. Experiments based on the aerial photographs of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 are conducted and analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed Hurricane damage pattern mining framework.

A frequent itemset is maximal if none of its supersets is frequent. The new parallel algorithm is named Parallel Max-Miner (PMM), and it is a parallel version of the sequential Max-Miner algorithm [3]. Most of existing mining algorithms discover the frequent k-itemsets on the kth pass over the databases, and then generate the candidate (k + 1)-itemsets for the next pass. Compared to those level-wise algorithms, PMM looks ahead at each pass and prunes more candidate itemsets by checking the frequences of their supersets. We implemented PMM on a cluster of workstations, and evaluated its performance for various cases. PMM demonstrated better performance than other sequential and parallel algorithms, and its performance is quite scalable, even when there are large maximal frequent itemsets (i.e., long patterns) in databases.

This allows rapid construction of composite models - complex models built from simpler ones - such as mixture models, Bayesian networks and decision trees. We illustrate this with a flexible decision tree tool for CDMS which rather than being limited to discrete target attributes, can model any kind of data using arbitrary probability distributions.

As the volume of literature continues to grow there is a need to sort through this information in a more efficient manner. Mapping the pathways of genes and proteins of interest is one goal that requires frequent reference to the literature. Pathway databases can help here and scientists currently have a choice between buying access to externally curated pathway databases or building their own in house. However such databases are either expensive to license or slow to populate manually. Building upon easily available, open-source tools we have developed a pipeline to automate the collection, structuring and storage of gene and protein interaction data from the literature. As a team of both biologists and computer scientists we integrated our natural language processing (NLP) software with the Gene Ontology (GO) to collect and translate unstructured text data into structured interaction data. For NLP we used a machine learning approach with a rule induction program, RAPIER (http://www.cs.utexas.eduluserslmllrapier.html). RAPIER was modified to learn rules from tagged documents, and then it was trained on a corpus tagged by expert curators. The resulting rules were used to extract information from a test corpus automatically. Extracted Genes and Proteins were mapped onto Locuslink, and extracted interactions were mapped onto GO. Once information was structured in this way it was stored in a pathway database and this formal structure allowed us to perform advanced data mining and visualization..

We find that research in the constrained theoretical realm, producing "perfect" and "optimal" results, can be utilized in actual practice: producing adaptive and improved approximating models. We describe applications to such areas as the behavioral-data mining of link analysis; agent design; synthesis of behaviorally-specified business systems; and the use of modeling techniques and adaptation to detect and correct defects in practical business systems that are already deployed.

We pioneered this work while at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, initially for color fused night vision (low-light visible and uncooled thermal imagery) and later extended it to multispectral IR and 3D ladar. We also developed a proof-of-concept system for EO, K SAR fusion and mining. Over the last year we have generalized this approach and developed a user-friendly system integrated into a COTS exploitation environment known as ERDAS Imagine. In this paper, we will summarize the approach and the neural networks used, and demonstrate fusion and interactive mining (i.e., target learning and search) of low-light visible/SWIR/MWIR/LWIR night imagery, and IKONOS multispectral and high-resolution panchromatic imagery. In addition, we will demonstrate how target learning and search can be enabled over extended operating conditions by allowing training over multiple scenes. This will be illustrated for the detection of small boats in coastal waters using fused visible/MWIR/LWIR imagery.

In order to provide the research community access to our normalized microarray data as a tool to assess relative expression of genes of interest, we developed a publicly accessible online database Tomato Expression Database (TED: http://ted.bti.cornell.edu). Through this database, we provide multiple approaches to pursue analysis of specific genes of interest and/or access the larger microarray data set to identify sets of genes that may behave in a pattern of interest to the user. A set of useful data mining and data visualization tools were developed and are under continuing expansion according to user's requirements. Developed initially as a data mining and analysis resource, TED also contains comprehensive annotation of each EST including homology derived from sequence similarity searches of GenBank and GO terms assigned manually according to putative functions.

Some issues involved in the specification of a statistical model type are discussed and we show that it is beneficial to explicitly include a sufficient statistic and functions for its manipulation in the model type's specification. Instances of such types can then be used by generalized learning algorithms while maintaining optimal learning time complexity. Examples are given for problems such as incremental learning and data partitioning problems (e.g. change-point problems, decision trees and mixture models).

Previous researches have already suggested that the relationship between news articles and stock prices do exist. However all of the existing approaches are concerning in mining single time series only. The interrelationships among different stocks are not well-addressed. Mining multiple time series concurrently is not only more informative but also far more challenging. Research in such a direction is lacking. In this paper, we try to explore such an opportunity and propose a systematic framework for mining multiple time series based on Efficient Market Hypothesis.

The proposed description schema is based on the structure and the semantics of the video data and incorporates scene, camera, object, track and behavior information pertaining to a large class of video data. The database tool is designed to exploit both the hierarchical structure of video data, the clips, shots or scenes, as well as the semantic structure, such as scene geometry, camera parameters, objects and the object behaviors. VideoViews provides means for intuitive representation and navigation, interactive manipulation, ability to annotate and correlate the data in the video database, while also supporting conventional database queries. This hierarchically and semantically structured browsing tool enables users to freely navigate to perform top-down and bottom-up analysis of the video database to visualize the information and data from a number of perspectives. The VideoViews description schema and the navigation tool are designed and developed as part of a video analysis and content extraction framework devised under U.S. Government ARDA/VACE (Video Analysis and Content Extraction) project(1).

The proposed prediction models used in geo-spatial data mining are likelihood ratio and conditional probability methods. In these approaches, the prediction models and estimation procedures depend on the basic quantitative relationships of geo-spatial data sets relevant to the forest fire with respect to the selected areas of previous forest fire ignition. In order to make the prediction map for the forest fire hazardous area prediction map using the two proposed prediction methods and evaluate the performance of prediction power, we applied a FHR (Forest Fire Hazard Rate) and a PRC (Prediction Rate Curve) respectively. When the prediction power of the two proposed prediction models is compared, the likelihood ratio method is more powerful than the conditional probability method. The proposed model for prediction of the forest fire hazardous area would be helpful to increase the efficiency of forest fire management such as prevention of forest fire occurrences and effective placement of forest fire monitoring equipment and manpower.

There is a need for the increase use of automated auditing and intelligent reporting mechanisms that must support security assessment and threat management. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques for improving security management processes including tools such Intrusion Detection Systems. The paper discusses an intelligent model for cyber attack detection and prevention. The adaptive model is based on various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Expert Knowledge-based Systems, Data Mining, and Intelligent Databases as well as traditional statistical approaches. The intelligent model supports user by providing useful feedback before an attack occurred.

Specifically, we study the collections of frequent sets in clusters produced by a probabilistic clustering using mixtures of Bernoulli models. That is, we first analyze 0-1 datasets by a global technique (probabilistic clustering using the EM algorithm) and then do a local analysis (discovery of frequent sets) in each of the clusters. The results indicate that the use of clustering as a preliminary phase in finding frequent sets produces clusters that have significantly different collections of frequent sets. We also test the significance of the differences in the frequent, set collections in the different clusters by obtaining estimates of the underlying joint density. To get from the local patterns in each cluster back to distributions, we use the maximum entropy technique [17] to obtain a local model for each cluster, and then combine these local models to get a mixture model. We obtain clear improvements to the approximation quality against the use of either the mixture model or the maximum entropy model.

We first show how to use a new type of predefined bitmap join index (pre-join_bitmap_index) to efficiently execute complex decision support queries with multiple outer join operations involved and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain. Then we discuss a bitmap based association rule algorithm. Our bitmap based association rule algorithm Bit-AssocRule doesn't follow the generation-and-test strategy of Apriori algorithm and adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, thus avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the item-sets, all the operations of finding large itemsets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental results show Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than Apriori and AprioirHybrid algorithms. Our results indicate that bitmap techniques can greatly improve the performance of decision support queries and association rule algorithm, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and data mining applications.

It will be shown that functional dependencies may be used to logically infer new association rules from given ones. This observation will then be employed to propose a new variant of the best known algorithm for association rule mining, the so-called A Priori algorithm.

Different conditional statements on moving averages are represented as strings, encodable as chromosomes in an approach based on genetic algorithm. The data mining of good investment strategies corresponds to the extraction of rules that are fit in the sense of evolutionary computation. Three different kinds of moving averages (simple moving average, exponential moving average and adaptive moving average) of various durations have been used in the conditional statement involving the closing price of a given stock. The performance of a given investment strategy is evaluated using the rate of overall return in both the training set and the test set, thereby converting the problem of discovering good investment strategies to an optimization problem in combinatorics, which is solved with a genetic algorithm approach. Stock data from NASDAQ, including Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and Dell are tested and comparisons of genetic algorithms with benchmark methods such as random walk, buy and hold, and exhaustive search are performed. Results show evidence of superior performance in genetic algorithm in term of the rate of overall return for the test set. Within the confine of limited data, all three moving averages show similar results for the four technology stock investigated.

In this paper, we present a two-phase scalable model-based clustering framework: First, a large data set is summed up into sub-clusters; Then, clusters are directly generated from the summary statistics of sub-clusters by a specifically designed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Taking example for Gaussian mixture models, we establish a provably convergent EM algorithm, EMADS, which embodies cardinality, mean, and covariance information of each sub-cluster explicitly. Combining with different data summarization procedures, EMADS is used to construct two clustering systems: gEMADS and bEMADS. The experimental results demonstrate that they run several orders of magnitude faster than the classic EM algorithm with little loss of accuracy. They generate significantly better results than other model-based clustering systems using similar computational resources.

Mining information and interesting knowledge from large databases has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning, and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. Analyzing the huge amount (usually tera-bytes) of data obtained from large databases such as credit card payments, telephone calls, environmental records, census demographics, however, a very difficult task. Visual Exploration and Visual Data Mining techniques apply human visual perception to the exploration of large data sets and have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis. Presenting data in an interactive, graphical form often opens new insights, encouraging the formation and validation of new hypotheses to the end of better problem-solving and gaining deeper domain knowledge. In this paper we give a short overview of visual exploration techniques and present new results obtained from applying PixelBarCharts in sales analysis and internet usage management.

They combine kernel-density-based clustering with pixel-oriented displays to emphasize clusters while avoiding overlap in locally dense point sets on maps. Because a full evaluation of density functions is prohibitively expensive, we also propose an efficient approximation, Fast-PixelMap, based on a synthesis of the quadtree and gridfile data structures.

In credit card portfolio management, predicting the cardholder's spending behavior is a key to reduce the risk of bankruptcy. Given a set of predicting variables (attributes) that describes all possible aspects of credit cardholders, we first present a set of general classification models that can theoretically handle any size of multiple-group cardholders' behavior problems. Then, we implement the algorithm of the classification models by using SAS and Linux. platforms. Finally, we test the models on a special case where the cardholders' behaviors are predefined as five classes: (i) bankrupt charge-off; (ii) non-bankrupt charge-off; (iii) delinquent; (iv) current and (v) outstanding on a real-life credit card data warehouse. As a part of the performance analysis, a data testing comparison between the MCLP and induction decision tree approaches is demonstrated. These findings suggest that the MCLP-data mining techniques have a great potential in discovering knowledge patterns from a large-scale real-life database or data warehouse.

It has resulted in an unprecedented opportunity to develop automated data-driven techniques of extracting useful knowledge. Data mining, an important step in this process of knowledge discovery, consists of methods that discover interesting, non-trivial, and useful patterns hidden in the data [SAD+93, CHY96]. The field of data mining builds upon the ideas from diverse fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, database systems, and data visualization. But, techniques developed in these traditional disciplines are often unsuitable due to some unique characteristics of today's data-sets, such as their enormous sizes, high-dimensionality, and heterogeneity. There is a necessity to develop effective parallel algorithms for various data mining techniques. However, designing such algorithms is challenging, and the main focus of the paper is a description of the parallel formulations of two important data mining algorithms: discovery of association rules, and induction of decision trees for classification. We also briefly discuss an application of data mining to the analysis of large data sets collected by Earth observing satellites that need to be processed to better understand global scale changes in biosphere processes and patterns.

From an information system, we find reducts to generate decision rules for classification. However, for an information system has some noises, reducts may become meaningless or not appropriate for classification. In this paper, we propose some indices to find approximate reducts. For finding indeices to measure subsets of attributes, we introduce the contingency matrix based on the number of objects in each class of the information system. The main advantage of using the contingency matrix is that there are some good properties for finding approximate reducts.

The cost of such treatment for end stage kidney disease is high and needs attention for reducing it. Individual patient survival may depend on an intricate interrelationship between various demographic and clinical variables, medications, medical interventions and the dialysis treatment prescription. In this research, a data mining approach is used to extract knowledge regarding the interactions between the features and the outcome. There exist a complex and contradictory relationships among data mining rules that are difficult to interpret and implement. To resolve these conflicts a decision-making algorithm is developed using sixteen different classifiers. The decision-making algorithm employs simple and weighted voting schemes. Thus in this paper, a hybrid data mining enhanced decision making approach is used for predictions of an individual patient surviving beyond the median survival time. The concepts introduced in this research have been applied and tested using data collected at four dialysis sites.

In literature we find different approaches for bayesian network learning. Some of them are based on search and score methodology and the others follow an information theory based approach. One of the most known algorithm for learning bayesian network is the SLA algorithm. This algorithm constructs a bayesian network by analyzing conditional independence relationships among nodes. The SLA algorithm has three phases: drafting, thickening and thinning. In this work, we propose an alternative method for performing the drafting phase. This new methodology uses data mining techniques, and in particular the computation of a number of parameters usually defined in relation to association rules, in order to learn an initial structure of a bayesian network. In this paper, we present the BNL-rules algorithm (Bayesian Network Learner with association rules) that exploits a number of association rules parameters to infer the structure of a bayesian network.

Pharmaceutical drug design data provided by high throughput screening (HTS) is used to train many base ANN classifiers. In data mining (KDD) we must avoid over fitting. The ensembles do extrapolate from the training data to other unseen molecules. Le. they predict inhibition of a P450 enzyme by compounds unlike the chemicals used to train them. Thus the models might provide in silico screens of virtual chemicals as well as physical ones from Glaxo SmithKline (GSK)'s cheminformatics database.

Every structure is defined by the set of finite elements that also represent the number of target variables. Since large-scale complex structures may have extremely large number of elements, predicting the failure in every single element using the original set of natural frequencies as features is exceptionally time-consuming task. Therefore, in order to reduce the time complexity we propose a hierarchical localized approach for partitioning the entire structure into substructures and predicting the failure within these substructures. Unlike our previous sub-structuring approach, which is based on physical substructures in the structure, here we propose to partition the structure into sub-structures employing hierarchical clustering algorithm that also allows localizing the damage in the structure. Finally, when the identified substructure with a failure consists of sufficiently small number of target variables the extent of the damage in the element of the substructure is predicted. A numerical example analyses on an electric transmission tower frame is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The data mining approach seems to be a novel, interesting and promising one. In view of the deficiencies encountered by ignoring the hierarchical information in encoding the paths for mining, we propose a new sequential pattern mining scheme for XML document similarity computation. It makes use of the hierarchical information to computing the document structural similarity. In addition, it includes a post-processing step to reuse the mined patterns to estimate the similarity of unmatched elements so that another metric to qualify the similarity between XML documents can be introduced. Encouraging experimental results were obtained and reported.

In some cases, approaches of real-time segmenting time series are necessary in time series similarity search and data mining, and this is the focus of this paper. A real-time iterative algorithm that is based on time series prediction is proposed in this paper. Proposed algorithm consists of three modular steps. (1) Modeling: the step identifies an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model of dynamic processes from a time series data; (2) prediction: this step makes k steps ahead prediction based on the ARMA model of the process at a crisp time point. (3) Change-points detection: the step is what fits a piecewise segmented polynomial regressive model to the time series data to determine whether it contains a new change-point. Finally, high performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing with Guralnik-Srivastava algorithm.

Most clustering algorithms, however, do not work and efficiently when facing such kind of dataset. This paper presents an approach to boost one of the most prominent density-based algorithms, called DENCLUE. We show analytically that the method of adjusted mean approximation on the grid is not only a powerful tool to relieve the burden of heavy computation and memory usage, but also a close proximity of the original algorithm. An adjusted mean approximation based clustering algorithm called DENCLUE-M is constructed which exploits more advantages from the grid partition mechanism. Results of experiments also demonstrate promising performance of this approach.

In this paper, a new algorithm PFP-growth (Parallel FP-growth), which is based on the improved FP-growth, is proposed for parallel frequent itemset mining. The new algorithm distributes the task fairly among the parallel processors. We devise partitioning strategies at different stages of the mining process to achieve balance between processors and adopt some data structure to reduce the information transportation between processors. The experiments on national high performance parallel computer show that the PFP-growth is an efficient parallel algorithm for mining frequent itemset.

In this paper, we introduce concepts from OLAP (online-analytical processing) and data-mining to resolve this issue. The criminal incidents are modeled into an OLAP data cube; a measurement function, called the outlier score function is defined on the cube cells. When the score is significant enough, we say that the incidents contained in the cell are associated with each other. The method can be used with a variety of criminal incident features to include the locations of the crimes for spatial analysis. We applied this association method to the robbery dataset of Richmond, Virginia. Results show that this method can effectively solve the problem of criminal incident association.

When the training data set is too large, sampling is commonly used to overcome the difficulty. This work investigates the applicability of active sampling in feature selection in a filter model setting. Our objective is to partition data by taking advantage of class information so as to achieve the same or better performance for feature selection with fewer but more relevant instances than random sampling. Two versions of active feature selection that employ class information are proposed and empirically evaluated. In comparison with random sampling, we conduct extensive experiments with benchmark data sets, and analyze reasons why class-based active feature selection works in the way it does. The results will help us deal with large data sets and provide ideas to scale up other feature selection algorithms.

Social system appraisement is faced with random variable and fuzzy variable, in order to solve the clustering of the mix type variables, this paper puts forward a clustering application method. The major thought of this method as follows: on the foundation of screening in advance for data source, classifies data variable according to whether belong to random variable or fuzzy variable. Random variable is determined by posterior probability distribution through Bayes study theory, and made it carry out clustering with the method of not random variable with posterior probability distribution as the weight of random variable. For fuzzy variable, the equivalence matrix is established according to the system clustering method of fuzzy relation, and converted it into Equivalence matrix to carry out clustering.

Mining this data can produce new insights into weather, climatological and environmental trends that have significance both scientifically and practically. This paper discusses the challenges posed by earth science databases and examines the use of fuzzy K-Means clustering for analyzing such data. It proposes the extension of the fuzzy K-Means clustering algorithm to account for the spatio-temporal nature of such data. The paper introduces an unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithm, based on the fuzzy K-Means and defines a cluster validity index which is used to determine an optimal number of clusters. It is shown experimentally that the algorithms are able to identify and preserve regions of meteorological interest.

According to our observation on real data, the distribution of attributes with respect to information gain is very sparse because only a few attributes are major discriminating attributes where a discriminating attribute is an attribute, by whose value we are likely to distinguish one tuple from another. In this paper, we propose an efficient decision tree classifier for categorical attribute of sparse distribution. In essence, the proposed Inference Based Classifier (abbreviated as IBC) can alleviate the "overfitting" problem of conventional decision tree classifiers. Also, IBC has the advantage of deciding the splitting number automatically based on the generated partitions. IBC is empirically compared to C4.5, SLIQ and K-means based classifiers. The experimental results show that IBC significantly outperforms the companion methods in execution efficiency for dataset with categorical attributes of sparse distribution while attaining approximately the same classification accuracies. Consequently, IBC is considered as an accurate and efficient classifier for sparse categorical attributes.

WBext learns sophisticated user interests and browsing habits by tailoring and integrating data mining techniques including association rules mining, clustering, and text mining, to suit the web browser environment. Upon activation, it automatically expands user searches, re-ranks and returns expanded search results in a separate window, in addition to returning the original search results in the main window. When a user is viewing a page containing a large number of links, WBext is able to recommend a few links from those that are highly relevant to the user, considering both the user's interests and browsing habits. Our initial results show that WBext performs as fast as a common browser and that it greatly improves individual users' search and browsing experience.

The first prediction method of fuzzy association rules is presented, and shortcoming of this prediction method is analyzed. Then, the second prediction method of fuzzy association rules with the variable threshold is presented. In the second prediction method, a little error between prediction value and actual value is allowed. When the error is less than a given threshold, prediction value is regarded as acceptable or rational. The second prediction method can obtain the different prediction precision corresponding to the different error threshold chosen by the users, so it is more flexible and effective than the first prediction method.

Our proposed method uses a learning algorithm for a stochastic (probabilistic) model as a component subroutine and repeats two steps: selectively sampling examples and running its subroutine using the selected examples. In sampling examples, we utilize the predictions, for each example in a given training data set, calculated by all previously trained models. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the problem of clustering co-occurrence data. The performance of our method was compared with those of a random-and-iterative sampling strategy and of a method using multiple copies of our component learning algorithm, which has been widely used for clustering co-occurrence data. Our results show that the performance of our method compares favorably against the two other methods, in terms of the final prediction accuracies achieved. From the experiments on synthetic data sets, we found that the advantage of our method becomes more pronounced for larger noise levels. The effectiveness of our method was confirmed by the experiments on actual protein-protein interaction data sets.

RS helps to identify dominant attributes and DT algorithm results in simpler and generalized classifier. Experimental results obtained by applying the hybridized rough set framework and related base algorithms on data sets from three categories are presented in this paper. Accuracy, complexity, number of rules and number of attributes assess the performance of candidate algorithms.

One of the problems is that the results depend heavily on initial values and criterion to combine clusters. In this investigation, we propose a new method to avoid this deficiency. Here we assume there exists aspects of local regression in data. Then we develop our theory to combine clusters using F values by regression analysis as criterion. We examine experiments and show how well the theory works.

It helps to make sound reservoir decisions and improves the asset value of the oil and gas companies. It maximizes integration of multidisciplinary data and knowledge and improves the reliability of the reservoir predictions. The ultimate product is a reservoir model with realistic tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty. Soft computing aims to exploit such a tolerance for solving practical problems. In reservoir characterization, these intelligent techniques can be used for uncertainty analysis, risk assessment, data fusion and data mining which are applicable to feature extraction from seismic attributes, well logging, reservoir mapping and engineering. The main goal is to integrate soft data such as geological data with hard data such as 3D seismic and production data to build a reservoir and stratigraphic model. While some individual methodologies (esp. neurocomputing) have gained much popularity during the past few years, the true benefit of soft computing lies on the integration of its constituent methodologies rather than use in isolation.

To extract and characterize these motions, we use an accumulation of quantized pixel differences among all frames in a video segment. As a result, the accumulated motions of segment are represented as a two dimensional matrix. Further, we develop how to capture the location of motions occurring in a segment using the same matrix generated for the calculation of the amount. We study how to cluster those segmented pieces using the features (the amount and the location of motions) we extract by the matrix above. We investigate an algorithm to find whether a segment has normal or abnormal events by clustering and modeling normal events, which occur mostly. In addition to deciding normal or abnormal, the algorithm computes Degree of Abnormality of a segment, which represents to what extent a segment is distant to the existing segments in relation with normal events. Our experimental studies indicate that the proposed techniques are promising.

Instead, associations are discovered with data-driven algorithms. Thus, such rules may be considered as a good tool to learn useful and precise knowledge from scientific, spatial or multimedia data, because data-driven algorithms work well with any sampling method. This paper presents the whole methodology of automatic discovery of new rules that includes theoretical background, algorithms, complexity analysis and postprocessing techniques. The methodology was designed for a specific telecom research problem, but it is expected to have a wide range of applications.

Recently, the Optimized Segment Support Map (OSSM) was introduced as a simple but powerful way of speeding up any form of frequency counting satisfying the monotonicity condition. However, the construction cost to obtain the ideal OSSM is high, and makes it less attractive in practice. In this paper, we propose the FSSM, a novel algorithm that constructs the OSSM quickly using a FP-Tree. Given a user-defined segment size, the FSSM is able to construct the OSSM at a fraction of the time required by the algorithm previously proposed. More importantly, this fast construction time is achieved without compromising the quality of the OSSM. Our experimental results confirm that the FSSM is a promising solution for constructing the best OSSM within user given constraints.

These approaches have run time complexity of O(n log n) when using spatial index techniques, R+ tree and grid cell. However, these methods are known to lack scalability with respect to dimensionality. In this paper, a unique approach to efficient neighborhood search and a new efficient density based clustering algorithm using EIN-rings are developed. Our approach exploits compressed vertical data structures, Peano Trees (P-trees(1)), and fast P-tree logical operations to accelerate the calculation of the density function within EIN-rings. This approach stands in contrast to the ubiquitous approach of vertically scanning horizontal data structures (records). The average run time complexity of our algorithm for spatial data in d-dimension is O(dnrootn). Our proposed method has comparable cardinality scalability with other density methods for small and medium size of data, but superior speed and dimensional scalability.

The key idea is to take advantage of different classification abilities of neural network and the C4.5 algorithm for different attacks. What is more, the model could also be updated by the C4.5 rules mined from the dataset after the event (intrusion). We employ data from the third international knowledge discovery and data mining tools competition (KDDcup'99) to train and test feasibility of our proposed model. From our experimental results with different network data, our model achieves more than 85 percent detection rate on average, and less than 19.7 percent false alarm rate for five typical types of attacks. Through the analysis after-the-event module, the average detection rate of 93.28 percent and false positive rate of 0.2 percent can respectively be obtained.

The Health Club is a tool for coaches or ordinary keep-fit enthusiasts to monitor the development of fitness and the improvement of tactics. This application is being built on Genie of the Net, a general software platform for context-aware applications. The work on context recognition was started by collecting data from cycling exercises. Data mining was used to find interesting and useful contexts from the collected data. Multilayer perceptrons and recursive least-squares were used in recognizing contexts. The contexts were utilized in analyzing the exercises. Different techniques for visualizing the exercise data, the recognized contexts and the results of the analysis were studied as well. A user interface was also built for testing the visualization techniques.

We propose an integrated approach to statistical modeling from relational databases. We structure the search space based on "refinement graphs", which are widely used in inductive logic programming for learning logic descriptions. The use of statistics allows us to extend the search space to include richer set of features, including many which are not boolean. Search and model selection are integrated into a single process, allowing information criteria native to the statistical model, for example logistic regression, to make feature selection decisions in a step-wise manner.

The relationship between specific chemistries and/or structure and final properties is generally studied (experimentally and theoretically) from material to material. Yet there is a need to develop a more generalized approach that permits one to explore vast arrays of data on structure-property relationships based on interface characteristics. Such an approach can permit one search for correlations between structure and property across vastly different length scales. This type of "Data Mining" or informatics approach is a well-established tool in the chemical and bio-chemical sciences in searching for structure-property relationships in a large combinatorial design of molecular chemistries. This approach is not wide spread in the materials science community, however, we will outline the value of this approach in some specific cases in designing materials through controlling interfacial characteristics.

In many applications real time process data from plasma etch or deposition tools is collected and powerful statistical methods are used to detect trends and correlations among variables; the results of which can be used for process control and fault detection. The introduction of such methods to ion implant process control has been slow, partly due to the large number (from hundreds to thousands) of process recipes which can be run on a given tool, and the relative lack of real time process signals which are available during a typical ion implant process. However, valuable run summary data is available on virtually every ion implant tool in the form of implant data logs (IDL's). The introduction of modern computer networking technology makes it possible to automatically collect data from IDL's on multiple implant tools and store them in a database. Once the database is formed a multitude of analysis tools can be applied for process control, fault detection, and ultimately scrap reduction and yield enhancement. Traditional data mining techniques such as principle component analysis can be applied to seek out correlations among the many different signals available. However, the precise nature of the ion implant process allows some variables to be analyzed in a more deterministic manner. For example, a precise and predictable functional relationship is expected to be present between analyzer magnet current and the implant species charge, mass, and energy. A model can be generated to predict the magnet current and the value in the IDL can be compared against it. The deviations between model predictions and actual implant parameters can be used as the input to a response system which, given the nature of the signal and the size and statistical significance of the deviation, would generate the appropriate response, if any. The level of the response could vary from an email notification to an engineer (for example, the detection of recipe with a bad source setup history which could be improved to reduce autotune times) to the automatic shutdown of the tool (if the wrong species was determined to have been implanted).

J	Roychowdhury, S				Roychowdhury, S			Association rule computation using lexicographic order combination	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article								Association rules in data mining are used in order to discover latent information hidden in databases. The class of apriori algorithms provide a simple way to compute association rules. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm its computational complexity is quite high. Specifically, the computational performance degrades due to intense computational requirements during the phase of frequent itemset generation. In this paper we have proposed a novel procedure to extract frequent itemsets. The itemset is modeled as a cell of a hypercube, and this cell is represented as a lexicographical order combination. The procedure described in this paper reduces the number of database passes to a single pass to extract frequent itemsets. Thus, the procedure is computationally attractive.

The diversity of GIS and the increasing accumulation of non-spatial (simple attributes) and spatial (geometric shapes) data make it difficult to apply conventional OLAP and data mining tools. Thus, the need to build a spatial data warehouse over heterogeneous GIS is becoming necessary in many fields. Our architecture is a central type architecture based on GML (for spatial data representation) and more generally on XML (for all data). In this paper we will focus on the study of data integration into a data warehouse, and data representation. We will show how the specificities of our architecture contribute to manage spatial and non-spatial data.

Accordingly, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is nowadays considered a relevant learning criterion, accommodating imbalanced data, misclassification costs and noisy data. This paper shows how a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the AUC criterion can be exploited for impact studies and sensitivity analysis.

But it does not have much more improvements on a stable learning algorithm. TAN, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, is a tree-like Bayesian network. The standard TAN learning algorithm generates a stable TAN classifier, which is difficult to improve its accuracy by boosting technique. In this paper, a new TAN learning algorithm called GTAN and a TAN classifier combination method called Boosting-MultiTAN are presented. Through comparisons of this TAN classifier combination method with the standard TAN classifier in the experiments, the Boosting-MultiTAN shows higher classification accuracy than the standard TAN classifier on the most data sets.

There are other alternative forms of groupings: one approach is to group patients according to common characteristics and infer their resource consumption based on their group membership. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of the alternative forms of patient classification obtained from data mining with the current classification for an objective assessment of the average difference between the inferred and the actual resource consumption. In tackling this prediction tasks, classification trees and neural clustering are used. Demographic and hospital admission information is used to generate the clusters and decision tree nodes. For the case study under consideration, the alternative forms of patient classifications seem to be better able to reflect the resource consumption than diagnosis related groups.

The model characterizes the desired behaviors of an MA and the relationships between the MA, its user, and other human agents with whom the user interacts through message exchange. The intention extraction function formulates intentions from performatives identified by a probabilistic dialogue act classifier using constraints for felicitous human communication.

A combination of state-of-the-art on-line monitoring and diagnostic systems with the necessary off-line inspections allows a more reliable operation with extended durations between maintenance intervals by applying modern data mining and expert systems. Prerequisites for such a condition based maintenance strategy are the incorporation of all available information of the generator, (i.e., design knowledge, fleet experience, history of the machine) and all diagnosis and monitoring Information.

However, other than in data mining, rule discovery has long been the subject of research in statistical physics of complex phenomena. Drawing from the expertise acquired therein, we suggest explanations for the two mechanisms of the apparent 'meaninglessness' of rule recovery in the reference data mining approach. One reflects the universal property of self-affinity of signals from real life complex phenomena. It further expands on the issue of scaling invariance and fractal geometry, explaining that for ideal scale invariant (fractal) signals, rule discovery requires more than just comparing two parts of the signal. Authentic rule discovery is likely to look for the possible structure' pertinent to the failure mechanism of the (position and/or resolution-wise) invariance of the time series analysed. The other reflects the redundancy of the 'trivial' matches, which effectively smoothes out the rule which potentially could be discovered. Orthogonal scale space representations and appropriate redundancy suppression measures over autocorrelation operations performed during the matches are suggested as the methods of choice for rule discovery.

Therefore a medico-scientific data mining web service called Meva (MEDLINE Evaluator) was developed, capable of analyzing the bibliographic fields returned by an inquiry to PubMed. Meva converts these data into a well-structured expressive result, showing a graphical condensed representation of counts and relations of the fields using histograms, correlation tables, detailed sorted lists or MeSH trees. The user can specify filters or minimal frequencies to restrict the analysis in the data mining process. MeSH codes for MeSH terms may be listed. Furthermore he can limit the output on first authors. Results can be delivered as HTML or in a delimited format to import into any database.

The visual-based approach to decision tree construction has gained increasing popularity. We present Star-Class, a new interactive visual classification method. This method maps multi-dimensional data to the visual display using star coordinates, allowing the user to interact with the display to create a decision tree. Preliminary evaluation indicates that this new technique is as effective as state-of-the-art algorithmic classification methods, and more effective than the previous visual-based methods. Star-Class also offers additional advantages such as improving the user's understanding of the data.

The proposed approach comprises a number of data mining techniques. To perform web mining, the Indexing Agents search and download scientific publications from web sites that typically include academic web pages, then they extract citations and store them in a Web Citation Database. The Temporal Document Clustering technique and Journal Co-Citation Clustering technique are applied to the Web Citation Database to generate temporal document clusters and journal clusters respectively. The Multi-Clustering technique is then proposed to mine the document and journal clusters for their interrelationships. Finally, the knowledge that is mined from the inter-relationships is used for the detection Of trends and emergent trends for a specified research area. In this paper, we will discuss the proposed web mining approach, and the performance of the proposed approach.

We show that by considering the information contained on a web page in terms of its position, nature, and type it was possible to classify the web sites investigated into ten classes. We also describe how, as a by-product of this work, we have produced a set of style sheets which can be used as a basis for web page/site design. The implications of the use of the style sheets for web page/site design are discussed as well as the potential for the use of our tool in enabling companies and/or individuals to standardize their web site(s).

In this paper we present another difficult task: learning, from large numbers of performances by concert pianists, to play music expressively. We model the problem as a multi-level decomposition and prediction task. Motivated by structural characteristics of such a task, we propose a new relational distance measure that is a rather straightforward combination of two existing measures. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach is in general viable and our algorithm, named DISTALL, is indeed able to produce musically interesting results. The experiments also provide evidence of the success of ILP in a complex domain such as music performance: it is shown that our instance-based learner operating on structured, relational data outperforms a propositional k-NN algorithm.

As a consequence of this phenomenon, mining Web data and analysing on-line users' behaviour and their on-line traversal pattern have emerged as a new area of research. Primarily based on the Web servers' log files, the main objective of traversal pattern mining is to discover the frequent patterns in users' browsing paths and behaviours. This paper presents a complete framework for web mining, allowing users to pre-define physical constraints when analysing complex traversal patterns in order to improve the efficiency of algorithms and offer flexibility in producing the results.

Neural networks have been used previously to make diagnostic classifications of corneal disease using summary statistics as network inputs. This approach neglects global shape features (used by clinicians when they make their diagnosis) and produces results that are difficult to interpret clinically. In this study we propose the use of Zernike polynomials to model the global shape of the cornea and use the polynomial coefficients as features for a decision tree classifier. We use this model to classify a sample of normal patients and patients with corneal distortion caused by keratoconus. Extensive experimental results, including a detailed study on enhancing model performance via adaptive boosting and bootstrap aggregation leads us to conclude that the proposed method can be highly accurate and a useful tool for clinicians. Moreover, the resulting model is easy to interpret using visual cues.

We add a data mining server to the traditional web architecture. This server computes, using sequential patterns, the pages likely to be requested by the users, taking into account their web access history. Then, the server loads these pages into the proxy's cache in order to have them available when they are actually asked for. We describe our implementation and the results obtained, showing that the average access time to a web page can be dramatically reduced using this technique. Further, we also implemented our proposal using simple association rules, showing that sequential patterns result in a smaller and more accurate set of rules, as a consequence of taking into account the order of the requests. Finally, we discuss the differences with other prefetching proposals.	Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada	Vaisman, AA (reprint author), Univ Toronto, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON, Canada.

It is a non-supervised process which concerns in finding frequent patterns (or itemsets) hidden in large volumes of data in order to produce compact summaries or models of the database. These models are typically used to generate association rules, but recently they have also been used in far reaching domains like e-commerce and bio-informatics. Because databases are increasing in terms of both dimension (number of attributes) and size (number of records), one of the main issues in a frequent itemset mining algorithm is the ability to analyze very large databases. Sequential algorithms do not have this ability, especially in terms of run-time performance, for such very large databases. Therefore, we must rely on high performance parallel and distributed computing. We present new parallel algorithms for frequent itemset mining. Their efficiency is proven through a series of experiments on different parallel environments, that range from shared-memory multiprocessors machines to a set of SMP clusters connected together through a high speed network. We also briefly discuss an application of our algorithms to the analysis of large databases collected by a Brazilian web portal.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		data mining; large data sets; missing data; neural networks		The recent advances in data mining have produced algorithms for extracting hidden and potentially useful knowledge in large data sets, which are assumed to be complete and reliable. However, data suitable for mining comes from various sources, has different formats, and can have missing or incorrect values [2]. Incomplete data sets significantly distort mining results. Therefore, data preparation to taking care of missing or out-of-range values is very critical to knowledge discovery [8]. This paper proposes a generic framework for missing data imputation using neural networks, where two-stage filling algorithms are implemented An empirical evaluation of this method through a large credit card data set is performed.

The primary purpose of the PMML standard is to separate model generation from model storage in order to enable users to view, post-process, and utilize data mining models independently of the tool that generated the model. In this paper two systems, called VizWiz and PEAR, are described. These software packages allow for the visualization and evaluation of data mining models that are specified in PMML. They can be viewed. as decision support systems, since they enable non-expert users of data mining results to interactively inspect and evaluate these results.

This knowledge is increasingly being recognized as an important resource and organizations are now taking steps to manage it. In addition,, as the pressures for globalization (Castells, 1998) increase, collaboration and cooperation are becoming more distributed and international. Knowledge sharing in a distributed international environment is becoming an essential part of Knowledge Management. This is a major shortfall in the current approach to capturing and sharing knowledge in Military Medical Information Assurance. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring Risk Information Management Resource (RIMR) as a tool for sharing knowledge using the concept of Communities of Practice. RIMR is based no the framework of sharing and using knowledge. This concept is done through three major components-people, process and technology. The people aspect enables remote collaboration, support communities of practice, reward and recognize knowledge sharing while encouraging storytelling. The process aspect enhances knowledge capture and manages information. While the technology aspect enhance system integration and data mining, it also utilizes intelligent agents and exploits expert systems. These coupled with supporting activities of education and training, technology infrastructure and information security enables effective information assurance collaboration.

Since an image is always accompanied with some text segments which are closely related to the image, we propose that the semantics of the image may be discovered from such text segments through a data mining process on these texts. Based on such recognition, we applied a text mining process on the accompany texts of an image to discover the themes of this image, which constitute the semantics of this image. The self-organizing map algorithm is first applied to cluster a set of preprocessed web pages. Based on the clustering result, we design a theme identification process to identify a set of words which constitute the semantics of an image. We performed experiments on a small set of images and obtained promising results.

The tree is constructed by performing a hierarchical decomposition of the feature space; this step is performed regardless of complex nature of protein functions, i.e. it performs this decomposition even without knowledge of the protein functional class labels. In order to test our algorithm, we have constructed a library of Protein Phylogenetic Profiles for the proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae with 60 species. Results showed our algorithm compares favorably to other classification algorithms such as the decision tree algorithms C4.5, C5, and to support vector machines.

In this paper, we discuss its influence to financial data mining in terms of GP with/without Boolean functions and/or automatically defined functions (ADFs). Our simulation results indicated that GP with Boolean functions and/or ADFs really help discover the underlying regularity and make higher forecasting accuracy in the short-term prediction, while it has the poor performance in the long-term forecasting. This implies that we have to modify the forecasting functions more frequently if Boolean functions and/or ADFs is incorporated into GP' representation.

In meteorology research, change is frequently associated with severe weather events or climate anomalies. Detecting change is crucial for weather and climate analysis. In this paper, we propose a wavelet based approach to analyze short term changes in the global meteorological data. We design a suite of algorithms to effectively detect the changes considering both spatial and temporal perspectives. The algorithms were implemented and evaluated with a real-world meteorological data set.

However traditional density, estimation methods are inapplicable for streaming data, which are continuously arriving large volume of data, because of their request for linear storage and square size calculation. The shortcoming limits the application of many existing effective algorithms on data streams, for which the mining problem is an emergency for applications and a challenge for research. In this paper the problem of computing density functions over data streams is examined. A novel method attacking this shortcoming of existing methods is developed to enable density estimation for large volume of data in linear time, fixed size memory, and without lose of accuracy. The method is based on M-Kernel merging, so that limited kernel functions to be maintained are determined intelligently The application of the new method on different streaming data models is discussed, and the result of intensive experiments is presented. The analytical and empirical result show that this new density, estimation algorithm for data streams can calculate density functions on demand at any time with high accuracy for different streaming data models.

The quality of a segmentation is defined by an objective function suitable for the user's objective, such as "mean squared error," "mutual information," or "chi(2)," each of which is defined in terms of the distribution of a given target attribute. Our goal is to find value groups on a given conditional domain that split databases into two segments, optimizing the value of an objective function. Though the problem is intractable for general objective functions, there are feasible algorithms for finding high quality binary segmentations when the objective function is convex, and we prove that the typical criteria mentioned above are all convex. We propose two practical algorithms, based on computational geometry techniques, which find a much better value group than conventional heuristics.

In this paper, given a data set (T,F) where T subset of or equal to {0, 1}(n) denotes a set of positive examples and F subset of or equal to {0, 1}(n) denotes a set of negative examples, we propose a method to identify decomposable structures among the attributes of the data. We first study computational complexity of the problem of finding decomposable Boolean extensions. Since the problem turns out to be intractable (i.e., NP-complete), we propose a heuristic algorithm in the second half of the paper. Our method searches a decomposable partition of the set of all attributes by using the error sizes of almost-fit decomposable extensions as a guiding measure, and then finds structural relations among the attributes in the obtained partition. Some results of numerical experiment on randomly generated data sets are also reported. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper focuses on design and configuration of high-level optimization systems (wrappers) for relevance determination and constructive induction, and on integrating these wrappers with elicited knowledge on attribute relevance and synthesis. In particular, we discuss decision support issues for the application (cost prediction for automobile insurance markets in several states) and report experiments using D2K, a Java-based visual programming system for data mining and information visualization, and several commercial and research tools. We describe exploratory clustering, descriptive statistics, and supervised decision tree learning in this application, focusing on a parallel genetic algorithm (GA) system, Jenesis, which is used to implement relevance determination (attribute subset selection). Deployed on several high-performance network-of-workstation systems (Beowulf clusters), Jenesis achieves a linear speedup, due to a high degree of task parallelism. Its test set accuracy is significantly higher than that of decision tree inducers alone and is comparable to that of the best extant search-space based wrappers.

"Meaningful" cases are those judged worth probing further to prevent an epidemic of quality problems. Our system has employed the apriori algorithm, a data mining technique that efficiently performs the basket analysis. Our system proves that this data mining technique is not only useful in knowledge discovery but is also capable of performing the database watchdog task. The apriori algorithm automatically generates frequent itemsets from a large set of records. A frequent itemset is an arbitrary combination of values that appear more often than a threshold "minimum support." The algorithm often generates too many itemsets for quality engineers to review carefully in their daily work. Many itemsets do not provide sufficient information to investigate further. Hence, in order not to generate these valueless itemsets, the apriori algorithm is modified in two ways. One way is "basket analysis on objective and explanatory attributes" and the other is "itemset reduction." The advantage of our method is demonstrated with some experimental results.

It shows that the model theory of belief functions is simpler than the model theory of lower order monotonic capacities. We concentrate on finding a generalization of belief functions with the same simple model theory, which also admits a conjunction operator. We identify collections of belief functions that have a full propositional logic and present our generalization based on this result. We do not completely solve the problem of finding a conjunction operator. We describe a possible application of this research in data mining, namely the combination of evidence from multiple sources.

J	Ma, S; Hellerstein, JL				Ma, S; Hellerstein, JL			Mining mutually dependent patterns for system management	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; dependent pattern; event mining; pattern discovery	EVENT	In some domains, such as isolating problems in computer networks and discovering stock market irregularities, there is more interest in patterns consisting of infrequent, but highly correlated items rather than patterns that occur frequently (as defined by minsup, the minimum support level). Herein, we describe m-pattern, a new pattern that is defined in terms of minp. the minimum probability of mutual dependence of items in the pattern. We show that all infrequent m-pattern can be discovered by an efficient algorithm that makes use of: 1) a linear algorithm to qualify an m-pattern, 2) an effective technique for candidate pruning based on a necessary condition for the presence of an m-pattern: and 3) a level-wise search for m-pattern discovery (which is possible because m-patterns are downward closed). Further. we consider frequent m-patterns, which are defined in terms of both minp and minsup. Using synthetic data, we study the scalability of our algorithm. Then, we apply our algorithm to data from a production computer network both to show the m-patterns present and to contrast with frequent pattern,,,. We show that when minp = 0. our algorithm is equivalent to finding frequent patterns. However, with a larger minp, our algorithm yields a modest number of highly correlated items, which makes it possible to mine for infrequent but highly correlated itemsets. To date, many actionable m-patterns have been discovered in production systems.

The state space of these problems consists of regions that lie near class separation boundaries and require the construction of complex discriminants while for the rest regions the classification task is significantly simpler. The motivation for developing the Supervised Network Self-Organizing Map (SNet-SOM) model is to exploit this fact for designing computationally effective solutions. Specifically, the SNet-SOM utilizes unsupervised learning for classifying, at the simple regions and supervised learning for the difficult ones in a two stage learning process. The unsupervised learning approach is based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of Kohonen. The basic SOM is modified with a dynamic node insertion/deletion process controlled with an entropy based criterion that allows an adaptive extension of the SOM. This extension proceeds until the total number of training patterns that are mapped to neurons with high entropy (and therefore with ambiguous classification) reduces to a size manageable numerically with a capable supervised model. The second learning phase (the supervised training) has the objective of constructing better decision boundaries at the ambiguous regions. At this phase, a special supervised network is trained for the computationally reduced task of performing the classification at the ambiguous regions only. The performance of the SNet-SOM has been evaluated on both synthetic data and on an ischemia detection application with data extracted from the European ST-T database, In all cases, the utilization of SNet-SOM with supervised learning based on both Radial Basis Functions and Support Vector Machines has improved the results significantly related to those obtained with the unsupervised SOM and has enhanced the scalability of the supervised learning schemes. The highly disciplined design of the generalization performance of the Support Vector Machine allows to design the proper model for the particular training set.

J	Skillicorn, DB				Skillicorn, DB			Parallel frequent set counting	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						association rules; parallel algorithms; approximate algorithms; sampling; hotlists		Computing the frequent subsets of large multi-attribute data is a key component of local pattern detection data mining algorithms. It is both computation- and data-intensive. The standard parallel algorithms require multiple passes through the data. The cost of data access may easily outweigh any performance gained by parallelizing the computational part. We address two opportunities for performance improvement: using a parallel approximate algorithm that requires only a single pass over the data; and using a probabilistic technique to avoid generating most of the lattice of subsets implied by each object's data. The computation required is only slightly greater than levelwise algorithms, but the amount of data access is much smaller. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

It is based on the integration of the regression tree and the artificial neural network. In this paper, the regression tree is used to extract knowledge or rules as a data-mining method. That is useful for the information processing of the complicated data. As a result, the proposed method has an advantage in clarifying the cause and effect of dynamic load behavior in load forecasting. However, the regression tree does not necessarily yield good prediction results in spite of good classification. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for combining the classification results of the regression tree with the multilayer perceptron of a universal nonlinear approximator. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in real data. (C) 2002 Scripta Technica, Electr Eng Jpn.

J	Ari, B; Guvenir, HA				Ari, B; Guvenir, HA			Clustered linear regression	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering linear regression; machine learning algorithm; eager approach		Clustered linear regression (CLR) is a new machine learning algorithm that improves the accuracy of classical linear regression by partitioning training space into subspaces. CLR makes some assumptions about the domain and the data set. Firstly, target value is assumed to be a function of feature values. Second assumption is that there axe some linear approximations for this function in each subspace. Finally, there are enough training instances to determine subspaces and their linear approximations successfully. Tests indicate that if these approximations hold, CLR outperforms all other well-known machine-learning algorithms. Partitioning may continue until linear approximation fits all the instances in the training set-that generally occurs when the number of instances in the subspace is less than or equal to the number of features plus one. In other case, each new subspace will have a better fitting linear approximation. However, this will cause over fitting and gives less accurate results for the test instances. The stopping situation can be determined as no significant decrease or an increase in relative error. CLR uses a small portion of the training instances to determine the number of subspaces. The necessity of high number of training instances makes this algorithm suitable for data mining applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Hypothesis generation is one of the significant differences of data mining from statistical analyses. Nonlinear pattern hypothesis generation is a major task of data mining and knowledge discovery. Yet, few methods of nonlinear pattern hypothesis generation are available. This paper proposes a model of data mining to support nonlinear pattern hypothesis generation. This model is an integration of linear regression analysis model, Kohonen's self-organizing maps, the algorithm for convex polytopes. and back-propagation neural networks.

J	Lin, TY				Lin, TY			Attribute transformations for data mining I: Theoretical explorations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Attribute (feature) transformations on databases are examined from a data mining prospect. Theoretical examples from classical mathematics are used to illustrate the effects of the transformations: (1) Certain examples show that attribute transformations are the only means to bring out the patterns to visible states. (2) There are no apparent hints from the raw data as to what transformations could be employed; domain experts need to be in the loop of data mining. (3) All transformations can be expressed, or more precisely approximated, by polynomials. Such expressions provide some means for a brute force search (one degree at a time) of the transformations. A reasonable success in a linear case (degree one) is reported in Ref. 2. (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.

J	Tremba, J; Lin, TY				Tremba, J; Lin, TY			Attribute transformations for data mining II: Applications to economic and stock market data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								The effects of attribute transformations have been examined theoretically in part I of this article. This is part II, and its focus is on applications. Specific linear transformations, which have statistical meaning, are applied to a selected set of economic and stock market data. The data are selected from the computer, semiconductor, and semiconductor equipment industries. The main data mining tool is the rough set based software, DataLogic/R+, augmented with programs that perform linear transformations, concept generalization, and so on. Some useful "predictive" rules are discovered. Here, "predictive" is used in the sense that the logical patterns involve time elements. We should note that even in such simple cases, a trail-and-error approach is necessary for finding the right transformation. (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.

Data mining is a technique that has produced good results in providing insight into large volumes of data. This paper describes how the association rule data mining technique may be employed to generate profiles from log data and the methodology used for the interpretation of the resulting rule sets. The process relies on background knowledge in the form of concept hierarchies and beliefs, commonly available from, or attainable by, the computer forensic investigative team. Results obtained with the profiling system has identified irregularities in computer logs.

Having a single tool that supports the user in the selection of data, their preprocessing and transformation, as well as their mining, is an important requirement of KDD practitioners. Moreover, it is important to assist the user of a KDD system in the selection of the right parameters or methods. This paper describes KDB2000, a tool that integrates database access, data preprocessing and transformation techniques, a full range of data mining algorithms as well as pattern validation and visualization. This integration aims to support the user in the entire KDD process enabling him/her to see the same problem from many different angles for a thorough investigation. In addition, KDB2000 makes use of the agent technology to assist the user in some data mining tasks, such as choosing the best pruning strategy for induced decision tree in accordance to both data features and used needs.

In addition, an approach for using the real-time diagnostic and prognostic information for degraded operation control of armament systems is described. The application focus of this paper is on advanced armament system gun mounts; however, the ADAPT approach has general applicability to a large class of complex systems. It is powered and enabled by the integration of three modeling and reasoning technologies Prognostics Framework (PF) model-based reasoning, Statistical Network (StatNet) modeling, and a time domain gun mount simulation. The model embodied in the PF reasoning is called a fault/symptom matrix, which is a connectivity matrix that represents the linkages of anomalies or faults (rows in the matrix) to observable measurements and the coverage of tests that pass or fail (columns in the matrix). StatNet is a modeling algorithm in the ModelQuest Analyst data mining tool. This algorithm combines the effective 'network of functions' concept in neural networks with proven statistical learning techniques.

In this paper six discretization algorithms, used for preprocessing of melanoma data, were compared using criteria of rule set complexity, total number of errors, and expert's evaluation. The best discretization method was based on divisive clustering technique. An additional experiment in which the best rules from all six rule sets, selected by an expert, were used for melanoma prediction, was additionally conducted. Our conclusion is that in the original data set, cases with suspicious melanoma were not well represented.

This huge amount of data can be a useful source of knowledge. Sophisticated mining processes are needed for this knowledge to be extracted, understood and used. In this paper we propose a Web Usage Mining (WUM) system, called SUGGEST, designed to efficiently integrate the WUM process with the ordinary web server functionalities. It can provide useful information to make easier the web user navigation and to optimize the web server performance. Two quantities are introduced in order to give a measure of the quality of our WUM system.

An important characteristic of the proposed approach is that cluster prototypes are formed and evaluated in the course of the optimization without any a-priori assumptions about the number of clusters. The intuitively straightforward compound optimization criterion of maximizing the overall similarity between data and the prototypes while minimizing the similarity between the prototypes has been adopted. It is shown that the partitioning of the pattern space obtained in the course of the optimization is more intuitive than the one obtained for the standard FCM. The local properties of clusters (in terms of the ranking order of features in the multidimensional pattern space) are captured by the weight vector associated with each cluster prototype, The weight vector is then used for the construction of interpretable information granules.

A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Well-known are two types of the similarity join, the distance range join where the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest point query or k-distance join which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we investigate an important, third similarity join operation called k-nearest neighbor join which combines each point of one point set with its k nearest neighbors in the other set. It has been shown that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbor classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. We propose a new algorithm to compute the k-nearest neighbor join using the multipage index (MuX), a specialised index structure for the similarity join. To reduce both CPU and I/O cost, we develop optimal loading and processing strategies.

This spatial dimension becomes important when data either refer to specific locations and/or have significant spatial dependence and which needs to be taken into consideration if meaningful patterns are to emerge. For point data there are two main groups of approaches. One stems from traditional statistical techniques such as k-means clustering in which every point is assigned to a spatial grouping and results in a spatial segmentation. The segmentation has k sub-regions, is usually space filling and non-overlapping (i.e. a tessellation) in which all points fall within a spatial segment. The difficulty with this approach is in defining k centroid locations at the outset of any data mining. The other broad approach searches for 'hotspots' which can be loosely defined as a localised excess of some,incidence rate. In this approach not all points are necessarily assigned to clusters. It is the mainstay of those approaches which seek to identify any significantly elevated risk above what might be expected from an at-risk background population. Definition of the population at risk is clearly critical and in some data mining applications is not possible at the outset. This paper presents a novel variable resolution approach to cluster discovery which acts in the first instance to define spatial concentrations in the absence of population at risk. The cluster centroids are then used to establish initial centroids for techniques such as k-means clustering and arrive at a segmentation on the basis of point attributes. The variable resolution technique can thus be viewed as a bridge between the two broad approaches towards knowledge discovery in mining point data sets. The technique is equally applicable to the mining of business, crime, health and environmental data. A business-oriented case study is presented here.

Therefore efficient robust data mining algorithms should comprise some routines for processing these unknown values. The paper [5] figures out that each dataset has more or less its own 'favourite' routine for processing unknown attribute values. It evidently depends on the magnitude of noise and source of unknownness in each dataset. One possibility how to solve the above problem of selecting the right routine for processing unknown attribute values for a given database is exhibited in this paper. The covering machine learning algorithm CN4 processes a given database for six routines for unknown attribute values independently. Afterwards, a meta-learner (meta-combiner) is used to derive a meta-classifier that makes up the overall (final) decision about the class of input unseen objects. The results of experiments with various percentages of unknown attribute values on real-world data are presented and performances of the meta-classifier and the six base classifiers are then compared.

Though lots of well developed statistical and mathematical techniques of feature selection exist they do not match the imprecise and incomplete nature of most of the real world problems. Recently soft computing techniques i,e. neurocomputing, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm etc. are gaining growing popularity for their remarkable ability of handling real life data like a human being in an environment of uncertainty, imprecision and implicit knowledge. In this work genetic algorithm in conjunction with a fuzzy fitness function, a fuzzy measure for evaluation of the quality of a feature has been proposed for feature subset selection. GA based feature selection algorithms are robust but their computation time is high specially when they are used with a classifier for fitness evaluation. The computationally light fuzzy fitness function lowers the computation time of the traditional GA based algorithm with classifier accuracy as the fitness function by separating the two stages feature selection and classification.

This paper aims at improving the performance of the SLIQ decision tree algorithm (Mehta et. al, 1996) for classification in data mining The drawback of this algorithm is that large number of gini indices have to be computed at each node of the decision tree. In order to decide which attribute is to be split at each node, the gini indices have to be computed for all the attributes and for each successive pair of values for all patterns which have not been classified. An improvement over the SLIQ algorithm has been proposed to reduce the computational complexity. In this algorithm, the gini index is computed not for every successive pair of values of an attribute but over different ranges of attribute values. Classification accuracy of this technique was compared with the existing SLIQ and the Neural Network technique on three real life datasets consisting of the effect of different chemicals on water pollution, Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data and Image data It was observed that the decision tree constructed using the proposed decision tree algorithm gave far better classification accuracy than the classification accuracy obtained using the SLIQ algorithm irrespective of the dataset under consideration. The classification accuracy of this algorithm was even better compared to the neural network classification technique. Overall, it was observed that this decision tree algorithm not only reduces the number of computations of gini indices but also leads to better classification accuracy.

The proposed model achieves parallelism by employing a specialized compactly supported covariance function defined over spatially localized clusters. The associated load balancing constraints arising from data parallelism are satisfied using a novel greedy clustering algorithm, GeoClust producing balanced clusters localized in space. Further, the use of the proposed covariance function as a building block for GP models is shown to decompose the maximum likelihood estimation problem into smaller decoupled subproblems. The attendant benefits which include a significant reduction in training complexity, as well as sparse predictive models for the posterior mean and variance make the present scheme extremely attractive. Experimental investigations on real and synthetic data demonstrate that the current approach can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) which employs a random data partitioning strategy. Finally, extensive evaluations over a grid-based computational infrastructure using the NetSolve distributed computing system show that the present approach scales well with data and could potentially be used in large-scale data mining applications.

S	Cornforth, D		Mckay, B; Slaney, J		Cornforth, D			Evolution in the orange box - A new approach to the sphere-packing problem in CMAC-based neural networks	AL 2002: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	DEC 02-06, 2002	CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA					The sphere-packing problem is the task of finding an arrangement to achieve the maximum density of identical spheres in a given space. This problem arises in the placement of kernel functions for uniform input space quantisation in machine learning algorithms. One example is the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC), where the problem arises as the placement of overlapping grids. In such situations, it is desirable to achieve a uniform placement of grid vertices in input space. This is akin to the sphere-packing problem, where the grid vertices are the centres of spheres. The nature of space quantisation inherent in such algorithms imposes constraints on the solution and usually requires a regular tessellation of spheres. The sphere-packing problem is difficult to solve analytically, especially with these constraints. The current approach in the case of CMAC-based methods is to rely on published tables of grid spacings, but this has two shortcomings. First, no analytical solution has been published for the calculation of such tables - they were arrived at by exhaustive search. Second, the tables include input spaces of only ten dimensions or less. Many data mining problems now rely upon machine learning techniques to solve problems in higher dimensional spaces. A new approach to obtaining suitable grid spacings, based on a Genetic Algorithm, is described, which is potentially faster than exhaustive search. The resulting grid spacings are very similar to the published tables, and empirical trials show that where they differ, the performance on an automated classifier problem is unchanged. The new approach is also feasible for more than ten dimensions, and tables are presented for grid spacings in higher dimensional spaces. The results are applicable to any application where a regular division of input space is required. They allow the investigation of space quantising algorithms for solving problems in high dimensional spaces.

It is highly probable that a user will issue a series of similar queries until he or she receives satisfying results. Currently available mining algorithms suffer from long processing times depending mainly on the size of the dataset. As the pattern discovery takes place mainly in the data warehouse environment, such long processing times are unacceptable from the point of view of interactive data mining. On the other hand, the results of consecutive data mining queries are usually very similar This observation leads to the idea of reusing materialized results of previous data mining queries in order to improve performance of the system. In this paper we present the concept of materialized data mining views and we show how the results stored in these views can be used to accelerate processing of data mining queries. We demonstrate the use of materialized views in the domains of association rules discovery and sequential pattern search.

A novel framework, called RDM, for inductive databases is presented. It is grounded in constraint logic programming. RDM provides a small but powerful set of built-in constraints to query patterns. It is also embedded in the programming language Prolog. In this paper, the semantics of RDM is defined and a solver is presented. The resulting query language allows us to declaratively specify the patterns of interest, the solver then takes care of the procedural aspects.

Nowadays, the steps of information source definition, the pertinent data extraction and the fusion need to be conducted as a whole. In this work, our interest is related to the esophagus wall segmentation from ultrasound images sequences. We aim to elaborate a general methodology of data mining that coherently links works on data selection and fusion architectures, in order to extract useful information from raw data and to integrate efficiently the physician a prior. In the presented method, based on fuzzy logic, some fuzzy propositions are defined using physicians a prior knowledge. The use of probabilistic distributions, estimated thanks to a learning base of pathologic and non-pathologic cases, enables the veracity of these propositions to be qualified. This promising idea enables information to be managed through the consideration of both information imprecision and uncertainty. In the same time, the obtained benefit, when a prior knowledge source is injected in a fusion based decision system, can be quantified. By considering that, the fuzzyfication stage is optimized relatively to a given criteria using a genetic algorithm. By this manner, fuzzy sets corresponding to the physicians ambiguous a prior are defined objectively. At this level, we successively compare performances obtained when fuzzy functions are defined empirically and when they are optimized. We conclude this paper with the first results on esophagus wall segmentation and outline some further works.

It is has recently been found competitive with other state of the art machine learning techniques on benchmark data mining problems. For more general utility in this vein, however, issues are associated with the large numbers of classifiers produced by XCS; these issues concern both readability of the combined set of rules produced, and the overall processing time. The aim of this work is twofold, to produce reduced classifier sets which can more readily be understandable as rules, and to speedup processing via reduction of classifier set size during operation of XCS. A number of algorithmic modifications are presented, both in the operation of XCS itself and in the post-processing of the final set of classifiers. We describe a technique of qualifying classifiers for inclusion in action sets, which enables classifier sets to be generated prior to passing to a reduction algorithm, allowing reliable reductions to be performed with no performance penalty. The concepts of 'spoilers' and 'uncertainty' are introduced, which help to characterise some of the peculiarities of XCS in terms of operation and performance. A new reduction algorithm is described which we show to be similarly effective to Wilson's recent technique, but with considerably more favourable time complexity, and we therefore suggest that it may be preferable to Wilson's algorithm in many cases with particular requirements concerning the speed/performance tradeoff.

The challenge is that data analysts wish to infer patterns of client-side behavior from server-side data. However, because only a fraction of the user's actions ever reach the Web server, analysts must rely on incomplete data. In this paper, we propose a client-side monitoring system that is unobtrusive and supports flexible data collection. Moreover, the proposed framework encompasses client-side applications beyond the Web browser. Expanding monitoring beyond the browser to incorporate standard office productivity tools enables analysts to derive a much richer and more accurate picture of user behavior on the Web.

Results: Starting with the mainframe-based patient-centered hospital information system DIOGENE in the 70s, Prof. Scherrer developed, implemented and evolved innovative concepts of man-machine interfaces, distributed and fedarated environments, leading the way with information systems that obstinately focused on the support of care providers and patients. Through a rigorous design of terminologies and ontologies, the DIOGENE data would then serve as a basis for the development of clinical research, data mining, and lead to innovative natural language processing techniques. In parallel, Prof. Scherrer supported the development of medical image management, ranging from a distributed picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) to molecular imaging of protein electrophoreses. Recognizing the need for improving the quality and trustworthiness of medical information on the Web, Prof. Scherrer created the Health-On-the-Net (HON) foundation. Conclusions: These achievements, made possible thanks to his visionary mind, deep humanism, creativity, generosity and determination, have made of Prof. Scherrer a true pioneer and leader of the human-centered, patient-oriented application of information technology for improving healthcare.

The oldest computer database is with fingerprints. Other examples of databases are shoeprints, handwriting, cartridge cases, toolmarks drugs tablets and faces. In these databases searches are conducted on shape, color and other forensic features. There exist a wide variety of methods for searching in images in these databases. The result will be a list of candidates that should be compared manually. The challenge in forensic science is to combine the information acquired. The combination of the shape of a partial shoe print with information on a cartridge case can result in stronger evidence. It is expected that searching in the combination of these databases with other databases (e.g. network traffic information) more crimes will be solved. Searching in image databases is still difficult, as we can see in databases of faces. Due to lighting conditions and altering of the face by aging, it is nearly impossible to find a right face from a database of one million faces in top position by a image searching method, without using other information. The methods for data mining in images in databases (e.g. MPEG-7 framework) are discussed, and the expectations of future developments are presented in this study.

However, standard data mining techniques, taken in isolation, seem to be inadequate to cope with such a task. In fact, symbolic approaches show difficulty in dealing with noise, while non-symbolic approaches, such as neural networks and statistics show difficulty in dealing with very long subsequences where relevant episodes may be interleaved with large gaps. The way out we suggest is to integrate the logic approach with non-symbolic methods in a unified paradigm, as it has been already done in other Artificial Intelligence tasks. We propose a framework where a high level knowledge representation is used to incorporate domain specific knowledge, to focus the attention on relevant episodes during the mining process, and flexible matching algorithms developed in the pattern recognition area are used to deal with noisy data. The knowledge extraction process follows a machine learning paradigm combining inductive and deductive learning, where deduction steps can be interleaved with induction steps aimed at augmenting a weak domain theory with knowledge extracted from the data. Our framework is formally characterized and then is experimentally tested on an artificial dataset showing its ability at dealing with noise and with the presence of long gaps between the relevant episodes.

Examples for this are metadata information systems, online-shops or portals for geodata. The main disadvantages of existing approaches are insufficient methods and mechanisms leading users to (e.g. spatial) data archives. This affects aspects concerning usability and personalization in general as well as visual feedback techniques in the different steps of the information retrieval process. Several approaches aim at the improvement of graphical user interfaces by using intuitive metaphors, but only some of them offer 3D interfaces in the form of information landscapes or geographic result scenes in the context of information systems for geodata. This paper presents GeoCrystal, which basic idea is to adopt Venn diagrams to compose complex queries and to visualize search results in a 3D information and navigation space for geodata. These concepts are enhanced with spatial metaphors and 3D information landscapes (library for geodata) wherein users can specify searches for appropriate geodata and are enabled to graphic-interactively communicate with search results (book metaphor).

With a proper, by problem encoded computer archived data base, the data mining process would be easy. One would need only, input the request and get the proper data in short time. The medical archives frequently base on paper records only, with a patient name as entering key. To find the proper record in such archive, a detective strategy is needed. The process continues with collecting the usually enormous amount of papers, finding between them the appropriate records and finally encoding and arranging them in a table. The whole named process can be separated on patients, paper and data mining. Because of their dilatory, these phases can be the most time loosing part of an on-medical data based investigation.

Since diagnosticians routinely use the so-called ABCD formula for melanoma prediction, our main concern was to improve the ABCD formula. In our search for the best coefficients of the ABCD formula we used two different discretization methods, agglomerative and divisive, both based on cluster analysis. In our experiments we used the data mining system LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets). As a result of more than 30,000 experiments, two optimal ABCD formulas were found, one with the use of the agglomerative method, the other one with divisive. These formulas were evaluated using statistical methods. Our final conclusion is that it is more important to use an appropriate discretization method than to modify the ABCD formula. Also, the divisive method of discretization is better than agglomerative. Finally, diagnosis of melanoma without taking into account results of the ABCD formula is much worse, i.e., the error rate is significantly greater, comparing with any form of the ABCD formula.

Today's challenges are less related to data storage and information retrieval, but can rather be found in the analysis of data on a global scale in a heterogenous information system: technologies such as On-Line Analytical Processing, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases all require the integration of information and efficient query processing. In distributed and heterogenous datasets this can only he achieved by the efficient distribution and scheduling of subtasks in a distributed computing resource, Me propose the use of mobile query optimizations based on agent-technology,for distributed data warehouse and OLAP applications to adapt the concurrent query execution dynamically to the computing resource it executes on. This is of particular importance in cluster and grid computing.

In this paper we propose an approach to analyze and determine the level of affability of a web site that tends to secure user's satisfaction, based on both the kind of page and the kind of user. We propose a granular approach based on the idea that a page can be considered as a set of features or factors. In fact, each of them can be perceived at different granularity levels. The proposed approach makes it possible to estimate a measure of affinity of a user for each level of each particular factor. On any particular page, each factor takes a certain level or value. The global measure of affinity for a certain page will be calculated jointly considering the levels or values that the attributes of this particular page have for each design factor.

We then exploit association rules to establish an initial fuzzy inference model. A novel tuning method is proposed to adjust the fuzzy model such that every association rule from data mining model can in turn help us recommend the most appropriate products to the prospective customers. By combining the Larsen's inference method and gradient descent method, we derive a systematic approach to refine the fuzzy model. Thus, a new adjusting method, i.e., Larsen-like, is proposed in this paper. How to derive the association rules from large database, how to apply the derived rules to establishing a fuzzy inference model, and how to optimize the fuzzy model are illustrated by simple examples.

Efficient retrieval of this information with regards to its meaning and content is an important problem in data mining systems for the creation, management and querying of very large such information bases. In this paper we deal with the main aspect of the problem of extracting meaning from documents, namely, with the problem of text categorization, outlining a novel and systematic approach to it's solution. We present a text categorization system for non-domain specific full-text documents based on the learning and generalization capabilities of neural networks. The main contribution of this paper lies on the feature extraction methodology which, first, involves word semantic categories and not raw words as other rival approaches. As a consequence of coping with the problem of dimensionality reduction, the proposed approach introduces a novel second order approach for text categorization feature extraction by considering word semantic categories cooccurrence analysis. The suggested methodology compares favorably to widely accepted, raw word frequency based techniques in a collection of documents concerning the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. In these comparisons different Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) algorithms as well as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the LVQ and the conventional k-NN technique are involved.

Space or airborne remote sensing also produces very large images. Telemedicine and telerobotics require signal monitoring and multichannel video transmission. Compression of such signals is usually necessary to fit them into the available communications channels and digital storage, or for data mining. This paper provides an overview of important compression methods and techniques, including lossless entropy coding techniques designed to reduce the redundancy in the critical multimedia material, as well as lossy coding techniques designed to preserve the relevancy of the noncritical multimedia material. Modern lossy techniques often employ wavelets, wavelet packets, fractals, and neural networks. Progressive image transmission is also employed to deliver the material quickly. The paper also addresses several approaches to blind separation of signal from noise (denoising) to improve the compression, and to the difficult question of objective and subjective image quality assessment through complexity metrics.

Most data mining tools can only discover customer models or profiles (such as customers who are likely attritors and customers who are loyal), but not actions that would improve customer relationship (such as changing attritors to loyal customers). We describe a novel algorithm that suggests actions to change customers from an undesired status (such as attritors) to a desired one (such as loyal). Our algorithm takes into account the cost of actions, and further it attempts to maximize the expected net profit. To our best knowledge, no data mining algorithms or tools today can accomplish this important task in CRM.

We introduce a new framework for categorization which is based on the concept of "pattern conception" (a term that may be contrasted to "pattern recognition", "pattern matching", "pattern perception", etc.). There are important distinctions between pattern conception and the mainstream pattern recognition models; furthermore, these distinctions lead us to new categorization information-processing architectures. The first major distinction tells us that there is more than one correct conception for each individual pattern. Each pattern may have numerous segmentations and descriptions which are fundamentally distinct but equally correct in a deep sense. Another striking distinction of pattern conception is the capability to "see as", in which context will guide the interpretation of data such as that one object may be seen as if it were another type of object, or as if it were occupying the position or role of other objects. A final and related distinction is that there should be a,relativity theory' view of concepts and categories, in which concepts are both defined by their relations to other concepts and activated from the spread of activation of other concepts. In this work, we analyze how these distinctions appear under three distinct application domains: (1) the notorious case of Bongard problems; (ii) letter-string analogies; and (iii) the game of chess (viewed as a pattern analysis problem). It may be concluded that data mining methods must be able to handle these distinctions if they are to be effective at pattern conception, and, thus, to a wide class of information categorization problems.

Mining incorporates different methods and considers different kinds of information. Granulation is an important aspect of mining. The data sets can be extremely large with multiple kinds of data in high dimensionality. Without granulation, large data sets often are computationally infeasible; and, the generated results may be overly fine grained. Most available algorithms work with quantitative data. However, many data sets contain a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. Our goal is to group records containing multiple data varieties: quantitative (discrete, continuous) and qualitative (ordinal, nominal). Grouping based on different quantitative metrics can be difficult. Incorporating various qualitative elements is not simple. There are partially successful strategies as well as several differential geometries. We expect to use a mixture of scalar methods and soft computing methods (rough sets, fuzzy sets), as well as methods using other metrics. To cluster whole records in a data set, it would be useful to have a general similarity metric or a set of integrated similarity metrics that would allow record to record similarity comparisons. There are methods to granulate data items belonging to a single attribute. Few methods exist that might meaningfully handle a combination of many data varieties in a single metric. This paper is an initial consideration of strategies for integrating multiple metrics in the task of granulating records.

Users interacting with the data mining system specify the class of patterns of their interest by means of data mining queries involving various types of constraints. It is very likely that a user will execute a series of similar queries, before he or she gets satisfying results. Unfortunately, data mining algorithms currently available suffer from long processing times, which is unacceptable in case of interactive mining. One possible solution, applicable in certain cases, is exploiting materialized results of previous queries when answering a new query. In this paper we discuss cost-based data mining query optimization in presence of materialized results of previous queries, focusing on one of the popular data mining techniques, called discovery of sequential patterns.

It is found to be useful for conventional relational data. However previous work has mostly targeted on mining a single table. In real life, a database is typically made up of multiple tables and one important case is where some of the tables form a star schema. The tables typically correspond to entity sets and joining the tables in a star schema gives relationships among entity sets which can be very interesting information. Hence mining on the join result is an important problem. Based on characteristics of the star schema we propose an efficient algorithm for mining association rules on the join result but without actually perk forming the join operation. We show that this approach can significantly out-perform the join-then-mine approach even when the latter adopts a fastest known mining algorithm.

Because of the predominance of incomplete data in practice, many methods have been proposed to deal with them while there are few studies that compare their performance. The HEPAR II project presents an excellent opportunity to test experimentally how these methods perform on a real data set. We briefly review several popular methods for handling incomplete data and then compare them on the task of learning conditional probability distributions of a Bayesian network model, where the comparison criterion is the resulting diagnostic accuracy. While substitution of "normal" values of missing attributes seemed to perform best, we observed only a small difference in performance among the studied methods.

The first novelty of our approach is a method to automatically derive a "vocabulary" from each class of video clips, using the powerful method of "Independent Component Analysis" (ICA). Second, the method is unified in that it works with both video and audio information, and gives vocabulary describing not only the still images, but also motion and the audio part. Furthermore, this vocabulary is natural in that it is closely related to human perceptual processing. More specifically, every class of video clips gives a list of "basis functions", which can compress its members very well. Once we represent video clips in "vocabularies", we can do classification and pattern discovery. For the classification of a video clip, we propose using compression: we test which of the "vocabularies" can compress the video clip best, and we assign it to the corresponding class.

Two descriptors of the rules (that is relevance and consistency) being viewed individually and en block are introduced. The relevance of the rules is quantified in terms of the data being covered by the antecedents and conclusions standing there. While this index describes each rule individually, the consistency of the rule deals with the quality of the rule viewed vis-a-vis other rules. It expresses how much the rule "interacts" with others in the sense that its conclusion is distorted by the conclusion parts coming from other rules. We show how the rules are formed by means of fuzzy clustering and their quality can be evaluated in terms of the above indexes. Global characteristics of a set of rules are also discussed and related to the number of information granules being constructed in the data space.

Historically, rough neurocomputing has three main threads: training set production, calculus of granules, and interval analysis. This form of neurocomputing gains its inspiration from the work of Pawlak on rough set philosophy as a basis for machine learning and from work on data mining and pattern recognition by Swiniarski and others in the early 1990s. This work has led to a variety of new rough neurocomputing computational models that are briefly presented in this article. The contribution of this article is a survey of representative approaches to rough neurocomputing.

A data set is viewed as a truth table with an output boolean function. The value of this function is set to one if the corresponding transaction exists in the data set, zero otherwise. The output function represents a condensed form of all the transactions in the data set and is represented by an efficient compact data structure. It is then explored with a depth first strategy to mine maximal frequent itemsets. We have developed a prototype, and first experiments have shown that it is possible to rely on a condensed representation based on boolean functions to mine frequent itemsets from large databases.

In order to obtain satisfactory forecasting results, development of models used for these aims should be grounded on some interactive data mining. The process of the development is usually accompanied by the formulation of some assumptions to background methods or models. The accessibility and reliability of data sources should be verified. Special data mining of data sources may verify the assumptions. Interactive data mining of the data, stored in the system of the Lithuanian teachers' database, and that of other sources representing the state of the education system and demographic changes in Lithuania was used. The models cover the estimation of data quality in the databases, analysis of the flow of teachers and pupils, clustering of schools, the model of dynamics of the pedagogical staff and pupils, and the quality analysis of teachers. The main results of forecasting and integrated analysis of the Lithuanian teachers' database with other data reflecting the state of the education system and demographic changes in Lithuania are presented.

Earlier efforts included the NOAO Save the Bits archive (more properly a data store) with current raw data holdings from telescopes at both Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory of more than 3 million images, totaling in excess of 20 terabytes. The NOAO Science Archive builds on the foundation provided by the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey (NDWFS) Archive that offers sophisticated analysis tools - as well as the coherent and extensive NDWFS data set. NSA is an initiative of the NOAO Data Products Program aimed at identifying scientifically useful datasets from the large and growing NOAO holdings and making these data available to the astronomical community, while providing tools for data discovery, mining and exploration. The goals for the NSA are: to immediately create a scientifically useful archive of NOAO Survey data, to develop in-house expertise in the relevant technologies, to identify and document requirements for NOAO's future comprehensive archive by providing a design study, and to create a high level of visibility and utility for both the NOAO Archive and NOAO Surveys (for example, with web services available at http://archive.noao.edu). The archive and associated NOAO assets are expected to grow into a resource of the National Virtual Observatory.

While current research concentrates mainly on improving the performance of single learning algorithms, an alternative is to combine learners with different biases. Stacking is the best-known such scheme which tries to combine learners predictions or confidences via another learning algorithm. However the adoption of Stacking into the data mining community is hampered by its large parameter space, consisting mainly of other learning algorithms: (1) the set of learning algorithms to combine, (2) the meta-learner responsible for the combining and (3) the type of meta-data to use: confidences or predictions. None of these parameters are obvious choices. Furthermore, little is known about the relation between parameter settings and performance of Stacking. By exploring all of Stacking's parameter settings and their interdependencies, we intend make Stacking a suitable choice for mainstream data mining applications.

Some reasons that make hard the transition academy-industry for new technology are: (a) the weak usability commonly presented by emergent technology in regard to the required ease of ordinary users; (b) few successful experiences reported; and (c) the lack of an adequate methodology to new tools. In this paper we argue that text mining technology is exactly in the chasm point and study the hypothesis (c) mentioned above. The start point of our argumentation is the contradiction posed by the extraordinary amount of information in text form - about 80% of all existing information in a company - while the amount of text mining/web mining applications does not go beyond 7%. At the same time, we observe that the available technological alternatives present an excellent level of maturity, with many functions and adequate interfaces for the common user. The research was carried out by means of a case study in which we used texts issued by a journalistic agency. In order to explore our hypothesis, we applied the CRISP-DM method that was originally conceived for data mining. The contribution of this work includes the examination of the methodological hypothesis for the lack of text mining applications, an experience report in which we describe the steps carried out to apply CRISP-DM to text mining, and the findings in the target domain.

Data mining and knowledge discovery on large amounts of data can benefit of the use of parallel computers both to improve performance and quality of data selection. This paper presents and discusses different forms of parallelism that can be exploited in data mining techniques and algorithms. For the main data mining techniques, such as rule induction, clustering algorithms, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and neural networks, the possible ways to exploit parallelism are presented and discussed in detail. Finally, some promising research directions in the parallel data mining research area are outlined.

Data mining and knowledge discovery on large amounts of data can benefit of the use of parallel computers both to improve performance and quality of data selection. This paper presents and discusses different forms of parallelism that can be exploited in data mining techniques and algorithms. For the main data mining techniques, such as rule induction, clustering algorithms, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and neural networks, the possible ways to exploit parallelism are presented and discussed in detail. Finally, some promising research directions in the parallel data mining research area are outlined.

In this paper we discuss a visualization approach, which uses texture mapping and blending techniques to perform visual data-mining on text data obtained from discovering patterns in protein sequences. This visual approach, investigates the possibilities of representing text data in three dimensions and provides new possibilities of representing more dimensions of information in text data visualization and analysis. We also present a generic framework derived from this visualization approach to visualize text in biosequence data.

Whereas most transportation performance measures deal more directly with congestion, such as through delay measures, few quantify the level of predictability of travel. A new measure that effectively measures predictability of transportation service, the variability index, was developed and demonstrated. The variability index is a good example of the application of data mining in large transportation databases. Conceptually: based on multivariate statistical quality control (MSQC), the variability index is computed by measuring the size (spatial,volume) of the confidence regions defined by MSQC by using large sets of archived traffic data. In other words, experience (archived traffic data) is mined to measure the level of variability experienced by time and location. A case study application of this procedure demonstrates how this measure can clearly identify times of day and days of the week that experience relatively high degrees of variability in traffic conditions-or less predictable. service for the traveler.

Here, the structure of the data is just as important as its content. We study the problem of discovering typical patterns Of graph data. The discovered patterns can be useful for many applications, including: compact representation of source information and a road-map for browsing and querying information sources. Difficulties arise in the discovery task from the complexity of some of the required sub-tasks, such as sub-graph isomorphism. This paper proposes a new algorithm for mining graph data, based on a novel definition of support. Empirical evidence shows practical, as well us theoretical, advantages of our approach.

In this paper, we argue that the combination of data mining techniques with optimization models can lead to more effective approaches to campaign management, and,to an overall improved support for marketing decision makers. Given a specific marketing task, such as customer retention or acquisition, a class of multivariate splitting rules, in which an optimization problem is solved at each node in the tree, is proposed in the first stage to derive a set of interesting segments, by scoring the customers or the prospects. Then, in the second stage of our procedure, a mixed integer optimization model is formulated and solved for the overall campaign optimization, taking as input the customer segmentation derived in the first stage, together with the set of offers defined by the marketing managers, and the constraints on the limited resources available for the whole campaign.

Our work proposes an approach to extract temporal patterns from data to predict the occurrence of target events, such as computer attacks on host networks, or fraudulent transactions in financial institutions. Our problem formulation exhibits two major challenges: 1) we assume events being characterized by categorical features and displaying uneven inter-arrival times; such an assumption falls outside the scope of classical time-series analysis, 2) we assume target events are highly infrequent; predictive techniques must deal with the class-imbalance problem. We propose an efficient algorithm that tackles the challenges above by transforming the event prediction problem into a search for all frequent eventsets preceding target events. The class imbalance problem is overcome by a search for patterns on the minority class exclusively; the discrimination power of patterns is then validated against other classes. Patterns are then combined into a rule-based model for prediction. Our experimental analysis indicates the types of event sequences where target events can be accurately predicted.

The conventional methods, such as statistics and correlation analysis, appear to be less effective because the data of such type of problems usually contains high-level noise and the actual distributions of attributes are unknown. This papers presents a neural-network based method to identify relevant input features and quantify their general and specified relevance. An application to a real-world problem, i.e. osteoporosis prediction, demonstrates that the method is able to quantify the impacts of risk factors, and then select the most salient ones to train neural networks for improving prediction accuracy.

Utilities on de-regulated markets are forced to focus on increased customer service on a very competitive market. In order to become successful the Utilities have to utilize all their resources. One such resource is the huge amount of information in different computer systems. This information can be refined and combined to show patterns and support conclusions that could be used to provide better service to the customers, gain market shares and increase profit. The key is to store this information in a data warehouse that is flexible enough to provide powerful data-mining capabilities, and powerful enough to handle the big information pressure caused by the constant inflow of measured data from the power network. To use data warehousing in the power industry needs special considerations. To be used as a reliable historian for process data, there are high requirements on performance, availability and redundancy. At the same time it must have all the flexibility and openness required to let the user perform e.g. ad hoc queries and data mining. This paper will discuss some of these considerations, and possible realizations.									0	1	1	INST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS INSPEC INC	EDISON	379 THORNALL ST, EDISON, NJ 08837 USA	0537-9989	0-85296-748-9	IEE CONF PUBL			2002		488					130	135				6	Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BV11J	WOS:000177846700023

In this paper, we propose a technique for extracting knowledge with less complex mathematical elaboration based on our activation interval projection on each dimensional axis with certainty factor refinement. The knowledge is captured in forms of if-then rules which their premises are the conjunction of input feature intervals. Our experiment signifies that the extracted rules accurate when compared with those from a neural network.

Using a unique cleaned and linked administrative health dataset we address the problem of empirically defining episodes of care. An episode of care is a time interval containing medical services relating to a particular medical situation. In this paper the medical situation is a hospital admission. The medical services of interest are pathology tests, diagnostic imaging and non-invasive investigative procedures performed before or after the hospital admission, but 'associated' with the hospital admission. The task can be viewed as detecting a signal in a time series relating to a hospital admission, distinct from the background noise of on-going medical care. Our approach uses an ensemble (panel of experts) paradigm where we implement multiple agents (alternative predictive models) to separately estimate intervals and then choose a robust interval estimate using a voting scheme. The results have been used in a study for the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing.

In particular, a large number of candidate compounds that are formed by all possible combinations of the targeted elements in the periodic table are first screened and shortlisted by artificial neural network techniques. Then the quantum mechanics computation is employed to evaluate the promising candidates selected from the first step. Finally experiments are performed. to further examine the computation results. In the present work, we apply this methodology to the study of semiconductors of binary (III-V and II-VI) and ternary (I-III-VI2 and II-IV-V-2) compounds. Firstly, we systematically study all possible binary and ternary compounds by using pattern recognition and perform prediction of two important properties, namely band gap energy and lattice constant, with the artificial neural network model. Candidate semiconductors are then selected. On the basis of the above study, we perform first principles quantum mechanics computation for some promising II-VI binary candidates. The first principles study of the ternary candidates will be conducted in the near future, and the experiment study of the binary compounds is ongoing. The model predicted new compounds as well as the developed design methodology may be of interest to general materials scientists including these of smart materials research.

However most existing clustering methods can only work with fixed-dimensional representations of data patterns. In this paper we study the clustering of data patterns that are represented as sequences or time series possibly of different lengths. We propose a model-based approach to this problem using mixtures of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning the mixing coefficients as well as the parameters of the component models. Experiments were conducted on simulated and real datasets. Results show that our method compares favorably with another method recently proposed by others for similar time series clustering problems.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an automatic application-specific file prefetching (AASFP) mechanism that is designed to improve the disk I/O performance of application programs with such complicated access patterns. The key idea of AASFP is to convert an application into two threads: a computation thread, which is the original program containing both computation and disk I/O, and a prefetch thread, which contains all the instructions in the original program that are related to disk accesses. At run time, the prefetch thread is scheduled to run sufficiently far ahead of the computation thread, so that disk blocks can be prefetched and put in the file buffer cache before the computation thread needs them. Through a source-to-source translator, the conversion of a given application into two such threads is made completely automatic. Measurements on an initial AASFP prototype under Linux show that it provides as much as 54% overall performance improvement for a volume visualization application.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				The Marine Corps' Project Albert seeks to model complex phenomenon by observing the behavior of relatively simple simulations over thousands of runs. These simulations are based upon lightweight agents, whose essential behavior has been distilled down to a small number of rules. By varying the parameters of these rules, Project Albert simulations can explore emergent complex nonlinear behaviors with the aim of developing insight not readily provided by first principle mathematical models. Thousands of runs of Albert simulation models create large amount of data that describe the associations/correlation between the simulation input and output parameters. Understanding the associations between the simulation input and output parameters is critical to understanding the simulated complex phenomenon. This paper presents a data mining approach to analyzing the large scale and highly uncertain Albert simulation data. Specifically, a characteristic rule discovery algorithm is described in the paper together with its application to the Albert simulation runtime data.

In a usual data warehouse, data is relatively static and passive. Agents in a MADWH become dynamic and active when they are called to perform data mining tasks. New agents with new knowledge can form new agent cubes (or communities) dynamically in a growing schema. Traditional data mining uses a data warehouse as a data source; MADM develops and uses a MADWH as an evolving data and knowledge structure for further discovery. It is shown that different cerebrum/cerebellum systems can be modeled in a MADWH and a MADM approach can be used to discover and develop such a data warehouse for robot gymnastics. Although examples in intelligent control are used to illustrate the basic ideas, the new approach is generally suitable for a broad category of data mining tasks where knowledge are scattered in a geographically or geometrically distributed but relevant environment.

J	Korpipaa, P				Korpipaa, P			Visualizing constraint-based temporal association rules	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						association rules; hot strip mill; interestingness; virtual model; visualization		When dealing with time continuous processes, the discovered association rules may change significantly over time. This often reflects a change in the process as well. Therefore, two questions arise: What kind of deviation occurs in the association rules over time, and how could these temporal rules be presented efficiently? To address this problem of representation, we propose a method of visualizing temporal association rules in a virtual model with interactive exploration. The presentation form is a three-dimensional correlation matrix, and the visualization methods used are brushing and glyphs. Interactive functions used for displaying rule attributes and exploring temporal rules are implemented by utilizing Virtual Reality Modeling Language v2 mechanisms. Furthermore, to give a direction of rule potential for the user, the rule statistical interestingness is evaluated on the basis of combining weighted characteristics of rule and rule matrix. A constraint-based association rule mining tool which creates the virtual model as an output is presented, including the most relevant experiences from the development of the tool. The applicability of the overall approach has been verified by using the developed tool for data mining on a hot strip mill of a steel plant.

This analytic approach gives a general feel of the comparative efficiency of methods, but it rarely leads to very precise results. It is now recognized that accurate performance evaluation can be made only with actual measurements on working software. Given that such an approach requires an enormous amount of performance data related to actual measurements, the development of novel approaches and systems that intelligently and efficiently analyze these data is of great importance to scientists and engineers. This paper presents new intelligent knowledge acquisition approaches and an integrated prototype system, which enables the automatic and systematic analysis of performance data. The system analyzes the performance data which is usually stored in a database with statistical, and inductive learning techniques and generates knowledge which can be incorporated in a knowledge base incrementally. We demonstrate the use of the system in the context of a case study, covering the analysis of numerical algorithms for the pricing of American vanilla options in a Black and Scholes modeling framework. We also present a qualitative and quantitative comparison of two techniques used for the automated knowledge acquisition phase. Although the system is presented with a particular pricing library in mind, the analysis and evaluation methodology can be used to study algorithms available from other libraries, as long as, these libraries can provide the necessary performance data.

J	Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM				Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM			Mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; quantitative association rule; partition scheme; large q_itemset generation; performance study	PERSPECTIVE	Previous studies on mining association rules focus on discovering associations among items without considering the relationships between items and their purchased quantities. However, exploring associations among items associated with their purchased quantities may discover information useful to improve the quality of business decisions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of mining quantitative association rules in a large database of sales transactions. When purchased quantities are considered, the supports of items associated with their purchased quantities may decrease drastically, and the number of potentially interesting association rules discovered will be few. In order to discover more potentially interesting rules, we present two partition algorithms to partition all the possible quantities into intervals for each item. We also propose an efficient mechanism to discover all the large itemsets from the partitioned data. Experimental results show that by our approach, the total execution time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, the potentially interesting rule discovered from the partitioned data can be considered to be a kind of generalized association rule. The generalized association rule is useful in marketing, business management and decision making, especially when the information from the rules generated from the original data is limited.

Nevertheless, such techniques are clearly motivated by the ever-increasing data collection rates of modern enterprises and the need for effective, guaranteed-quality approximate answers to queries over massive relational data sets. In this paper, we propose SPARTAN, a system that takes advantage of attribute semantics and data-mining models to perform lossy compression of massive data tables. SPARTAN is based on the novel idea of exploiting predictive data correlations and prescribed error tolerances for individual attributes to construct concise and accurate Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT) models for entire columns of a table. More precisely, SPARTAN selects a certain subset of attributes for which no values are explicitly stored in the compressed table; instead, concise CaRTs that predict these values (within the prescribed error bounds) are maintained. To restrict the huge search space and construction cost of possible CaRT predictors, SPARTAN employs sophisticated learning techniques and novel combinatorial optimization algorithms. Our experimentation with several real-life data sets offers convincing evidence of the effectiveness of SPARTAN's model-based approach - SPARTAN is able to consistently yield substantially better compression ratios than existing semantic or syntactic compression tools (e.g., gzip) while utilizing only small data samples for model inference.

When the database is partitioned among several share-nothing machines, the problem can be addressed using distributed data mining algorithms. One such algorithm, called CD, was proposed by Agrawal and Shafer in [1] and was later enhanced by the FDM algorithm of Cheung, Han et al. [5]. The main problem with these algorithms is that they do not scale well with the number of partitions. They are thus impractical for use in modern distributed environments such as peer-to-peer systems, in which hundreds or thousands of computers may interact. In this paper we present a set of new algorithms that solve the Distributed Association Rule Mining problem using far less communication. In addition to being very efficient, the new algorithms are also extremely robust. Unlike existing algorithms, they continue to be efficient even when the data is skewed or the partition sizes are imbalanced. We present both experimental and theoretical results concerning the behavior of these algorithms and explain how they can be implemented in different settings.

J	Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM				Tsai, PSM; Chen, CM			Discovering knowledge from large databases using prestored information	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery; data mining; association rules; sequential patterns	ASSOCIATION RULES; PERSPECTIVE	In this paper, we examine the two issues of mining association rules and mining sequential patterns in a large database of sales transactions. The problems of mining association rules and mining sequential patterns focus on discovering large itemsets and large sequences, respectively. We present PSI and PSI-seq for efficient large itemsets generation and large sequences generation, respectively. The main ideas of these two algorithms are using prestored information to minimize the numbers of candidate itemsets and candidate sequences counted in each database scan. The prestored informations for PSI and PSI-seq include the itemsets and the sequences along with their support counts found in the last mining, respectively. Typically a user may require to tune the value of the minimum support many times before a set of useful association rules can be obtained from the transaction database. Using prestored information, the total computation time will be reduced effectively. Empirical results show that our approaches outperform previous methods by an order of magnitude, using little storage space for the prestored information.(C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Decision trees partition large amounts of data into smaller segments by applying a series of rules. Creating and evaluating decision trees benefits greatly from visualization of the trees and diagnostic measures of their effectiveness. This paper describes an application, EMTree Results Viewer, that supports decision tree analysis through the visualization of model results and diagnosis. The functionality of the application and the visualization techniques are revealed through an example of churn analysis in the telecommunications industry.

In this invited proceeding, we will address a particular scientific application - Panchromatic Mining for Quasars - of the forthcoming virtual observatories, which have arisen in an effort to control the effects of the data Tsunami. This project, in addition to serving as an important scientific driver for virtual observatory technologies, is designed to a) characterize the multi-wavelength nature of known active galaxies and quasars, especially in relation to their local environment, in order to b) quantify the clustering of these known systems in the multidimensional parameter space formed by their observables, so that new, and potentially unknown types of systems can be optimally targeted.

The Decision Tree C4.5 is reviewed with the Rough Set Theory. An enhanced window application is developed to facilitate the pre-processing filtering by introducing the feature (attribute) transformations, which allows users to input formulas and create new attributes. Also, the application produces three varieties of data set with delaying, averaging, and summation. The results prove the improvement of preprocessing by applying feature (attribute) transformations on Decision Tree C4.5. Moreover, the comparison between Decision Tree C4.5 and Rough Set Theory is based on the clarity, automation, accuracy, dimensionality, raw data, and speed, which is supported by the rules sets generated by both algorithms on three different sets of data.

This paper proposes a new approach to finding frequent itemsets. The approach reduces a number of passes through an input data set and generalises a number of strategies proposed so far. The idea is to analyse a variable number n of itemset lattice levels in p, scans through an input data set. It is shown that for certain values of parameters (n,p) this method provides more flexible utilisation of fast access transient memory and faster elimination of itemsets with four support factor. The paper presents the results of experiments conducted to find how performance of association rule mining algorithm depends on the values of parameters (n,p).

From 1986 to 1996, the USA prison population more than doubled while in France, it increased from 35655 in 1980 to 51623 in 1995. In spite of these findings, very little information concerning the inmates population is available. At the present time, there is a desire to adopt a policy based on the prevention of recidivism, on adequate release planning and referrals to community-based services. The aim of the RAPPEL project was to build an information system for assessing the social and health status of prison inmates. The pilot project was set up at the prison of Loos and allowed the collection and analysis of nearly 15000 records. The aim of this paper is to present the extension of the project consisting in developing a regional net-work grouping 11 jails. Information locally available will serve as the basis for the information system of regional jails. Data mining techniques will provide solutions for the extraction of new information. Three data mining tools were experimented : association rules, classification trees and clustering. Further extension consists in a distributed approach allowing direct access to the information system by WEB tools.

An integrated parametric analysis scheme is developed with supplemented graphical methods to facilitate interpretation of results. It consists of five phases: Device Variation Partition, Key Node Screening, Linear Equipment Modeling, Graph Aided Interpretation, and Control Policy Re-evaluation. The concepts of quality control, data mining, and process knowledge are integrated in this scheme. Field data case study shows that the integrated parametric analysis scheme is able to diagnose the parametric yield problem, help engineers construct the knowledge base, predict the yield, and provide insights for yield enhancement.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to extract rules using genetic algorithms (GA) and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network classifier. The interval for each input in the condition part of each rule is adjusted using GA. The fitness of a chromosome is determined by the accuracy of extracted rules. The decision boundary of rules extracted is in the form of hyper-rectangular. During the training of an RBP neural network, large overlaps between clusters corresponding to the same class is allowed in order to decrease the number of hidden units while maintaining classification accuracy. The weights connecting the hidden units with the output units are then pruned. Our simulations demonstrate that our approach leads to more accurate and concise rules.

One rapidly expanding application area is the processing of broadcast audio for information access. At LIMSI, broadcast news transcription systems have been developed for English, French, German, Mandarin and Portuguese, and systems for other languages are under development. Audio indexation must take into account the specificities of audio data, such as needing to deal with the continuous data stream and an imperfect word transcription. Some near-term applications areas are audio data mining, selective dissemination of information and media monitoring.

A number of mutant mice should provide a useful tool to understand the gene function of the mammalian genome including human. It also becomes an animal model system for the studies of human diseases. To identify mutants, it is necessary to screen a large number of candidate mice with many objective phenotypes, since mutations arise only in a low frequency even if some mutagens are administered. In order to conduct the project in a large scale, an ORACLE-based database system has been introduced in our project at RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center. All the mice in our facilities are bar-coded and all the data, information, messages are transferred back and forth through LAN. All biometrical devices are also directly connected to the database server through LAN with a transporting protocol. Based upon these infrastructures, population and quantitative genomics now becomes feasible to identify the useful mutations from the compiled genotype- and phenotype-database. The expected mutants in silico will be examined in vivo and vise versa. For these process, new data-mining tools are also needed combining with biological and genetical tools. The comparative genomics between human and mouse is also another key to effectively utilize this animal model system to elucidate the mechanism of human diseases and to apply the outcomes to medical and pharmaceutical field.

For example, in New York State all patients who enter the EMS are tracked through their pre-hospital care to the emergency room using the PreHospital Care Report (PCR). Our goal is to automate the collection of data from the PCR and enable efficient maintenance, and dissemination of information. The task involves the automatic extraction and transliteration of the handwritten text in the response boxes provided on the form. The objective is to produce for each form image, an ASCII transcription of the handwritten contents of the response boxes. These responses could be then used to populate a database. The database itself will then emerge as a valuable resource for enabling data mining and knowledge discovery for the entire medical community.

Such transactional data pose particular issues such as very high dimensionality (> 10,000), and sparse categorical entries, that have been dealt with more effectively using a graph-based approach to clustering such as ROCK.(1) But large transactional data raises certain other issues such as how to compare diverse products (e.g. milk vs. cars) cluster balancing and outlier removal, that need to be addressed. We first propose a new similarity measure that takes the value of the goods purchased into account, and form a value-based graph representation based on this similarity measure. B novel value-based balancing criterion that allows the user to control the balancing of clusters, is then defined. This balancing criterion is integrated with a value-based goodness measure for merging two clusters in an agglomerative clustering routine. Since graph-based clustering algorithms are very sensitive to outliers, we also propose a fast, effective and simple outlier detection and removal method based on under-clustering or over-partitioning. The performance of the proposed clustering framework is compared with leading graph-theoretic approaches such as ROCK and METIS.

This paper describes the Directed Association Visualization (DAV) system that visually associates product affinities and relationships for large volumes of e-commerce transaction data. DAV maps transaction data items and their relationships to vertices, edges, and positions on a visual spherical surface. DAV encompasses several innovative techniques (1) items are positioned according to their associations to show the strength of their relationships; (2) edges with arrows are used to represent the implication directions; (3) a mass-spring engine is integrated into a visual data mining platform to provide a self-organized graph. We have applied this system successfully to market basket analysis and e-customer profiling Internet applications.

The proposed approach consists of three phases. fuzzy-rule generating, fuzzy-rule encoding and fuzzy-rule evolution. In the fuzzy-rule generating phase, a number of fuzzy rules are randomly generated. In the fuzzy-rule encoding phase, all the rules generated are translated into fixed-length bit strings to form an initial population, In the fuzzy-rule evolution phase, genetic operations and credit assignment are applied at the rule level. The proposed mining approach chooses good individuals in the population for mating, gradually creating better offspring fuzzy rules. A concise and compact fuzzy rule base is thus constructed effectively without human expert intervention.

Implementing the Microsensors, Microactuators, and Microelectronics leads to what is known as a M-3 (M-cubic) system. This project involves demonstrating the concept of using small actuators (similar to micron-millimeter scale) to provide large control forces for a large-scale system (similar to meter scale) through natural flow amplification phenomenon. This is theorized by using fluid separation phenomenon, vortex evolution, and vortex symmetry on a delta wing aircraft. By using MEMS actuators to control leading edge vortex separation and growth, a desired aerodynamic force can be produced about the aircraft for flight control. Consequently, a MEMS shear stress sensor array was developed for detecting the leading edge separation line where leading edge vortex flow separation occurs. By knowing the leading edge separation line, a closely coupled micro actuation from the effectors can cause the required separation that leads to vortex control. A robust and flexible balloon type actuator was developed using pneumatic pressure as the actuation force. Recently, efforts have started to address the most elusive problem of amplified distributed control (ADC) through data mining algorithms. Preliminary data mining results are promising and this part of the research is ongoing. All wind tunnel data used the baseline 56.5 degrees sweepback delta wing with root chord of 31.75cm.

When an attribute is continuous (i.e., real-valued) such as height, length and weight, its domain is usually discretized into several intervals. Fuzzy rules are recognized as a convenient tool for handling continuous attributes in a human understandable manner. When we use fuzzy rules, the domain of each continuous attribute is discretized into several fuzzy sets. A linguistic label is usually associated with each fuzzy set especially when linguistic interpretations of fuzzy rules are required. In this paper, we first fuzzify the concept of association rules. That is, we show fuzzy versions of two measures (i.e., confidence and support) that are used for evaluating each association rule in the field of data mining. Then we illustrate these two measures of fuzzy rules for function approximation and pattern classification problems. Finally we examine the relation between the classification performance of fuzzy rules and the definition of their certainty grades through computer simulations. Simulation results show that the direct use of confidence as a certainty grade is not always appropriate from the viewpoint of classification performance.

In this study, the potential applicability and limitations of the time series forecasting approach using neural network with the multiresolution learning paradigm (NNMLP) are investigated. The predicted long-term range streamflows using the NNMLP are compared with the observations. The results show that the time series forecasting approach of NNMLP has good predicting skill. The NNMLP requires only historical streamflow information. The time series forecasting approach of NNMLP has great potential for being used alone in regions with limited available information, and for being combined with other approaches to improve long-term range streamflow forecasts.

In other work, we have introduced modifications of these methods that mine fuzzy association rules and fuzzy frequent episodes and have described off-line methods that utilize these fuzzy methods for anomaly detection from audit data. In this paper we describe another extension that uses fuzzy frequent episodes for near real-time intrusion detection. We first define fuzzy frequent episodes and then describe experiments that explore their applicability for real-time intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy frequent episodes can provide effective approximate anomaly detection.

All objects contained in the same group have similar characteristics. Grouping multivariate data is a difficult data mining task when no domain knowledge on data structure is available. In this chapter we describe the use of a well known linear projection technique, called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to discover clusters. SVD is an optimal dimensionality reduction method that projects a mufti-dimensional pattern space into a subspace that preserves the character of data. The plot of the 2- or 3-dimensional points gives the human user a guide to discover the presence of homogeneous groups (clusters) in the data set. A user, by inspecting the graphical 2- or 3-dimensional representations, may identify groups on the basis of space density and define threshold values to separate clusters. Experimental results on real scientific data sets assess the quality of the clustering obtained.

In the data mining cycle: visualization has been mainly focused on data visualization and output generation. However, besides datasets, many other entities need to be explored and understood by users and analysts. In this paper, we describe the role of visualization in the data mining process, and we present a model to support the interaction between users and data mining entities. We discuss visualizations of datasets, parameter spaces of data mining algorithms, models induced from datasets, and patterns generated by the application of data mining algorithms to datasets. We have developed a Java-based testbed, that implements the extended data mining model with visual support to interact with datasets, models, parameter spaces, and patterns. Experimental results based on several public datasets, data mining algorithms, multidimensional visualization techniques, and other novel visualizations, show clearly the benefits of the integration of visualization in the data, mining process.

Because of the lack of standards in music classification - or the lack of enforcement of existing standards - there is a huge amount Of unclassified titles of music in the world. In this paper we propose a method of classification based on musical data mining technique based on co-occurrence and correlation analysis that can be used for classification. It gives a new approach of similarity between several titles of music or several artists. We study large corpora of textual information referring titles of music or artists whose names are decided by humans without particular constraints other than readability, and draw various hypotheses concerning the natural similarities that emerge from these corpora. Based on a clustering technique, we show that interesting groups can reveal specific music genres and allow classifying titles of music in a kind of objective manner.

GMDH is typically used for data mining to reveal the unknown relationship between the wind stress coefficient and physical variables such as wave energy, wind and pressure. While in current practice the wind stress coefficient is determined on the basis of wind speed and wind direction, this research has shown that there is also a dependency between the wind stress coefficient and wave energy. This result can be explained by physics and is therefore a justification for our approach. When adding the dependencies found by the GMDH network to the actual North Sea model, the accuracy of the results does not differ much from the actual current model in which the wind stress coefficient has been successively more and more fine-tuned during several years. Although our approach has not resulted in an improvement of the current North Sea model, the advantage of our approach can be found in the fact that instead of tuning extensively over a period of several years GMDH-based data mining can be exploited to fine-tune a model reasonably fast.

In this paper, we address research issues in the parallelization of scientific queries containing complex user-defined operations. In a parallel query execution environment, parallelizing a query execution plan involves determining how input data streams to evaluators implementing logical operations can be divided to be processed by clones of the same evaluator in parallel. We introduced the concept of "relevance window" that characterizes data lineage and data partitioning opportunities available for an user-defined evaluator. In addition, we developed a query parallelization framework by extending relational parallel query optimization algorithms to allow the parallelization characteristics of user-defined evaluators to guide the process of query parallelization in an extensible query processing environment. We demonstrated the utility of our system by performing experiments mining cyclonic activity, blocking events, and the upward wave-energy propagation features from several observational and model simulation datasets.

Extracting interesting and useful patterns from spatial datasets is more difficult than extracting the corresponding patterns from traditional numeric and categorical data due to the complexity of spatial data types, spatial relationships, and spatial autocorrelation. A popular approach is to apply classical data mining techniques after transforming spatial components into non-spatial components via feature selection. An alternative is to explore new models, new objective functions, and new patterns which are more suitable for spatial data and their unique properties. This chapter investigates techniques in the literature to incorporate spatial components via feature selection, new models, new objective functions, and new patterns.

Such abuse may originate from both outside an organisation and from within, and will not necessarily be prevented by traditional authentication and access control mechanisms. Intrusion Detection Systems aim to overcome these weaknesses by continuously monitoring for signs of unauthorised activity. The techniques employed often involve the collection of vast amounts of auditing data to identify abnormalities against historical user behaviour profiles and known intrusion scenarios. The approach may be optimised using domain expertise to extract only the relevant information from the wealth available, but this can be time consuming and knowledge intensive. This paper examines the potential of Data Mining algorithms and techniques to automate the data analysis process and aid in the identification of system features and latent trends that could be used to profile user behaviour. It presents the results of a preliminary analysis and discusses the strategies used to capture and profile behavioural characteristics using data mining in the context of a conceptual Intrusion Monitoring System framework.
