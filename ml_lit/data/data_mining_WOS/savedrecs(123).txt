Under the umbrella of an information architecture research for road safety, the objective of this research is to identify the role of collision related factors to the severity of an accident in explaining road safety situations and define or construct road safety information architecture based on existing enterprise frameworks. The research followed a Design Science research paradigm and Zachman Enterprise Framework was used to guide the development of the road safety information architecture. The research also employed classification techniques using Decision tree and Rule induction approaches. Results showed that the architectural representation guided by the selected framework can provide a holistic view to the management of road safety data. Moreover the identified patterns in a form of rule can supplement the previous severity prediction experiments with promising performance.

To tackle this problem, we can compare the a priori assumptions about how the system should be used with the actual user behavior in order to decide how the system could be improved. For this aim, we propose to employ the same formalism to express the intended usage, the web portal model and the real usage extracted from system usage traces by data mining algorithms. Inspired from BioCham, we propose to use temporal logic and Kripke structure as such a common formalism.

A Mobile Agent (MA) is an autonomous transportable program that can migrate under its own or host control from one node to another in a heterogeneous network. This paper highlights the agent based approach for mining the association rules from the distributed data sources and proposed an another framework called Agent enriched Mining of Strong Association Rules (AeMSAR) from Distributed Data Sources. As agent technology paradigm of the DC has gained lots of research in the recent years, therefore, making an alliance of agent and Association Rules Mining(ARM) will help mining the Association rules in a Distributed environment in a better way.

The recent explosive growth in data collection made the current rule mining algorithms restricted and insufficient to analyze excessively large transaction sets because they suffer from many problems when mining massive transaction datasets. Some of the major problems are: (1) required multiple database scan, (2) massive computational power requirement (3) huge memory requirement, and (4) lake of parallelism (5) less of interactive nature for different support value ([1-2]). In this paper an approach of Inverted matrix, the new representation of transactional database is used and distributed it amongst parallel nodes. Frequent item from the inverted matrix is assigned to parallel nodes. In parallel implementation, a Co-Occurrence Frequent Item (COFI) tree for assigning frequent item is generated by the parallel nodes. Mining process is accomplished by all nodes which generate all frequent items in which the assigned items are participated. Here, less communication is required amongst the master node all parallel node to generate all frequent itemsets. Two techniques have been used for assignment of frequent item to the parallel nodes, viz. (1) Alternate Loop Splitting (ALS), and (2) Block Loop Splitting (BLS). We have Implemented sequential as well as parallel algorithms for frequent set mining and compared its performance on mushroom [9] database having approximately 10000 transactions, 120 different items and 23 average transaction sizes. It has been found that alternate loop splitting achieves better time complexity as compared to block loop splitting. Also both the parallel techniques are found to be better than sequential algorithm.

OCTracker adapts a preliminary community structure towards dynamic changes in social networks using a novel density-based approach for detecting overlapping community structures and automatically detects evolutionary events like birth, growth, contraction, merge, split, and death of communities with time. Unlike other density-based community detection methods, the proposed method does not require the neighborhood threshold parameter to be set by the users, rather it automatically determines the same for each node locally.

Classification being a very well-known data mining technique, groups similar data objects by establishing relationship between the objects under test and the pre-defined class labels obtained during training phase. Of all the classification algorithms, decision tree is most commonly used. In this paper we will discuss scalability of decision tree algorithm based on the selection of the attribute selection measure. Attribute selection measure is mainly used to select the splitting criterion that best separates the given data partition. The popular attribute selection measures are Information Gain and Gain Ratio. We would perform the comparative analysis of these measures and based on their results we would determine which measure should be used in which situation in order to increase the scalability of the Decision Tree algorithm.

Association rule mining is one of the key research area in the field of Data Mining. Association rule mining can be considered as unsupervised learning model, it discovers the interesting relationship among large set of data items on the basis of some predefined threshold. Support-confidence is the classical model used for the rule mining purpose, it uses confidence for final rule generation but it has some limitations. As sometimes it can generate those rules which are not positively correlated and thus can mislead the decision maker. In this paper we addressed the problems associated with existing approach and also proposed two new measure of interestingness to deal with these problems. The new measures have been tested for their correctness.

Creating predictive models to customize advertiser requirements and campaign analytics to show targeted ads to users who are most likely to convert has become increasingly challenging. Advertisers often group customers into a segment defined by a given set of demographic or behavioral attributes. Such segments are often very sparse. "Look-Alike Modeling" enables advertisers to enhance the target segment by using predictive models to expand the segment membership by assigning a probability score to users that did not explicitly belong to that segment based on the original segment definition. In this paper accompanied by the demo of a distributed platform, we describe a Look-Alike Modeling framework to expand segment membership using a novel high-dimensional distributed algorithm based on frequent pattern mining. We describe how the distributed algorithm is more efficient than traditional classification techniques that (a) require multiple passes over the dataset and (b) require both positive and negative class labels for training. Our solution is capable of concurrently and continuously processing thousands of segments and includes an efficient grouping operator and a distributed scoring algorithm for predicting multiple segment membership for a given (very large) set of users. This leverages the power of in-database analytics as compared to using standard data mining libraries and is currently deployed on a real-world highly scalable distributed columnar database that powers several hundred campaigns and processes look-alike models for large online display advertisers. The results from the study demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other comparable techniques for predicting and expanding segments.			ashish@npario.com; pokuri@npario.com; krishna@npario.com; ankurt@u.washington.edu						0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-0-7695-4925-5				2012							914	914		10.1109/ICDMW.2012.73		1	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BFQ26	WOS:000320946500129

Recent machine learning approaches include methods of data mining, statistical analysis, clustering, and estimation that support activity-based intelligence. We seek to explore contemporary methods in activity analysis using machine learning techniques that discover and characterize behaviors that enable grouping, anomaly detection, and adversarial intent prediction. To evaluate these methods, we describe the mathematics and potential information theory metrics to characterize behavior. A scenario is presented to demonstrate the concept and metrics that could be useful for layered sensing behavior pattern learning and analysis. We leverage work on group tracking, learning and clustering approaches; as well as utilize information theoretical metrics for classification, behavioral and event pattern recognition, and activity and entity analysis. The performance evaluation of activity analysis supports high-level information fusion of user alerts, data queries and sensor management for data extraction, relations discovery, and situation analysis of existing data.

In this article, we present an inductive database system that does not rely on a new data mining query language, but on plain SQL. We propose an intuitive and elegant framework based on virtual mining views, which are relational tables that virtually contain the complete output of data mining algorithms executed over a given data table. We show that several types of patterns and models that are implicitly present in the data, such as itemsets, association rules, and decision trees, can be represented and queried with SQL using a unifying framework. As a proof of concept, we illustrate a complete data mining scenario with SQL queries over the mining views, which is executed in our system.

Many algorithms can perform clustering in a simple and efficient manner, but have drawbacks, such as the lack of a way to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters in the dataset and the possibility of getting stuck in local optima solutions. To try and reduce these drawbacks this work proposes a new clustering algorithm based on Artificial Immune Systems. This algorithm is characterized by the generation of multiple simultaneous high quality solutions in terms of the number of clusters in the database and the use of a cost function that explicitly evaluates the quality of clusters, minimizing the inconvenience of getting stuck in local optima solutions.

Necessary data were obtained from Multiagent Internet Measurement System - MWING, which monitored web transactions issued by MWING's agent located in Las Vegas, US and targeting web servers in Europe. Data contains the measurements, which were taken every day at the same time: at 06:00 a.m., 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m, during the period of May, 2009. First, the preliminary analysis of measurement data was conducted. Next, the structural analysis, which includes directional variogram approximated with the theoretical model, was performed. Subsequently, the spatial forecast (from one week in advance) of total time of downloading data from Web servers was calculated. The analysis of server activity on a particular weekday for a period of a few weeks in selected time intervals and considered forecasted errors was performed. Finally, the results of forecast were analyzed in detail, followed by the determination of subsequent; research directions to improve Web performance forecasts.

These methods usually assume a small number of classes, typically less than ten, and reach their limit in case of too many classes. In this paper, we extend discretization and value grouping methods, based on the partitioning of both the input and class variables. The best joint partitioning is searched by maximizing a Bayesian model selection criterion. We show how to exploit this preprocessing method as a preparation for the naive Bayes classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the approach in the case of hundreds of classes.

Internet surveillance aims to predict and prevent attacks and to assist in finding suspects based on information from the web. However, the amount of data on the internet rapidly increases and it is time consuming to monitor many websites. In this paper, we present a novel method to automatically monitor trends and find anomalies on the internet. The system was tested on Twitter data. The results showed that it can successfully recognize abnormal changes in activity or emotion.

The IDS need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Although many established techniques and commercial products exist, their effectiveness leaves room for improvement. A great deal of research has been carried out on intrusion detection in a distributed environment to palliate the drawbacks of centralized approaches. However, distributed IDS suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc. In this paper, we propose a distributed IDS that integrates the desirable features provided by the multi-agent methodology with the high accuracy of data mining techniques. The proposed system relies on a set of intelligent agents that collect and analyze the network connections, and data mining techniques are shown to be useful to detect the intrusions. Carried out experiments showed superior performance of our distributed IDS compared to the centralized one.

Data sets under analysis are no longer only static databases, but also data streams in which concepts and data distributions may not be stable over time. However, most learning algorithms produced so far are based on the assumption that data comes from a fixed distribution, so they are not suitable to handle concept drifts. Moreover, some concept drifts applications requires fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re) trained with the latest available data. But the process of labeling data is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to unlabeled data acquisition, thus only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are also based on the assumption that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenge in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach was used to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. In this paper, we extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm using a single classifier, which naturally adapts to concept changes, without any explicit drift detection mechanism. Its built-in mechanisms provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually "forgetting" older knowledge as older labeled data items became less influent on the classification of newer data items. Some computer simulation are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A vehicle departs loaded from the depot, visit every customer delivering a certain amount of goods according to their demand, and optionally pickup items from those customers, receiving a profit for each pickup realized. The vehicle has a limited capacity, which may turn impossible to attend all pickups, or make this unprofitable if it has to come back later in the customer after unloaded enough to fit the pickup demand. The objective is to find a minimal cost feasible route, the cost being the total travel costs minus the total revenue earned with pickups. Despite the many real applications, the literature is scarce. We propose an evolutionary algorithm whose crossover and mutation operators use data mining strategies to capture good characteristics from the parents and the population. Solutions are improved by a VNS algorithm during the process, and new solutions are introduced regularly to avoid premature convergence, using good constructive algorithms. The algorithm was tested with a benchmark of 68 instances, and the results compared to other publications. The results show the robustness of the method and 7 new solutions were found, including 2 new optimal solutions.

How much data to use, or when to stop the learning process, are the key questions. In the paper, we present an approach for an early assessment of the extracted knowledge (classification models) in the terms of performance (accuracy). The key questions are answered by detecting the point of convergence, i.e., where the classification model's performance does not improve any more even when adding more data items to the learning set. For the learning process termination criteria we developed a set of equations for detection of the convergence that follow the basic principles of the learning curve. The developed solution was evaluated on real datasets. The results of the experiment prove that the solution is well-designed: the learning process stopping criteria are not subjected to local variance and the convergence is detected where it actually has occurred.

Network operators need to know who relies on a failed network asset (e.g. IP address, network service, application) and what critical operations are impacted. This requires a mapping between network assets and the critical operations that depend on them, currently a manual and tedious task. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of networks and missions, manual mappings of network assets to operational missions rapidly become outdated. This paper describes one approach to modeling the complex relationships between cyber assets and the missions and users that depend on them, using an ontology developed in conjunction with practitioners and cyber mission assurance researchers. We describe the "Camus" (cyber assets, missions and users) proof of concept, which uses this ontology and automatically populates that model from data already on the network. We discuss the technical approach and provide examples of query results returned by the model. We conclude by describing ongoing work to enhance this proof of concept and its potential applicability to support mission assurance and mission impact solutions.

The approach which we have taken makes use of linear discriminant approaches to classify normal, and non-normal, style of email correspondence for each sender. This change in email style could be used to provide an early indication of virtual harassment/ bullying.. This approach has great potential for use in large organization where it is often appears to be hard to identify unacceptable information transmission between two colleagues. By identifying indicative behavior it should be possible to instigate company anti bullying processes in a more timely manner. This should ensure a more effective work force in terms of work place efficiency and reduction of stress related absence resulting from harassment or bullying. We show that it is possible to improve the identification of the number of sender signature styles contained within the email pages, irrespective of the number of pages concerned. The implications of the use of SSSs, and ASSSs, for identification of future email interactions are discussed.

Particularly, we seek models that can account for partially overlaid and interleaved patterns in biological sequences. Our proposed context-switching model (cswHMM) is designed as a variable-order hidden Markov model (HMM) with a specific structure that allows switching control between two or more sub-models. An important feature of our model is the ability of its sub-models to store their last active state, so when each sub-model resumes control it can continue uninterrupted. This is a fundamental variation on the closely related jumping HMMs. A combination of as few as two simple linear HMMs can describe sequences with complicated mixed dependencies. Tests of this approach suggest that a combination of HMMs for protein sequence analysis, such as pattern mining based HMMs or profile HMMs, with the context-switching approach can improve the descriptive ability and performance of the models.

Generating Optimized Fuzzy Partitions to Classification and Considerations to Management Imprecise Data	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence (IJCCI 2010)	OCT 24-26, 2010	Valencia, SPAIN			Fuzzy discretization; Fuzzy set; Genetic algorithm; Fuzzy decision tree	RULES	Many algorithms for classification need to discretize the continuous attributes for their development. Therefore the discretization of continuous attributes is a very important part in data mining. In this paper, we propose a technique for discretizing continuous attributes by means of a series of fuzzy sets which constitute a fuzzy partition of the domain of these attributes. The definition of these sets is very important as it affects the results obtained in the classification algorithms. Throughout this document we present a strategy to construct fuzzy sets in order to improve classification results. Additionally, we give some ideas about how to improve this strategy in order to work with another kinds of data. Also, we show various experimental results which evaluate our proposal in comparison with previously existing ones and where the results have been statistically validated.	[Cadenas, J.

To test the techniques that are designed in this area, there is the need for repositories of low quality datasets. Currently we can find various data mining techniques that are designed to handle some kind of low quality data. But, as far as we get our knowledge, it has not yet designed a software tool focused on the creation/management of low quality datasets that will help us to create repositories to facilitate the testing and comparison of the above techniques. We present in this paper a software tool which can create/manage low quality data. Even if a technique doesn't manage low quality data, the tool permits to transform the low quality data by other data that technique can manage.

We also observe a significant increase in the number of fraud cases, resulting in billions of dollars losses each year worldwide. Therefore it is important and necessary to developed and apply techniques that can assist in fraud detection, which motivates our research. This work aims to apply and evaluate some computational intelligence techniques to identify fraud in electronic transactions, more specifically in credit card operations. In order to evaluate the techniques, we define a concept of economic efficiency and apply them in an actual dataset of the most popular Brazilian electronic payment service. Our results show good performance in fraud detection, presenting significant gains in comparison to the actual scenario of the company.

The time series mining is an important tool to analyze the huge quantity of climate data. Here, we propose the Sequential Association Rules from Time series - SART method to mine association rules in time series that keeps the information of time between related events through an overlapped sliding-window approach. Also the proposed method mines association rules, while the previous ones produce frequent sequences, adding the semantic information of confidence, which was not previously defined by sequential patterns. Experiments were conducted with real data collected from climate sensors. The results showed that the proposed method increases the number of mined patterns when compared with the traditional sequential mining, revealing related events that occur over time. Also, the method adds the semantic information related to the confidence and time to the mined patterns.

A Preliminary Study on Missing Data Imputation in Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems of Subgroup Discovery	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)/International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)/IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE-CEC)/IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE-WCCI)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE		Subgroup Discovery; Evolutionary Fuzzy System; Missing Data Imputation	SOFTWARE TOOL; ALGORITHMS; VALUES; KEEL	In real-life data, a loss of information is frequent in data mining due to the presence of missing values in the attributes. Missing values can occur due to problems in the manual data entry procedures, equipment errors or incorrect measurements. The presence of missing values in attributes conditions the results obtained by any knowledge extraction approach. Specifically, this problem could lead in subgroup discovery to a loss of quality of results obtained by subgroups on measures such as sensitivity, confidence, significance or unusualness. This paper presents an experimental study to analyse the effect of different missing data imputation mechanisms within subgroup discovery algorithms based on evolutionary fuzzy systems presented throughout the literature. The analysis is carried out with a large number of data sets obtained from KEEL repository. Among all the imputation techniques, the imputation method K-Nearest Neighbour outstands as the best option. In summary, if experts need to analyse a problem with a high percentage of missing values they must use this imputation method in order to treat data in a correct way and also to obtain a meaningful descriptive knowledge. In addition, results also show that the evolutionary fuzzy system with the best results is the algorithm NMEEF-SD in the missing values scenario.	[Carmona, C. J.; Gonzalez, P.; del Jesus, M.

This paper presents a study carried out over a specialized database containing information about a large number of certificates acquired by Portuguese companies, in the period 2008-2010. Certification is a voluntary process that can be crucial to the survival of a company in its business area. The set of certificates that a company must acquire may vary according to several factors, like the region where the company is located or its sector of activity. The application of data mining techniques in this area allows making predictions about which licenses a company may acquire that best fit its business characteristics and that bring some advantages in its business activities.

J	Casali, A; Ernst, C				Casali, Alain; Ernst, Christian			Discovering Correlated Parameters in Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes: A Data Mining Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Chi(2) correlation statistic; data mining; decision rule; semiconductor manufacturing	KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY	Data mining tools are nowadays becoming more and more popular in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, and especially in yield-oriented enhancement techniques. This is because conventional approaches fail to extract hidden relationships between numerous complex process control parameters. In order to highlight correlations between such parameters, we propose in this paper a complete knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) model. The mining heart of the model uses a new method derived from association rules programming, and is based on two concepts: decision correlation rules and contingency vectors. The first concept results from a cross fertilization between correlation and decision rules. It enables relevant links to be highlighted between sets of values of a relation and the values of sets of targets belonging to the same relation. Decision correlation rules are built on the twofold basis of the chi-squared measure and of the support of the extracted values. Due to the very nature of the problem, levelwise algorithms only allow extraction of results with long execution times and huge memory occupation. To offset these two problems, we propose an algorithm based both on the lectic order and contingency vectors, an alternate representation of contingency tables. This algorithm is the basis of our KDD model software, called MineCor. An overall presentation of its other functions, of some significant experimental results, and of associated performances are provided and discussed.

Based on the probabilistic models of input parameters, such as load variation and the occurrence of contingencies, Monte Carlo-type simulation is performed to iteratively evaluate the system time domain responses. The dynamic probabilistic attributes are then analyzed using time series data mining techniques, namely Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in order to recognize the system DVRs based on the patterns associated to three different short-term stability phenomena. The vulnerability criterion consists in the possibility of some N-1 contingencies driving the system to further undesirable events (i.e. N-2 contingencies), which could be considered as the beginning of a cascading event. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the methodology in finding hidden patterns in dynamic electric signals as well as in numerically mapping power system DVRs due to its ability to consider relevant operating statistics, including the most probably severe events that could lead the system to potential insecure conditions and subsequent blackouts.

The research in the area of information retrieval, data mining, marketing or e-commerce shows that integration of contextual information into recommendation system would further improve the efficiency and capability of recommendation system for individual users. In this work the conceptual framework of an user oriented pedestrian navigation system with the capability of integrating context awareness in route recommendation is proposed. A very small pilot study is undertaken to measure the effectiveness of the recommendation system with incorporation of context awareness.

Diverse classification techniques had been already proposed in the literature for both in the run of the mill environment and distributed environment. Mining of decision trees in the distributed environment can be able to handle the large amount of data but with high communication cost. A new distributed communication decision tree algorithm is proposed here which reduces the communication cost for the transmission of the data in the distributed and heterogeneous environment.

There is a need of effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) to protect computers from these unauthorized or malicious actions. Different soft-computing based methods have been proposed in recent years for the development of intrusion detection systems. In this paper we are proposing a contemporary approach for network intrusion detection which is significantly improvises the prediction of network intrusions. The proposed technique is a fusion of efficient data mining technique such as Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, neural network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experiments and evaluations of proposed method were performed with Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset and we have used sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and F-value as the evaluation metric parameters. Our approach achieved detection accuracy of about 99.96% for DOS attacks, 99.73% for PROBE, 99.93% for R2L and 99.87% for U2R attacks. Our proposed technique yielded very good results and was compared with the other existing techniques to prove its validity.	[Chandrashekar, A.

Sequence motifs in proteins are some subsequences which appear frequently. Motifs often denote important functional regions in proteins and can be used to characterize a protein family or discover the function of proteins. The SP-index algorithm was proposed to find sequence motifs containing gaps of arbitrary size. To find motifs, it constructs B-trees for indexing the occurring positions of short segments. Then, to check whether a long pattern composed of short segments appears frequently, the SP-index algorithm needs to test a large number of nodes of those B-trees, which may not be efficient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Bit-Pattern-based (BP) algorithm to improve the efficiency of the SP-index algorithm. First, the BP algorithm transforms the protein sequences into bit patterns. Then, instead of testing a large number of nodes in the SP-index algorithm, the BP algorithm utilizes bit operations, i.e., AND, OR, shifting and masking, to efficiently find sequence motifs. The BP algorithm also performs a pruning step to reduce the processing time. From the experimental results on biological and synthetic data sets, we show that the BP algorithm needs shorter processing time than the SP-index algorithm.

The patients receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) which they need to take every day for the rest of their life. To maintain treatment efficacy, it is necessary to avoid the event of treatment failure. In order to assist physicians monitoring HIV patients this paper propose temporal data mining to predict treatment outcome by providing visual representation of prediction results. Temporal abstraction is used to classify time series data into discrete categories, each represented typically with a symbol. Artificial neural networks are used in this study where the problem of unbalanced data size occurs during the learning process. Two under-sampling techniques are proposed. With the nearest samples to cluster center technique, accuracy is achieved at levels higher than 85% and the discovered patterns correspond with real world diagnosis where viral load is the primary feature to predict treatment outcome.

Power Stock Markets are such highly dynamic and competitive auction environments, additionally perplexed by constrained power laws in the various stages, from production to transmission and consumption. As with all real-time auctioning environments, the limited time available for decision making provides an ideal testbed for autonomous agents to develop bidding strategies that exploit time series prediction. Within the context of this paper, we present Cassandra, a dynamic platform that fosters the development of Data-Mining enhanced Multi-agent systems. Special attention was given on the efficiency and reusability of Cassandra, which provides Plug-n-Play capabilities, so that users may adapt their solution to the problem at hand. Cassandra's functionality is demonstrated through a pilot case, where autonomously adaptive Recurrent Neural Networks in the form of Echo State Networks are encapsulated into Cassandra agents, in order to generate power load and settlement price prediction models in typical Day-ahead Power Markets. The system has been tested in a real-world scenario, that of the Greek Energy Stock Market.

However, there are numerous features that can be extracted from fruits and vegetables such as colour, texture and shape. As a result, it is effort consuming to identify suitable features ad hoc. Thus, data mining is required to discover the most discriminative features for recognition. This paper aims to extend the usage of data mining algorithm to image domain. Data mining algorithm is preferred to other feature selection algorithms because it discovers nuggets of knowledge that can be understood by human whereas classic feature selection techniques provide outputs that can only be managed by learning algorithms	[Chaw, J.

However, in the distributed systems, trust model is so complex that it is very difficult to quantify and predict accurately. Thus, according to human psychological cognitive behavior, a trust predicting method based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed in this paper. Moreover, due to the stochastic of initial weights' assignment and search complexity for optimal weights, training algorithm can easily be trapped into local optimum, or be slow to converge or even diverge. Focusing on these problems, a learning rate in network training is proposed here. By using adaptive data mining and knowledge discovery in multidimensional trust attributes, the model also overcomes the problem of insufficient ability of data processing in traditional models.

The proposed 'PARA' model, which is designed to diagnose and correct service failures, takes its name from the initial letters of the four analytical stages of the model: (i) 'primary diagnosis': (ii) 'advanced diagnosis'; (iii) 'review': and (iv) 'action'. In the primary-diagnosis stage, the customer-complaint database is comprehensively analysed to identify themes and categories of complaints. In the advanced-diagnosis stage, a data-mining technique is employed to investigate the relationship between the categories of customer complaints and the deficiencies of the service system. In the review stage, the identified weaknesses of the service system are reviewed and awareness of these weaknesses is enhanced among the organisation's employees. In the action stage, a strategy of action plans for improvement is developed. An empirical case study is conducted to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the 'PARA' model. The paper concludes by summarising the advantages of the proposed model and the implications for future research. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It first transforms quantitative transactions into fuzzy sets. Then, utility of each fuzzy itemsets is then calculated according to the given external utility table. If the value is large than or equals to the minimum utility ratio, it will be considered as a High Utility Fuzzy Itemset (HUFI). Finally, contingency tables are calculated and used for checking those HUFI satisfy specific four criteria or not. If yes, it is a High Coherent Utility Fuzzy Itemsets (HCUFI). Experiments on the foodmart dataset are also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The Apriori algorithm is a method for association rule mining, a data mining technique. Although a lot of mining approaches have been proposed based on the Apriori algorithm, most focus on positive association rules, such as "If milk is bought, then bread is bought". However, such a rule may be misleading since customers that buy milk may not buy bread. In this paper, an algorithm for mining highly coherent rules that takes the properties of propositional logic into consideration is proposed. The derived association rules may thus be more thoughtful and reliable. Experiments are conducted on simulation data sets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

However, some comment problems of those approaches are that (1) a minimum support should be predefined, and it is hard to set the appropriate one, and (2) the derived rules usually expose common-sense knowledge which may not be interested in business point of view. In this paper, we thus proposed an algorithm for mining fuzzy coherent rules to overcome those problems with the properties of propositional logic. It first transforms quantitative transactions into fuzzy sets. Then, those generated fuzzy sets are collected to generate candidate fuzzy coherent rules. Finally, contingency tables are calculated and used for checking those candidate fuzzy coherent rules satisfy four criteria or not. Experiments on the foodmart dataset are also made to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It first encodes the membership functions of each item class (category) into a chromosome according to the given taxonomy. The two objective functions of each chromosome are then calculated. The first one is the summation of large 1-itemsets of each item in different concept levels, and the second one is the suitability of membership functions. The fitness value of each individual is then evaluated by these two objective functions. After the GA process terminates, various sets of membership functions could be used for deriving multiple-level fuzzy association rules according to decision maker. Experimental results on a simulation dataset also show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Second, MapReduce has emerged as a suitable framework for simplified parallel application development for many classes of applications, including data mining and machine learning applications that benefit from accelerators. This paper focuses on the challenge of scaling a MapReduce application using the CPU and GPU together in an integrated architecture. We develop different methods for dividing the work, which are the map-dividing scheme, where map tasks are divided between both devices, and the pipelining scheme, which pipelines the map and the reduce stages on different devices. We develop dynamic work distribution schemes for both the approaches. To achieve high load balance while keeping scheduling costs low, we use a runtime tuning method to adjust task block sizes for the map-dividing scheme. Our implementation of MapReduce is based on a continuous reduction method, which avoids the memory overheads of storing key-value pairs. We have evaluated the different design decisions using 5 popular MapReduce applications. For 4 of the applications, our system achieves 1.21 to 2.1 speedup over the better of the CPU-only and GPU-only versions. The speedups over a single CPU core execution range from 3.25 to 28.68. The runtime tuning method we have developed achieves very low load imbalance, while keeping scheduling overheads low. Though our current work is specific to MapReduce, many underlying ideas are also applicable towards intra-node acceleration of other applications on integrated CPU-GPU nodes.

Cloud computing, a newly developed framework for parallel computing, offers great advantages over traditional parallel computing in big data processing. In this paper, we present a parallel frequent pattern mining for price fluctuation based on cloud computing. Firstly, original dataset is pre-processed and transformed to meet the requirement of frequent pattern mining model. Secondly, the mining task is described and multi-supports-based frequent pattern mining problem is defined. Finally, the experiment was carried out on a cluster of 12 computer nodes with map-reduce framework as a basis. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively find the frequent patterns in high efficiency, which can satisfy actual application.

The essence of stream processor is getting high performance according to executing thousands of threads parallelly. It is widely used in scientific computing, data mining, video quality analysis and other fields. But mass threads means the high costs of thread synchronization. Mass computing time is wasted in the reduction of thread data. This paper provides a binary reduction algorithm based on three basic reduction algorithms according to CUDA parallel computing model. Experiments show that the performance of binary reduction algorithm is better than three basic reduction algorithms and it has great scalability.

However, most of the enterprises in Taiwan do not have clear assessment standard and analysis mechanism on educational training, which usually leads to bad implementation results. Therefore, in order to enhance enterprise's training-implementing ability, Taiwan has designed a set of Taiwan TrainQuali System (TTQS) using a training quality score card to perform the assessment and audit. It is important to understand whether the introducing TTQS mechanism to an enterprise can enhance business operation performance and enterprise's competitiveness, and it is also important to know also if the entire training-implementing attitude of the training-implementing personnel will affect the assessment and audit result of an enterprise. This study has investigated, through the attitude transition of training-implementing personnel who have participated in the learning curriculum, if the attitude transition will affect the current status of an enterprise and what kind of benefits it will bring. In this study, Genetic Algorithm is associated with Support Vector Machine technique to perform data mining and analysis. The experimental results show that within an enterprise, enterprise supervisor and training personnel of different standing points will have different thinking on the introduction of TTQS, and there is also significant difference on the educational training attitude too. For the difference of entire attitude change before and after the participation of TTQS curriculum, the data of the training personnel are better than that of the enterprise supervisor.

In this paper, we use another semi-supervised method called label propagation to help detect clusters. We propose two new semi-supervised algorithms named K-SSMST and M-SSMST. Both of them aim to discover clusters of diverse density and arbitrary shape. Based on Minimum Spanning Tree's algorithm variant, K-SSMST can automatically find natural clusters in a dataset by using K labeled data objects where K is the number of clusters. M-SSMST can detect new clusters with insufficient semi-supervised information. Our algorithms have been tested on various artificial and UCI datasets. The results demonstrate that the algorithm's accuracy is better than other supervised and semi-supervised approaches.

Analysis on the relationship between educational settings and student performance can be useful in predicting student performance in a class. In addition, this analysis is able to help identifying the key indicators that may affect the students' final grade. In this paper, we present the initial work on the development of a predictive model that can predict student performance in a class to assist lecturers in improving student's learning process. We identified the predictor variables that can be used in our predictive model. The predictor variables of this model are based on attributes from different educational settings such as coursework marks, psychosocial factors and Course Management System (CMS) log data. These variables are collected from an advanced programming course in an institute of higher learning in Malaysia. This study provides a theoretical model that shows how data from different educational settings can contribute in the prediction of student's final grade. The results indicate that coursework marks has the most significant positive relationship with the student's final grade followed by total number of materials downloaded from CMS.	[Chen, Y.

PPI is formed by multiple proteins and play an important role. There are too many PPIs resources in used. Combination of the separated PPI systems is very promising as the data among different PPI resources are complementary. Integration of PPI of various resources can provide us more complete and more comprehensive information. In this paper, we design a PPI integration system which can get information from multiple various resources and then integrate the information together. The system is able to yield novel information for researchers to carry on further study on bioinformation.

As such they are of enormous potential value to studies ranging from data mining to social anthropology. To realize the potential, this study investigates improvements of algorithms specifically tailored for the discovery of latent socio-demographic patterns in Twitter metadata. These newly improved hybrid algorithms improve on existing ones in terms of speed and scalability (from thousands of records to millions). Testing on a real-world Twitter data set (similar to 7.4 million messages) reveals emergent patterns in global day-to-day Twitter activity. The results demonstrate novel insight when applied to real-world Twitter data, practical large-scale applications of the methods, and suggest potential areas of future research.

They are the people who represent the university in the real world. University alumni systems exist to promote active and ongoing relationships between graduates and their alma mater. However, it is a big challenge how to enhance mentoring between alumni and current students. This paper proposes to incorporate selected features of social networking and data mining into alumni systems to boost mentoring between alumni and students. There are two major contributions of this research project, a framework for smart alumni systems (SAS), and a proof-of-concept prototype implementation of an SAS subset. The SAS framework expands stakeholder roles beyond alumni to include current students, faculty, staff, and guests. The framework supports social networking style interactions within and across stakeholder types, for activities such as mentoring, fund-raising, curriculum development, etc. In the SAS framework, the primary purpose of data mining is to provide recommendations for establishing associations between stakeholders so that helps current students to get better mentoring; a secondary purpose is analyzing results from university and departmental surveys. The proof-of-concept smart alumni system prototype has been implemented as a web-based interface.The prototype implements stakeholder roles for students, faculty and alumni, and supports social networking features of friends, groups and messaging. Basic data mining algorithms are used to provide a ranked list of recommendations for stakeholder relationships for friends or groups.

A data mining approach to evolutionary optimisation of noisy multi-objective problems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; evolutionary computations; multi-objective optimisation; noise	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; ENVIRONMENTS; SELECTION; FITNESS	Many real world optimisation problems have opposing objective functions which are subjected to the influence of noise. Noise in the objective functions can adversely affect the stability, performance and convergence of evolutionary optimisers. This article proposes a Bayesian frequent data mining (DM) approach to identify optimal regions to guide the population amidst the presence of noise. The aggregated information provided by all the solutions helped to average out the effects of noise. This article proposes a DM crossover operator to make use of the rules mined. After implementation of this operator, a better convergence to the true Pareto front is achieved at the expense of the diversity of the solution. Consequently, an ExtremalExploration operator will be proposed in the later part of this article to help curb the loss in diversity caused by the DM operator. The result is a more directive search with a faster convergence rate. The search is effective in decision space where the Pareto set is in a tight cluster. A further investigation of the performance of the proposed algorithm in noisy and noiseless environment will also be studied with respect to non-convexity, discontinuity, multi-modality and uniformity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on ZDT and other benchmarks problems. The results of the simulations indicate that the proposed method is effective in handling noise and is competitive against the other noise tolerant algorithms.	[Goh, C.

Especially in scientific data visualization, pre-fetching can reduce the IO waiting time. In order to increase the accuracy, we apply a data mining technique to extract hidden information. More specifically, we apply a data mining technique for discovering the hidden contexts in data access patterns and make prediction based on the inferred context to boost the accuracy. In particular, we performed Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), a mixture model based algorithm popular in the text mining area, to mine hidden contexts from the collected user access patterns and, then, we run a predictor within the discovered context. We further improve PLSA by applying the Deterministic Annealing (DA) method to overcome the local optimum problem. In this paper we demonstrate how we can apply PLSA and DA optimization to mine hidden contexts from users data access patterns and improve predictive pre-fetcher performance.

We use the borders, classical in data mining, for the Constrained Cube. These borders are the boundaries of the solution space and can support classification tasks. However, the borders do not make possible to retrieve the measure values and therefore cannot be used to answer OLAP queries. This is why we introduce two new and reduced representations without measure loss: the Constrained Closed Cube and Constrained Quotient Cube. The former representation is based on the concept of cube closure. It is one of the smallest possible representations of cubes. Provided with the Constrained Closed Cube and thus by storing the minimal information, it is possible to answer efficiently queries which can be answered from the Constrained Cube itself. The latter representation is supported by the structure of the Quotient Cube which was proposed to summarize data cubes. The Quotient Cube is revisited in order to provide it with a closure-based semantics and thus adapt it to the context of the Constrained Cube. The resulting Constrained Quotient Cube is less reduced than the Constrained Closed Cube but it preserves the "specialization / generalization" property of the Quotient Cube which makes it possible to navigate within the Constrained Cube. We also state the relationship between the two introduced representations and the one based on the borders. Experiments performed on various data sets are intended to measure the size of the three representations. As expected in the most common situations (real data), the space reduction for each representation is significant comparatively to the size of the Constrained Cube. Thus depending on the user future needs, each of the proposed representations supplies a significant space reduction for a specific use: Borders for OLAP classification, Constrained Closed Cube for OLAP querying and Constrained Quotient Cube for cube navigation.

Our results were conducted on four typical series of incomplete data sets with 5% increments of missing attribute values. Two interpretations of missing attribute values were used: lost and "do not care" conditions. We conclude that the best approach (choice of the interpretation of missing attribute values and selection of the best type of approximation) depends on a data set. Probabilistic approximations are constructed from characteristic sets. The number of distinct probabilities associated with characteristic sets is much larger for data sets with "do not care" conditions than with data sets with lost values. Therefore, for data sets with "do not care" conditions the number of probabilistic approximations is also larger.

There are currently ways to discover problems using both noninvasive and invasive techniques. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has recently developed a noninvasive system called the Squid Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) that can be used to gather fetal heartbeat data. This raw data, however, must then be analyzed by a human being to determine if there is a problem with a given fetus. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a computer to determine if a fetus is in a healthy or unhealthy state by the employment of a technique that will allow for rapid analysis using data mining.

Optimizing the debugging phase can help to reduce development time significantly. A powerful approach used extensively during this phase is the analysis of execution traces. However, huge trace volumes make manual trace analysis unmanageable. In such situations, Data Mining can help by automatically discovering interesting patterns in large amounts of data. In this paper, we are interested in discovering periodic behaviors in multimedia applications. Therefore, we propose a new pattern mining approach for automatically discovering all periodic patterns occurring in a multimedia application execution trace. Furthermore, gaps in the periodicity are of special interest since they can correspond to cracks or drop-outs in the stream. Existing periodic pattern definitions are too restrictive regarding the size of the gaps in the periodicity. So, in this paper, we specify a new definition of frequent periodic patterns that removes this limitation. Moreover, in order to simplify the analysis of the set of frequent periodic patterns we propose two complementary approaches: (a) a lossless representation that reduces the size of the set and facilitates its analysis, and (b) a tool to identify pairs of "competitors" where a pattern breaks the periodicity of another pattern. Several experiments were carried out on embedded video and audio decoding application traces, demonstrating that using these new patterns it is possible to identify abnormal behaviors.

One of the fundamental researches of links between objects is link prediction. Many link prediction algorithms have been proposed and perform quite well, however, most of those algorithms only concerns network structure in terms of traditional graph theory, which lack information about evolving network. In this paper we proposed a novel tensor-based prediction method, which is designed through two steps: First, tracking time-dependent network snapshots in adjacency matrices which form a multi-way tensor by using exponential smoothing method. Second, apply Common Neighbor algorithm to compute the degree of similarity for each nodes. This algorithm is quite different from other tensor-based algorithms, which also mentioned in this paper. In order to estimate the accuracy of our link prediction algorithm, we employ various popular datasets of social networks and information platforms, such as Facebook and Wikipedia networks.

In this chapter we give a large view, firstly of what could be a community in a social network, and then we list the most popular techniques to detect such communities. Some of these techniques were particularly developed in the SNA context, while other are adaptations of classical clustering techniques.

For this purpose the framework for the best rank-R tensor decomposition is presented. This allows any multi-dimensional data reduction in accordance with chosen ranks. Since computations of tensor decomposition require floating-point operations, we propose special data scaling procedure to allow memory efficient representation in the fixed-point representation. The proposed method is exemplified with processing of the monochrome and color video sequences. The method shows promising results and can be easily applied to other types of multidimensional data.

But were and when in the system the local search should be applied and does it really speed up evolutionary search is a still an open question. In this paper we investigate the influence of the memetic extensions on globally induced regression and model trees. These evolutionary induced trees in contrast to the typical top-down approaches globally search for the best tree structure, tests at internal nodes and models at the leaves. Specialized genetic operators together with local greedy search extensions allow to the efficient tree evolution. Fitness function is based on the Bayesian information criterion and mitigate the over-fitting problem. The proposed method is experimentally validated on synthetical and real-life datasets and preliminary results show that to some extent memetic approach successfully improve evolutionary induction.

In [1], [2], a new approach to rapid change detection and automatic summarization of large documents was introduced. This approach is based on a theory of social networks and ideas from image processing and especially on the Helmholtz Principle from the Gestalt Theory of human perception. In this article we modify, optimize and verify the approach from [1], [2] to unusual behaviour detection and information extraction from small documents.

On the other hand, massive data from PMUs has also brought challenges to store, analyze and transmit results without causing a bottleneck in the available information processing infrastructure. In addition to the amount of data, the dimensionality of synchrophasor data is bound to increase with more PMUs coming into operation. In order to enable real time surveillance of the grid, high-speed synchrophasor data has to be processed before a new set of data arrives for processing. Machine learning techniques which are being studied for power systems may suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" thus, detrimentally affecting their performance. In this paper, we introduce an online technique to reduce dimensionality of synchrophasor data on the fly. This method will extract correlations between synchrophasor measurements such as voltage, current, frequency etc. and represent it with their principal components without the loss of too much information. The proposed method can be used as a pre-processor before storing or transmission of synchrophasor data where trends are more important than exact data.

The minimal-model semantics of causal discovery is an essential concept for the identification of a best fitting model in the sense of satisfactory consistent with the given data and be the simpler, less expressive model. Consistency is one of major measures of reliability in knowledge discovery. Therefore to develop an algorithm being able to derive a minimal model is an interesting topic in the are of reliable knowledge discovery. various causal induction algorithms and tools developed so far can not guarantee that the derived model is minimal and consistent. It was proved the MML induction approach introduced by Wallace, Keven and Honghua Dai is a minimal causal model learner. In this paper, we further prove that the developed minimal causal model learner is reliable in the sense of satisfactory consistency. The experimental results obtained from the tests on a number of both artificial and real models provided in this paper confirm this theoretical result.

Data mining methods are applied to predict the number of available bicycles at a certain time at a given station, to describe situations of empty and full stations and, to estimate the most common paths and usage patterns.

Later the players decide on functions they want to compute on the data without the servers needing to know which computation is done, while the computation should be secure against a malicious adversary corrupting a constant fraction of the players and servers. Using packed secret sharing, the data can be stored in a compact way but will only be accessible in a block-wise fashion. We explore the possibility of using I/O-efficient algorithms to nevertheless compute on the data as efficiently as if random access was possible. We show that for sorting, priority queues and data mining, this can indeed be done. We show actively secure protocols of complexity within a constant factor of the passively secure solution. As a technical contribution towards this goal, we develop techniques for generating values of form r, g(r) for random secret-shared r is an element of Z(q) and g(r). in a group of order q. This costs a constant number of exponentiation per player per value generated, even if less than n/3 players are malicious. This can be used for efficient distributed computing of Schnorr signatures. We further develop the technique so we can sign secret data in a distributed fashion at essentially the same cost.

Also, all the measured variables of these high-dimensional datasets are not relevant for understanding the underlying phenomena of interest. In this paper, firstly, similarities among the attributes are measured by computing similarity factors based on relative indiscernibility relation, a concept of rough set theory. Based on the similarity factors, attribute similarity set AS = {(A ->(k) B)/A, B are attributes and B similar to A with similarity factor k} is formed which helps to construct a directed weighted graph with weights as the inverse of similarity factor k. Then a minimal spanning tree of the graph is generated, from which iteratively most important vertex is selected in reduct set. The iteration completes when the edge set is empty. Thus the selected attributes, from which edges emanate, are the most relevant attributes and are known as reduct. The proposed method has been applied on some benchmark datasets and the classification accuracy is calculated by various classifiers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Typically, the datasets constantly grow accumulating a large number of features, which are not equally important in decision-making. Moreover, the information often lacks completeness and has relatively low information density. Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental area of research in data mining domain. Rough Set Theory (RST), based on a mathematical concept, has become very popular in dimensionality reduction of large datasets. The method is used to determine a subset of attributes called reduct which can predict the decision concepts. In the paper, the concepts of discernibility relation and attribute dependency are integrated for the formation of a compact reduct set which not only reduces the complexity but also helps to achieve higher accuracy of the system. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by comparing classification accuracy with some existing dimension reduction algorithms, demonstrating superior result.

Classification task is one of the most studied tasks of data mining. In solving classification task of data mining, the classical algorithm such as Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) takes large computation time because the network grows over the training period i.e. the partial descriptions (PDs) in each layer grows in successive generations. Unlike PNN this proposed work restricts the growth of partial descriptions to a single layer. A greedy technique is then used to select a subset of PDs those who can best map the input-output relation in general. Performance of this model is compared with the results obtained from PNN. Simulation result shows that the performance of GPNN is encouraging for harnessing its power in data mining area and also better in terms of processing time than the PNN model.

A current unbalance this equation can lead to unwanted deviations of voltage or loss of revenue. With this, system operators must anticipate the load values in order to prepare the necessary corrective actions to operate the system with security. One of the possible actions is the purchase of energy consumption. Before, the operators of CELG - Goias Power Distribution Co. employ some empirical capabilities to predict the load. This paper describes new software used by these operators to help in the load forecasting. The proposed methodology presented in this paper is based on fuzzy concepts. The paper shows some forecasting with real data from CELG power system.

Many of these use non-linear models to handle complex data-relationships in the input data. Their lack of transparency, however, is problematic since comprehensibility is a key requirement in many potential application domains. Rule-extraction algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem for classification by extracting comprehensible rulesets from the often better performing, complex models. We present a new pedagogical rule extraction algorithm for regression, based on active learning, which can be combined with any existing rule induction technique. Empirical results show that the proposed ALPA-R rule extraction method improves on classical rule induction techniques, both in accuracy and fidelity.

The mechanism that the human immune system uses to detect and protect from organisms that threaten the human body is efficient and can be adapted to detect malware attacks. In this paper we propose a system to perform malware distributed collection, analysis and detection, this last inspired by the human immune system. After collecting malware samples from Internet, they are dynamically analyzed so as to provide execution traces at the operating system level and network flows that are used to create a behavioral model and to generate a detection signature. Those signatures serve as input to a malware detector, acting as the antibodies in the antigen detection process. This allows us to understand the malware attack and aids in the infection removal procedures.

Developing innovative data mining techniques and efficient parallel computational methods to implement them will be crucial in extracting useful knowledge from this raw unprocessed data, such as in discovering significant cellular subsystems from gene correlation networks. In this paper, we present a scalable combinatorial sampling technique, based on identifying maximum chordal subgraphs, that reduces noise from biological correlation networks, thereby making it possible to find biologically relevant clusters from the filtered network. We show how selecting the appropriate filter is crucial in maintaining the key structures from the original networks and uncovering new ones after removing noisy relationships. We also conduct one of the first comparisons in two important sensitivity criteria-the perturbation due to the vertex numbers of the network and perturbations due to data distribution. We demonstrate that our chordal-graph based filter is effective across many different vertex permutations, as is our parallel implementation of the sampling algorithm.

Attribute reduction is one of the most critical issues in rough set theory. Chen et. al. proposed an attribute reduction algorithm for decision information system based on the covering generalized rough sets. In this paper, we first point out that Chen's algorithm applies to the fifth, the sixth and the seventh type of covering generalized rough sets. Then we establish the equivalent relationship between covering and the reflexive and transitive relation. Moreover, we prove that attribute reduction based on covering in this paper is a special case of the one based on general binary relation proposed by Wang et. al. As a result, a new attribute reduction algorithm with lower time complexity is designed. With these discussion, the research provides theoretical and practical significance.

In recent years, a great amount of proposals have arisen for improving its performance. Among them, instance selection is highlighted due to its capabilities for improving the accuracy of the classifier and its efficiency simultaneously, by editing noise and reducing considerably the size of the training set. It is also possible to remark the role of feature and instance weighting as outstanding methodologies for improving further the performance of the nearest neighbor rule. In this work we present a new co-evolutionary algorithm for combining the former techniques. Its performance is compared with evolutionary approaches performing instance selection, instance weighting and feature weighting in isolation, as well as with the nearest neighbor classifier. The results obtained, contrasted through nonparametric statistical tests, supports the capabilities of co-evolution as a outstanding strategy for joining several proposals for enhancing the nearest neighbor rule.

Computing global predicates in such systems is usually very costly. The cost further increases when the data changes rapidly and computation has to follow these changes In this paper we describe a two step approach for dealing with these costs. First, we describe a highly efficient global algorithm which can be used to monitor a wide class of data mining models. Then, we use this algorithm as a feedback loop for the monitoring of complex functions of the data such as its outlier detection. Finally we would like to extend our future work is to show that how fail-stop process failures can be tolerated without check pointing or message logging.	[Devi, R.

However, there is a lack of data mining studies concerning this topic. This paper meets this void and uses a financial dataset as input for the estimated models. Bagged decision trees were utilized to cope with the high dimensionality. Two bagged decision trees were estimated: one using the whole dataset and one using the top 12 predictors. Both had the same predictive performance. This means we can highly reduce the computational complexity, without losing accuracy.

Usually databases are continuously updated with observations, and are related to heterogeneous data. Deep and continuous analysis on data could mine useful correlations, explain relations existing among data and cue searches for further evidences. The solution to the problem addressed before seems to deal both with the domain of Data Mining and with the domain of high level Data Fusion, that is Situation Assessment, Threat Assessment and Process Refinement, also synthesised as Situation Awareness. The focus of this paper is the definition of an architecture for a system adopting data mining techniques to adaptively discover clusters of information and relation among them, to classify observations acquired and to use the model of knowledge and the classification derived in order to assess situations, threats and refine the search for evidences. Sources of information taken into account are those related to the intelligence domain, as IMINT, HUMINT, ELINT, COMINT and other non-conventional sources. The algorithms applied refer to not supervised and supervised classification for rule exploitation, and adaptively built Hidden Markov Model for situation and threat assessment.

These existing organizations, in the past, often employed a centralized control over their dataset as a way to curb data integrity and data solidarity. In this instance, a central processing unit, often a single machine, could consume all resources, else not affording to process the data altogether. To solve these incumbent problems, distributed computing techniques arc being introduced to improve the efficiency of data processing. In this project, we present a framework to distribute processing resources for data mining tool, i.e. to provide the ability to distribute the processes, over a cloud software stack using open source tools and platforms. As a conclusion to this framework, we discussed the open source tools and platforms along with our preliminary investigation results.

We describe the use of a fuzzy Linguistic Summarisation (LS) technique for extracting linguistically interpretable scaled fuzzy weighted rules from student data describing prominent relationships between activity / engagement characteristics and achieved performance. We propose an intelligent framework for monitoring individual or group performance during activity and problem based learning tasks. The system can be used to more effectively evaluate new teaching approaches and methodologies, identify weaknesses and provide more personalised feedback on learner's progress. We present a case study and initial experiments in which we apply the fuzzy LS technique for analysing the effectiveness of using a Group Performance Model (GPM) to deploy Activity Led Learning (ALL) in a Master-level module. Results show that the fuzzy weighted rules can identify useful relationships between student engagement and performance providing a mechanism allowing educators to transparently evaluate teaching and factors effecting student performance, which can be incorporated as part of an automated intelligent analysis and feedback system.

Besides defining an ontology in terms of concepts and relations, the actual process of populating an ontology with individuals has become a more and more time-consuming task due to the multitude of information sources. Therefore, the extraction of proper individuals may be very difficult when one is dealing with such amount of information freely available on the web and with so many classes within the hierarchy. On the other side, the classical approach of populating ontologies consists of parsing the input and matching it against certain regular expressions. Due to its intrinsic limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that is used to create rules by reading the predefined ontologies (mostly generated via expert knowledge) and later to apply them on the given text. The ants build individuals iteratively by searching keywords in the text that better fit as values for the attributes defined within each ontology class. The validation results prove that our method provides more specific individuals than classic pattern matching techniques as the algorithm scans every word from the text in order to compare it against a list of keywords.

As usual, simplicity and high performance are two sides of a same coin. Our aim is to explore an easy-to-use classifier without losing its effectiveness. On this account, a single attribute based classification (SAC) algorithm is proposed. SAC first splits the original data set into multi one-dimensional data sets. After that, it creates a base classifier, e.g. C4.5, for each one-dimensional data, and then selects all classifiers having the highest accuracy. At last, SAC uses these selected classifiers to make prediction and the most frequent label is assigned to the new instance. Results of classification accuracy on 16 data sets from UCI machine learning repository indicate that the proposed method performs better in comparison with classical OneR algorithm. Experiments on high-dimensional data are also conducted to evaluate the proposed method, which demonstrates its scalability.

Algorithms like the Fuzzy C-Means and Possibilistic C-Means provide good result both for the static data and data streams. All clustering algorithms compute centers from chunk of data, what requires a lot of time. If the rate of incoming data is faster than speed of algorithm, part of data will be lost. To prevent such situation, some pre-processing algorithms should be used. The purpose of this paper is to propose a pre-processing method for clustering algorithms. Experimental results show that proposed method is appropriate to handle noisy data and can accelerate processing time.

However, because of the sudden improvement and change of modern IT Technology, some solutions become out of date and those should be replaced sooner or later, even if we consider the world of Enterprise Resource Planning systems. One can figure out that business requirements for software change management depend on specific business functions, industry, technologies and so on. This is true for the IT needs of logistics as well. With the existence of supply chain management, strong needs for a solid IT background came to life. These needs cover the fields of data mining, advanced business intelligence tools, and the move towards cloud computing and mobile devices as well. After overviewing some of the basic elements and challenges of supply change management, this paper tries to analyse two widespread ERPs, SAP and Dynamics AX, and compare them from logistics point of view. In this area the need for a long term reliable and supported solution and the need for the latest technology exist parallel. There is only a slight difference in the used technology, but a greater difference in the way business flows are handled.

First, use the measure to measure the importance of attribute, and get the granularity of the universe, and then repeat this procedure to every granule of the granularity, until the decision attribute has only one value for all granules, then we will describe every granule to get the rule. The analysis of the algorithm and the experiment show that the method presented is effective and reliable. Classification rules are the main target of association rule, decision tree and rough sets. A new algorithm to mine classification rules based on the importance of attribute value supported. This algorithm views the importance as the number of tuple pair that can be discernible by it, and the rules obtained from the constructed decision tree is equivalent to those obtained from ID3, which can be proved by the idea of rule fusion. However, this method is of low computation, and is more suitable to large database. Rough sets is a techniques applied to data mining problems. This paper presents a new method to extract efficiently classification rules from decision table. The new model uses rough set theory to help in decreasing the calculation need for building decision tree by using what is called reduct algorithm and a rules set (knowledge) is generated from the decision table. The reliable classifier architecture is obtained and its effectiveness is verified by the experiments comparing with traditional rough set approaches. Data mining research has made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on large databases.

This paper presents a new corpus for NEWS articles analysis in Persian called Persica. NEWS analysis includes NEWS classi?cation, topic discovery and classi?cation, trend discovery, category classification and many more procedures. Dealing with NEWS has special requirements. First of all it needs a valid and NEWS-content-enriched corpus to perform the experiments. Our Approach is based on a modified category classification and data normalization over Persian NEWS articles which has led to creation of a multipurpose Persian corpus which shows reasonable results in text mining outcomes. In the literature, regarding to our knowledge there are few Persian corpuses but none of them have Persian NEWS time trend characteristics. Empirical results on our benchmark indicate that in addition to reducing the problem dimensions and useless content, Persica keeps admissible validity and reliability in comparison with standard corpuses in the literature.

Furthermore, the incompliance to the treatment because of its high cost and related unfavorable effects makes its prediction of paramount importance. By using machine-learning techniques, a significantly accurate predictive model constructed to predict Egyptian patients' response based on their clinical and biochemical data. The model uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT) to achieve this goal. Two-hundred patients treated with Peg-IFN and RBV; 83 responders (41%), and 117 non-responders (59%) retrospectively studied to extract informative features and train the Neural Networks and Decision Trees. Optimization done by using six different Neural Network architectures, starting with an input layer of 12 neurons, a hidden layer of 70 to 180 neurons and an output layer containing a single neuron. For decision Trees (DTs), the CART classification algorithm was used. Six DTs with two classes, pruning levels of 9, 11, 13, and 17, and nodes from 45 to 61 investigated. Among the 12 features in the study, the most statistically significant informative features were the patient's Histology activity index, fibrosis, viral-load, Alfa-feta protein and albumin. Validation of the models on a 20% test set was then performed. The best and average accuracy for the ANN and DT models were 0.76 and 0.69, and 0.80 and 0.72 respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.39, and 0.89 and 0.78 respectively. We conclude that decision trees gave a higher accuracy in predicting response and would help in proper therapy options for patients.

This paper presents a generic classification model based on a rough set approach and decision rules. To increase the efficiency of the classification process, boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is used to discretize the data sets. The approach is tested by a comparatif study of three different classifiers (decision rules, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbor) over three distinct discretization techniques (equal bigning, entropy and boolean reasoning). The rough set reduction technique is applied to find all the reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for prediction. In this paper we adopt the genetic algorithms approach to reach reducts. Finally, decision rules were used as a classifier to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we present tests on breast cancer data set. The experimental results obtained, show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the employed rough set approach and decision rules is high compared with other classification techniques including Bayes and k-nearest neighbor.

Human-machine dialogue, however, is challenged by noisy acoustic data, and by people's preference for more natural interaction. This paper describes an ambitious project that embeds human subjects in a spoken dialogue system. It collects a rich and novel data set, including spoken dialogue, human behavior, and system features. During data collection, subjects were restricted to the same databases, action choices, and noisy automated speech recognition output as a spoken dialogue system. This paper mines that data to learn how people manage the problems that arise during dialogue under such restrictions. Two different approaches to successful, goal-directed dialogue are identified this way, from which supervised learning can predict appropriate dialogue choices. The resultant models can then be incorporated into an autonomous agent that seeks to assist its user.

As the complexity of the demanded tasks being increased, the single techniques proved insufficient. This gave rise to intelligent systems that are hybrids of several machine learning techniques to solve the most challenging problems. In this paper we propose a hybrid multiple classifier approach for recognizing usual and unusual drilling events. We suggest using two different information sources namely: (1) real time data collected by sensors located around the drilling rig, and (2) daily morning reports written by drilling personnel to describe the drilling process. Text mining techniques were used to analysis the daily morning reports and to extract textual features that include keywords and phrases, whereas data mining techniques were used to analysis the sensors data and extracting statistical features. Three base classifiers were trained and combined in one ensemble to obtain better predictive performance. Experimental evaluation with real data and reports shows that the ensemble outperforms the base classifiers in every experiment, and the average classification accuracy is about 90% for usual events, and about 75% for unusual events.

In this paper we provide general rules of thumb that are useful for companies seeking funding from investor. These rules of thumb are generated by analyzing the social relationships between investors and companies found within the small world of Facebook.

An integrated, company-oriented, e-recruitment system was implemented based on the proposed scheme and its functionality was showcased and evaluated in a real-world recruitment scenario. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system implements automated candidate ranking, based on objective criteria that can be extracted from the applicant's LinkedIn profile. What is more, candidate personality traits are automatically extracted from his/her social presence using linguistic analysis. The applicant's rank is derived from individual selection criteria using analytical hierarchy process (AHP), while their relative significance (weight) is controlled by the recruiter. Findings - The proposed e-recruitment system was deployed in a real-world recruitment scenario, and its output was validated by expert recruiters. It was found that with the exception of senior positions that required domain experience and specific qualifications, automated pre-screening performed consistently compared to human recruiters. Research limitations/implications - It was found that companies can increase the efficiency of the recruitment process if they integrate an e-recruitment system in their human resources management infrastructure that automates the candidate pre-screening process. Interviewing and background investigation of applicants can then be limited to the top candidates identified from the system.

This paper presents a new semi-supervised manifold learning algorithm, called Multi-Manifold Discriminative Analysis (Multi-MDA). The proposed method is designed to explore the discriminative information hidden in geodesic distances. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1) we propose a semi-supervised graph construction method which can effectively capture the multiple manifolds structure of the data; 2) each data point is replaced with an associated feature vector whose elements are the graph distances from it to the other data points. Information of the nonlinear structure is contained in the feature vectors which are helpful for classification; 3) we propose a new semi-supervised linear dimension reduction method for feature vectors which introduces the class information into the manifold learning process and establishes an explicit dimension reduction mapping. Experiments on benchmark data sets are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, with the current communication systems mainly optimized for human to human communications, there are important capabilities that need to be developed in M2M systems in order to fully realize the new smart services enabled by M2M. In this paper, we provide an overview of M2M and its applications to smart grid. In particular, we discuss technical areas where data mining and machine learning can play an important role in realizing various smart functionalities in the future power grid. As a case study, we also present a novel phase identification technique in smart grid based on smart meter data. Preliminary results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

However, the current BCI systems still have a very low accuracy on the recognition of facial expressions and thoughts. This makes it very difficult to use these devices to enable safe and robust commands of complex devices such as an Intelligent Wheelchair. This paper presents an approach to expand the use of a brain computer interface for driving an intelligent wheelchair by patients suffering from cerebral palsy. The approach was based on appropriate signal preprocessing based on Hjorth parameters, a forward approach for variable selection and several data mining algorithms for classification such as naive Bayes, neural networks and support vector machines. Experiments were performed using 30 individuals suffering from IV and V degrees of cerebral palsy on the Gross Motor Function (GMF) measure. The results achieved showed that the preprocessing and variable selection methods were effective enabling to improve the results of a commercial BCI product by 57%. With the developed system it was also possible for users to perform a circuit in a simulated environment using just facial expressions and thoughts.

Data Mining Applied to Diagnose Diseases Caused by Lymphotropic Virus: a Performance Analysis	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Computational Intelligence; Data-Mining; Neural Networks		This paper proposes a new methodology to diagnose the rheumatology manifestations and HTLV-I-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis, or HAM/TSP, in patients who have Lymphotropic virus of T cells in Humans or HTLV of type I and II. Computational intelligence algorithms are used to classify HTLV patient carriers with or without the presence of rheumatology manifestations and of HAM / TSP. A benchmarking is performed among artificial neural intelligence, nave bayes, Bayesian networks and decision tree to evaluate the most suitable technique for solving this application issue. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the methodology on the helping non-specialist doctors to classify the patient with the disease suspicion.	[Farias, F. D. S.; Souza, L. V.

A fuzzy system approach is compared to a linear regression approach. Both are applied to a real world DSL network where a variable noise power is injected. Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) is used to organize the data selection, while linear regression and Fuzzy algorithms are compared through data mining process. Results show that the use of techniques such as Fuzzy and linear regression are an effective solution for the real-time estimation of crosstalk in DSL systems. The proposed scheme can be adapted to other types of noise, thus extending its application to DSL systems.	[Farias, F. S.; Moritsuka, N. S.; Borges, G. S.; de Souza, L. V.; Frances, C. R.

Most existing data mining classifiers can not detect and classify the novel class instances in real-time data stream mining problems like weather conditions, economical changes, astronomical, and intrusion detection etc, untill the classification models are trained with the labeled instances of the novel class. Arrival of a novel class in concept-drift occurs in data stream mining when new data introduce the new concept classes or remove the old ones. The proposed approach for incremental learning of concept drift considers mining, where the streaming data distributions change over time. It build a decision tree model from training dataset, which continuously updates so that the tree represents the most recent concept in data stream. The experiments on real benchmark data evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach in both detecting the novel class and classification accuracy with comparisons of traditional data mining classifiers.

Recent years have witnessed many efforts on discovering fuzzy associations. The key strength of fuzzy association rule mining is its completeness. This strength, however, comes with a major drawback to handle large datasets. It often produces a huge number of candidate itemsets. The huge number of candidate itemsets makes it ineffective for a data mining system to analyze them. In the end, it produces a huge number of fuzzy associations. This is particularly true for datasets whose attributes are highly correlated. The huge number of fuzzy associations makes it very difficult for a human user to analyze them. Existing research has shown that most of the discovered rules are actually redundant or insignificant. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to overcome these problems; we are preprocessing the data tuples by focusing on similar behaviour attributes and ontology. Finally, the efficiency and advantages of this algorithm have been proved by experimental results.

Most conventional data-mining algorithms identify the relationships among transactions using binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are however commonly seen in real-world applications. The fuzzy concepts are used to represent item importance, item quantities, minimum supports and minimum confidences. Each attribute uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in the mining process. The number of items is thus the same as that of the original attributes, making the processing time reduced. It uses a combination of large 1-itemsets and membership-function suitability to evaluate the fitness values of chromosomes. The calculation for large 1-itemsets could take a lot of time, especially when the database to be scanned could not totally fed into main memory. In this system, an enhanced approach, called the cluster-based fuzzy-genetic mining algorithm. It divides the chromosomes in a population into clusters by the 3-dimensional k-means clustering approach and evaluates each individual according to both cluster and their own information. A genetic-fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting lit membership functions and multilevel association rules with its confidence from quantitative transactions is shown.

Here there is proposed a hybrid face detection algorithm based on a data mining approach. In training phase, first with using of preprocessing acts on every training image we convert them into edge and non-edge images. Then with the usage of MAFIA algorithm, maximal frequent features of face will be extracted from edge and non-edge image. In detection phase, first by HAAR classifier, candidates will generate for the second classifier. HAAR Classifier, usually detect most of faces in image, but some non-faces are detected as face, by mistake. So that, first, all possible regions of face, detect by HAAR Classifier, and are sent to the face feature classifier, as candidate. In this classifier with the usage of maximal frequent features of face which obtained from training phase, non-faces which were detected as face by mistake in the last phase will be eliminated, so the false positives rate will be decreased significantly.

Incomplete information has a pervasive negative impact on downstream processing steps. This work addresses this problem with a novel information extraction approach, which integrates data mining and information extraction methods into a single complementary approach in order to benefit from their respective advantages and reduce incompleteness in information extraction.

Although the vast use, the analysis of mined rules may be intricate for non-experts, and the technique effectiveness is constrained by the data dimensionality. This paper presents a pre-processing approach that uses (1) dual scaling in order to present the mined rules with some semantic contextualization that assists interpretation, and (2) mean shift clustering to reduce data dimensionality. We tested our model with real data collected from accident reports in petroleum industry.	[Fernandes, Leandro A.

The tests were carried out using three data mining techniques with distinct characteristics, specifically, linear regression, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptron neural networks, in four artificially built datasets. The datasets design was aimed at understanding the specific circumstances where each method, simple or combined, would present better performance. Results from this experiment suggest that blending classifiers using segmentation is a viable solution to improve the performance of both statistic regressions, that both FBTSeg and NNTree are in general more predictive than the traditional segmentation, while bagging and boosting are more effective alternatives for improving neural networks models.

They are based in the use of approaches with diverse functionality (e-mail, Web pages, forums, learning platforms, and so on) as a support of the process of teaching-learning. The Cloud Computing environment rises as a natural platform to provide support to e-Learning systems and also for the implementation of data mining techniques that allow to explore the enormous data bases generated from the former process to extract the inherent knowledge, since it can be dynamically adapted by providing a scalable system for changing necessities along time. In this contribution, we give an overview of the current state of the structure of Cloud Computing for applications on e-learning. We provide details of the most common infrastructures that have been developed for such a system, and finally we present some examples of e-learning approaches for Cloud Computing that can be found in the specialized literature.

We consider this problem solving in multi-agent systems (MAS) domains. Change point testing allows agents to recognize changes in the environment, to detect more accurately current state information and provide more appropriate information for decision-making. Standard statistical procedures for change point detection, based on maximum likelihood estimators, are complex and require construction of parametrical models of data. In methods of computational statistics, such as bootstrapping or resampling, complex statistical inference is replaced by a large computation volumes. However, these methods require accurate analysis of their precision. In this paper, we apply and analyze a bootstrap-based CUSUM test for change point detection, as well as propose a pairwise resampling CP test. We derive some useful properties of the tests and demonstrate their application in the decentralized decision-making of vehicle agents in city traffic.

In the same time, many systems consist of similar parts that may be defined globally and seamlessly configured to be used in specific systems. In many solutions this kind of application parts are defined as a separate middle layer of the application. With increasing demands on systems scalability and reliability, more and more applications were using so called middleware model. There are many applications that may be enhanced to the middleware model, but there is no methodology of determining the way of choosing proper environment, technology and implementation. Moreover, there is no research on how to increase application's reliability and performance using opportunities given by middleware. This article is a description of concept how data mining tools may be used in defining these factors.

Trust factors can be used to infer degree of friendship as well as investigating what contribute to customer loyalty in e-commerce on online social networks. In the past, trust factors were either obtained via direct questioning during survey or qualitative estimation; questions to be asked are 'how much do you trust something/somebody in multi-level Likert scale?' Respondents replied by indicating one of the following, for example: Very much, Much; Somewhat; Little; Never. The results are then counted usually by simple frequency distribution. In this paper, an alternative method by data mining is presented that infers quantitatively the relative importance of each trust factor with respective to the predicted class. This is done by Feature Selection algorithms prior to constructing a decision tree. The advantage of using data mining method over simple statistic is that each factor (or Relative Importance Factor) acts as a predictor variable that foretells how the likelihood of an expected occurrence. In other words, a-priori knowledge can be assumed in this case; the relative importance can be assumed known without the fact that actually occurred. Such relative importance measures would be useful for estimating the weights of variables that are used in some prediction formula. A case study of estimating trust and therefore inducing recommendation in Facebook is given.

Micro-blogs like Facebook, Twitter, Flicker, Renren, Sina Weibo have undergone an exponential growth in popularity, they have become an essential tool in connecting people beyond spatial boundaries. As the policy of real-name verification has launched in Beijing China, the reaction from netizens is noticeably overwhelming; while some people keep a good faith that will help subside online frauds, some expressed concern over the privacy issues like revealing their true identities in online interactions, the freedom of speech and so on. To this end, we conducted a face-to-face survey for collecting some public opinions with a case study of Sina Weibo micro blog. We investigate the perceived effect/affect of real-name verification policy on the uses of micro-blogs. The results are interpreted via simple statistics as well as some data mining approach.

In Brazil, in the last three decades an explosive growth in production has occurred, nearly thirty times, causing a chain of unprecedent changes of land uses and land cover (LULC) in the territory. Therefore, it becomes highly necessary to develop means to monitor such LULC changes, and remote sensing is one of the more potential tools for this monitoring. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology for contributing in the mapping and monitoring soybeans planted areas, with time-series of remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Two main techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map soybeans areas, and DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. The study area comprises three municipalities in the northwest of Sao Paulo State, being this area well representative of the agricultural conditions of the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. The statistics indicated an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. These results indicate that the combination of OBIA + DM + multitemporal imagery is very efficient and promising for the soybeans mapping process.

A network of body sensors in a community of people generates large amounts of contextual data that requires a scalable approach for storage and processing. Cloud computing can provide a powerful, scalable storage and processing infrastructure to perform both online and offline analysis and mining of body sensor data streams. This paper presents BodyCloud, a system architecture based on Cloud Computing for the management and monitoring of body sensor data streams. It incorporates key concepts such as scalability and flexibility of resources, sensor heterogeneity, and the dynamic deployment and management of user and community applications.

The interaction can be performed either by the mean of hand posture recognition or by the dynamic hand gesture recognition according to user's preference. The statistical approach adopted in our work to recognize hand posture has shown accurate results for both performance evaluation and user test. Besides, the combination of data-mining fields and signal processing for dynamic gestures recognition allows us to define the appropriate rules and to reduce the confusion between gestures. Furthermore, the hand region extraction is based on both skin color and background subtraction to avoid the detection of static objects that have a similar skin color. Finally, the collected user's feedback allows as to evaluate our approach from the user's point of view and to define the limitations that will be discussed in our perspectives in order to improve the results.

These approaches assume that the observed high dimensional data are driven by a small number of hidden binary sources combined due to Boolean superposition. The first approach is the Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) and the second one is the Boolean factor analysis (BFA). The two BMF methods are used for comparison. First is the M8 method from the BMDP statistical software package and the second one is the method suggested by Belohlavek & Vychodil. These two are compared to BFA, especially with the Expectation-maximization Boolean Factor Analysis we had developed earlier has, however, been extended with a binarization step developed here. The well-known bars problem and the mushroom dataset are used for revealing the methods' peculiarities. In particular, the reconstruction ability of the computed factors and the information gain as the measure of dimension reduction was under scrutiny. It was shown that BFA slightly loses to BMF in performance when noise-free signals are analyzed. Conversely, BMF loses considerably to BFA when input signals are noisy.

It is relevant to a wide range of fields such as combinatorial optimization, structural optimization, control theory, economics, quantum chemistry, sensor network location and data mining. The capability to solve extremely large-scale SDP problems will have a significant effect on the current and future applications of SDP. In 1995, Fujisawa et al. started the SDPA(Semidefinite programming algorithm) Project aimed at solving large-scale SDP problems with high numerical stability and accuracy. SDPA is one of the main codes to solve general SDPs. SDPARA is a parallel version of SDPA on multiple processors with distributed memory, and it replaces two major bottleneck parts (the generation of the Schur complement matrix and its Cholesky factorization) of SDPA by their parallel implementation. In particular, it has been successfully applied to combinatorial optimization and truss topology optimization. The new version of SDPARA (7.5.0-G) on a large-scale supercomputer called TSUBAME 2.0 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology has successfully been used to solve the largest SDP problem (which has over 1.48 million constraints), and created a new world record. Our implementation has also achieved 533 TFlops in double precision for large-scale Cholesky factorization using 2,720 CPUs and 4,080 GPUs.

Implicit knowledge can be derived by means of several deductive logic-based processes. This paper introduces a new way for extracting implicit knowledge from ontologies by means of a link analysis of the T-box of the ontology integrated with a data mining step on the A-box. The implicit knowledge extracted is in the form of "Influence Rules" i.e. rules structured as: if property p(1) of concept c(1) has value upsilon(1), then property p(2) of concept c(2) has value upsilon(2) with probability pi. The technique is completely general and applicable to whatever domain. The Influence Rules can be used to integrate existing knowledge or to support any other data mining process. A case study about an ontology that describes intrusion detection is used to illustrate how the method works.

In this work we have used a fuzzy association rule based classification method, to obtain an accurate and compact fuzzy rule-based classifier with a low computational cost. We have proposed the use of a novel fitness function to deal with the problem of imbalance dataset in the genetic post processing phase for rule selection and parameter tuning. The efficiency of the proposed system has been shown through a complete detailed experimental comparative study with well-known classifiers reported in the IDS literature.

Consequently current research is focusing on providing fault tolerance strategies that aim to minimize fault's effects on applications. By far the most popular technique is the checkpoint-restart strategy. A complement to this classical approach is failure avoidance, by which the occurrence of a fault is predicted and preventive measures are taken. This requires a reliable prediction system to anticipate failures and their locations. Thus far, research in this field has used ideal predictors that were not implemented in real HPC systems. In this paper, we merge signal analysis concepts with data mining techniques to extend the ELSA (Event Log Signal Analyzer) toolkit and offer an adaptive and more efficient prediction module. Our goal is to provide models that characterize the normal behavior of a system and the way faults affect it. Being able to detect deviations from normality quickly is the foundation of accurate fault prediction. However, this is challenging because component failure dynamics are heterogeneous in space and time. To this end, a large part of the paper is focused on a detailed analysis of the prediction method, by applying it to two large-scale systems and by investigating the characteristics and bottlenecks of each step of the prediction process. Furthermore, we analyze the prediction's precision and recall impact on current checkpointing strategies and highlight future improvements and directions for research in this field.

Improvements in database's technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is knowledge discovery, i.e. patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. The knowledge that becomes available through data mining enables an asset owner to make important decisions about life cycle costs in advance. In maintenance field, CMMS (Computer maintenance management system) and CM (Condition Monitoring) are the most popular software available in the industries. Since first one stores all historical data, maintenance actions, events and manufacturer recommendations, second one collects and stores all critical physical parameters (vibration, temperature..) to be monitored in a regular time basis. However, converting these data into useful information is a challenge. The degradation process of a system may be affected by many unknown factors, such as unidentified fault modes, unmeasured operational conditions, engineering variance, environmental conditions, etc. These unknown factors not only complicate the degradation behaviors of the system, but also make it difficult to collect quality data. Due to lack of knowledge and incomplete measurements, certain important context information (e. g. fault modes, operational conditions) of the collected data will be missing. Therefore, historical data of the system with a large variety of degradation patterns will be mixed together. With such data, learning a global model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction becomes extremely hard since the end user does not have enough and good-quality data to model properly the system. This has led us to look for advanced RUL prediction techniques beyond the traditional RUL prediction models. The degradation process for many engineering systems, especially mechanical systems, is irreversible unless the condition is recovered by effective maintenance actions. The irreversible degradation process does not necessarily imply that the observed features will exhibit a monotonic progression pattern during degradation. Such progression pattern is sometimes hard to model using parametric methods. Considering a degradation process involving no or limited maintenance, the process may compose of a sequence of irreversible stages (either discrete or continuous) from new to be worn out, which can be implicitly expressed by the trajectory of the measured condition data or features. Therefore, the RUL of the system can be estimated if its future degradation trend can be projected from those historical instances. In this paper, a novel RUL prediction method inspired by feature maps and SVM classifiers is proposed. The historical instances of a system with life-time condition data are used to create a classification by SVM hyper planes. For a test instance of the same system, whose RUL is going to be estimated, degradation speed is evaluated by computing the minimal distance defined based on the degradation trajectories, i.e. the approach of the system to the hyper plane that segregates good and bad condition data at a different time horizon. Therefore, the final RUL of a specific component can be estimated, and global RUL information can then be obtained by aggregating the multiple RUL estimations using a density estimation method. Proposed model develops an effective RUL prediction method that addresses multiple challenges in complex system prognostics, where many parameters are unknown. Similarities between degradation trajectories can be checked in order to enrich existing methodologies in prognostic's applications. Existing CM data for bearings will be used to verify the model.

In recent years many techniques discovering hidden structures in the data set like clustering and projection of data from high-dimensional spaces have been developed. In this paper, we propose a model for multiple view unsupervised clustering based on Kohonen self-organizing-map algorithm. The results of simulations in two dimensional space using three views of training sets having different statistical properties have been presented.

The application of these techniques in the banking environment has been a direct outcome in order to enhance the services offered to end users. In this paper, we present a context-aware mobile recommender system based on real banking data provided by a well known Spanish bank. The data were composed by customer profiles, credit card transactions and information about places where bank clients have previously spent their money. The system model and its architecture are described taking into account social, mobility and ubiquitous requisites to generate personalized recommendations. The mobile prototype deployed in the bank was evaluated in a survey among 100 users with good results regarding trust, usefulness and effectiveness.

Prior research efforts and industry practice focused on feeding this information back to the design flow via bug root-cause analysis. However, the value of this silicon data for helping further improvement of the post-silicon validation process has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose an adaptive test selection method to progressively tune the validation plan using knowledge automatically mined from the bug sightings during post-silicon validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fault-model-free data mining approach can prioritize those tests capable of uncovering more silicon timing errors, resulting in significant reduction of validation time and effort.

However, real life databases are frequently updated. To the best of our knowledge, the discovery of functional dependencies in dynamic databases has never been studied. A naive solution consists in re-applying one of the existing algorithms to discover functional dependencies holding on the updated database. Nevertheless, in many domains, where response time is crucial, re-executing algorithms from scratch would be inacceptable. In this paper, we propose a new technique that makes use of the previously discovered results to cut down the amount of work that has been done to discover the new set of functional dependencies satisfied by the updated database.

But because of the large size of the dataset and the need of having a high detection rate, the resulted models have often produced many false positives. This paper proposes a modified version of the perceptron algorithm able to detect malware samples while training at a low rate (even zero) of false positives. A very low number of false positives is crucial because in a real life situation detecting a clean file as malware can destroy the operating system or render other programs unusable. We also provide a method of optimizing the training speed for the algorithm while maintaining the same accuracy. The resulted algorithm can be used in an ensemble or voting system to increase detection and eliminate false positives.

Applications of Web Data Mining in e-commerce supply effective solutions for these problems. This paper provides a detailed description of web Data Mining technology in e-commerce, expounds its opinion, classification, data sources, and describes its system model.

Non-Additive Random Data Perturbation for Real World Data	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, COMMUNICATION, CONTROL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (C3IT-2012)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)	FEB 25-26, 2012	INDIA			Perturbation; Random data; Classification	PRIVACY-PRESERVING DATA	Privacy preservation is the major concern while real datasets are handled. A specific topic- privacy preserving data mining (PPDM), completely deals with data modification but also limits rule loss. Data perturbation is one of the PPDM techniques, which mostly deals with numerical data and concentrates on the statistical analysis of the data. Perturbation is of two types, additive perturbation and multiplicative perturbation, where generated random data is either added or multiplied with the data, which results in a random modified data. In this paper we have proposed a model in which the perturbation is done by randomization, where the data is generated in intervals based on the level of privacy specified by each customer. Our model is proved by applying classification algorithm on the perturbed data set and the accuracy is still maintained the same. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the last decade, the associative classification algorithms which depends on pure data mining techniques appears as an effective method for classification. In this paper, we examine associative classification approach on the Arabic language to mine knowledge from Arabic text data set. Two methods of classification using AC are applied in this study; these methods are single rule prediction and multiple rule prediction. The experimental results against different classes of Arabic data set show that multiple rule prediction method outperforms single rule prediction method with regards to their accuracy. In general, the associative classification approach is a suitable method to classify Arabic text data set, and is able to achieve a good classification performance in terms of classification time and classification accuracy.

The first step to adapt instruction to group of learners is learners grouping. Many methods have used to group learners in e-learning environment specially data mining techniques such as clustering methods. This paper aims to propose a clustering method to group learners using some specific learners' observable behavior while working by system and based on cognitive style. The objective function of proposed method is defined by considering two criteria in measuring the clustering goodness, compactness and separation, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to optimize the objective function. This method used to group learners based on cognitive style. Results of the proposed method are compared with K-means, fuzzy C-means, and EFC methods using Davies-Bouldin cluster validity index and comparing the achieved groups and the cognitive style of learners who are in the same group, shows that the grouping accuracy is in a higher level using fuzzy-inspired PSO method and this method has the better clustering performance than the others and groups similar learners in one cluster.

A naive algorithm for index construction in distortion-free subsequence matching is a very time-consuming process since it generates a huge number of data subsequences to consider all possible positions and all possible query lengths. In this paper, we formally analyze the index construction step and discuss how to improve the performance of each step. To improve the performance, we present a concept of DF-bucket, which stores the intermediate results and reuse them repeatedly in the next steps. We also present a novel notion of store-and-reuse principle, and using the principle we build a multidimensional index much faster than a naive algorithm.

Hospice care considerations are particularly valuable for terminally ill patients since they enable patients and their families to initiate end-of-life discussions and choose the most desired management strategy for the remainder of their lives. Unlike traditional data mining methodologies, our approach seeks to identify subgroups of patients possessing common characteristics that distinguish them from other subgroups in the dataset. Thus, heterogeneity in the data set is captured before the classification model is built. Object related reducts are used to obtain the minimum set of attributes that describe each subgroup existing in the dataset. As a result, a collection of decision rules is derived for classifying new patients based on the subgroup to which they belong. Results show improvements in the classification accuracy compared to a traditional RST methodology, in which patient diversity is not considered. We envision our work as a part of a comprehensive decision support system designed to facilitate end-of-life care decisions. Retrospective data from 9105 patients is used to demonstrate the design and implementation details of the classification model.

This work constructs a user-specific affect model identifying music induced emotion using several timbre features. A corpora of music-emotion data was collected, which includes 150 30-second long instrumental segments and self-annotated emotion labels. Several pieces were found whose timbral content induces a consistent emotional response. To find the relationship between emotion and timbre, 60 timbre feature derivatives were used along with 13 MFCC features. Experiments using four classifiers yielded accuracy between 44% to 72%.

Traditionally individuals gather feedback from their friends or relatives beforepurchasing an item, but today the trend is to identify the opinions of a variety ofindividuals around the globe using microbloggingdata. This paper discusses an approach where a publicised stream of tweets from the Twitter microblogging site are preprocessed and classified based on their emotional content as positive, negative and irrelevant; and analyses the performance of various classifying algorithms based on their precision and recall in such cases. Further, the paper exemplifies the applications of this research and its limitations.

Especially with the advent of the software as a service principle, an information retrieval community is conceivable that publishes executable experiments by anyone over the Web. A review of recent SIGIR papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration. The benefits of publishing information retrieval experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, including potential to boost research profiles and reputation. However, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice. In order to foster experiments as a service in information retrieval, we present the TIRA (Testbed for Information Retrieval Algorithms) web framework that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing web-based solutions. To describe TIRA in a practical setting, we explain how it is currently used as an official evaluation platform for the well-established PAN international plagiarism detection competition. We also describe how it can be used in future scenarios for search result clustering of non-static collections of web query results, as well as within a simulation data mining setting to support interactive structural design in civil engineering.

In this paper, we eliminate the necessity of setting the minimum cluster size parameter of the Randomized Gravitational Clustering algorithm proposed by Gomez et al. Basically, the minimum cluster size is estimated using a heuristic that takes in consideration the functional relation between the number of clusters and the clusters with at least a given number of points. Then a data point's region of action (region of the space assigned to a point) is defined and a cluster refinement process is proposed in order to merge overlapping clusters. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to deal with noise, while finding an appropriate number of clusters without requiring a manual setting of the minimum cluster size(1).

In this scenario, cluster analysis has been proved to be a useful technique to reduce the amount of data to analyze. A good example is the use of the density-based cluster algorithm DBSCAN to identify similar single program multiple data (SPMD) computing phases in message-passing applications. This structure detection simplifies the analyst work as the whole information available is reduced to a small set of clusters. However, DBSCAN presents two major problems: it is very sensitive to its parametrization and is not capable of correctly detect clusters when the data set has different densities across the data space. In this paper, we introduce the Aggregative Cluster Refinement, an iterative algorithm that produces more accurate structure detections of SPMD phases than DBSCAN. In addition, it is able to detect clusters with different densities.

In this paper, we consider the problem of calculating the non-overlapping frequencies of all q-grams in a text given in compressed form, namely, as a straight line program (SLP). We show that the problem can be solved in O(q(2)n) time and O(qn) space where n is the size of the SLP. This generalizes and greatly improves previous work (Inenaga & Bannai, 2009) which solved the problem only for q = 2 in O(n(4) log n) time and O(n(3)) space.

They either perform operations in the ring of the real valued spaces endowed with some (inf, sup) lattice operators, or use lattice theory to produce generalizations or fusions of conventional approaches. Lattice Computing has produced a variety of algorithms for data processing, classification, signal filtering over the last decades. On the other hand, hybrid algorithms are flourishing in the last years giving innovative solutions to new and old problems. Hybrid algorithms are free combinations of Computational Intelligence approaches for data mining, signal processing or general artificial intelligence questions, including statistical, nature and bio-inspired algorithms. In this paper we review some Lattice Computing approaches and how they have been hybridized for specific problems.

There exist many instance selection algorithms capable for significant reduction of training data size for particular classifier without generalization degradation. In opposition to those methods, this paper focuses on general pruning methods which can be successfully applied for arbitrary classification method. Simple but efficient wrapper method based on generalization of Hart's Condensed Nearest Neighbors rule is presented and impact of this method on classification quality is reported.

Recently, some works have attempted to model the behavior of Map-Reduce, but these existing models ignore the non-linearity of disk I/O performance under contention, which is a critical aspect of estimating the performance of data intensive applications. Understanding I/O interference between tasks running on the same node is critical in optimizing task scheduling for improved resource utilization. In this paper, we present a model to estimate the I/O behavior of Map-Reduce applications that can be used to achieve these goals.

In particular, the raw network data has to be transformed and largely reduced to be processed by data mining models. The primary objective of this work is to control the dimensionality reduction (DR) of network flow records in view of the accuracy of misuse detection. A real data set, containing flow records with potential spam messages, is used to perform the tests of the proposed method. The algorithm proposed in this study is applied to investigate the merits of hybrid models composed of dimensionality reduction, neural networks, and decision trees. The benefits of dimensionality reduction and the impact of the process on the overall spam detection rates and false positive rates are investigated. The advantages of the proposed technique over standard a priori selection of reduced dimension are discussed.

TRAOD is one of classic method to detecting outlying trajectory, however, Two Phase Partition, which was used to performance optimization, would lead to the loss of outlying trajectory segment. In this paper, we proposed an efficient outlying detection based on R-Tree, which prunes irrespective sub-trajectories by R-Tree to improve the performance of algorithm. Detailed experimental results prove that the method not only resolves the loss of outlying t-partition, but also obtains much higher performance than existing techniques.

While results might appear interesting at a first glance, they can often be explained by already known characteristics of the data. Randomization is an established technique for significance testing, and methods to assess data mining results on vector data or network data have been proposed. In many applications, however, both sources are simultaneously given. Since these sources are rarely independent of each other but highly correlated, naively applying existing randomization methods on each source separately is questionable. In this work, we present a method to assess the significance of mining results on graphs with binary features vectors. We propose a novel null model that preserves correlation information between both sources. Our randomization exploits an adaptive Metropolis sampling and interweaves attribute randomization and graph randomization steps.

Our results indicate that while simultaneously using both sources is beneficial, often one source of information is dominant for determining the mining results.

They are widely used in data mining, signal processing and computer vision. In many applications, we need to estimate the parameters of a GMM from data before working with it. This task can be handled by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (EM-GMM), which is computationally demanding. In this paper we present our FPGA-based solution for the EM-GMM algorithm. We propose a pipeline-friendly EM-GMM algorithm, a variant of the original EM-GMM algorithm that can be converted to a fully-pipelined hardware architecture. To further improve the performance, we design a Gaussian probability density function evaluation unit that works with fixed-point arithmetic. In the experiments, our FPGA-based solution generates fairly accurate results while achieving a maximum of 517 times speedup over a CPU-based solution, and 28 times speedup over a GPU-based solution.

In tri-training algorithm, it generates three classifiers from the original labeled examples and then refined using unlabeled examples in the tri-training process. This algorithm neither needs sufficient and redundant view, nor does it require the use of different supervised learning algorithms whose hypothesis partitions the instance space into a set of equivalence classes. However, the performance of this algorithm goes degradation under certain condition. In this paper, we address three issues existed in tri-training, including unsuitable error estimation, excessively confined restriction and deficiency of weight for labeled example and unlabeled example. An improved tri-training algorithm (im-tri-training) is proposed to work on the three issues. Experiments on UCI data sets show that im-tri-training outperforms the tri-training on learning performance.

Efforts at fighting against these risks have led to developing privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) techniques and anti-discrimination techniques in data mining. However, there is an evident gap between the large body of research in data privacy technologies and the recent early results on anti-discrimination technologies. This context presents a study on the relation between data anonymization from privacy technologies literature and anti-discrimination. We discuss how different data anonymization techniques have impact on discriminatory biased datasets.

Data mining comes with unprecedented opportunities and risks: a deeper understanding of human behavior and how our society works is darkened by a greater chance of privacy intrusion and unfair discrimination based on the extracted patterns and profiles. Although methods independently addressing privacy or discrimination in data mining have been proposed in the literature, in this context we argue that privacy and discrimination risks should be tackled together, and we present a methodology for doing so while publishing frequent pattern mining results. We describe a combined pattern sanitization framework that yields both privacy- and discrimination-protected patterns, while introducing reasonable (controlled) pattern distortion.

Parallel programming is classified in to two major groups as code parallelism and data parallelism. In order to exploit the power of multi core processors it is essential to change programming of conventional application to parallel programming paradigms. Some compiler tools have been developed to help the programmer to develop parallel applications. However, it is still a challenging problem to programmer to extract full parallelism in general applications. Here we propose a case study of classification of huge database like electoral data of Kolhapur constituency in to age wise groups using popular technique of classification using K-Nearest Neighbor on multi core CPUs. Such a classification of data will predict the age group of constituency which will help the contestant to arrange their campaign accordingly. Also trend of voting can be associated to age groups for analysis. This application demonstrates how parallel programs can be developed using multi core processors to take full advantage of parallel programming on desktop.	[Halkarnikar, P.

Extensive research has been conducted recently on applying different classification and features selection techniques. Heart sound data sets represent a real life data that contains continuous attributes and a large number of features that could be hardly classified by most of classification techniques. Data mining techniques including the feature evaluation and classification techniques that ignore the important characteristics that may exist in the heart sound data set may not be applicable on this case. In this context, the present paper initially surveys the research that has been conducted concerning the exploitation of heart sound signals for automated detection of heart conditions. Then, A comparative study is applied to determine the most effective data mining techniques that are capable for the detection of heart valve disease with a high accuracy. The results shows that the techniques that are capable of the handling the multivariate data sets that has continuous nature show the highest classification accuracy.

The produced rules concern the future land use in urban areas. The suggested approach allows the integration of variable data into existing techniques of spatial data mining. The used process is based on a meta-rules generation in order to classify produced rules according to their temporal evolution. Subsequently, the technique of least squares is used to estimate the future values of rule confidence according to which applicable rules to a future date will be selected. A prototype and an experiment on a spatial database taken at various dates gave encouraging results.

The clustering was performed by a method based bio (social spiders) because there is currently no method of learning that can almost directly represent unstructured data (text). Thus, to make a good data classification must be a good representation of the data. The representation of these data is performed by a vector whose components are derived from the overall weight of the corpus used (TF-IDF). A language-independent method was used to represent text documents is that of n-grams characters and words. Several similarity measures have been tested. To validate the classification we used a measure of assessment based on recall and precision (f-measure).

Hence, there has been a considerable need for tools or techniques to delve and efficiently discover valuable, non-obvious information from large databases. In this situation, data mining is an important research field which offers efficient solutions for such an extraction. Much research in data mining from large databases have focused on the discovery of frequent patterns which are then used to identify relationships between sets of items in a database, through for example association rule derivation. In practice, however, the number of frequently occurring patterns is very large, hampering their effective exploitation by the end-users. In this situation, many works have been interested in defining manageably-sized sets of patterns, called concise representations, from which redundant patterns can be regenerated. In this paper, we concentrate on exact concise representations of frequent patterns. Thus, we describe their close relation with important concepts like the framework of epsilon-adequate representation and the minimum description length principle. Based on the mathematical settings of Formal Concept Analysis, we also show the complementarity between minimal generators and closed itemsets. Then, we focus on the key role played by these patterns for solving several problem associated to various pattern classes. In this respect, we classify concise representations of frequent itemsets according to their common characteristics. Then, we analyze a representative of each class and show its close link with minimal generators. Finally, we carry out a critical study of concise representations with respect to several aspects and comparative criteria which proves the importance of considering closed sets and minimal generators.

Mining Knowledge from Data: An Information Network Analysis Approach	2012 IEEE 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING (ICDE)	IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	28th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	APR 01-05, 2012	Washington, DC	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Microsoft, Natl Sci Fdn, EMC, Greenplum, HP, IBM Res, Google				Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However, many database researchers consider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval rather than an information-rich, inter-related and multi-typed information network that supports comprehensive data analysis; whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneous networks. Departing from both, we view interconnected, semi-structured datasets as heterogeneous, information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge in such networks. For example, a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneous information network, where objects of multiple types, such as students, professors, courses, departments, and multiple typed relationships, such as teach and advise are intertwined together, providing abundant information. In this tutorial, we present an organized picture on mining heterogeneous information networks and introduce a set of interesting, effective and scalable network mining methods. The topics to be covered include (i) database as an information network, (ii) mining information networks: clustering, classification, ranking, similarity search, and meta path-guided analysis, (iii) construction of quality, informative networks by data mining, (iv) trend and evolution analysis in heterogeneous information networks, and (v) research frontiers. We show that heterogeneous information networks are informative, and link analysis on such networks is powerful at uncovering critical knowledge hidden in large semi-structured datasets. Finally, we also present a few promising research directions.

We have prototyped the data mining task using the MapReduce model and evaluated it in the Cloud. A performance evaluation model has been built for assessing the eff ciency of the prototype. The results, from both experiments and the evaluation model, show the performance and scalability can be enhanced through these advanced technologies.

A few days ago, because the data of each application database is getting bigger and bigger, the clustering analysis is widely applied in all kinds of research fields, and becomes a very active research subject in the area of data mining. With the development of data collection technology, computer network and database technology, the various complex types of data grows explosively, so new data mining technology need to be explored urgently for complex data types. This paper carries on a research on two problems the space the moving object clustering and moving object trajectory clustering, from the views of the improvement of mobile object clustering space effect, mobile object clustering effect, enhancing algorithm time complexity and reducing input parameter sensitivity, which need solutions badly.

Intrusion detection (ID) is the process of examining the events occurring in a computer system or network. Analyzing the system or network for signs of intrusions, defined as attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or to bypass the security mechanisms of a network. The focus of this paper is mainly on intrusion detection based on data mining. The main part of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is to produce huge volumes of alarms. The interesting alarms are always mixed with unwanted, non-interesting and duplicate alarms. The aim of data mining is to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. So, here we proposed a framework which detect the intrusion and after that, it will show the improvement of k-means clustering algorithm.

Monitoring Nests of Solitary Bees using Image Processing Techniques	2012 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MECHATRONICS AND MACHINE VISION IN PRACTICE (M2VIP)	International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)	NOV 28-30, 2012	Auckland, NEW ZEALAND		AUT Univ	Image processing; machine vision; data mining; fast random forest; WEKA; FIJI; ecological monitoring; native bees; solitary bees; insects		The results from monitoring New Zealand's native bees based on image processing techniques are presented. Rather than identifying individual bees directly images of active ground nests are collected, processed and counted. The number of nests is good estimate of population since the number of bees in each nest is constant for most native species; described as solitary because a single female constructs a single nest. Open source software FIJI was used to pre-process and classify images. Accuracies were verified using data mining software WEKA. To date, the random forest classifier has returned fast effective results, classifying nests which are otherwise impossible to identify with the naked eye. Population fluctuations are evident when the two seasons are compared. This method produces repeatable, reliable estimations of the population status of New Zealand native bees.	[Hart, N.

Gathering data from medical sources is one of the most popular one. Among all these datasets, cancer datasets is a real eye catcher for the researchers. Classifying these cancer dataset is a real challenge because of their high dimensionality and enormous size. Different existing classifiers are handy in classifying these high dimensional datasets. Decision tree classifiers are good candidates for this task while we have used a boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) for classifying along with the decision tree classifiers. In this paper, the performances on the accuracy of classification and time to build the model for decision tree induction classifiers and AdaBoost is analyzed.

J	Hasan, I; Parapar, J; Barreiro, A				Hasan, Ismael; Parapar, Javier; Barreiro, Alvaro			Improving the Extraction of Text in PDFs by Simulating the Human Reading Order	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						PDF; text preprocessing; text extraction; ordered text extraction; text mining; evaluation	LAYOUT ANALYSIS; SEGMENTATION	Text preprocessing and segmentation are critical tasks in search and text mining applications. Due to the huge amount of documents that are exclusively presented in PDF format, most of the Data Mining (DM) and Information Retrieval (IR) systems must extract content from the PDF files. In some occasions this is a difficult task: the result of the extraction process from a PDF file is plain text, and it should be returned in the same order as a human would read the original PDF file. However, current tools for PDF text extraction fail in this objective when working with complex documents with multiple columns. For instance, this is the case of official government bulletins with legal information. In this task, it is mandatory to get correct and ordered text as a result of the application of the PDF extractor. It is very usual that a legal article in a document refers to a previous article and they should be offered in the right sequential order. To overcome these difficulties we have designed a new method for extraction of text in PDFs that simulates the human reading order. We evaluated our method and compared it against other PDF extraction tools and algorithms. Evaluation of our approach shows that it significantly outperforms the results of the existing tools and algorithms.

Under this circumstances, a mechanism to detect topics in social media has become important. This paper targets the East Japan Great Earthquake, and proposes a method for topic discovering from the emergent time series. In this paper, our proposed method analyzes user comments in video sharing websites, and adopts directed graphs to show topic structures in social media. Then clusters are formed using modularity measure which expresses the quality of division of a network into modules or communities. Topic structures are visualized dynamically, so that we can understand emerging topics easily. An experimental result using actual user comments in the video sharing website is shown as well.

However, there is no detailed investigation on how accurately Web-mined data reflect real-world data. It must be problematic to idolatrously utilize the Web-mined data in public Web applications without ensuring their accuracy sufficiently. Therefore, this paper defines spatio-temporal Web Sensors by analyzing Twitter, Facebook, weblogs, news sites, or the whole Web for a target natural phenomenon, and tries to validate the potential and reliability of the Web Sensors' spatio-temporal data by measuring the coefficient correlation with Japanese weather, earthquake, and influenza statistics per week by region as real-world data.

Systems can easily produce more log file entries than a human can realistically use. However, there are a number of good filtering and clustering technologies that are used in various areas of data mining. This research focuses on using very easily accessible Bayesian spam filters for categorizing log entries. Results of this research have confirmed that these filters can be effectively used to discover log entries related to known issues, and to effectively disprove outage relationships. Both of these techniques can be easily instrumented in a log analysis framework and provide administrators with much needed filtering for similar logs and thus, similar outages.

Social networking and mobile computing alone are producing data sets that are growing by terabytes every day. Because these data often cannot be loaded into a computer's working memory, most literal algorithms (algorithms that require access to the full data set) cannot be used. One type of pattern recognition and data mining method that is used to analyze databases is clustering; thus, clustering algorithms that can be used on large data sets are important and useful. We focus on a specific type of clustering: kernelized fuzzy c-means (KFCM). The literal KFCM algorithm has a memory requirement of O(n(2)), where n is the number objects in the data set. Thus, even data sets that have nearly 1,000,000 objects require terabytes of working memory-infeasible for most computers. One way to attack this problem is by using incremental algorithms; these algorithms sequentially process chunks or samples of the data, combining the results from each chunk. Here we propose three new incremental KFCM algorithms: rseKFCM, spKFCM, and oKFCM. We assess the performance of these algorithms by, first, comparing their clustering results to that of the literal KFCM and, second, by showing that these algorithms can produce reasonable partitions of large data sets. In summary, the rseKFCM is the most efficient of the three, exhibiting significant speedup at low sampling rates. The oKFCM algorithm seems to produce the most accurate approximation of KFCM, but at a cost of low efficiency. Our recommendation is to use rseKFCM at the highest sample rate allowable for your computational and problem needs.

Word-level paraphrasing is sensitive to the context, and its critical indicator is interchangeability. This paper presents a two-stage multi-feature word-level Chinese paraphrase extracting method. In stage one, using data mining technology the target word and its candidate paraphrases are extracted from large-size corpuses and the Internet. In stage two, stratified probability statistical model is established, and seven similarity feature values which are to train binary classifier later are calculated. Finally, candidate paraphrases with high similarity values are filtered out. Experimental results show that (1) Retrieving candidate paraphrases from large-size corpuses through data mining has practical value. On average 3.1 correct paraphrases for a word are obtained; (2) The binary classifier is effective in filtering out the correct paraphrases, with an accuracy of 0.676; (3) 34.32% of the retrieved paraphrases cannot be found in the Chinese Expanded Synonym Dictionary, which proves that the paraphrase retrieving method presented in this paper is an expansion of the traditional paraphrase extracting methods.

SSE are evolutionary conserved and define the overall fold of a protein. Therefore they can be used to classify protein families. SSE form pairwise energetical interactions which can be described by graphs. Neighbourhood graphs employ edge conditions to filter relevant interactions out of a set of pairwise relations. Graphlet analysis then employs stochastic sampling of subgraphs to identify overrepresented interaction patterns. To distinguish graphlets while sampling requires an efficient algorithm for graph isomorphism. In this Chapter, we describe a graph isomorphism algorithm that is easy to implement. In a preprocessing phase, the presented algorithm combines marks assigned to vertices to more informative marks. Propagated over edges, marks collect information about the structure of the graph and hence allow to efficiently find isomorphisms in a subsequent backtracking step. Applying graphlet analysis to neighbourhood graphs for structures from the ICGEB Protein Benchmark database and the Super-Secondary Structure database (SSSDB), we identify 627 significant graphlets. Subsequently trained decision trees on these features predict the four SCOP levels and SSSDB classes with a mean Area Under Curve (mAUC) better than 0.89 (5-fold CV). Regularizing these decision trees to avoid overfitting reveals that for reliable prediction of structural features about 20 graphlets are sufficient. Especially, we find that graphlets composed of five secondary structure elements are most informative for classification. Conversely, using decision trees trained on the mere sequence of SSE obtained from the protein sequence we are also able to predict graphlets directly from secondary structure annotation. Optimal prediction performance thereby reaches up to a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7. From our experiments in this Chapter, we conclude that SSE interactions form patterns significantly different from random. These patterns are both useful to predict structural protein features as well as they can be predicted from protein sequence. Therefore they can be used as constraints to facilitate the de novo prediction of unknown protein structures.

One of the important categories in association rule is known as Negative Association Rule (NAR). Significant NAR is very useful in certain domain applications; however it is hardly to be captured and discriminated. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a model called Critical Negative Association Rule Model (CNAR-M) to extract the Critical Negative Association Rule (CNAR) with higher Critical Relative Support (CRS) values. The result shows that the CNAR-M can mine CNAR from the benchmarked and real datasets. Moreover, it also can discriminate the CNAR with others association rules.

The imbalance in data sets represents a challenging problem for most classification methods, this is because the generalization power achieved for classic classifiers is not good for skewed data sets. Many real data sets are imbalanced, so the development of new methods to face this problem is necessary. The SVM classifier has an exceptional performance for data sets that are not skewed, however for imbalanced sets the optimal separating hyper plane is not enough to achieve acceptable results. In this paper a novel method that improves the performance of SVM for skewed data sets is presented. The proposed method works by exciting the support vectors and displacing the separating hyper plane towards majority class. According to the results obtained in experiments with different skewed data sets, the method enhances not only the accuracy but also the sensitivity of SVM classifier on this kind of data sets.

CAR-NF: A classifier based on specific rules with high netconf	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; supervised classification; class association rules; association rule mining		In this paper, an accurate classifier based on Class Association Rules (CARs), called CAR-NF, is proposed. CAR-NF introduces a new strategy for computing CARs, using the Netconf as measure of interest, that allows to prune the CAR search space for building specific rules with high Netconf. Moreover, we propose and prove a proposition that supports the use of a Netconf threshold value equal to 0.5 for mining the CARs. Additionally, a new way for ordering the set of CARs based on their rule sizes and Netconf values is introduced in CAR-NF. The ordering strategy together with the "Best K rules" satisfaction mechanism allows CAR-NF to have better accuracy than CBA, CMAR, CPAR, TFPC and HARMONY classifiers, the best classifiers based on CARs reported in the literature.

One cause of obesity is lack of exercise. Although the reason is known by people and the method of keeping health is self maintenance, but it is hard for most people, especially the elderly people. Because of this, we design a daily exercise support application, which is based on the user model, to provide health maintain support. In this research, we focus on applying user model to help people. Because a person's health situation relates to his everyday activities, the users' data of daily life can be the data to build the user model. Thus we choose to use sensors to recode the amount of exercise and users' motion data to build the user model. We obtained the user's motion data and the amount of exercise from sensors firstly, and use fuzzy inference and fuzzy membership function to recognize the motion data. And then, the user model can be constructed by mining motion data and the amount of exercise. Finally, the daily exercise support application can offer service to the user by applying the user model. Furthermore, we will show two kind of exercise support service of the application.

This paper proposes a fuzzy variant of k-member clustering with the goal of improving the quality of data summarization with k-anonymity. Each k-member cluster is extracted considering the fuzzy membership degrees of samples, which are estimated based on the distance from clusters. The proposed anonymization method is also applied to collaborative filtering, in which the main task is estimation of the applicability of unevaluated items. Several experimental results demonstrate the characteristic features of the proposed anonymization method.

In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of the GA-based attribute-clustering process based on the grouping genetic algorithm (GGA). In our approach, the general GGA representation and operators are used to reduce the redundancy of chromosome representation for attribute clustering. At last, experiments are made to compare the efficiency of the proposed approaches and the previous ones.

For such situations, multi-step search approaches have been proposed that can accommodate changes in the underlying similarity measure without the need to rebuild the index. In this paper, we present a heuristic multi-step search algorithm that utilizes a measure of intrinsic dimension, the generalized expansion dimension (GED), as the basis of its search termination condition. Compared to the current state-of-the-art method, experimental results show that our heuristic approach is able to obtain significant improvements in both the number of candidates and the running time, while losing very little in the accuracy of the query results.

The models can be viewed as generalizations of the expansion dimension, which was originally proposed for the analysis of certain similarity search indices using the Euclidean distance metric. Here, we extend the original model to other metric spaces: vector spaces with the L-p or vector angle (cosine similarity) distance measures, as well as product spaces for categorical data. We also provide a practical guide for estimating both local and global intrinsic dimensionality. The estimates of data complexity can subsequently be used in the design and analysis of algorithms for data mining applications such as search, clustering, classification, and outlier detection.

In the absence of any treatment, AAA tends to grow until rupture. In this paper, we develop an Intelligence Analysis Tool to help researchers predict postoperative morbidity after AAA. The Tool includes an ensemble model, classification modules, model evaluation, and data visualization. The probabilities of complication calculated by the model of complications and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the accuracy of postoperative morbidity prediction. The results show that the system proposed by this approach yields valuable qualitative and quantitative information for postoperative morbidity of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm patients. Our System facilitates different types of users to access without to learn new data mining software.

However, the small transmission capability limits the applications to different domains. How to fuse the transmitted data to increase the effective transmission of wireless sensor networks is an important issue. This work designs an intelligent data fusion algorithm with fusion benefit pattern tree for wireless sensor networks. The algorithm computes the fusion benefit from past transmission paths. Then, it discovers the association among past transmission patterns according to the fusion benefits to construct an appropriate fusion benefit pattern tree. The topology of fusion benefit pattern tree is taken as a data aggregation tree for data fusion. The experiential results show that the topology can provide higher transmission dataflow.

To reduce the damages and casualty, an effective real-time system for hazard prediction and mitigation is necessary. In this study, a case study for landslide hotspots and hazard factors investigation are analyzed in accordance with spatial data mining technology from massive spatial database. Many different kinds of geospatial data, such as the terrain elevation, land cover types, the distance to roads and rivers, geology maps, and monitoring rainfall data etc., are collected into the database for spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression analysis. In order to guarantee the data quality, the spatial data cleaning is essential to remove the noises, errors, outliers, and inconsistency hiding in the input spatial data sets. The experiment results show that the hot spot analysis exactly has the ability to indicate the hazards locations. In addition, the spatial relationship can be built using the geographically weight regression (GWR) model.

This paper proposes a filling algorithm of mining constraint frequent neighboring class set, which is suitable for mining any length constraint frequent neighboring class set. In order to improve efficiency of mining algorithm, the algorithm uses computing subset of neighboring class set to generate candidate via top-down strategy. Meanwhile, it uses the method of filling subset to double generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, and it also uses 'and' operation of corresponding integer to compute support. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than other algorithms when mining constraint frequent neighboring class sets.

A sample with the size of 9862 cases has been studied. The sample was extracted from a real world Healthcare Information System database containing 309383 medical records. We observed that the distribution of patient diseases in the medical database is imbalanced. Under-sampling technique has been applied to generate training data sets, and data mining tool Weka has been used to generate the Naive Bayesian and J-48 classifiers. In addition, an ensemble of five J-48 classifiers was created trying to improve the prediction performance, and rough set tools were used to reduce the ensemble based on the idea of second-order approximation. Experimental results showed a little improvement of the ensemble approach over pure Naive Bayesian and J-48 in accuracy, sensitivity, and F-measure.

We propose Fermi Density Descriptor (FDD) which represents the probability of measuring a fermion at a specific location for anomaly detection. We also quantify and examine different Laplacian normalization effects and choose the best one for anomaly detection. Both theoretical proof and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed FDD is substantially more discriminative and robust than the commonly-used algorithms.

When the data comes as stream, its mining becomes difficult. Unlike relational database the stream data size keep growing while the memory size is fixed relatively. So it is unfeasible to store all the past data in many applications. Hence one-time scan algorithm is needed to execute mining on stream data. As well as the increasing application of sensors, data type of image, video are produced in a rapid speed. Those data usually are with high dimensionality. Inspired by this, we present a new method of mining high dimensional stream data in this paper. A model based on forest structure is developed to index the sequence and to find the new patterns. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of large synthetic data stream.

They are a high-priority target group for viral marketing campaigns. On an average, an opinion leader will tell about his or her experience with a product or company to 14 other people. It is important to identify such opinion leaders from data derived from online activity of users. We present an approach to identification of opinion leaders using the K-means clustering algorithm. This approach does not require knowledge of the user's opinions or membership in other forums.

Application of Data Mining to Candidate Screening	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACCCT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)	AUG 23-25, 2012	Ramanathapuram, INDIA	IEEE	Syed Ammal Engn Coll		CLASSIFICATION	Classification models are supervised learning methods used for predicting the value of a categorical target attribute. These models use a set of examples, called the training set, to learn to predict the target class of a future example whose class is unknown. The development of learning algorithms capable of learning from past experience is an important step in emulating inductive learning in humans. Classification finds application in many domains, of which selection of customers for a marketing campaign, fraud detection, diagnosis of diseases, image recognition, and spam e-mail filtering are just a few examples. In this paper, we present a comparative study of the application of the Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification methods to the problem of screening candidates for a vacant position in an organization. The observable attributes of a candidate profile are first established. In the training phase, a training set of example profiles is used for learning the classification rules of the organization. In the test phase, the accuracy of the classification model is assessed by classifying example profiles not included in the training set, but for which the target class is already known. In the prediction phase, a profile whose target class is not known is classified. We present the results of the comparison of the Naive Bayes method with the kNN method.

Most of these organizations tend to analyze their data to discover new patterns. Usually, analyzing such amount of data requires huge computational power and storage facilities that may not be available to these organizations. Cloud computing offers the best way to solve this problem. Storing the private data of different organizations in the same cloud server enhances the mining process, but at the same time, raises privacy concerns. Therefore, it is highly recommended to support privacy preserving data mining algorithms in the cloud environment. This paper introduces an efficient and accurate cryptography-based scheme for mining the cloud data in a secure way without loss of accuracy. Specifically, we address the problem of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification over horizontally distributed databases without revealing any unnecessary information. We have utilized the recently developed cryptography primitive, order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE), to integrate securely the local classifications at a lower cost than the previously presented privacy preserving data mining schemes. Empirical results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme has similar performance with the naive mining systems in terms of classification accuracy.

If a company has already bought some advertising terms which describe certain services, it is reasonable to find out the terms bought by competing companies. On the other hand, the company, that provides context advertisement, wants to discover prospective markets, the advertisers. It can be done by means of so-called biclustering. For binary relation firms x terms the most terms respectively, where each firm from the first component buys each term from the second one. To solve this task there is a well-developed notion of formal concept which has almost equivalent definition to such a bicluster in terms of object-attribute tables in Formal Concept Analysis. However, the number of formal concepts (biclusters) for a given dataset can be of exponential new concept-based biclustering method. The new bicluster definition, (dense) object-attribute concept notion. Our findings show that the number of (dense) oa-biclusters is no greater than the number of non-empty cells of initial binary relation. The paper contains experimental results advertisement data in comparison with some FCA algorithms and additional results on so-called morphological metarules for term recommendation task on the dame data.

As the pilot test. "History of Civilization" class which offered in Bahcesehir University is selected. Item Response Theory (IRT) is focused for the determination of system inputs which are item responses of students, item difficulties of questions, and question levels. Item difficulties of questions are Gaussian normalized to make ordinal decisions. The distance between predicted and expected class values is employed for accuracy estimation. Comparison study is conducted to the ordinal class prediction correctness and performance analysis which is observed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs. The results show that ANFIS has better performance and higher accuracy than ANN and SVMs in terms of ordinal question classification when the ordinal decisions are practically made by Gaussian Normal Distribution and ROC graphs are focused to observe any significant difference among the performances of classifiers.

Our approach relies mainly on the notion of "dance tags" that we took from the NLP community by analogy with Part-of-Speech tagging. The process starts from scores described in Labanotation and produces in a fully automatic manner a high-level, comprehensive representation of the choreographic sequence. Our experiments show that we succeed in retrieving manually translated scores with an accuracy of 85% to 94%. Using this new representation of the choreographic data, one can then perform several useful tasks in an efficient manner. Among these are: music recommendation, automated detection of dance style or genre, and ultimately any task that requires a deeper understanding of the meaning of choreographic information than traditional processing can provide. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with a simple example for discriminating between classical ballet, modern ballet, and folkloric dances.

Many research has been made to solve complicated mathematical and optimization problems since long. The Evolutionary Algorithm has been used effectively to resolve these optimization problems. Due to the evolutionary and stochastic nature of these algorithms, slow convergence rate is the major problem of these algorithms. We propose a new scheme to mutate the opposition Genetic Algorithm (GA). This technique is used to improve the population effectively by using the Gaussian Mutation (GM) and Cauchy Mutation (CM). Both the mutation schemes are used probabilistically. A suit of 5 optimization functions has been used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results are compared with Opposition based Genetic Algorithm (OGA) to evaluate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm. Proposed method shows results superior to GA and OGA for the majority of the test functions and shows comparable results over some functions.

The health care industry collects huge amount of health care data which,unfortunately are not mined to discover hidden information for effective decision making. Discovery of hidden patterns and relationships often goes unexploited. Data mining techniques can help remedy this situation. Data mining have found numerous applications in Business and Scientific domains. Association rules,classification,clustering are major areas of interest in data. mining. Among these,association rules have been a very active research area. In our work Genetic algorithm is used to predict more accurately the presence of Heart Disease for Andhra Pradesh Population. The main motivation for using Genetic algorithm in the discovery of high level Prediction rules is that they perform a global search and cope better with attribute interaction than the greedy rule induction algorithms often used in Data Mining.

Prediction of Risk Score for Heart Disease using Associative Classification and Hybrid Feature Subset Selection	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS (ISDA)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	NOV 27-29, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	Machine Intelligence Res Labs (MIR Labs), IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Czechoslovakia Chapter, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Spanish Chapter, IEEE, Cochin Univ Sci & Technol		Andhra Pradesh; Associative classification; Feature subset selection; Genetic search; Heart disease		Medical data mining is the search for relationships and patterns within the medical data that could provide useful knowledge for effective medical diagnosis. Extracting useful information from these data bases can lead to discovery of rules for later diagnosis tools. Generally medical data bases are highly voluminous in nature. If a training data set contains irrelevant and redundant features classification may produce less accurate results. Feature selection as a pre-processing step in used to reduce dimensionality, removing irrelevant data and increasing accuracy and improves comprehensibility. Associative classification is a recent and rewarding technique that applies the methodology of association into classification and achieves high classification accuracy. Most associative classification algorithms adopt exhaustive search algorithms like in Apriori, and generate huge no. of rules from which a set of high quality of rules are chosen to construct efficient classifier. Hence generating a small set of high quality rules to build classifier is a challenging task. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally and in India more deaths are due to CHD. Cardiovascular disease is an increasingly an important cause of death in Andhra Pradesh. Hence there is an urgent need to develop a system to predict the heart disease of people. This paper discusses prediction of risk score for heart disease in Andhra Pradesh. We generated class association rules using feature subset selection. These generated rules will help physicians to predict the heart disease of a patient.	[Jabbar, M.

Clustering is one of the important data mining tasks. It is the process of grouping objects into clusters such that the objects from the same cluster are similar and objects from different clusters are dissimilar. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Fuzzy c-means algorithm is one of the popular clustering techniques. However, it will get easily struck at local minima. Recently, the use of global optimization technique such as particle swarm optimization has emerged in clustering field. In this paper, we present both fuzzy c-means and particle swarm optimization algorithms to solve the clustering problems. A brief review of applications is also described. The fuzzy c-means algorithm is experimented with different distance measures like Euclidian, Angular separation and Canberra for well known real-world data sets.	[Jafar, O. A.

Consequently, fraud detection systems need to update their methods and improve them by considering more sources of information to stay effective. In this paper, a data enrichment scheme is proposed which concentrates on using social network analysis to help the detection system by feeding information that is hidden in the relations among entities. Since one of the challenges of a real life electronic transaction system is the large amount of data and number of users, the proposed scheme is presenting an efficient method to update the social network, as well. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to detect fraud scenarios that are not detected using typical anomaly detection methods based on the normal behavior of cardholders. Hence, providing a higher accuracy, while minimizing the updating procedure.

Its effectiveness has been confirmed in practice as most of the latest international data-mining contest winners were using some kind of a committee of classifiers to produce their final entry. This paper presents a method of using a genetic algorithm to optimize an ensemble of multiple classification or regression models. An implementation of that method in R system, called Genetic Meta-Blender, was tested during the Australasian Data Mining 2009 Analytic Challenge. A subject of this data mining competition was the methods for combining predictive models. The described approach was awarded with the Grand Champion prize for achieving the best overall result. In this paper, the purpose of the challenge is described and details of the winning approach are given. The results of Genetic Meta-Blender are also discussed and compared to several baseline scores. Additionally, GMB is evaluated on data from a different data mining competition, namely SIAM SDM' 11 Contest: Prediction of Biological Properties of Molecules from Chemical Structure.

Architecture and Implementation of an Associative Memory Using Sparse Clustered Networks	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ISCAS 2012)	IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	MAY 20-23, 2012	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE, Circuits and Syst Soc (CAS)			FPGA IMPLEMENTATION	Associative memories are alternatives to indexed memories that when implemented in hardware can benefit many applications such as data mining. The classical neural network based methodology is impractical to implement since in order to increase the size of the memory, the number of information bits stored per memory bit (efficiency) approaches zero. In addition, the length of a message to be stored and retrieved needs to be the same size as the number of nodes in the network causing the total number of messages the network is capable of storing (diversity) to be limited. Recently, a novel algorithm based on sparse clustered neural networks has been proposed that achieves nearly optimal efficiency and large diversity. In this paper, a proof-of-concept hardware implementation of these networks is presented. The limitations and possible future research areas are discussed.

One of possible contributions of automated techniques is a selection of suitable problems for individual students based on previously collected data. To achieve this goal, we propose a model of problem solving times, which predicts how much time will a particular student need to solve a given problem. Our model is an analogy of the models used in the item response theory, but instead of probability of a correct answer, we model problem solving time. We also introduce a web-based problem solving tutor, which uses the model to make adaptive predictions and recommends problems of suitable difficulty. The system already collected extensive data on human problem solving. Using this dataset we evaluate the model and discuss an insight gained by an analysis of model parameters.

According to recent survey by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), 72 animals are dying each year due to collision with speeding trains. Its high time we protect the lives of endangered species of animals. Though railway authorities ordered the drivers to reduce the speed of the trains inside forest areas, it does not have any fruitful results so far. We need a mechanism to alert the animals from crossing railway tracks when the train is approaching near. This paper proposes a simple and efficient technique which alerts animals about speeding trains. Unlike other techniques, our proposed mechanism does not need human intervention for operation.

In this paper, we aim to mine user daily behavior based on a user's location history. As we know, there are regularities in people's daily activities, especially people's daily travel experience. Such regularity is significant to service providers, by recommending potential friends or other information with high relevance to users. Therefore, an approach, namely time- clustering-based behavior analysis (TCBA) is proposed to model each individual's location history and mine the regularity in daily activities. By this approach, we can solve the following queries in a user's daily life: 1) Given a specified time, such as dinner time or working time, what places a user often goes to? 2) What's the regularity of a user's daily life? By using this approach, we can recommend users a convenient route to company in advance, or friends with the same regularity.

At the same time, high-level APIs like map-reduce are being used for developing several types of high-end and/or data-intensive applications. Map-reduce, originally developed for data processing applications, has been successfully used for many classes of applications that involve a significant amount of computations, such as machine learning, image processing, and data mining applications. Because such applications can be accelerated using GPUs (and other accelerators), there has been interest in supporting map-reduce-like APIs on GPUs. However, while the use of map-reduce for a single GPU has been studied, developing map-reduce-like models for programming a heterogeneous CPU-GPU cluster remains an open challenge. This paper presents the MATE-CG system, which is a map-reduce-like framework based on the generalized reduction API. We develop support for enabling scalable and efficient implementation of data-intensive applications in a heterogeneous cluster of multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. Our contributions are three folds: 1) we port the generalized reduction model on clusters of modern GPUs with a map-reduce-like API, dealing with very large datasets; 2) we further propose three schemes to better utilize the computing power of CPUs and/or GPUs and develop an auto-tuning strategy to achieve the best-possible heterogeneous configuration for iterative applications; 3) we show how analytical models can be used to optimize important parameters in our system. We evaluate our system using three representative data-intensive applications and report results on a heterogeneous cluster of 128 CPU cores and 16 GPUs (7168 GPU cores). We show an average speedup of 87x on this cluster over execution with 2 CPU-cores. Our applications also achieve an average improvement of 25% by using CPU cores and GPUs simultaneously, over the best performance achieved from using only one of the types of resources in the cluster.

Our approach is based on the representation of multirelational databases as sets of trees, for which we propose two alternative representation schemes. Tree mining techniques can thus be applied as the basis for multirelational data mining techniques, such as multirelational classification or multirelational clustering. We analyze the differences between identifying induced and embedded tree patterns in the proposed tree-based representation schemes and we study the relationships among the sets of tree patterns that can be discovered in each case. This paper also describes how these frequent tree patterns can be used, for instance, to mine association rules in multirelational databases.

The pioneering work in this area was rooted in the theory of Bayesian network (BN) learning, which however, is a NP-complete problem. Hence several constraint-based algorithms have been developed to efficiently discover causations in large databases. These methods usually use the idea of BN learning, directly or indirectly, and are focused on causal relationships with single cause variables. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine causal rules in large databases of binary variables. Our method expands the scope of causality discovery to causal relationships with multiple cause variables, and we utilise partial association tests to exclude noncausal associations, to ensure the high reliability of discovered causal rules. Furthermore an efficient algorithm is designed for the tests in large databases. We assess the method with a set of real-world diagnostic data. The results show that our method can effectively discover interesting causal rules in large databases.

For dealing with a large volume of trajectory data, traditional approaches quantize them by a grid with a fixed resolution. However, an appropriate resolution often varies across different areas of trajectories. Simply increasing the resolution cannot capture broad patterns and consumes unnecessarily large computational resources. To solve the problem, we propose a hierarchical grid-based approach with quadtree search. The approach initially searches for frequent patterns with a coarse grid and drills down into a finer grid level to discover more minute patterns. The algorithm is naturally parallelized and implemented in the MapReduce programming model to accelerate the computation. Our evaluative experiments on real-word data show the effectiveness of our approach in mining complex patterns with lower computational cost than the previous work.

FS is a process to select most instructive features from the given data set. In this paper, we propose a new soft set based unsupervised feature selection algorithm. The reduction of attributes is achieved by using Soft Set Theory. Attributes are removed so that the reduced set provides the same predictive capability of the original set of features. The supremacy of the algorithm, in terms of speed and performance, is established extensively over various data sets. The result obtained using the proposed method is compared with existing rough set based unsupervised feature selection algorithm and this work demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Electronic business growth has increased very much in a great deal of practices. Researchers have posed rules-based auditing systems for electronic business transactions, but they rely on the auditor's knowledge of e-business fraud highly. While fraud happen, it is difficult to deal with by business systems due to the large number of online transactions. In this paper, we introduce a method that to bring about rules from fraud patterns based on data mining. Nextly, the system can distinguish transactions that have a high chance be deceptive by making use of these rules to e-business databases.

To prevent accidents, these factors are to be eliminated finally but it could not best solution due to time and space limitation. The data mining technique is also applied in various fields as a method to extract information based on massive data, and neural networks are also utilized as useful modeling technique. In this paper, using the neural network in a traffic accident in-depth analysis of scientific research through the pre-crash factors is proposed in order to reduce traffic accidents. For the prevention of traffic accident, the main factors are found associated with deaths. However, it is a difficult problem to present the perfect result while considering all circumstances if applied in actual problems, as multiple variables that affects the result. Through neural network learning values by adjusting the weights between each node and important factors can be found. In this paper, two kinds of neural networks of MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) and RBFN (Radial-Basis Function Network) are experimented by XLMiner. As the result, it had some weight whether driving with drunk or high speed.

However some of the data mining techniques like classification and clustering cannot deal with numeric attributes though most real dataset contains some numeric attributes. Continuous attributes should be divided into a small distinct range of nominal attributes in order to apply data mining techniques. Correct discretization makes the dataset succinct and contributes to the high performance of classification algorithms. Meanwhile, several methods are presented and applied, but it is often dependent on the area. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid discretization technique based on entropy and contingency coefficient. Also we analyze performance evaluation with well-known techniques of discretization such as Equal-width binning, 1R, MDLP and ChiMerge.

Therefore, only knowledge transfer from these portfolios in inference for new one is possible.

Existing work on clustering focused on only categorical data which is based on attribute values for grouping similar kind of data. This paper is based on clustering the continuous and categorical data set in efficient manner. The goal is to use integrated clustering approach based on high dimensional categorical data that works well for data with mixed continuous and categorical features. The exprimental results of the proposed method on several data sets suggests that the link based cluster ensemble algorithm when integrate with k-means algorithm to produce final results. The scope of this proposed work is used to provide the accurate and efficient results, whenever the user wants to access the data from the database.	[Kalaivani, K.; Raghavendra, A. P.

The various sources through which the information is collected are banking, healthcare system, insurance companies, government organizations etc. The information collected in this manner is treated as an asset with great quality, research value and is used for analysis purpose by organizations. Various data mining techniques are applied on such huge data to acquire useful [1] and relevant knowledge. Such information is not only used by organization but also released for public to acquire knowledge and benefits from such data. Sometimes dissemination of such data [2] which includes sensitive and personal information becomes the main source of sign of danger to violate the privacy of an individual. The simplest solution for this problem is to transform the sensitive information before disseminating it to the outside world. The data transformation should be performed in such a manner that the intruder should not be able to extract the true sensitive information and the released data should be valid for data analysis. Privacy of sensitive information can be protected by replacing the true data by false but realistic ones. Generally the database owner predefines the sensitive attributes whose data values are to be scrambled. The crucial task to recognize the sensitive attributes in the database has not been developed. In this paper we propose an innovative approach which accepts the user queries consisting of different attributes and identifies the sensitive attributes whose values are to be scrambled depending on threshold value. The threshold value is calculated depending on the different weights assigned to individual attributes. The information under those particular attributes whose total weights exceeds the threshold values is scrambled.

However traces can be very large, which hinders their effective exploitation. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a k-golden set of blocks that best characterize data. Sequential pattern mining can help to automatically discover the blocks, and we called k-golden set, a set of k blocks that maximally covers the trace. These kind of blocks can simplify the exploration of large traces by allowing programmers to see an abstraction instead of low-level events. We propose an approach for mining golden blocks and finding coverage of frames. The experiments carried out on video and audio application decoding show very promising results.	[Kamdem, C.

In recent years, several methods have been proposed for making classifiers learned over discriminatory data discrimination-aware. However, these methods suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) They require either modifying the discriminatory data or tweaking a specific classification algorithm and (2) They are not flexible w.r.t. discrimination control and multiple sensitive attribute handling. In this paper, we present two solutions for discrimination-aware classification that neither require data modification nor classifier tweaking. Our first and second solutions exploit, respectively, the reject option of probabilistic classifier(s) and the disagreement region of general classifier ensembles to reduce discrimination. We relate both solutions with decision theory for better understanding of the process. Our experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate that our solutions outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, especially at low discrimination which is a significant advantage. The superior performance coupled with flexible control over discrimination and easy applicability to multiple sensitive attributes makes our solutions an important step forward in practical discrimination-aware classification.

To prevent discrimination arising from the use of discriminatory data, recent data mining research has focused on methods for making classifiers learned over discriminatory data discrimination-aware. Most of these methods have been tested on standard classification datasets that have been tweaked for discrimination analysis rather than over actual discriminatory data. In this paper, we study discrimination-aware classification when applied to a real-world dataset of Statistics Netherlands, which is a census body in the Netherlands. Specifically, we consider the use of classifiers for predicting whether an individual is a crime suspect, or not, to support law enforcement and security agencies' decision making. Our results show that discrimination does exist in real world datasets and blind use of classifiers learned over such datasets can exacerbate the discrimination problem. We demonstrate that discrimination-aware classification methods can mitigate the discriminatory effects and that they lead to rational and legally acceptable decisions.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair regarding sensitive features such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to develop fairness-aware or discrimination-aware data mining techniques that take into account issues of social fairness, discrimination, and neutrality. In this paper, after demonstrating the applications of these techniques, we explore the formal concepts of fairness and techniques for handling fairness in data mining. We then provide an integrated view of these concepts based on statistical independence. Finally, we discuss the relations between fairness-aware data mining and other research topics, such as privacy-preserving data mining or causal inference.

Many types of entities need to collect, analyze, and disseminate data rapidly and accurately, without exposing sensitive information to unauthorized or untrusted parties. Solutions based on secure multiparty computation guarantee privacy and correctness, at an extra communication (too costly in communication to be practical) and computation cost. The high overhead motivates us to extend this SMC to cloud environment which provides large computation and communication capacity which makes SMC to be used between multiple clouds (i.e., it may between private or public or hybrid clouds). Cloud may encompass many high capacity servers which acts as a hosts which participate in computation (IaaS and PaaS) for final result, which is controlled by Cloud Trusted Authority (CTA) for secret sharing within the cloud. The communication between two clouds is controlled by High Level Trusted Authority (HLTA) which is one of the hosts in a cloud which provides MgaaS (Management as a Service). Due to high risk for security in clouds, HLTA generates and distributes public keys and private keys by using Carmichael-R-Prime-RSA algorithm for exchange of private data in SMC between itself and clouds. In cloud, CTA creates Group key for Secure communication between the hosts in cloud based on keys sent by HLTA for exchange of Intermediate values and shares for computation of final result. Since this scheme is extended to be used in clouds(due to high availability and scalability to increase computation power) it is possible to implement SMC practically for privacy preserving in data mining at low cost for the clients.

In this paper we extend Kleinberg's algorithm in an information-theoretic fashion to obtain a new class of algorithms and apply it into learning of piecewise stationary memoryless sources (PSMSs). The keys of the proposed algorithm are; 1) the parameter space is discretized so that discretization scale depends on the Fisher information, and 2) the optimal path over the discretized parameter space is efficiently computed using the dynamic programming method so that the sum of the data and parameter description lengths is minimized on the basis of the MDL principle. We prove that an upper bound on the total code-length for the proposed algorithm asymptotically matches Merhav's lower bound.

However, there still exists limitation on RFID-based services such as transferring the simple information of exhibits at exhibition halls or managing the exhibits stored in warehouses. In order to improve the service qualities at exhibition centers, showrooms, or museums, we have developed a system, which can provide the disruptive services using mobile RFID technology. Our system accumulates the information such as how many people visit a specific exhibit, what the demographic information the visitors have, and what kinds of items the visitors see, and so on whenever visitors read a tag on an exhibit with an RFID reader connected to a mobile device. The accumulated information is stored in a database to provide an efficient search service and to bring a better service to the visitors. We have developed an application program for analyzing the visitors' data retrieval pattern from the database. Using this program, our system can get the information about the movement paths of the visitors. Also, by adopting data mining technology, we also propose a novel approach to enhance RFID-based services so that visitors can have a customized real-time question-answering service from assistants in a certain exhibition hall or museum whenever they are intrigued to know about exhibits.

In this paper, we propose a new matrix lower rank approximation called Bounded Matrix Low Rank Approximation (BMA) which imposes a lower and an upper bound on every element of a lower rank matrix that best approximates a given matrix with missing elements. This new approximation models many real world problems, such as recommender systems, and performs better than other methods, such as singular value decompositions (SVD) or NMF. We present an efficient algorithm to solve BMA based on coordinate descent method. BMA is different from NMF as it imposes bounds on the approximation itself rather than on each of the low rank factors. We show that our algorithm is scalable for large matrices with missing elements on multi core systems with low memory. We present substantial experimental results illustrating that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for recommender systems such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Alternating Least Squares with regularization, SVD++, Bias-SVD on real world data sets such as Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and Netflix.

The basic idea of providing knowledge is done via the web services in which we use a knowledge server to answer the queries of the consumers. A web service is a single entity which comprises of cluster of functionalities and is made available at the heart of the network and the knowledge data are entitled to be used by the knowledge consumers in a standardized manner to maintain transparency. Here, we have proposed an architecture called Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) where we use utility mining algorithms for extracting the knowledge data from the data owners when the knowledge consumers are in need of a particular knowledge data. The main motive behind proposing architecture is to provide Utility Mining as a service in a distributed computing environment which can be applied in business such as cross selling approach. This novel architectural based approach is experimented in online shopping cart system.

The relationship among patterns provides information for the ragas. It can be converted into knowledge about historical patterns and future trends. Raga is an attractive combination of notes, engaging tonal context. Western Music has been under the gaze of this community for quite some time. However, Indian music has remained relatively untouched. Generating script for a musical composition and identifying raga in Indian Classical music is a tedious and time consuming task. Here, we depict a system which takes an audio file as an input identifies the language and instruments which will give nativity of music and converts it into sequence of notes, identifies the raga. The system is analyzed for 55 different rags and tested for 20 different ragas. The system performs with a result of 85%.

Spatial data mining techniques has been collaboratively applied to extract implicit knowledge from spatial as well as non-spatial attributes. These techniques are efficiently applied in several fields such as healthcare, environmental, marketing and remote sensing databases to improve planning and decision making process. In this paper, we have designed and implemented SpaGRID framework for detection of spatial clusters. The framework has unprecedented efficiency to extract implicit knowledge of spatial data, due to its accessibility to handle and discover hidden patterns from spatial databases. We have also illustrated the usage of spatial variations among the United States men with prevalence of prostate cancer disease. The data of age group was taken from (15-65+) years in this group prostate cancers were examined and several stages of disease diagnosis was taken into account. The population of data was characterized by white, black and others were too small to be taken into account. Numerous challenges were encountered due to complexity of spatial datasets hence being resolved by certain statistical measures. The approach is to discover knowledge from spatial databases and design different aspects of knowledge discovery process from spatial databases.

Web data mining is the extraction of data on web. The term Web Data Mining is a technique used to crawl through various web resources to collect required information, which enables an individual or a company to promote business, understanding marketing dynamics, new promotions floating on the Internet, etc. The data on web is unstructured, irregular and lacks a fixed unified pattern as it is presented in HTML format that represents data in the presentation format and is unable to handle semi-structured or unstructured data. These difficulties lead to the emergence of XML based web data mining. XML was created so that richly structured documents could be used over the web.XML provides a standard for the data exchange and data storage This paper presents a web data mining model based on XML. In this model first of all unstructured data is transformed to XML and then XML document is stored in database in the form of the string tree, then specific records are searched using a LINQ query. If record does not exist in the database then check the updates of specific website and repeat the same steps. At last data selected by LINQ Query is displayed on web browser. The feature that helped to increase the speed of data extraction and that also reduces the time of extraction is the presence of database that stores the data that have been extracted earlier by a user and can be used by other users by passing a LINQ query in this model there is no need to create an extra separate XSL file because this model stores xml document in the database in the form of the string tree. This model is implemented using C# with XML.			payalpreetkaur@gmail.com; gargraghu@ymail.com; sidhu_225@yahoo.co.in; mandeepsingh.iit@gmail.com					Bradley P, 2002, COMMUN ACM, V45, P38; Chakrabari S., 2003, MINING WEB DISCOVERI; Chen Yufang, 2004, COMPUTER ENG APPL, V40, P150; Cheng Zheng, INT C COMP INT SEC, DOI DOI 10.1109/CIS.2009.267; Li Jian, J SOFIWARE, V19, P231; Ni Xianjun, INT C COMP ENG TECHN; Tu Chengsheng, 2003, RES WEB CONTENT MINI, P6; Wang Qijun, 2000, COMPUTER ENG, V26, P158; Wu Honghan, BROWSING RDF DATA ST; Zhou Xiaomei, COMPUTER ENG DESIGN, V28, P198	10	0	0	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	STAFA-ZURICH	LAUBLSRUTISTR 24, CH-8717 STAFA-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND	1022-6680	978-3-03785-312-2	ADV MATER RES-SWITZ			2012	403-408						1062	1067		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.403-408.1062		6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Computer Science; Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science	BCN35	WOS:000310764700177

In the proposed model, the input auction space is partitioned into groups of similar auctions by k-means clustering algorithm. The recurrent problem of finding the value of k in k-means algorithm is solved by employing elbow method using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the transformed data after clustering, bid selector nominates the cluster for the current auction whose price is to be forecasted. Regression trees are employed to predict the end-price and designing the optimal bidding strategies for the current auction. Our results show the improvements in the end price prediction using clustering and regression tree approach.

Map-Reduce has been the most popular programming paradigm for developing applications in large scale distributed environments. In this paper we present design of a scalable clustering algorithm 'Exclusive and Complete Clustering using PACT Programming model' (ExCC-P) for recently developed Stratosphere system for cloud computing environment. This system supports novel model for programming in large scale distributed environments. Based on the concept of Parallelization Contracts, the PACT programming model is a generalization of Map-Reduce paradigm. PACT programs are complied by a PACT compiler and executed by Nephele execution engine of Stratosphere after optimizing data-flow graphs. The algorithm ExCC-P is proposed as a solution for incremental clustering of unbounded massive data sets, to be executed in Stratosphere environment. The algorithm discretizes data space into a conceptual grid and processes data in batches. After a batch is processed, the algorithm applies connected component analysis on the grid to deliver arbitrarily shaped clusters. Limited experimentation on this under-development system (Stratosphere) validated PACT programming model for the proposed algorithm.

By discovering predictive relationships between different pieces of extracted data from the medicine field, data-mining algorithms can be used to improve the precision of information extraction. Medical text retrieval refers to text retrieval techniques applied to biomedical resources and articles available in the biomedical domain. In this paper we propose an approach to extract the important medical text from the published medical articles. The medical text here means the disease and the treatment keywords. Here we extract the relationship between the disease and the treatment. The three relations that we extract are cure, prevention and side-effect. The amount of published medical articles, and therefore the underlying medical knowledge base, is expanding at an increasing rate. So retrieval of the reliable information is a difficult task. To overcome that we propose this method and also we develop an expert system to develop medical diagnosis applications and the medication management which serves a good purpose for the laypeople as well as for the people who do research in the medical field. This paper presents a technique for using data mining algorithm to increase the accuracy of medical text extraction.

Today the requirement of automatic extraction of useful knowledge among large-capacity data is completely realized. Consequently, the automatic analysis and data discovery tools are in progress rapidly. Data mining is a knowledge that analyzes extensive level of unstructured data and helps discovering the required connections for better understanding of fundamental concepts. On the other sides, temporal data mining is related to the analysis of sequential data streams with temporal dependence. The purpose of temporal data mining is detection of hidden patterns in either unexpected behaviours or other exact connections of data. Hitherto various algorithms have been presented for temporal data mining. The aim of present study is to introduce, collect and evaluate these algorithms to create a global view over temporal data mining analyses. According to significant importance of temporal data mining in diverse practical applications, our suggestive collection can be considerably beneficial in selecting the appropriate algorithm.

Real estimation requires cost and effort factors in producing software by using of algorithmic or Artificial Intelligent (AI) techniques. Boehm developed the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) that is one of the algorithmic SCE models. Also, these models contain three increasingly basic, intermediate and detailed forms, i.e. basic COCOMO is suitable for quick, early, rough order of among the estimates of required effort in producing software, but its accuracy is limited due to its loss of factors to account for difference between cost drivers. Intermediate COCOMO assumes these project attributes into account. In addition detailed COCOMO accounts for individual project phases used. The COCOMO algorithmic techniques families have used since 1981. In recent years, some techniques emerged by using intelligent techniques to solve and estimate the effort required in producing software. In this paper, different data mining techniques to estimate software costs are presented and then the results of each technique are evaluated and compared. However, NASA's projects to train and test each of these techniques are applied. Then, data set to train and test the data mining techniques improve the estimation accuracy of the models in many cases. We show the comparison between COCOMO model and data mining techniques here. The results indicate that these methods result in many benefit answers. Also we show the comparison of the estimation accuracy of COCOMO model with data mining techniques. Data mining techniques improve the estimation accuracy of the models in many cases. So the estimated effort more improvement in this models.

No filtering categorization has been currently proposed. Numerous lists of banned, unethical and objectionable words have been developed with limited user satisfaction. Lists are usually manually generated, with some programmable extensibility for online forums and public newsgroups. We define a tool and methodology to categorize the censor data. We statistically grow words in the categorized data and tag the hidden neutral words with meaning in context. Using Computational Linguistics tools and modifying them to suit our means, we analyze sample text from gigabytes of email newsgroup dataset over Cloud Servers. A sample result dataset of the most frequently used words breaking the norms in recent cloud communication is presented in the results in broad categories. The categories separate cloud-server data found in newsgroups related to internet crimes, fraud, theft, anti-state elements, and other material of legal importance. Thus this study demonstrates a tag cloud of most frequent critical words in communications from legal and ethical point-of-view in the current scenario of cloud databases.

Thus the identification of different kinds of settlements is a major concern and challenge for authorities of many countries. Very High Resolution (VHR) Remotely Sensed imagery has proved to be a very promising way to detect different kinds of settlements, especially through the using of new object-based image analysis (OBIA). The most important key is in understanding what characteristics make unplanned settlements differ from planned ones, where most experts characterize unplanned urban areas by small building sizes at high densities, no orderly road arrangement and Lack of green spaces. Knowledge about different kinds of settlements can be captured as a domain ontology that has the potential to organize knowledge in a formal, understandable and sharable way. In this work we focus on extracting knowledge from VHR images and expert's knowledge. We used an object based strategy by segmenting a VHR image taken over urban area into regions of homogenous pixels at adequate scale level and then computing spectral, spatial and textural attributes for each region to create objects. A genetic-based data mining was applied to generate high predictive and comprehensible classification rules based on selected samples from the OBIA result. Optimized intervals of relevant attributes are found, linked with land use types for forming classification rules. The unplanned areas were separated from the planned ones, through analyzing of the line segments detected from the input image.

That is why discovering patterns of higher level is an active research field. In this paper, by investigating the relationship between constraint-based mining and constraint satisfaction problems, we propose an approach to model and mine queries involving several local patterns (n-ary patterns). First, the user expresses his/her query under constraints involving n-ary patterns. Second, the constraints are formulated using constraint programming and solved by a constraint solver which generates the correct and complete set of solutions. This dissociation allows the user to express in a declarative way a large set of queries without taking care of their solving. Our approach also takes benefit from the recent progress on mining local patterns by pushing, with a solver on local patterns, all local constraints which can be inferred from the query. This approach enables us to model in a flexible way any set of constraints combining several local patterns and it leads to discover patterns of higher level. Experiments show the feasibility and the interest of our approach.

However, documents are also associated with further information, such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example, news articles are usually related to several people, organizations, countries or locations. Since those associated entities carry rich information, it is highly desirable to build more expressive, entity-based topic models, which can capture the term distributions for each topic, each entity, as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities. ETM not only models the generative process of a term given its topic and entity information, but also models the correlation of entity term distributions and topic term distributions. A Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is proposed to learn the model. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Representing of texts in the concept-space derived from Wikipedia has received growing attention recently. This concept-based representation is capable of extracting semantic relatedness between texts that cannot be deduced with the bag of words model. A key obstacle, however, for using Wikipedia as a semantic interpreter is that the sheer size of the concepts derived from Wikipedia makes it hard to efficiently map texts into concept-space. In this paper, we develop an efficient and effective algorithm which is able to represent the meaning of a text by using the concepts that best match it. In particular, our approach first computes the approximate top-k Wikipedia concepts that are most relevant to the given text. We then leverage these concepts for representing the meaning of the given text. The experimental results show that the proposed technique provides significant gains in execution time without causing significant reduction in precision. We then explore the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on a real world problem. In particular, we show that this novel scheme could be leveraged to boost the effectiveness in finding topic boundaries in a news video.

Our method groups users of similar preferences and utilizes the group profile information for recommending contents in a more specialized manner to the target user. We experimented with our method using the data of the actual one-month IPTV services. The experiment results showed the success rate of 93.58% and the precision of 77.40%, which are recognized as a good performance for IPTV services.

One application of such a general capability is to the provisional identification of networks, or rather, of associations within networks. Conversely, given a network structure among entities that are associated with various texts, the network structure can itself contribute usefully to construction of indicators derived from texts. The focus of the paper is on basic concepts and methods for deriving indicators from texts. Much research remains to be done.

A metric space also provides a "ruler", or absolute measure of how different two feature vectors are. In the computer vision community color can easily be miss-treated as a metric distance. This paper serves as an introduction to why using a non-metric space is a challenge, and provides details of why color is not a valid Euclidean distance metric.

We used learner profiles to personalize this technology. After a short introduction to this technology, we discuss the result of a practical application and draw conclusions. In particular, we could not obtain sufficient data to establish this kind of learner profiles. Therefore, we shifted our strategy from an "eager" one of holding an explicit model towards a "lazy" strategy of mining with data, which is really available without making "guesses" what they mean (profiles). In particular, we utilize the educational history of the students and vocational ambitions for student modeling.

In former work, the authors developed a modeling system for university learning processes, which aims at evaluating and refining university curricula to reach an optimal learning success in terms of the best possible grade point average (GPA). This is performed by applying an Educational Data Mining (EDM) technology to former students curricula and their degree of success (GPA) and thus, uncovering golden didactic knowledge for successful education. Here, we introduce a complementary technology to mine course characteristics similarities of former students' study traces and utilize them to optimize curricula of current students based to their performance traits revealed by their study achievements so far. This way, technology generates suggestions of personalized curricula. Furthermore, this technology is supplemented by an adaptation mechanism, which compares recent data with historical data to ensure that the similarity of mined characteristics follow the dynamic changes affecting curriculum (e.g., revision of course contents and materials, and changes in teachers, etc.).

Those systems are rather complex and lack a mobile-specific design. Thus, we propose a mobile running route recommender system (RRR) which supports the user while running or while planning the running route. The gathering and modeling of the route and its context/environment is discussed in respect of computational performance. A four dimensional plugin based ranking function is established that considers location-, time-, content-, and community-specific route features which cover all data types in our database. A conceptual model shows how the runner's physical condition could be involved by predicting the heart rate for certain routes. Therefore, Artificial Neural Networks are chosen as data mining methodology to extend the existing recommender system.

Recent improvements in CAM system make it easier for even unskilled engineers to generate NC programs. In the NC program, the end-milling conditions are decided by engineers. However, engineers need to decide the order of the process, cutting tool selection, and the end-milling conditions on the basis of their expertise and background knowledge because the CAM system cannot automatically decide. Data-mining methods were used to support decisions about end-milling conditions. Our aim was to extract new knowledge by applying data-mining techniques to a tool catalog. We used both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering of catalog data and also used applied multiple regression analysis. We focused on the shape element of catalog data and we visually grouped ball end-mills from the viewpoint of tool shape, which here meant the ratio of dimensions, by using the k-means method. We also found an expression for calculating end-milling conditions, and we compared the calculated with the catalog values.

However, the analysis of such high dimensional bioimages is a difficult task for most of the labs, since software solutions for particular data mining steps are difficult to use or just not available. In this paper we present two new free online tools: MICOLT (Multivariate Image COlocation Tool) and MIFIST (Multivariate Image Frequent Item Set Tool). Both tools can be used via our recently proposed online bioimage analysis platform BioIMAX, so users can upload their bioimage data, apply the tools and share the results with other invited users based on BioIMAX' concept of shared virtual projects. Data mining with these tools includes the computation and visualization colocation factors well established in the microscopy community (like Mander's score) and association rule mining following the frequent item set principle, thereby supporting large and small scale analysis.

Biological data includes protein sequence, function, pathways, nucleic acid and genetic interaction. Bioinformatics is a branch of study which deals with storage, retrieval, analysis of the Biological data. However, there is a lacking in availability of analysis tools which discover relationships that are hidden and trends in data.

The final goal is to build a neural network that can efficiently be implemented in distributed memory machines. Thus a fast simple parallel training scheme for RBPNNs is studied, that is based almost solely on Gaussian summations which can by their part be efficiently mapped on parallel as well as on pipeline distributed machines. The suggested training scheme is tested for accuracy and performance and can guarantee simplicity, parallelization and linear speed ups in common parallel implementations, namely neuron parallel and pipelining studied here.

They often provide useful information that can be used for data mining tasks. However, a trajectory database may contain sensitive attributes that are associated with trajectory data. Therefore, improper publishing of the trajectory database could put the privacy of moving objects at risk. Removing identifiers from the trajectory database before the public release, is not effective against privacy attacks, especially, when the adversary employs some background knowledge. The existing approaches for privacy preservation in trajectory data publishing apply the same amount of privacy preservation for all moving objects, without regard to their privacy requirements. The consequence is that some moving objects may be offered insufficient privacy preservation, while some others may not need high privacy protection. In this paper, we address this issue and present a novel approach for privacy preservation in trajectory data publishing based on the concept of personalized privacy. It consists of two main steps: (1) identifying primary critical trajectory data records and generalizing sensitive attributes according to them, and (2) identifying remaining critical trajectory data records and eliminating moving points with minimum information loss. The results of experiments on a trajectory dataset show that our proposed approach achieve the conflicting goals of data utility and data privacy in accordance with the privacy requirements of moving objects.

Econometric and statistical models, as well as machine learning and data mining techniques, have proposed heuristic based solutions with limited long-range success. In practice, the capabilities and intelligence of financial experts is required to build a managed portfolio of stocks. However, for non-professional investors, it is too complicated to make subjective judgments on available stocks and thus they might be interested to follow an expert's investment decision. For this purpose, it is critical to find an expert with similar investment preferences. In this work, we propose to benefit from the power of Social Network Analysis in this domain. We first build a social network of financial experts based on their publicly available portfolios. This social network is then used for further analysis to recommend an appropriate managed portfolio to non-professional investors based on their behavioral similarities to the expert investors. This approach is evaluated through a case study on real portfolios. The result shows that the proposed portfolio recommendation approach works well in terms of Sharpe ratio as the portfolio performance metric.

It can be easily verified that trying to infer trust based on the social network alone is often inefficient. Therefore, the avenue we explore is applying Data Mining algorithms to unearth latent relationships and patterns from background data. In this paper, we focus on a case where the background data is user ratings for online product reviews. We consider as a testing ground a large dataset provided by Epinions.com that contains a trust network as well as user ratings for reviews on products from a wide range of categories. In order to predict trust we define and compute a critical set of features, which we show to be highly effective in providing the basis for trust predictions. Then, we show that state-of-the-art classifiers can do an impressive job in predicting trust based on our extracted features. For this, we employ a variety of measures to evaluate the classification based on these features. We show that by carefully collecting and synthesizing readily available background information, such as ratings for online reviews, one can accurately predict social links based on trust.

These ants have a simple but efficient prey search strategy: when they capture their prey, they return straight to their nest, drop off the prey and systematically return back to their original position. This behavior has already been applied to optimization, as the API meta-heuristic. API is a shortage of api-calis. Here, we combine API with the ability of ants to sort and cluster. We provide a comparison against Ant clustering Algorithm and K-Means using Machine Learning repository datasets. API introduces new concepts to ant-based models and gives us promising results.

The Impact of Recommender Systems on Item-, User-, and Rating-Diversity	AGENTS AND DATA MINING INTERACTION	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Workshop on Agents and Data Mining Interaction (ADMI 2011)	MAY 02-06, 2011	Taipei, TAIWAN	Agent Min Interact & Integrat, Special Interest Grp				Recommender systems are increasingly used for personalised navigation through large amounts of information, especially in the e-commerce domain for product purchase advice. Whilst much research effort is spent on developing recommenders further, there is little to no effort spent on analysing the impact of them neither on the supply (company) nor demand (consumer) side. In this article, we investigate the diversity impact of a movie recommender. We define diversity for different parts of the domain and measure it in different ways. The novelty of our work is the usage of real rating data (from Netflix) and a recommender system for investigating the (hypothetical) effects of various configurations of the system and users' choice models. We consider a number of different scenarios (which differ in agents' choice models), run extensive simulations, analyse various measurements regarding experimental validation and diversity, and report on selected findings. The scenarios are art essential part of our work, since these can be influenced by the owner of the recommender once deployed. This article contains an overview of related work on data-mining, multi-agent systems, movie recommendation and measurement of diversity; we explain different agents' choice models (which are used to simulate how users react to recommenders); and we report on selected findings from an extensive series of simulation experiments that we ran with real usage data (from Netflix).

Data streams are the order of the day input sources. In general, data streams exhibit a peculiar behavior of drifting the concepts as time passes by. Here is a study of GP Classifier on Concept Drifting Data Streams. GP classifier performance is compared to that of other state-of-the-art data mining and stream classification approaches. Boosting is a machine learning meta-algorithm for performing supervised learning. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier which is only slightly correlated with the true classification. In contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification. Boosting combines a set of weak learners to create a strong learner. It is observed that the Boosting GP approach is beating Boosting Naive Bayes classification on Concept Drifting Data Streams. Hence it is found that GP is a competent algorithm for Concept Drifting Data Stream classification.	[Kumar, Dirisala J.

Recently, frequent patterns along with regularity have good reputation in data mining research. A frequent pattern is regular frequent pattern if it occurs at less than or equal to user given maximum regularity threshold. So, in this paper we are introducing a new algorithm RFPDS to mine frequent patterns that occur at regular intervals from high speed data streams with sliding window technique using vertical data format, satisfies downward closure property. Our experiment results show the outperformance of our algorithm in discovering recent regular frequent patterns from a high speed data stream.	[Kumar, G.

IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user. A variety of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed for protecting computers and networks from malicious attacks by using traditional statistical methods to new data mining approaches in last decades. However, today's commercially available intrusion detection systems are signature-based that are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we analyze a classification model for misuse and anomaly attack detection using decision tree algorithm.	[Kumar, Manish; Kumar, T. V.

This can be achieved only when the institutions are capable of predicting the student's behavior, their attitude towards studies and also the outcome of their result in the forth coming examinations. This can be achieved through various data mining techniques like classification, clustering and rule based mining. Classification techniques like decision trees, Bayesian network and neural networks can be used to predict the student's outcome in the examination based on their attendance percentage, their marks in the internal examination, the historical data available in the form of their previously scored percentage etc. Bayesian classification technique is used to predict the student's outcome in the university examination based on the marks obtained by them in the internal examination. Bayes classification is used to predict the result of the student on an individual basis which has helped the tutor to identify the weak students in each subject. This result has helped the tutors to concentrate on those weak students and bring out better results. This prediction will also help the institution to reduce the drop out ratio and produce better results.	[Kumar, S. Anupama; Vijayalakshmi, M.

Here, the main aim of privacy preserving data mining is to find the global mining results by preserving the individual sites private data/information. Many Privacy Preserving Association Rule Mining (PPARM) algorithms are proposed for different partitioning methods by satisfying privacy constraints. The various methods such as randomization, perturbation, heuristic and cryptography techniques are proposed by different authors to find privacy preserving association rule mining in horizontally and vertically partitioned databases. In this paper, the analysis of different methods for PPARM is performed and their results are compared. For satisfying the privacy constraints in vertically partitioned databases, algorithm based on cryptography techniques, Homomorphic encryption, Secure Scalar product and Shamir's secret sharing technique are used. For horizontal Partitioned databases, algorithm that combines advantage of both RSA public key cryptosystem and Homomorphic encryption scheme and algorithm that uses Paillier cryptosystem to compute global supports are used. This paper reviews the wide methods used for mining association rules over distributed dataset while preserving privacy.

While checkpointing, including checkpointing of parallel programs like MPI applications, provides a general solution, the overhead of this approach is becoming increasingly unacceptable. Thus, algorithm-based fault-tolerance provides a nice practical alternative, though it is less general. Although this approach has been studied for many applications, there is no existing work for algorithm-based fault-tolerance for the growing class of data-intensive parallel applications. In this paper, we present an algorithm-based fault tolerance solution that handles fail-stop failures for a class of data intensive algorithms. We divide the dataset into smaller data blocks and in replication step, we distribute the replicated blocks with the aim of keeping the maximum data intersection between any two processors minimum. This allows us to have minimum data loss when multiple failures occur. In addition, our approach enables better load balance after failure, and decreases the amount of re-processing of the lost data. We have evaluated our approach by using two popular parallel data mining algorithms, which are k-means and apriori. We show that our approach has negligible overhead when there are no failures, and allows us to gracefully handle different number of failures, and failures at different points of processing. We also provide the comparison of our approach with the MapReduce based solution for fault tolerance, and show that we outperform Hadoop both in absence and presence of failures.

Considering the growth of educational field as a business, clustering of educational data must be focused as it can give effective results as in the case of mining enrolled students on the basis of education they undertake. A new algorithm is proposed and implemented by us for clustering educational data. This algorithm is based on a continuous looping procedure. Raw dataset is assigned to clustering algorithm initially and a novel cluster is identified for partition whose cluster high degree is less. Then improvement of degree of cluster is carried out. In this algorithm on the basis of homogeneity, cluster high degree is defined. Experiment is carried out on educational data; which provides good high degree clusters.

The accurate prediction of protein folding rate change is helpful and useful in protein design. In earlier study, we have firstly analyzed the prediction of folding rate change upon single point mutation and constructed a non-redundant dataset of F467. F467 consists of 467 mutants with various features and widely distributed on secondary structure, solvent accessibility, conservation score and long-range contacts. In this work, we therefore focused on effectively developing the knowledge in F467 dataset. We have systematically analyzed the dataset and presented several representative data mining techniques, including decision tree, decision table and association rule algorithms. Furthermore, we have interpreted, evaluated, and compared the knowledge obtained from different techniques. The experimental results showed that the present approach can effectively develop the knowledge in the dataset and the outcomes can increase the understanding of predicting protein folding rate change upon single mutation.

However, in current health examination systems, people get only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the data containing historical health records and personal life style information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be given to people for disease prevention.

Through CEC 2005 to CEC 2011 competitions, many different algorithms have been proposed to solve continuous problems. The advances on this type of problems are of capital importance as many real-world problems from very different domains (biology, engineering, data mining, etc.) can be formulated as the optimization of a continuous function. In this paper we analyze the behavior of a hybrid algorithm combining two heuristics that have been successfully applied to solving continuous optimization problems in the past. We show that the combination of both algorithms obtains competitive results on the proposed benchmark by automatically selecting the most appropriate heuristic for each function and search phase.

In the past couple of years, however, new datasets have been built by automatically extracting facts, as subject-predicate-object triples, from semistructured information sources such as Wikipedia. Recently some approaches, for example, in the context of YAGO2, have extended such facts by adding temporal and spatial information. The presence of such new data sources gives rise to new approaches for discovering spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper, we present a framework in support of the discovery of interesting spatio-temporal patterns from knowledge base datasets. Different from traditional approaches to mining spatio-temporal data, we focus on mining patterns at different levels of granularity by exploiting concept hierarchies, which are a key ingredient in knowledge bases. We introduce a pattern specification language and outline an algorithmic approach to efficiently determine complex patterns.

High-throughput pyrosequencing is a next-generation sequencing technique very popular in microbial community analysis due to its longer read length compared to alternative methods. Computational tools are inevitable to process raw data from pyrosequencers, and in particular, noise removal is a critical data-mining step to obtain robust sequence reads. However, the slow rate of existing denoisers has bottlenecked the whole pyrosequencing process, let alone hindering efforts to improve robustness. To address these, we propose a new approach that can accelerate the denoising process substantially. By using our approach, it now takes only about 2 hours to denoise 62,873 pyrosequenced amplicons from a mixture of 91 full-length 16S rRNA clones. It would otherwise take nearly 2.5 days if existing software tools were used. Furthermore, our approach can effectively reduce overestimating the number of OTUs, producing 6.7 times fewer species-level OTUs on average than a state-of-the-art alternative under the same condition. Leveraged by our approach, we hope that metagenomic sequencing will become an even more appealing tool for microbial community analysis.

To learn effectively from dynamic data evolving over time, it is required to detect the drift of the concept of data. We present a method to detect it by utilizing the correlation information of value distribution and apply our method to a learning task on a multi-stream data model. The result of experiments on a synthetic data set shows that our approach could provide a reasonable threshold to detect the change between windowed batches of stream data.

Although time-interval data have been dealt with in the past - as single or multiple, regular or irregular, and/or with definite ranges, what we are proposing here is a data mining algorithm that allows multiple time intervals in a sequence that are irregular and more flexible by employing a clustering technique integrated in an Apriori-based algorithm. Clustering allows non-integral time values to be categorized effectively and efficiently and leads to the characterizations of time interval data. In light of our research on a smart space that aims to provide empathic support to its occupant, we aim to use our algorithm as tool when building various predictive models of human behavior. Behavior modeling is a persisting and compelling issue in the design of intelligent environments in order to anticipate user needs and provide timely system responses. Insensitive or untimely system responses solicit unfavorable user reception. As proof of concept, we used our algorithm to infer the behavior patterns of individuals in terms of their habitual paths and walk time, i.e., spots in the space that an individual would likely take coupled with walk duration intervals. Our smart space may then use these two parameters to create models of effective timely interactive support provisions.

However, the power of the results depends on the nature of the clusters prototypes generated by the clustering technique. Some cluster algorithms just label the data points producing a prototype for the cluster as the full set of data points belonging to the clusters. Some techniques produce a single 'abstract' data point as the model for the full cluster losing the information of the shape, size and structure of the cluster. This paper proposes an on-line cluster prototype generation mechanism for the Gravitational Clustering algorithm. The idea is to use the gravitational system dynamic and the inherent hierarchical property of the gravitational algorithm for determining some summarized prototypes of clusters at the same time the gravitational clustering algorithm is finding such clusters. In this way, a cluster is represented by several different 'abstract' data points allowing the algorithm to find an appropriated representation of clusters that are found. The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated experimentally on two types of synthetic data sets: data sets with Gaussian clusters and with non parametric clusters. Our results show that the proposed mechanism is able to deal with noise, finds the appropriated number of clusters and finds an appropriated set of cluster prototypes.

To facilitate accessibility to the system, its development is based on Google Maps application programming interface (API), Java and client/server architecture. In addition to the construction of a powerful query system for the multi-source, multi-scale and multi-level tropical cyclone database, data mining approach and dynamic modelling approach have been implemented and integrated for effective and efficient analysis, prediction and visualization of tropical cyclone movements. The system can be accessed worldwide by researchers, professionals and the general public. It is thus a powerful system for research, real-life application and knowledge dissemination. Its extensibility and user-friendliness pave the road for further development and enable more in-depth analysis and real-time operation.

Most of previous works have focused on the data cleansing and the correction for the benefit of the subsequent mining process. When the training data contains noise, the classification accuracy was being affected dramatically. In this paper, we present a novel classification algorithm named ESC (Error-Sensitive Classification) to cover this problem. We materialize our main idea by constructing Attribute-Decision tree and measuring correlation among attributes. Experimental results show that our algorithm has ability to significantly improve the quality of data mining results.

In 1990, the internationally accepted research methods had been introduced into our country, and now it has formed a survey of ideas and index system suited to our national characteristics. The online survey of scientific literacy is an important source of survey data, it can make up for the shortcomings of the cost of household survey, but the credibility of the data is relatively high. In this paper, we use data mining to analyze the scientific literacy survey data, and propose a data fusion based on online survey data and household survey data analysis algorithms to compensate for both their own lack of.

J	Li, PP; Wu, XD; Hu, XG				Li, Peipei; Wu, Xindong; Hu, Xuegang			Mining Recurring Concept Drifts with Limited Labeled Streaming Data	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Data stream; concept drift; decision tree; clustering	CLASSIFIERS; CONTEXTS; ENSEMBLE	Tracking recurring concept drifts is a significant issue for machine learning and data mining that frequently appears in real-world stream classification problems. It is a challenge for many streaming classification algorithms to learn recurring concepts in a data stream environment with unlabeled data, and this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Motivated by this challenge, this article focuses on the problem of recurring contexts in streaming environments with limited labeled data. We propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LA-beled data, called REDLLA, in which a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-means is installed to produce concept clusters and unlabeled data are labeled in the method of majority-class at leaves. In view of deviations between history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and recurring concepts are maintained. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data confirm the advantages of our REDLLA algorithm over three state-of-the-art online classification algorithms of CVFDT, DWCDS, and CDRDT and several known online semi-supervised algorithms, even in the case with more than 90% unlabeled data.

And most evaluation work is started only after obtaining the failure data in the later period of software development, which leads to a problem that people could not obtain the information of software reliability level in the early stage of software development, which could be used for guiding the work of software reliability design, analysis and testing. Therefore, the qualitative software reliability evaluation methods based on the reliability corresponding factors in each stage of the software development are studied recently. In this paper, a qualitative software reliability evaluation method based on rough set is proposed, which takes use of the data mining technology based on rough set to analyze the data related to the software reliability, and finds the factors and the correlation rules which have an important influence on the software reliability. Then it could be used to evaluate the software reliability.

Semantic similarity measurement based on knowledge mining: an artificial neural net approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						semantic similarity; geospatial semantics; geospatial knowledge discovery; spatial data mining; search engine; ranking; ontology	ENTITY CLASSES; ONTOLOGIES; NETWORK; WEB	This article presents a new approach to automatically measure semantic similarity between spatial objects. It combines a description logic based knowledge base (an ontology) and a multi-layer neural network to simulate the human process of similarity perception. In the knowledge base, spatial concepts are organized hierarchically and are modelled by a set of features that best represent the spatial, temporal and descriptive attributes of the concepts, such as origin, shape and function. Water body ontology is used as a case study. The neural network was designed and human subjects' rankings on similarity of concept pairs were collected for data training, knowledge mining and result validation. The experiment shows that the proposed method achieves good performance in terms of both correlation and mean standard error analysis in measuring the similarity between neural network prediction and human subject ranking. The application of similarity measurement with respect to improving relevancy ranking of a semantic search engine is introduced at the end.

B	Li, XN; Li, B; Mabu, S; Hirasawa, K			IEEE	Li, Xianneng; Li, Bing; Mabu, Shingo; Hirasawa, Kotaro			A Continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithm by Evolving Graph Structures Using Reinforcement Learning	2012 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) / International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) / IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE-CEC) / IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE-WCCI)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE			OPTIMIZATION; EVOLUTION; MODELS	A novel graph-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) named Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Network Programming (PMBGNP) has been proposed. Inspired by classical EDAs, PMBGNP memorizes the current best individuals and uses them to estimate a distribution for the generation of the new population. However, PMBGNP can evolve compact programs by representing its solutions as graph structures. Therefore, it can solve a range of problems different from conventional ones in EDA literature, such as data mining and Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This paper extends PMBGNP from discrete to continuous search space, which is named PMBGNP-AC. Besides evolving the node connections to determine the optimal graph structures using conventional PMBGNP, Gaussian distribution is used for the distribution of continuous variables of nodes. The mean value mu and standard deviation sigma are constructed like those of classical continuous Population-based incremental learning (PBILc). However, a RL technique, i.e., Actor-Critic (AC), is designed to update the parameters (mu and sigma). AC allows us to calculate the Temporal-Difference (TD) error to evaluate whether the selection of the continuous value is better or worse than expected. This scalar reinforcement signal can decide whether the tendency to select this continuous value should be strengthened or weakened, allowing us to determine the shape of the probability density functions of the Gaussian distribution. The proposed algorithm is applied to a RL problem, i.e., autonomous robot control, where the robot's wheel speeds and sensor values are continuous. The experimental results show the superiority of PMBGNP-AC comparing with the conventional algorithms.

But it still faces many challenges in the future. Firstly, the level of privacy has different definitions in different filed. Therefore, the measure of privacy preserving data mining technology protecting private information is not the same. So, it's an urgent issue to present a unified privacy definition and measure. Secondly, the most of research in privacy preserving data mining is presently confined to the theory study.

Their focus is on string sequences analysis towards application of knowledge discovery techniques for protecting personal computer information by means of detection, prevention, and response to various attacks. These three string sequences analysis problems could be treated as three classification problems. To tackle these three classifications problems, we propose a Ensemble Learning method. The idea of ensemble learning is to employ multiple learners and combine their predictions. These ensemble methods utilize multiple models to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent models[13], [14], [16]. In the tasks, we utilize (LDA-,SK-)SVM, (LDA-,SK-)GP and (LDA-,SK-)AdaBoost as the weak classifiers, and the experiments shows that ensemble learning method can improve the classification performance significantly.

At present, granular computing faces the challenges of consuming a huge amount of computational time and memory space in dealing with large-scale and complicated data sets. Feature selection, a common technique for data preprocessing in many areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining, is of great importance. This paper focuses on efficient feature selection algorithms for large-scale data sets and dynamic data sets in granular computing.

It can be observed in many areas easily, including biology, chemistry, physics and social society. A series of interactive processes in-between individuals trigger the formation of collective behavior. Traditional data mining methods, however, mainly concentrate on the analysis of individual behavior but ignore the potential associations. Similarly, in sociology, many well-known models based on survey sampling are not suitable for the new emerging social media platform any more, where huge amounts of data are generated by users every day. It is necessary for researchers to develop effective approaches for sampling and modeling the collective behavior on social media. In this paper, we propose an innovative model that consists of multiple hidden Markov chains. By learning a group of time-series behavior data, our model can not only predict the synchronous state of a collective, but also measure the dependency property, namely reactive factor, of each individual. Preliminary experimental result shows that CoSync model has the power to distinguish behavior patterns of different persons.	[Liang, Victor C.; Ng, Vincent T.

The framework contains feature extraction (FE), feature selection (FS), unsupervised clustering analysis and clustering result validation. In the process of FE, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is shown to be the suitable dimension reduction technique by extracting the majority of the variation in the original data sets. We show that singular value decomposition (SVD) can provide additional insight to understand the results of PCA which are often difficult to interpret. By comparing the patterns of the PD pulses and the Normalised Autocorrelation Functions (NACFs) of the pulses after applying SPCA, the PD pulses are chosen to be the features for cluster analysis. In the process of cluster analysis, the need for cluster validation in unsupervised learning is discussed. Experimental results provide evidence that using several indexes gives greater confidence in choosing the appropriate unsupervised clustering algorithm and determining the correct number of clusters.

However, most of these studies cannot deal with the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy of the tracking. In object tracking sensor networks (OTSNs), the movement of the object generally follows some definite patterns. The moving object location, arrival time, path are likely to hide some useful association rules, which can be excavated by applying suitable data mining algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed an object tracking scheme for OTSNs using data mining approach. We have improved the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules and made it applicable to the OTSNs. The data mining algorithm is applied to the past movement information of the object and useful association rules are excavated, which are then used to predict the next location of the object. Our scheme predicts the next location of the object more accurately and increases the network lifetime. Experimental results have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme for OTSNs and they show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy of tracking.

Usually, users browse their Apps by swiping touch screen on smart phones, and are likely to spend much time on browsing Apps. In this paper, we design an AppNow widget that is able to predict users' Apps usage. Therefore, users could simply execute Apps from the widget. The main theme of this paper is to construct the temporal profiles which identify the relation between Apps and their usage times. In light of the temporal profiles of Apps, the AppNow widget predicts a list of Apps which are most likely to be used at the current time. AppNow consists of three components, the usage logger, the temporal profile constructor and the Apps predictor. First, the usage logger records every App start time. Then, the temporal profiles are built by applying Discrete Fourier Transform and exploring usage periods and specific times. Finally, the system calculates the usage probability at current time for each App and shows a list of Apps with highest probability. In our experiments, we collected real usage traces to show that the accuracy of AppNow could reach 86% for identifying temporal profiles and 90% for predicting App usage.

Usually, users browse their Apps by swiping touch screen on smart phones, and are likely to spend much time on browsing Apps. In this paper, we design an AppNow widget that is able to predict users' Apps usage. Therefore, users could simply execute Apps from the widget. The main theme of this paper is to construct the temporal profiles which identify the relation between Apps and their usage times. In light of the temporal profiles of Apps, the AppNow widget predicts a list of Apps which are most likely to be used at the current time. In our experiments, we collected real usage traces to show that the accuracy of AppNow could reach 86% for identifying temporal profiles and 90% for predicting App usage.

A Profile-based Framework for Interaction Prediction	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRANULAR COMPUTING (GRC 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GrC)	AUG 11-13, 2012	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Int Granular Comp Soc (GrC), IEEE SMC Soc Tech Comm Granular Comp, IBM Almaden Res Ctr, IBM Greater China, San Jose State Univ	Zhejiang Univ	data mining; interaction prediction; time-evolving graph; profile		In this paper, we generalize the link prediction problem to an interaction prediction problem. Compared with links in social networks, interactions can occur several times repeatedly. Based on the observation, we formulate an event-triggered interaction prediction problem. For example, we may want to know when a user connects to a website (e.g. Facebook), who will also connect to the website. We propose a Profile-based Interaction Prediction Framework (PIPF) which can solve the event-triggered interaction prediction problem efficiently and effectively. In PIPF, we first transform the interaction log into a Sliding-window Evolving Graph (SEG) to reduce the data volume and incrementally update SEG as interaction log grows. Then, we build profiles designed to present users' behavior by extracting the static and surprising features from SEG. The static (respectively, surprising) feature reflects the regularity of users' behavior (respectively, the temporal behavior). When an event occurs, we compute the similarity between the event and each candidate link. We propose two similarity functions for static and surprising features and an automatic selection strategy to control the influence of the two features. We use a real dataset that records Internet connections to evaluate the scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness of PIPF. The experimental results show that PIPF is far more scalable and efficient than the previous methods to perform real-time prediction.

Papers appear in virtually every conference on data mining or network science with new methods. We argue that the practical performance potential of these methods is generally unknown because of challenges endemic to evaluation in many link prediction contexts. We demonstrate that current methods of evaluation are inadequate and can lead to woefully errant conclusions about practical performance potential. We argue for the use of precision-recall threshold curves and associated areas in lieu of receiver operating characteristic curves due to the extreme imbalance of the link prediction classification problem. We provide empirical examples of how current methods lead to questionable conclusions, how the fallacy of these conclusions is illuminated by methods we propose, and suggest a fair and consistent framework for link prediction evaluation for longitudinal and non-longitudinal network data sets.

In this context, this paper discusses and presents as a contribution not only the classifiers that were used in the problem of intrusion detection, but also the initial stage of data preparation. Therefore, we tested the performance of three classifiers on the KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset and selected the best classifiers. We initially tested a Decision Tree and a Neural Network using this dataset, suggesting improvements by reducing the number of attributes from 42 to 27 considering only two classes of detection, normal and intrusion. Finally, we tested the Decision Tree and Bayesian Network classifiers considering five classes of attack: Normal, DOS, U2R, R2L and Probing. The experimental results proved that the algorithms used achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduction of false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.

However, the key factor of a successful service model is the integration of domain knowledge. To show a feasible fusion model as an example, we propose the system design of an intelligent consultation and recommendation framework to assist nutritionists in the environment of cloud computing. We employ the data mining technology of predicting and finding suitable patterns to help nutritionists develop personalized, comprehensive nutrition programs for customers. Decision tree analysis is used to find the matching pairs between customers' physiological states and their proper diet programs. This system can not only help nutritionists provide better services, but also assist customers to track physiological data, meals, and exercise information. The result demonstrates that our design can serve as a model of intelligent systems for both service providers and consumers.

Recently, data stream mining has emerged as an important subfield of data mining, because data samples usually are generated in a sequence over time and collected in a form of a stream in many cases in the real world. In this paper, we study a real-world problem and apply data stream mining techniques to the prediction of Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index Futures (TAIEX Futures). We model the problem as a binary classification problem and our goal is to predict the rising or falling of the short-term futures. We design the data preprocessing procedure and employ a data stream miming toolkit in experiments. The results indicate that the concept drift detection method is helpful for TAIEX Futures in which concept drift supposedly exists and also that data stream mining technology is helpful for predicting the futures market.

An efficient way of achieving such goals is to explore and profile customers' past purchase behavior and mine out their possible further needs and wants. When faced with increasingly diversified consumption demands, customers should be segmented based on their potential and willingness to purchase. Therefore, in this study, we propose the customer potential value (CPV) matrix for the segmentation of applicants based on the degree of their potential value and their willingness to buy for an insurance database. In this proposed CPV matrix, the applicants will be categorized into four dimensions defined as the opened group, desire-deficiency group, perception-deficiency group, and closed group. Furthermore, we use the data mining technique to determine the important association rules for each segment of the CPV matrix. The results show that more powerful support of association rules can be obtained via the segmentation of customers based on the CPV matrix.

In this paper, we study a nonnegative matrix factorization technique, where we show how to define objective functions and derive corresponding multiplicative update functions. We then use that knowledge to propose a data value perturbation scheme that hides data values but still keeps the data pattern to a large degree. Based on the proposed data value perturbation scheme, we develop a dual data hiding scheme which not only hides data but also hides individual sample's class membership. The essential idea is to use an indicator matrix as a guide for the update process. The performance of the proposed schemes are examined on benchmark datasets for both utility value and data perturbation degree. The empirical results show that the data values are well perturbed and our schemes are capable of hiding a data sample's class membership without side effects. At the end, we draw some interesting conclusions and layout potential future work.

Traditionally the information is derived from the primary source of data by recording events such as transactions, phone calls, user sessions, security breaches, and car trips. Much of the early data mining techniques used information granules generated from primary data sources. Recent data mining techniques such as ensemble classifiers and stacked regression use secondary sources of data obtained from initial data mining activities. Typically, these techniques use preliminary applications of data mining techniques for initial knowledge discovery. The knowledge acquired from the preliminary data mining is then used for more refined analysis. Granular computing can enable us to develop a formal framework for incorporating information from both primary and secondary sources of data. This enhanced granular representation can help us develop integrated data mining techniques. This paper proposes a novel recursive meta-clustering algorithm to demonstrate the versatility of granular computing for developing integrated data mining techniques to exploit primary and secondary knowledge sources.

Such technique has become an important tool for data mining, machine learning and pattern recognition. Most self-organizing neural networks have a difficulty in reflecting data distributions precisely if data distributions are very complex. And meanwhile, it is also hard for these algorithms to learn new data incrementally without destroying the previous learnt data. In this paper, we propose a robust energy artificial neuron based incremental self-organizing neural network with a dynamic structure (REISOD). It can adjust the scale of network automatically to adapt the scale of the data set and learn new data incrementally with preserving the former learnt results. Moreover, several experiments show that our algorithm can reflect data distributions precisely.

The high dimensionality of data may pose great challenges to traditional learning algorithms. In fact, many of features in large volume of data are redundant and noisy. Their presence not only degrades the performance of learning algorithms, but also confuses end-users in the post-analysis process. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate irrelevant features from data before being fed into learning algorithms. Currently, many endeavors have been attempted in this field and many outstanding feature selection methods have been developed. Among different evaluation criteria, mutual information has also been widely used in feature selection because of its good capability of quantifying uncertainty of features in classification tasks. However, the mutual information estimated on the whole dataset can not exactly represent the correlation between features. To cope with this issue, in this paper we firstly re-estimate mutual information on identified instances dynamically, and then introduce a new feature selection method based on conditional mutual information. Performance evaluations on sixteen UCI datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to other well-established feature selection algorithms in most cases.

Our proposed GA-KM is a hybrid method that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and K-means (KM) algorithm, and MPSO-KM is also a hybrid method that combines a momentum-type particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and K-means algorithm. The functions of GA-KM or MPSO-KM are to determine the optimal weights of attributes and cluster centers of clusters that are needed to classify the disease dataset. The dataset, used in this study, includes 13 attributes with 270 instances, which are the data records of cardiac disease. A comparative study is conducted by using C5, Nave Bayes, K-means, GA-KM and MPSO-KM to evaluate the accuracy of presented algorithms. Our experiments indicate that the clustering accuracy of cardiac disease dataset is significantly improved by using GA-KM and MPSO-KM when compared to that of using K-means only.

However, more and more spam messages are also emerging on Sina Weibo. How to detect these spam is essential for the social network security. While most previous studies attempt to detect the microblogging spam by identifying spammers, in this paper, we want to exam whether we can detect the spam by each single Weibo message, because we notice that more and more spam Weibos are posted by normal users or even popular verified users. We propose a Weibo spam detection method based on machine learning algorithm. In addition, different from most existing microblogging spam detection methods which are based on English microblogs, our method is designed to deal with the features of Chinese microblogs. Our extensive empirical study shows the effectiveness of our approach.

As pointed out by various professional players and coaches, a proper weight shift is critical in hitting a shot with good accuracy and range, and therefore it would be beneficial for golfers to obtain weight shift data corresponding to their swing motions, so that analysis and improvement on the swing pose can be made. Weight shift data collected through common methods such as using electronic scales may contain noise data due to factors such as pre-swing movements, and in order for the data to be useful, it is necessary to distinguish actual swing motion from noise. In this paper a data mining approach named Simplified Swarm Optimization with Sorted Local Search (SSO-SLS), which is based on a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), has been proposed to classify golf swing from weight shift data. In the proposed approach a novel Sorted Local Search strategy has been introduced to remedy the issue of premature convergence facing PSO by allowing particles to obtain information from their nearest neighbors and improve swarm diversity. Experiments on UCI datasets and weight shift data in golf show that SSO-SLS is competitive with common classification techniques, and is an ideal approach for classifying golf swing from weight shift.

For uncertain data, provenance plays an important role in query and analytical processing. K-anonymous data is a special kind of uncertain data, which is derived according to the generalization tree by the definite data. Thus, generalization tree is an essential part of provenance of the k-anonymous data. Through the analysis of the generation of the k-anonymous data, we propose a formal definition of the generalization tree and the construction algorithm from the perspective of recipients of the data. On that basis, we present an algorithm for mining association-rule on the k-anonymous data. Finally, compared with the experiment mining of original data, we can verify that the new algorithm is feasible, and theoretical performance analysis shows that the new algorithm can greatly reduce the time complexities of mining and improve the efficiency of mining.

J	Liu, YC; Chen, PJ				Liu, Yu-Chin; Chen, Po-Jung			Discovering discriminative test items for achievement tests	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Association rule; Achievement test; Data mining; Item discrimination		One of the essential goals of test designing is to select items with the most discriminative power. In the past, most research has assumed there is no dependent relationship among test items, so that test papers are often produced by selecting items with individual discriminations. However, in actuality, test items may relate to other items and the overall discrimination of a test paper cannot be simply aggregated. Therefore, this study proposes a two-step framework to design test papers by choosing discriminative item combinations from the item bank. The proposed approach (the process) first analyzing entails the archival tests to discover substitute items, as well as recognize discriminative test itemsets by using data mining technology. Then, test items can be recommended to compose a discriminative test paper. Finally, a real life case is used to test the proposed method. The test data is provided by the Chinese Enterprise Planning Association (CERP) in Taiwan. The experimental results indicate that: (1) the two-step method can complete the test design task efficiently; (2) the newly composed test paper presents highly discriminative; and (3) the discrimination power of our test paper is very close to the theoretic maximum value based on Item Response Theory.

The motivation is twofold. First, researchers on Spatial Data Mining often assume that spatial data are already available, thanks to current GIS and positioning technologies. Nevertheless, this is not applicable to the case of spatial information embedded in data without an explicit spatial modeling, such as documents. Second, despite the huge amount of Web documents conveying useful geographic information, there is not much work on how to harvest spatial data from these documents. The problem is particularly challenging because of the lack of annotated documents, which prevents the application of supervised learning techniques. In this paper, we propose to harvest facts on geographic places through an unsupervised approach which recognizes spatial relations among geographic places without supposing the availability of annotated documents. The proposed approach is based on the combined use of a spatial ontology and a prototype-based classifier. A case study on topological and directional relations is reported and commented.

Recently, multi-agent systems have been promoted as a technique to deal with cooperation issues involved in SOA. This cooperation is particularly important in several application domains, in which different companies are involved in a concrete service deployment. Agents, among other issues, offer the possibility to decide, if more than one option is available, providing flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we describe the agent-based cooperation process we have followed to enable partner's cooperation in an equipment maintenance workflow. The use of ontologies and relationships with standards is highlighted. The approach is illustrated in an hospital scenario considered in the AIMES project.

This form of learning generates large amounts of transition dynamics data, which can be mined to improve the agent's understanding of the environment. There could be many uses for this data; here we focus on mining it to identify a relevant feature subspace. This is vital since RL performs poorly in high-dimensional spaces, such as those that autonomous agents would commonly face in real-world problems. This paper demonstrates the necessity and feasibility of integrating data mining into the learning process while an agent is learning, enabling it to learn to act by both acting and understanding. Doing so requires overcoming challenges regarding data quantity and quality, and difficulty measuring feature relevance with respect to the control policy. We propose the progressive mining framework to address these challenges by relying on cyclic interaction between data mining and RL. We show that a feature selection algorithm developed under this framework, PROFESS, can improve RL scalability better than a competing approach.

J	Loseu, V; Ghasemzadeh, H; Jafari, R				Loseu, Vitali; Ghasemzadeh, Hassan; Jafari, Roozbeh			A Mining Technique Using n-Grams and Motion Transcripts for Body Sensor Network Data Repository	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Body sensor networks (BSNs); data mining; n-grams; Patricia tree; string templates	CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; INFORMATION; CRITERIA; SYSTEMS; TEXT	Recent years have witnessed a large influx of applications in the field of cyber-physical systems. An important class of these systems is body sensor networks (BSNs) where lightweight embedded processors and communication systems are tightly coupled with the human body. BSNs can provide researchers, care providers and clinicians access to tremendously valuable information extracted from data that are collected in users' natural environment. With this information, one can monitor the progression of a disease, identify its early onset, or simply assess user's wellness. One major obstacle is managing repositories that store the large amount of sensing data. To address this issue, we propose a data mining approach inspired by the experience in the areas of text and natural language processing. We represent sensor readings with a sequence of characters, called motion transcripts. Transcripts reduce complexity of the data significantly while maintaining morphological and structural properties of the physiological signals. To further take advantage of the physiological signal's structure, our data mining technique focuses on the characteristic transitions in the signals. These transitions are efficiently captured using the concept of n-grams. To facilitate a lightweight and fast mining approach, we reduce the overwhelmingly large number of n-grams via information gain (IG) feature selection. We report the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of the speed of mining while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in terms of the F-score combining both precision and recall.

The most accurate algorithm is not known in advance and no single model format is superior for all datasets. An a priori comparison experiment to determine which algorithm leads to the most optimal model fit could offer relief but is rather time consuming. A meta model which is able to predict and explain which model would fit best could address this problem. The relevance of such a meta model increases with the number and runtime of algorithms under consideration and the size of the dataset. In this paper a novel meta model is proposed to automatically provide support to the user about whether to use a linear, spline, tree, linear tree or linear spline model, given a particular dataset. This study distinguishes itself from previous meta learning studies by focusing on comprehensible regression models, regression specific dataset characteristics, artificially generated datasets and a score based user recommendation.

But when the data or objects to be analyzed are complex, it is necessary to redefine and enhance the abilities of the OLAP. In this paper, we suggest combining OLAP and data mining in order to create a new visualization operator for complex data or objects. This operator uses the correspondence analysis method and we call it VOCoDa (Visualization Operator for Complex Data).

By analyzing the occurrences of events over time in a home automation system, it's possible to find periodic patterns based on action-time relationships. However, the human behavior could be better defined if it's related to chained actions, creating action-action relationships. This work presents IntelliDomo's learning layer, a data mining approach based on ontologies and production rules that aims to achieve those objectives. This module is able to acquire users' habits and automatically generate production rules for behavior patterns to anticipate the user's periodic actions. The learning layer includes new features looking for the adaptability and personification of the environment.

In such mobile applications and services, the travel recommendation system is one of popular LBSs for mobile users. More and more research studies focus on discovering of various kinds of mobile patterns from various mobile databases. In which, one of popular research issues is mining of the travel trajectory patterns from mobile travel trajectory databases. Mining travel knowledge from travel trajectory data benefits for supporting of an intelligent travel recommendation system. However, it is not easy to obtain the real travel trajectory data for mobile users since the problem of personal privacy. To develop a travel trajectory data generator is very useful for the research communities on mobile travel behavior mining. In this paper, we present a simulation framework to generate mobile travel trajectory data based on the statistics and observations of real travel information. In the simulation model, we generate not only the travel trajectories for mobile users but also the mobile transactions for each arrived attraction according to the reasonable probability designs.

Data mining techniques are efficient to construct a reliable Intrusion Detection System. Classification is an essential task in data mining. In this paper, a new classification method is proposed to build an accurate and efficient classifier for intrusion detection. The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently. On the basis of the extracted rules, the multi-feature space is projected into a two-dimensional average matching degree space. The benchmark data KDD Cup 1999 and NSL-KDD are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

M-DART will cross-correlate and examine different data sources to assess anomalies, infer root causes, and anneal data into actionable information. By performing higher-level reasoning "triage" of diverse data sources, M-DART focuses on early detection of emerging power system events and identifies highest priority actions for the human decision maker. M-DART represents a significant advancement over today's grid monitoring technologies that apply offline analyses to derive model-based guidelines for online real-time operations and use isolated data processing mechanisms focusing on individual data domains. The development of the M-DART will bridge these gaps by reasoning about results obtained from multiple data sources that are enabled by the smart grid infrastructure. This hybrid approach integrates a knowledge base that is trained offline but tuned online to capture model-based relationships while revealing complex causal relationships among data from different domains.

However, there are still some open issues in this kind of problem. This paper presents a multi-objective grammar-based ant programming algorithm for imbalanced classification, capable of addressing this task from both the binary and multiclass sides, unlike most of the solutions presented so far. We carry out two experimental studies comparing our algorithm against binary and multiclass solutions, demonstrating that it achieves an excellent performance for both binary and multiclass imbalanced data sets.

Earlier work on algebras for XML query focused mostly on rule-based optimization and used node-at-a-time execution model. Heavy query workloads in modern applications require cost-based optimization which is naturally supported by the set-at-a-time execution model. This paper introduces an algebra with only set-at-a-time operations, and discusses expression reduction methods and lazy evaluation techniques based on the algebra. Our experiments demonstrate that, for queries with complex conditional and quantified expressions, the proposed algebra results in plans with much better performance than those produced by the state-of-the-art algebras. For relatively simple queries, the proposed methods are expected to yield plans with comparable performance.

The basic concepts of rough set theory are a pair of non-numerical operators, i.e., lower and upper approximation operators that are exported from the approximation spaces. Set-valued ordered information systems are generalized models of single-valued information systems. The attribute set in an information system may vary due to the arrival of new information. In this paper, we focus on the incremental approach for dynamically updating approximations in the set-valued ordered information systems when the attribute set varies over time.

As the user base is increasing, mobile communications networks is also increasing pressure. In the traditional artificial methods about communication network fault detection, network managers need to do a lot of work and the process is tedious but not satisfied with the quality test. It is an effective means of fault management using software to manage the network. The mobile network fault detection system base on data mining not only reduces the workload of network managers and the test results more accurate, but also can reduce network management costs. In this paper, we introduce the fault detection strategies for the mobile communication network. By using the data mining algorithm, we can find the network default more easily.

Query classification and study of university students' search trends	PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information retrieval; Information management	AUSTRALIAN ACADEMIC USE; WEB; INTERNET; INFORMATION; IDENTIFICATION; USAGE	Purpose - This study is an attempt to develop an automatic identification method for Arabic web queries and divide them into several query types using data mining. In addition, it seeks to evaluate the impact of the academic environment on using the internet. Design/methodology/approach - The web log files were collected from one of the higher institute's servers over a one-month period. A special program was designed and implemented to extract web search queries from these files and also to automatically classify Arabic queries into three query types (i.e. Navigational, Transactional, and Informational queries) based on predefined specifications for each type. Findings - The results indicate that students are slowly and gradually using the internet for more relevant academic purposes. Tests showed that it is possible to automatically classify Arabic queries based on query terms, with 80.6 per cent to 80.2 per cent accuracy for the two phases of the test respectively. In their future strategies, Jordanian universities should apply methods to encourage university students to use the internet for academic purposes. Web search engines in general and Arabic search engines in particular may benefit from the proposed classification method in order to improve the effectiveness and relevancy of their results in accordance with users' needs. Originality/value - Studying internet web logs has been the subject of many papers. However, the particular domain, and the specific focuses on this research are what can distinguish it from the others.

We illustrated this problem in the context of data mining based on a biological population data. We analyze feasibility of several approaches such as boosting, non-symmetric cost of misclassification events, and combining several weak classifiers (metalearning). We show that metalearning seems counter-productive if the goal is to enhance the recognition of a weak class, and that the method of choice would consist in combining boosting with the non-symmetric cost approach.

It demands the creation of methodologies and techniques that allow monitoring and intervening, efficiently and at reasonable costs, in areas susceptible to deforestation. Thus, the computational modeling of remote sensing data involves many challenges, including a large set of algorithms and techniques to extract strategic information contained in these data. This paper aims to employ graphs to represent relationships among deforestation objects captured from remote sensing data, and then extract patterns from them applying graph mining, that performs the search for frequent substructures using the FSG graph-based knowledge discovery algorithm, in order to identify frequent substructures among deforestation objects.

The presence of missing values influences data set features and the class attributes, thus affecting the predictive accuracies of the classifiers. For the last one decade, many researchers have come out with different techniques for dealing with missing attribute values in databases with homogeneous and/or numeric attributes. In this research work, we proposed a new indexing measure to the imputation algorithm for missing data values of the attributes to compute the similarity measure between any two typical elements in the dataset. It can also be applied on any dataset be it a nominal and/or real. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive experiments and comparison with KNNI, SVMI, WKNNI, KMI and FKMI algorithms.

Furthermore, this information is commonly not static and can change over the time. Therefore the nature of this kind of data are huge, analysing data is a complex task. This research aims to propose an intermediate data model that can represented suitable for Spatio-Temporal data and performing data mining task easily while facing problem in frequently changing the data. In order to propose suitable data model, this research also investigate the analytical parameters, the structure and its specifications for Spatio-Temporal data. The concept of proposed data model is inspired from the nature of hair which has specific properties and its growth over the time. In order to have better looking and quality, the data is needed to maintain over the time such as combing, cutting, colouring, covering, cleaning etc. The proposed data model is represented by using mathematical model and later developed the data model tools. The data model is developed based on the existing relational and object-oriented models. This paper deals with the problems of available Spatio-Temporal data models for utilizing data mining technology and defines a new model based on analytical attributes and functions.

Soft Flexible Overlapping Biclustering Utilizing Hybrid Search Strategies	ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Machine Learning Technologies and Applications (AMLTA 2012)	DEC 08-10, 2012	Cairo, EGYPT		Ain Sham Univ	Possibilistic clustering; fuzzy clustering; biclustering; bi-dimensional clustering; gene expression analysis	MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA	Biclustering is powerful data mining technique that allows identifying groups of genes which are co-regulated and co-expressed under a subset of conditions for analyzing gene expression data from microarray technology. Possibilistic biclustering algorithms can give much insight towards different biological processes that each gene might participate into and the conditions under which its participation is most effective. This paper proposes an iterative algorithm that is able to produce k-possibly overlapping semi-possibilistic (or soft) biclusters satisfying input constraints. Several previous possibilistic approaches are sensitive to their input parameters and initial conditions beside that they don't allow constraints to be put on the residue of produced biclusters and can work only as refinement step after applying hard biclustering. Our semi-possibilistic approach allows discovering overlapping biclusters with meaningful memberships while reducing the effect of very small memberships that may participate in iterations of possibilistic approaches. Experimental study on Yeast and Human shows that our algorithm can offer substantial improvements in terms of the quality of the output biclusters over several previously proposed biclustering algorithms.

In this paper, two efficient soft c-mediods clustering algorithms for prototype selection for protein sequences are presented. In the proposed techniques patterns are considered to belong to some but not necessarily all clusters. The proposed algorithms is comprised of a judicious integration of the principles of fuzzy sets, semi-fuzzy or soft clustering models, the amino acid mutation matrix. Applying randomized search along with soft clustering model to the fuzzy c-medoids algorithm enables efficient and effective selection of the minimum set of the most informative bio-bases. The efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, along with a comparison with other algorithms, have been demonstrated on different types of protein data sets.

Cluster analysis is one of the major data analysis techniques and k-means one of the most popular partitioning clustering algorithm that is widely used. But the original k-means algorithm is computationally expensive and the resulting set of clusters strongly depends on the selection of initial centroids. Several methods have been proposed to improve the performance of k-means clustering algorithm. In this paper we propose a heuristic method to find better initial centroids as well as more accurate clusters with less computational time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generates clusters with better accuracy thus improve the performance of k-means clustering algorithm.	[Mahmud, Md. Sohrab; Rahman, Md.

By means of data mining it is possible to develop critical skills that are essential in today's information technology. We present our experience in teaching a data mining module, within an Information System course, centered around a few key aspects: a convergence of theoretical Information Systems aspects and computing skills through programming a complete data mining analysis in Matlab; a project centered learning experience; a sharing of resources that are commented on both by the teacher and by peers facilitating the flow of information and the development of critical skills; a guided inquiry process where the students, when needed, are guided through appropriate questions in the right direction; and finally special attention to requiring motivation of each decision and step undertaken. As a case study we present and summarize the experience performed by two groups of students in a data mining study aiming at predicting a liquidity crisis of companies.

Business enterprises are data overloaded and, hence, using data mining techniques to transform the vast amount of data into meaningful information can be extremely beneficial. We will present a data mining approach for inventory forecasting and planning a Bill Of Materials in a highly competitive environment such as an Italian car racing team. By exploiting clustering algorithms and by using statistical techniques to identify the optimal number of clusters this work presents a method to optimally cluster a multi-year dataset containing the products used in car revision after each rally competition during a three-year period. The Bill Of Materials was used as input for the Material Requirements Planning.

Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) deals with protecting the privacy of individual data or sensitive knowledge without sacrificing the utility of the data. People have become well aware of the privacy intrusions on their personal data and are very reluctant to share their sensitive information. This may lead to the inadvertent results of the data mining. Within the constraints of privacy, several methods have been proposed but still this branch of research is in its infancy. The success of privacy preserving data mining algorithms is measured in terms of its performance, data utility, level of uncertainty or resistance to data mining algorithms etc. However no privacy preserving algorithm exists that outperforms all others on all possible criteria. Rather, an algorithm may perform better than another on one specific criterion. So, the aim of this paper is to present current scenario of privacy preserving data mining tools and techniques and propose some future research directions.

The unsupervised PCA ante up no attention to the class labels of the existing training data. LDA is not stable due to the small sample size problem and but corroborate best directions when each class has a Gaussian density with a common covariance matrix. But it can flop if the class densities are more general and interpreted class separability in between-class-matrices are inadequate. Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC) having lower computational cost, is more efficient than LDA for calculating the discriminant vectors barring the computation for inverse of within-class-scatter matrix. But traditional MMC disregards the discriminative information within the local structure of samples and performance is depended on choosing of a coefficient. In this paper we delineate the locality of data points by counting a distances among data points considering the supervised knowledge. We have computed the entire scatter matrix in Laplacian graph embedded space and finally the produced stastically uncorrelated discriminant vectors reduces redundancy among the extracted features and there is no constant to be chosen. Our experiment with Reauter dataset recommends this algorithm is more efficient than LDA, MMC and it manifests similar or sometimes better result than other locality based algorithm like LPP and LSDA.

Web syndication is a competitive collaborative content delivery system over the cloud, which refers to making web feeds/material available from a site to other people with a summary of the website's content including the recent updates. The relevance of web syndication has been remarkable in the fields of e-Governance, e-Commerce etc. It endows the ability of subscribing to a desired feed and obtain the contents using the highly scalable web syndication formats RSS (Rich Site Summary)[2] and Atom. Two common protocols used for web pub-sub architecture is the PubSubHubub (PUSH) and Atom, out of which the PubSubHubub[1] is the widely used and very popular. This paper proposes an improvised version of the PUSH named as Ex-PUSH protocol. The Ex-PUSH protocol implements a hybrid filtering technique of feeds and a Poll based Pull strategy for pulling of updates in addition to the existing Push strategy. In addition it includes a Publishers cache that gives two way benefit of trust reinforcement and building of a trust database (TDB) for future data mining. The sample survey shows that the protocol can decrease the total cost of network, save bandwidth and improve scalability.

We focus on discrimination prevention for classification. We introduce a new training set correction approach to handle discriminatory decision policies. Previous training set correction approaches are policy-neutral; our approach specifically targets decision policies evidencing discrimination. The goal is to target specific evidence of discrimination, and thus reduce discrimination with little impact on classification accuracy.

Clustering analysis is the major application area of data mining where Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is being widely implemented due to its simplicity and efficiency. When compared with techniques like K-means, Fuzzy C-means, K-Harmonic means and other traditional clustering approaches, in general, the PSO algorithm produces better results with reference to inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances, while having quantization errors comparable to the other algorithms. In recent times, many hybrid algorithms with PSO as one of the techniques have been developed to harness the strong points of PSO and increase its efficiency and accuracy.

OPTIMAL FEATURE SET AND PARAMETER SELECTION FOR POWER QUALITY DATA MINING	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							CONTINUOUS-VARIABLES; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK	The significance of detection and classification of power quality (PQ) events that disturb the voltage and/or current waveforms in electrical power distribution networks is well known. Consequently, in spite of a large number of research reports in this area, research on the selection of useful features from the existing feature set and the parameter selection for specific classifiers has thus far not been explored. The choice of a smoothing parameter for a probabilistic neural network classifier (PNN) in the training process, together with feature selection, will significantly impact the classification accuracy. In this work, a thorough analysis is carried out, using two wrapper-based optimization techniques-the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing-for identifying the ensemble of celebrated features obtained using discrete wavelet transform together with the smoothing parameter selection of the PNN classifier. As a result of these analyses, the proper smoothing parameter together with a more useful feature set from among a wider set of features for the PNN classifier is obtained with improved classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results show that the performance of simulated annealing is better than the genetic algorithm for feature selection and parameter optimization in Power Quality Data Mining.

Because not only the taxonomy data is widely exist, but also the information provided by the generalized frequent itemsets is richer and valuable than the traditional frequent itemsets. Like the traditional mining, the number of the generalized frequent itemset is also very large, which make it difficult to do further analysis. We propose a new method called CGIP-summary, which represent the whole frequent generalized itemsets by a set profiles and the profiles used to more concise.

Diabetes disease diagnosis via proper interpretation of the diabetes data is an important classification problem. Different techniques of artificial intelligence has been applied to diabetes problem. The purpose of this study is apply the artificial meta plasticity on multilayer perceptron (AMMLP) as a data mining (DM) technique for the diabetes disease diagnosis. The Pima Indians diabetes was used to test the proposed model AMMLP. The results obtained by AMMLP were compared with decision tree (DT), Bayesian classifier (BC) and other algorithms, recently proposed by other researchers, that were applied to the same database. The robustness of the algorithms are examined using classification accuracy, analysis of sensitivity and specificity, confusion matrix. The results obtained by AMMLP are superior to obtained by DT and BC.

Worm infected and botnet participating hosts can be identified and malicious backdoor communications can be detected. Any passive DNS monitoring solution needs to address several challenges that range from architectural approaches for dealing with large volumes of data up to specific Data Mining approaches for this purpose. We describe a framework that leverages state of the art distributed processing facilities with clustering techniques in order to detect anomalies in both online and offline DNS traffic. This framework entitled DNSSM is implemented and operational on several networks. We validate the framework against two large trace sets (1).

This algorithm uses a contex-free grammar to represent individuals, encoding the solutions in a tree-shape conformant to the grammar, so they are more expressive and flexible. The algorithm here presented has the advantages of using evolutionary algorithms for mining association rules, and it also solves the problem of tuning the huge number of parameters required by these algorithms. The main feature of this algorithm is the small number of parameters required, providing the possibility of discovering association rules in an easy way for non-expert users. We compare our approach to existing evolutionary and exhaustive search algorithms, obtaining important results and overcoming the drawbacks of both exhaustive search and evolutionary algorithms. The experimental stage reveals that this approach discovers frequent and reliable rules without a parameter tuning.

By incorporating data-mining in the process of designing protection functions, the limits of performance are extended. We propose a method that uses data-mining, able to detect high impedance faults (HIFs) in multi-grounded distribution networks when conventional devices are insufficient. HIF's are produced when overhead lines contact a quasi-isolated surface, such as a tree or the ground. The fault current can be lower than the residual current under normal conditions; hence overcurrent devices do not detect this fault. We describe a set of indicators that characterize HIFs and that can be used in data-mining to distinguish fault situations from other situations. The result is a HIF detection function whose development is based on pattern recognition analysis. The presented methodology can be applied to other fault detection problems to achieve more reliable protection devices.	[Masa, A.

The fault forecasting engine is designed as part of development of expert system shell for power plants. It is a hybrid approach incorporating data mining, fault models, clustering and time series analysis. For real time monitoring of plant condition, graphical models are constructed by K means clustering algorithm. To build the time series value forecasting model, Multilayer Perceptron (M LP) based neural network is used. By using latest history data base of SCADA system training and testing of the models are done.

The importance of analyzing real-world data collected from MERCI clinical trials is key to providing insights on the effectiveness of MERCI. Most of the existing data analysis on MERCI results has thus far employed conventional statistical analysis techniques. To the best of our knowledge, advanced data analytics and data mining techniques have not yet been systematically applied. To address the issue in this thesis, we conduct a comprehensive study on employing state of the art machine learning algorithms to generate prediction criteria for the outcome of MERCI patients. Specifically, we investigate the issue of how to choose the most significant attributes of a data set with limited instance examples. We propose a few search algorithms to identify the significant attributes, followed by a thorough performance analysis for each algorithm. Finally, we apply our proposed approach to the real-world, de-identified patient data provided by Erlanger Southeast Regional Stroke Center, Chattanooga, TN. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed approach performs well.

Clustering is a data mining technique, which is used to place data elements into related groups without advance knowledge of the group definitions. Here, we propose an incremental clustering technique for managing knowledge in edaphology, a study concerned with the influence of soils on living things, particularly plants. The soil information along with the appropriate plants to be cultivated on it for better yield, collected by edaphologists, are utilized in the proposed system. Initially, an incremental DBSCAN algorithm is applied to a dynamic database where, the data may be frequently updated. Then, the data available in the soil database is grouped into clusters and every new element is added into it without the need of rerunning process. Finally, we have performed the plant prediction using regression model. The experimentation is carried out in soil database to analyze the performance of the proposed system in plant prediction.

A prominent Artificial Intelligence research area is automatic programming - the generation of a computer program by another computer program. Clustering is an important data mining task with many useful real-world applications. Particularly, the class of clustering algorithms based on the idea of data density to identify clusters has many advantages, such as the ability to identify arbitrary-shape clusters. We propose the use of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for the artificial generation of density-based clustering algorithms. In order to guarantee the generation of valid algorithms, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) was defined where each node represents a procedure (building block) and each edge represents a possible execution sequence between two nodes. The Building Blocks DAG specifies the alphabet of the EDA, that is, any possibly generated algorithm. Preliminary experimental results compare the clustering algorithms artificially generated by AutoClustering to DBSCAN, a well-known manually-designed algorithm.	[Meiguins, Aruanda S.

Accordingly, automatically mining and annotating high-level concepts for video indexing and management become imperative research tasks in both multimedia research and data mining research. The mainstream content-based semantic concept mining approaches suffer from the notorious semantic gap problem, which is the difficulty of associating the low-level features to high-level concepts directly. Recently, the utilization of concept-concept association has been proven to be effective to address the semantic gap problem. In this paper, a framework based on multi-model collaboration and information integration is proposed to integrate the association among concepts to enhance the high-level concept detection by reusing the information outputs from the primary concept detectors. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the other approaches in the comparison and therefore is promising.

The pay as you use nature of cloud computing services such as EC2 provided by Amazon wherein you pay only for the servers, server or part thereof that you use also makes it economically attractive. This paper is targeted at researchers in the field of genetics and biotechnology who wish to understand how cloud computing can contribute to their area of research. Bio-informatics tools are extensively used in biological research today. These tools can be utilized more efficiently and in a possibly more cost and time effective manner using cloud technology. High-throughput genomics leads to reams of data that cannot be processed by local research facility computers at the speed it is generated. This bottleneck has been overcome by the use of cloud computing to store and to process data in real time. Large datasets and applications for image analysis, data mining, protein folding, and gene sequencing can also be shared for collaborative research between facilities using clouds. This is a simpler approach than transferring such data. Clouds also provide applications such as Apache's Hadoop and Google's MapReduce for parallel computing (particularly useful for making services such as BLAST easier to deploy in a shorter time). Cloud computing with characteristics like multi-tenacity, scalability, low cost, virtualization, agility and empowerment of end users has made it possible to share the results of studies at much finer granularity, along with sharing scientific investigations at the level of individual data points. Cloud technology can contribute significantly in areas such as biodiversity informatics and the study of human genetic variation and disease. We discuss these possibilities, the challenges in realizing the potential for application of cloud technology in biological sciences, and the work being done to overcome these challenges.

This technique has been employed for classification task of data mining. In fact, there are a few studies that used this tool for solving classification problems. In this present research, we propose a hybrid FLANN (HFLANN) model, where the optimization process is performed using 3 known population based techniques such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm and differential evolution. This model will be empirically compared to FLANN based back-propagation algorithm and to others classifiers as decision tree, multilayer perceptron based back-propagation algorithm, radical basic function, support vector machine, and K-nearest Neighbor. Our results proved that the proposed model outperforms the other single model.

In this paper, we introduce granular association rules to reveal connections between concepts in two universes. An example of such an association might be "men like alcohol." We present four meaningful explanations corresponding to four subtypes of granular association rules. We also define five measures to evaluate the quality of rules. Based on these measures, the relationships among different subtypes are revealed. This work opens a new research trend concerning granular computing and associate rule mining.

It groups the objects on the basis of similarity among them. Web has evolved enormously in past few years which resulted in sharp augmentation in number of web users and web pages. Web personalization has become a challenging task for e-Commerce based companies due to the information overload on web and increase of web users. Web users are matched with the available information in order to make personalization effective. Web usage data, coming from a single domain happens to be dense in nature as plenty of web users are fetching the pages from the same domain/application area. This scenario is prevalent in case of e-Commerce websites. Rough set is a soft computing technique which is efficient in dealing with ambiguities present in data. In this paper we have utilized rough set based clustering using similarity upper approximation for deriving the clusters. The clusters evolve in steps and finally converge in to a well defined clustering scheme. Developers are trying to customize web sites as per the needs of specific users with the help of knowledge acquired from users' navigational behaviour. Since user page visits are intrinsically sequential in nature, efficient clustering algorithms with suitable distance/similarity measure for sequential data is needed. In the current paper, we demonstrate the clustering task for sequence data (web page visits) in three ways namely, capturing content information, sequence information and combination of both. Experimental results suggest that the measure which captures both content and sequence forms compact clusters, thus putting the web users of similar interests in one group.

But however, frequent patterns in large scale datasets is an extremely time consuming task. So, in order to reduce the time the fuzzy concept was introduced in order to discretize the dataset in the range of 0 to 1. The Particle Swarm Optimizing (PSO) algorithm was basically developed from the social behavior of various animals likes bird flocking and fish schooling etc. In the existing versions of the local PSO algorithm with different neighborhood structures and the multi swarm PSOs, the swarms are predefined or dynamically adjusted according to the distance. Due to this the freedom of sub-swarms is limited. But in dynamic multi-swarm particle swarm optimizer (DMS-PSO) the neighborhood structure is dynamic and randomized. In this paper, a fuzzy data set has been used and various frequent pattern mining techniques like Apriori, Vertical data format and Frequent Pattern (FP) growth were implemented. Out of various frequent pattern mining techniques it was clear that FP growth method yields the better results on a fuzzy dataset. The frequent patterns obtained were considered as the set of initial population or particles. For the selection criteria, we have considered the mean squared residue (MSR) score rather using the threshold value. It has been observed that DMS-PSO based fuzzy FP growth technique finds the best individual frequent patterns as compared to the traditional PSO based fuzzy FP growth and also the runtime of the first was much better than the latter.

It is of the most important task in data mining and knowledge discovery. But usually a large number of frequent patterns get generated from a large scale of data matrix which is a time consuming affair. So, in order to discretize the data matrix a mathematical concept called fuzzy logic was used. It generalizes the data matrix values in the range of 0 to 1. In the due course of time, an evolutionary algorithm, called Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has also gained much popularity. But due to the premature convergence of PSO, a comprehensive learning strategy was introduced that used all particles' best information to update a particle's velocity. It also enabled the diversity of the swarm to be preserved to discourage premature convergence. In this paper, frequent patterns were generated from the fuzzy dataset (data matrix converted into fuzzy data matrix) using the Frequent Pattern (FP) growth algorithm. In order to generate some of the best individual frequent patterns out of the entire set of patterns, the CLPSO algorithm was used with a selection measure called mean squared residue (MSR) score. It was noted that the CLPSO algorithm outperformed the traditional PSO algorithm in the generation of the best individual patterns with a comparatively lower MSR value.

A fuzzy hill-climbing algorithm for the development of a compact associative classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						classification; association rules; fuzzy set; data mining	RULES	Classification, a data mining technique, has widespread applications including medical diagnosis, targeted marketing, and others. Knowledge discovery from databases in the form of association rules is one of the important data mining tasks. An integrated approach, classification based on association rules, has drawn the attention of the data mining community over the last decade. While attention has been mainly focused on increasing classifier accuracies, not much efforts have been devoted towards building interpretable and less complex models. This paper discusses the development of a compact associative classification model using a hill-climbing approach and fuzzy sets. The proposed methodology builds the rule-base by selecting rules which contribute towards increasing training accuracy, thus balancing classification accuracy with the number of classification association rules. The results indicated that the proposed associative classification model can achieve competitive accuracies on benchmark datasets with continuous attributes and lend better interpretability, when compared with other rule-based systems.

Existing data mining tools use workflow to capture user requirements. The workflow enactment can be improved with a suitable underlying execution layer, which is a Multi-Agent System (MAS). From this perspective, we propose a strategy to obtain an optimal MAS configuration from a given workflow when resource access restrictions and communication cost constraints are concerned, which is essentially a constraint optimization problem. In this paper, we show how workflow is modeled in the way that can be optimized, and how the optimized model is used to obtain an optimal MAS configuration. Finally, we demonstrate that our strategy can improve the load balancing and reduce the communication cost during the workflow enactment.

As an iterative clustering strategy, K-Means algorithm is very sensitive to the initial starting conditions. In this paper, we propose a clustering technique called MaxD K-Means clustering algorithm. MaxD K-Means algorithm auto generates initial k (the desired number of cluster) without asking for input from the user. MaxD K-means also used a novel strategy of setting the initial centroids. The experiment of the Max-D means has been conducted using synthetic data, which is taken from the Llyod's K-Means experiments.

The selection of teacher to attend training is done randomly, by rotation and not based on their work performance. This paper investigate the weakest integrity trait of teacher using association rule technique with the aim can assists the school management to organize training related to teachers integrity performance and avoid sending a wrong teacher for a training. A dataset of Trainees Integrity Dataset (TID) representing 1500 secondary school teachers in Langkawi Island, Malaysia in the year 2009 were pre-processed and mined using apriori. The knowledge from the mining was analyzed based on demographic and integrity trait of teacher. The finding indicates that adaptability and stability are the weakest integrity trait among teachers. Besides that, the analysis also unable to prove that demographic factor such as the age and gender of teachers reflect their low integrity performance. The finding can be a guideline for school management to propose a suitable training program for teacher to improve integrity mainly at the adaptability and stability trait.

The proposed model is initiated because it has been found that many motivational training programs fail to meet their objectives because there is a mismatch between the needs of training programs and the integrity levels of trainees. The proposed model consists of three modules namely personality characteristics identification, training program requirements identification, and trainee selection agent. A dataset for the study called Trainees Integrity Dataset (TID) is mined using association rule to discover important personality characteristics. TID is obtained from Langkawi District Education Office (LDEO) and it has 1500 respondents which represents secondary school teachers in Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia who attended a training program organized by LDEO in 2009. The proposed model is intended to produce an efficient selection process and suitable trainees.

We targeted 466 senior American smokers who are 65 years of age or older from the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, 2006). We employed a decision tree algorithm to conduct classification analysis to find the relationship between the average numbers of cigarette use per day. The results showed that the most important explanatory variable for prediction of the average number of cigarette use per day is the age when first started smoking cigarettes every day, followed by education level, and psychological distress. These results suggest that social workers need to provide more customized and individualized intervention to older adults. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This information typically contains sensitive data that must be preserved in order to be used for research or educational purposes, depending on the regulations of each country and institution. In order to assure confidentiality of data, different techniques can be used to remove basic identifiers (e.g. names, ids); however, these techniques can be easily bypassed by attackers who know the information that can act as pseudo-identifiers of patients (e.g. birth dates, gender). Although these pseudo-identifiers can also be removed, the information they contain is valuable for medical research. To face this problem, different methods that allow minimizing the risk of sharing confidential information have been proposed. The interactive use of anonymization algorithms for electronic medical records is the main contribution of this paper, dubbed AnonymousData.co: a proposal for anonymization of electronic health records.

Such knowledge can be clearly transferred to the decision makers of an organization by utilizing an informative knowledge map. A knowledge map is a visual representation of information which can be designed in a multiple level of details out of the knowledge assets of an organization. The main idea of this paper is to employ data mining approaches for creating the knowledge map in order to locate the experts and domains of their expertise in research-based organizations. In order to actualize the idea in this paper, a portion of UT-SAED (Faculty Members Research Management system) data has been used and a knowledge map has been automatically created out of a number of engineering areas in faculty of engineering, university of Tehran, Iran.

As a result, smart grids increase the uncertainties caused by the power injections of photovoltaic (PV) and/or wind power generation. To smooth smart grid operation, it is necessary to select the predicted input variables for the forecasting model. In this paper, how to select explanatory variables in the forecasting model of PV generation is discussed because Japan gives much higher priority to PV generation in the framework of future energy policy. The global solar radiation is one of the most important variables in dealing with PV generation output forecasting. This paper focuses on the relationship between the global solar radiation and its explanatory variables. The proposed method makes use of the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm of data mining method to select the explanatory or input variables in the forecasting model of global solar radiation. CART has the function to give priority to explanatory variables through an index called Variable Importance. The proposed method was applied to real data of global solar radiation in Tokyo, Japan.

J	Muelas, S; LaTorre, A; Pena, JM				Muelas, Santiago; LaTorre, Antonio; Pena, Jose-Maria			A new methodology for the automatic creation of adaptive hybrid algorithms	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Hybrid evolutionary algorithms; memetic algorithms; differential evolution; continuous optimization; machine learning	MEMETIC DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS	Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms are a promising alternative to deal with the problem of selecting the most appropriate Evolutionary Algorithm for a specific problem. By means of the combination of different heuristic optimization approaches, it is possible to profit from the benefits of the best approach or, even more, to discover synergies between the algorithms that could improve the results of the best performing individual algorithm. Nowadays, there is an active research in the design of dynamic or adaptive combination strategies for hybrid algorithms. However, little research has been done in the automatic learning of the best hybridization strategy. This paper proposes a new methodology for developing intelligent adaptive hybrid algorithms that uses data mining techniques to analyze the results from past executions. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on a well-known benchmark on continuous optimization made up of 19 different functions and several dimensions (50, 100, 200 and 500). Several analyses have been conducted and statistical tests have been used for validating the results. The generated hybrid algorithm has achieved outstanding results, obtaining significantly better results than the MOS algorithm, the most performant algorithm on this benchmark, and the CMA-ES algorithm, one of the reference algorithms in continuous optimization.

Today's complex data, however, allow multiple interpretations leading to several valid groupings hidden in different views of the database. Each of these multiple clustering solutions is valuable and interesting as different perspectives on the same data and several meaningful groupings for each object are given. Especially for high dimensional data, where each object is described by multiple attributes, alternative clusters in different attribute subsets are of major interest. In this tutorial, we describe several real world application scenarios for multiple clustering solutions. We abstract from these scenarios and provide the general challenges in this emerging research area. We describe state-of-the-art paradigms, we highlight specific techniques, and we give an overview of this topic by providing a taxonomy of the existing clustering methods. By focusing on open challenges, we try to attract young researchers for participating in this emerging research field.

The main purpose of this research is to develop a dynamic dropout prediction model for universities, institutes and colleges. In this work, We first apply chi square test to separate factors such as gender, financial condition and dropping year to classify the successful from unsuccessful students. The main purpose of applying it is feature selection to data. Degree of freedom is used to P-value (Probability value) for best predicators of dependent variable. After being separation of factors we have had examined by using data mining techniques Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and CHAID tree. Among classification tree, growing methods Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was the most successful in growing the tree with an overall percentage of correct classification than CHAID tree. A maximum tree depth has been reached: 3 levels for the CHAID tree and 4 levels for the CART tree. After generating, the classification matrix rules for CART and CHAID tree (Study outcome) have generated. Both the risk estimated by the cross-validation and the gain diagram suggests that all trees based only enrolment data are not quite good in separating successful from unsuccessful students. Here we have considered most important factors to classify the successful students over unsuccessful students are gender, financial condition and dropping year as well as age, gender, ethnicity, education, work status, and disability and study environment that may in-flounce persistence or dropout of students at university level.

Clustering techniques are broadly used in solving the permutation problem, however, some challenges still exist, for example, elongated datasets should be handled, and constraint from the background knowledge must be considered. Inspired by various successful applications of kernel and spectral clustering methods in machine learning and data mining community, we try to solve the permutation problem by these methods. In this paper, the weighted kernel k-means algorithm is modified according to the specific requirement of the permutation problem, and the spectral interpretation of the kernel approach is also investigated. In addition, we propose several kernel construction approaches to improving the permutation performance.

The paper provides a survey of various current mobile software agents based Distributed Data Mining systems like BODHI, PADMA, Papyrus, JAM, InfoSleuth and DKN and discusses their salient features. Flexibility and autonomy of mobile software agents make them a suitable tool for software deployment in wireless sensor networks. We then discuss the deployment of mobile software agents on two popular sensor architectures Crossbow Mica2 motes and Sun SPOT. The limitation of the Sun SPOT environment in supporting mobile software agents due to the absence of serializable interface on Sun SPOTs is discussed. The common pitfalls while deploying mobile software agents using Agilla agent framework on Crossbow motes are also discussed.

The notion of alternate worlds is used to formalize the information content of a ciset and ciset relations. A ciset represents a collection of (regular) sets. Similarly, a ciset relation represents a collection of (regular) relations. Once this collection has been identified, any ciset relational operator can be applied on the collection of (regular) relations represented by ciset relations involved. This approach is computationally inefficient and is introduced solely to fully explain in a formal way, the semantics of newly introduced operators.

Recent advances in the field of data mining, pervasive computing and other computing methods are ready to meet this kind of challenges. However, few techniques can be gracefully adopted for generating accurate and reliable as well as biologically interpretable rules. The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel method for classifying coronary artery disease dataset based on the principle of decision trees. We extend classical decision tree building algorithms to handle data sets with Multivariate in nature. Extensive experiments have been conducted which shows that the resulting classifiers are more accurate than the existing classifiers. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with the coronary artery disease (CAD) data sets taken from University California Irvine (UCI).

Hence the desire to keep one's own sensitive data secret is an important challenge of preserving privacy while mining in a distributed setup. There have been indeed numerous attempts to propose privacy preserving data mining algorithms. However, in order to extract the associations with respect to the time segment, the cyclic nature of the association rules must be examined. To the best of our knowledge and explorations, the current privacy preserving algorithms, do not consider the cyclic nature of the association rules. Hence, we here propose techniques with illustrative examples that help to privately decipher cyclic association rules that are common to all the participating parties. The techniques proposed by us for a multi-party scenario are based on homomorphism and Shamir's secret sharing. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using computers to analyze masses of information to discover trends and patterns. The current trend in business collaboration shares the data and mines results to gain mutual benefit. The main goal of the work is to introduce a bisection method which is capable of transforming a non-anonymous data set into adult data set. In this model, transform a table so that no one can make high probability association between records in the table and the corresponding entities. In order to achieve these goals we are implemented a bracket rule identifier for the prediction of the cluster. For this a suitable metric has been developed to estimate information loss by suppression which works well for both numeric and categorical data.

Our main goal is to illustrate the applications of EDM in the domain of e-learning and online courses by implementing a model to predict academic dismissal and also GPA of graduated students. The monitoring and support of freshmen and first year students are considered very significant in many educational institutions. Consequently, if there are some ways to estimate probability of dismissal, drop out and other challenges within the process of the graduation, and also capable tools to predict GPA or even semester by semester grades, the university officials can design and improve more efficient strategies for education systems especially for e-learning ones which include less known and more complicated problems. To achieve the mentioned goal, a common methodology of data mining has been utilized which is called CRISP. Our results show that there can be confident models for predicting educational attributes. Currently there is an increasing interest in data mining and educational systems, making educational data mining as a new growing research community.

Application of Change Point Outlier Detection Methods in Real Time Intrusion Detection	2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES (ACSAT)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advanced Computer Science Applications and Technologies (ACSAT)	NOV 26-28, 2012	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Design Sci Renaissance (DSR)		Network Intrusion; Anomaly Detection; Change Detection; Threshold Algorithms; Performance Evaluation; Outlier Detection		Recent years has shown a growing interest in the development of change detection techniques for the analysis of Intrusion Detection. Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.	[Naveen, N.

This issue throws up a new area of research namely privacy preserving data mining. In this paper, we proposed a privacy preservation method by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) trained Auto Associative Neural Network (PSOAANN). The modified (privacy preserved) input values are fed to a decision tree (DT) and a rule induction algorithm viz., Ripper for rule extraction purpose. The performance of the hybrid is tested on four benchmark and bankruptcy datasets using 10-fold cross validation. The results are compared with those obtained using the original datasets where privacy is not preserved. The proposed hybrid approach achieved good results in all datasets.

The value of share itemsets provides useful information such as total profits and total customer purchased quantities associated with itemsets in database. The share-frequent itemsets mining problems become a very important research issue in data mining. Existing share-frequent itemsets mining algorithms are based on static database so knowledge must be rebuilded when the minimum share threshold is changed or database is modified either appended or updated. This paper proposes a novel BitTable knowledge for incremental and interactive share-frequent itemsets mining in multiple minimum share thresholds without rebuilding BitTable knowledge. It is effective for incremental and interactive mining to take advantage of the previous BitTable knowledge and the previous mining results.

These methods specifically exploit the statistical dependencies among instances in order to improve classification accuracy. However, there has been little focus on how these same dependencies affect our ability to draw accurate conclusions about the performance of the models. More specifically, the complex link structure and attribute dependencies in relational data violate the assumptions of many conventional statistical tests and make it difficult to use these tests to assess the models in an unbiased manner. In this work, we examine the task of within-network classification and the question of whether two algorithms will learn models that will result in significantly different levels of performance. We show that the commonly used form of evaluation (paired t-test on overlapping network samples) can result in an unacceptable level of Type I error. Furthermore, we show that Type I error increases as (1) the correlation among instances increases and (2) the size of the evaluation set increases (i.e., the proportion of labeled nodes in the network decreases). We propose a method for network cross-validation that combined with paired t-tests produces more acceptable levels of Type I error while still providing reasonable levels of statistical power (i.e., 1-Type II error).

With regard to data mining, it has been applied to legal databases, as well as to law enforcement. We survey forensic applications of data mining to fraud and otherwise to crime intelligence or investigation. Traditionally a field separate from AI and Law, the two are now coming together. Success has been achieved especially in unravelling networks and in detecting fraud.

Since WUM directly involves in large range of applications, such as, e-commerce, e-learning, Web analytics, information retrieval etc. Weblog data is one of the major sources which contain all the information regarding the users visited links, browsing patterns, time spent on a particular page or link and this information can be used in several applications like adaptive web sites, modified services, customer summary, pre-fetching, generate attractive web sites etc. There are several problems related with the existing web usage mining approaches. Existing web usage mining algorithms suffer from difficulty of practical applicability. So, a novel research is necessary for the accurate prediction of future performance of web users with rapid execution time. WUM consists of preprocessing, pattern discovery and pattern analysis. Log data is characteristically noisy and unclear. Hence, preprocessing is an essential process for effective mining process. In this paper, a novel pre-processing technique is proposed by removing local and global noise and web robots.

Almost everything and anything can be searched on net. Web pages usually contain huge amount of information that may not interest the user, as it may not be the part of the main content of the web page. Web Usage Mining (WUM) is one of the main applications of data mining, artificial intelligence and so on to the web data and forecast the user's visiting behaviors and obtains their interests by investigating the samples. Since WUM directly involves in applications, such as, e-commerce, e-learning, Web analytics, information retrieval etc. Weblog data is one of the major sources which contain all the information regarding the users visited links, browsing patterns, time spent on a particular page or link and this information can be used in several applications like adaptive web sites, modified services, customer summary, pre-fetching, generate attractive web sites etc. There are varieties of problems related with the existing web usage mining approaches. Existing web usage mining algorithms suffer from difficulty of practical applicability. This paper continues the line of research on Web access log analysis is to analyze the patterns of web site usage and the features of users behavior. It is the fact that the normal Log data is very noisy and unclear and it is vital to preprocess the log data for efficient web usage mining process. Preprocessing is the process comprises of three phases which includes data cleaning, user identification, and pattern discovery and pattern analysis. Log data is characteristically noisy and unclear, so preprocessing is an essential process for effective mining process. In this paper, a novel pre-processing technique is proposed by removing local and global noise and web robots. Preprocessing is an important step since the Web architecture is very complex in nature and 80% of the mining process is done at this phase.

However, the resulting large graphical models can make inference for Markov logic a computationally challenging problem. Recently, dual decomposition (DD) has become a popular approach for scalable inference on graphical models. We study how to apply DD to scale up inference in Markov logic. A standard approach for DD first partitions a graphical model into multiple tree-structured subproblems. We apply this approach to Markov logic and show that DD can outperform prior inference approaches. Nevertheless, we observe that the standard approach for DD is suboptimal as it does not exploit the rich structure often present in the Markov logic program. Thus, we describe a novel decomposition strategy that partitions a Markov logic program into parts based on its structure. A crucial advantage of our approach is that we can use specialized algorithms for portions of the input problem some of which have been studied for decades, e. g., coreference resolution. Empirically, we show that our program-level decomposition approach outperforms both non-decomposition and graphical model-based decomposition approaches to Markov logic inference on several data-mining tasks.

MEB has a limitation for dealing with a large dataset in which computational load drastically increases as training data size becomes large. To handle this problem in huge dataset used in different domains, we propose two approaches using Fuzzy C-mean clustering method. These approaches find the concentric balls with minimum volume of data description to reduce the chance of accepting abnormal data that contain most of the training samples. Our method uses a divide-and-conquer strategy; trains each decomposed sub-problems to get support vectors and retrains with the support vectors to find a global data description of a whole target class. Our study is experimented on speech information to eliminate all noise data and reducing time training. For this, the training data, learned by Support Vector Machines (SVMs), is partitioned among several data sources. Computation of such SVMs can be achieved by finding a core-set for the image of the data. Numerical experiments on some real-world datasets verify the usefulness of our approaches for data mining.

The presence of outliers is an unavoidable phenomenon in data analysis. Detection of outliers is important to increase the accuracy of the required estimates and for reliable knowledge discovery from the underlying databases. Most of the existing outlier detection methods in regression analysis are based on the single case deletion approach that is inefficient in the presence of multiple outliers because of the well known masking and swamping effects. To avoid these effects the multiple case deletion approach has been introduced. We propose a group deletion approach based diagnostic measure for identifying multiple influential observations in logistic regression. At the same time we introduce a plotting technique that can classify data into outliers, high leverage points, as well as influential and regular observations. This paper has two objectives. First, it investigates the problems of outlier detection in logistic regression, proposes a new method that can find multiple influential observations, and classifies the types of outlier. Secondly, it shows the necessity for proper identification of outliers and influential observations as a prelude for reliable knowledge discovery from modeling and classification via logistic regression. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method, compare the performance with the existing popular diagnostic methods, and explore the necessity of outlier detection for reliability and robustness in modeling and classification by using real datasets.

Different approaches have been proposed to predict stock prices including the use of computational intelligence and data mining techniques. Many of these methods operate on closing stock prices or on known technical indicators. Limited studies have shown that Japanese candlestick analysis serve as rich information sources for the market. In this paper decision trees based on the ID3 algorithm are used to derive short-term trading decisions from candlesticks. To handle the large amount of uncertainty in the data, both inputs and output classifications are fuzzified using well-defined membership functions. Testing results of the derived decision trees show significant gains compared to ideal mid and long-term trading simulations both in frictionless and realistic markets.

In this study, a new framework is defined to predict user ratings on new items from previously given ratings by other users. The systems has two major steps: (1) Enhancing available data based on semantic content to get a full item-user matrix, and (2) Predicting the unknown rating using an integrated feature set of "other ratings given by the same user" and "other ratings given to the same item". This allows the classifier to consider both user similarities and item similarities simultaneously. The system is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy on a benchmark movie dataset.

Frequently, this type of data sets are incomplete in the sense that not all geographical coordinates have measured values of the variable(s) of interest. This incompleteness may be caused by poor data collection, measurement errors, costs management and many other factors. These missing values may cause several difficulties in many applications. Spatial imputation/interpolation methods try to fill in these unknown values in geo-referenced data sets. In this paper we propose a new spatial imputation method based on machine learning algorithms and a series of data preprocessing steps. The key distinguishing factor of this method is allowing the use of data from faraway regions, contrary to the state of the art on spatial data mining. Images (e. g. from a satellite or video surveillance cameras) may also suffer from this incompleteness where some pixels are missing, which again may be caused by many factors. An image can be seen as a spatial data set in a Cartesian coordinates system, where each pixel (location) registers some value (e. g. degree of gray on a black and white image). Being able to recover the original image from a partial or incomplete version of the reality is a key application in many domains (e. g. surveillance, security, etc.). In this paper we evaluate our general methodology for spatial interpolation on this type of problems. Namely, we check the ability of our method to fill in unknown pixels on several images. We compare it to state of the art methods and provide strong experimental evidence of the advantages of our proposal.
