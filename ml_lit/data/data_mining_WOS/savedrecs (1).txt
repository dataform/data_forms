With the development of urban traffic acquisition technology, the traffic data have increased to PB level. In order to manage these traffic data effectively and serve for intelligent transportation, we need to use efficient algorithm to process them in the distributed environment. In a distributed platform, this paper optimizes the Hadoop schedule algorithm that is used in processing traffic data and makes up the shortcomings of real-time traditional algorithms. The results of experiments show that the optimized scheduling algorithm used in a distributed environment, whether it is compute-intensive or I/O-intensive, has the most minimum calculation time, the best performance, better capacity of processing the traffic data, and better real time.

An automatic measure tool intended to exhibit the meaning of words in context has been developed and linked with Quantum Theory, particularly entanglement. "Quantum like" experiments were undertaken on semantic space based on the Hyperspace Analogue Language (HAL) method. A quantum HAL model was implemented using state vectors issued from the HAL matrix and query observables, testing a wide range of window sizes. The Bell parameter S, associating measures on two words in a document, was derived showing peaks for specific window sizes. The peaks show maximum quantum violation of the Bell inequalities and are document dependent. This new correlation measure inspired by Quantum Theory could be promising for measuring query relevance.

However, extraneous information is displayed on the top of the search results and the user interest in the search results in a text match without or seldom taking into account the search intents of the users. For most of the search engines, they either cannot become aware of the user interest properly or cannot find the information which users need efficiently. In our study, we solve these problems. We store users' search history in the user profile, and relocate the results of search history by the particular subject. The proposed method can provide a personalized search service that imparts higher priority to the user documentation saw, which is positioned at the top of the search results. On the basis of the proposed method, we developed a system with which the corresponding experiment has been performed to verify our proposed method. The experiment result shows the validity of our proposed method and the importance of personalized search.

It is useful to construct relations between a word or phrases and a representative name of the entity to meet these demands. To reduce the costs, this paper discusses how to automatically discover "sameAs'' and "meaningOf'' links from Japanese Wikipedia. In order to do so, we gathered relevant features such as IDF, string similarity, number of hypernym, and so on. We have identified the link-based score on salient features based on SVM results with 960,000 anchor link pairs. These case studies show us that our link discovery method goes well with more than 70 % precision/recall rate.

In this paper, we will examine the problem of density-based local outlier detection on uncertain data sets described by some discrete instances. We propose a new density-based local outlier concept based on uncertain data. In order to quickly detect outliers, an algorithm is proposed that does not require the unfolding of all possible worlds. The performance of our method is verified through a number of simulation experiments. The experimental results show that our method is an effective way to solve the problem of density-based local outlier detection on uncertain data.

Consequently, measuring nodes similarity in a graph is a fundamental problem of graph data mining. Personalized PageRank (PPR) and SimRank (SR) have emerged as the most popular and influential link-based similarity measures. In practice, PPR and SR scores are achieved by iterative computing. With increasing of iterations, the computations incur heavy overhead. The ideal solution is that computing similarity within the minimum number of iterations is sufficient to guarantee a desired accuracy. However, the existing upper bounds are too coarse to be useful in general. Therefore, we focus on designing accurate and tight upper bounds of PPR and SR in the paper. Our upper bounds are designed based on following human intuition: "the smaller the difference between the two consecutive iteration step results is, the smaller the difference between iterative similarity scores and theoretical ones is". Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of our novel upper bounds in the scenario of top-k similar nodes query, where our upper bounds accelerate speed of the query. At last, we run a comprehensive set of experiments on real data sets to verify effectiveness and efficiency of our upper bounds	[Zhang, Yinglong; Li, Cuiping; Chen, Hong] Renmin Univ China, Key Lab Data Engn & Knowledge Engn MOE, Beijing, Peoples R China	Zhang, YL (reprint author), Renmin Univ China, Key Lab Data Engn & Knowledge Engn MOE, Beijing, Peoples R China.	zhangyinglong@126.com; cuiping_li@263.net						18	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-319-08010-9; 978-3-319-08009-3	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2014	8485						100	112				13	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BB3LO	WOS:000342838500013

However, the increasing scale and complexity of data has restricted the performance of entity resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel entity resolution framework that clusters large-scale data with distributed entity resolution method. We model the clustering problem as finding similarity sub connected graphs from records. Firstly, our approach finds pairs of records whose similarities are above a given threshold based on appjoin algorithm which extends the ppjoin algorithm and are executed on MapReduce framework. Then, we propose a cache-based algorithm which cluster entities with similar pairs based on the Disjoin Set algorithm and are also designed for MapReduce framework. Experimental results on real dataset show that our algorithms can achieve more efficiency than previous algorithms on the entity resolution and clustering.

However, most of the existing studies assumed the data for classification is complete, while in practice, a lot of data with missing values exists. When dealing with these data, deleting the incomplete instances will result in a reduction of available information and filling in missing values may introduce skew and errors. To avoid the above problems, it is of great importance to study how to classify directly with incomplete data. In the paper, an information theory based classification algorithm, ITCI, is proposed. ITCI calculates the initial uncertainty of each class and attributes' contribution to decrease class uncertainty in the training stage and then, in the testing stage, an instance is assigned to the class whose uncertainty is minimum after all of the attributes are taken into consideration. Extended experiments proved the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

[1] "Knowing" is not just having a checklist of facts. Functionally, SA is about possessing information of sufficient scope and accuracy to support decision making that facilitates effective action. Augmented Cognition research shows that presenting too much data, even of high quality, can be as harmful to effective cognition as presenting little or no data [2]. Research has shows that in 35% of aviation errors in SA, all needed information was present, but not attended to by decision makers. [3] This work presents a formal but simple mathematical SA Model, and describes the application of data mining and modeling to SA errors resulting from inattention to the most salient facts. The model is applied to two data sets to demonstrate a general approach to automating the detection and diagnosis of SA errors.

Association rule mining is one of the most important techniques in this field, discovering relationships of interest among patterns. Despite the mining of association rules being an area of great interest for many researchers, the search for well-grouped continuous values is still a challenge, discovering rules that do not comprise patterns which represent unnecessary ranges of values. Existing algorithms for mining association rules in continuous domains are mainly based on a non-deterministic search, requiring a high number of parameters to be optimised. These parameters hinder the mining process, and the algorithms themselves must be known to those data mining experts that want to use them. We therefore present a grammar guided genetic programming algorithm that does not require as many parameters as other existing approaches and enables the discovery of quantitative association rules comprising small-size gaps. The algorithm is verified over a varied set of data, comparing the results to other association rule mining algorithms from several paradigms. Additionally, some resulting rules from different paradigms are analysed, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model for reducing gaps in numerical features.

This research is facilitated by the advent of automated sensor-free detectors that have been designed to "infer" affect from the logs of student interactions within a learning environment. Such detectors allow for fine-grained analysis of the impact of different affective states on a range of learning outcome measures. However, these detectors have to date only been developed for a subset of online learning environments, including problem-solving tutors, dialogue tutors, and narrative-based virtual environments. In this paper, we extend sensor-free affect detection to a science microworld environment, affording the possibility of more deeply studying and responding to student affect in this type of learning environment.

Recent research has begun to validate the claims stated by the theory and extend the provided statements to the design of pedagogical interactions. To incorporate the theory in a design, automatic detector of flow is required. However, little attention has been drawn to this filed, and the detection of flow is currently still dominated by using surveys. Hence, within this paper, we present an automated detector which is able to identify the students that are in flow. This detector is developed using a step regression approach, with data collected from college students learning linear algebra from a step-based tutoring system.

In this paper we investigate using data mining techniques for analyzing student behaviors in an especially-complex exploratory environment, with over one hundred possible actions at any given point. Furthermore, the outcomes of these actions depend on their context. We propose a multi-layer action-events structure to deal with the complexity of the data and employ clustering and rule mining to examine student behaviors in terms of learning performance and effects of different degrees of scaffolding. Our findings show that using the proposed multi-layer structure for describing action-events enables the clustering algorithm to effectively identify the successful and unsuccessful students in terms of learning performance across activities in the presence or absence of external scaffolding. We also report and discuss the prominent behavior patterns of each group and investigate short term effects of scaffolding.

The last two approaches are from the recommender system's field. We approach the problem using question-level Knowledge Components (KCs) and test the methods using cross-validation. In this work, we focus on predicting students' performance in parameterized exercises. Our experiments shows that advanced recommender system techniques are as accurate as the pioneer methods in predicting student performance.

We describe an approach that leverages a data mining framework to build and validate a detector that evaluates an ill-defined inquiry process skill, designing controlled experiments. The detector was originally built and validated for use with physical science simulations that have a simpler, linear causal structure. In this paper, we show that the detector can be used to identify demonstration of skill within a life science simulation on Ecosystems that has a complex underlying causal structure. The detector is evaluated in three ways: 1) identifying skill demonstration for a new student cohort, 2) handling the variability in how students conduct experiments, and 3) using it to determine when students are off-track before they finish collecting data.

Traditional methods of computer modeling of educational systems often either lack transparency in their implementation, are complex, and often do not natively simulate nonlinear systems. In response, we advocate a Complex Adaptive Systems approach towards modeling and data mining. By simulating agent-level attributes rather than system-level attributes, the modeling is inherently transparent, easily adjustable, and facilitates analysis of the system due to the analogous nature of the simulated agents to real-world entities. We explore the design a CAS model of schools using multiple levels of data from varied data streams.

This study identifies a clear need for validating results using players not appearing in the original sample, as even methods that use in-sample cross-validation can show substantial differences in performance from one data set to another. Many methods are found to be quite accurate in correctly identifying player types in training data, but perform poorly when used on new samples. Artificial neural networks appear to be the most reliable classification method overall, but still fail to identify a large group of likely problem gamblers. Bet intensity, variability, frequency and trajectory, as well as age and gender are noted to be insufficient variables to classify probable disordered gamblers with arbitrarily reasonable accuracy.

For example, predicting college student performance is crucial for both the student and educational institutions. It can support timely intervention to prevent students from failing a course, increasing efficacy of advising functions, and improving course completion rate. In this paper, we present the efforts carried out at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) toward conducting predictive analytics to academic data collected from 2009 through 2013 and available in one of the most commonly used learning management systems, called Moodle. First, we have identified the data features useful for predicting student outcomes such as students' scores in homework assignments, quizzes, exams, in addition to their activities in discussion forums and their total GPA at the same term they enrolled in the course. Then, Logistic Regression and Neural Network predictive models are used to identify students as early as possible that are in danger of failing the course they are currently enrolled in. These models compute the likelihood of any given student failing (or passing) the current course. Numerical results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of the developed models and their predictive accuracy.

Their telescopes, instruments, software, and human resources engage in interwoven workflows over a broad range of timescales. These workflows have been tuned to be responsive to concepts of observatory operations that were applicable when various assets were commissioned, years or decades in the past. The astronomical community is entering an era of rapid change increasingly characterized by large time domain surveys, robotic telescopes and automated infrastructures, and most significantly of operating modes and scientific consortia that span our individual facilities, joining them into complex network entities. Observatories must adapt and numerous initiatives are in progress that focus on redesigning individual components out of the astronomical toolkit. New instrumentation is both more capable and more complex than ever, and even simple instruments may have powerful observation scripting capabilities. Remote and queue observing modes are now widespread. Data archives are becoming ubiquitous. Virtual observatory standards and protocols and astroinformatics data-mining techniques layered on these are areas of active development. Indeed, new large-aperture ground-based telescopes may be as expensive as space missions and have similarly formal project management processes and large data management requirements. This piecewise approach is not enough. Whatever challenges of funding or politics facing the national and international astronomical communities it will be more efficient scientifically as well as in the usual figures of merit of cost, schedule, performance, and risks to explicitly address the systems engineering of the astronomical community as a whole.

This analysis is based on data that was collected by the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) on the development of 4,106 software projects. Data mining techniques have been applied to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the project activities and to identify a link between the effort distribution and the prevalence of software defects. This analysis has been complemented with the use of a hierarchical clustering algorithm with a dissimilarity based on the likelihood ratio statistic, for exploratory purposes. As a result, different behaviours have been identified for this collection of software development projects, allowing for the definition of risk control strategies to diminish the number and impact of the software defects. It is expected that the use of similar estimations might greatly improve the awareness of project managers on the risks at hand.

An Improved Pearson's Correlation Proximity-Based Hierarchical Clustering for Mining Biological Association between Genes	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY; PROFILES	Microarray gene expression datasets has concerned great awareness among molecular biologist, statisticians, and computer scientists. Data mining that extracts the hidden and usual information from datasets fails to identify the most significant biological associations between genes. A search made with heuristic for standard biological process measures only the gene expression level, threshold, and response time. Heuristic search identifies and mines the best biological solution, but the association process was not efficiently addressed. To monitor higher rate of expression levels between genes, a hierarchical clustering model was proposed, where the biological association between genes is measured simultaneously using proximity measure of improved Pearson's correlation (PCPHC). Additionally, the Seed Augment algorithm adopts average linkage methods on rows and columns in order to expand a seed PCPHC model into a maximal global PCPHC (GL-PCPHC) model and to identify association between the clusters. Moreover, a GL-PCPHC applies pattern growing method to mine the PCPHC patterns. Compared to existing gene expression analysis, the PCPHC model achieves better performance. Experimental evaluations are conducted for GL-PCPHC model with standard benchmark gene expression datasets extracted from UCI repository and GenBank database in terms of execution time, size of pattern, significance level, biological association efficiency, and pattern quality.

Some secure or private information can be discovered by data mining techniques, thus resulting in an inherent risk of threats to privacy. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) has thus arisen in recent years to sanitize the original database for hiding sensitive information, which can be concerned as an NP-hard problem in sanitization process. In this paper, a compact prelarge GA-based (cpGA2DT) algorithm to delete transactions for hiding sensitive itemsets is thus proposed. It solves the limitations of the evolutionary process by adopting both the compact GA-based (cGA) mechanism and the prelarge concept. A flexible fitness function with three adjustable weights is thus designed to find the appropriate transactions to be deleted in order to hide sensitive itemsets with minimal side effects of hiding failure, missing cost, and artificial cost. Experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed cpGA2DT algorithm compared to the simple GA-based (sGA2DT) algorithm and the greedy approach in terms of execution time and three side effects.

Many researches have been proposed, which were focusing on improving the performance of decision tree. However, those algorithms are developed and run on traditional distributed systems. Obviously the latency could not be improved while processing huge data generated by ubiquitous sensing node in the era without new technology help. In order to improve data processing latency in huge data mining, in this paper, we design and implement a new parallelized decision tree algorithm on a CUDA (compute unified device architecture), which is a GPGPU solution provided by NVIDIA. In the proposed system, CPU is responsible for flow control while the GPU is responsible for computation. We have conducted many experiments to evaluate system performance of CUDT and made a comparison with traditional CPU version. The results show that CUDT is 5 similar to 55 times faster than Weka-j48 and is 18 times speedup than SPRINT for large data set.

The class imbalance problem is handled by finding legal as well as fraud transaction patterns for each customer by using frequent itemset mining. A matching algorithm is also proposed to find to which pattern (legal or fraud) the incoming transaction of a particular customer is closer and a decision is made accordingly. In order to handle the anonymous nature of the data, no preference is given to any of the attributes and each attribute is considered equally for finding the patterns. The performance evaluation of the proposed model is done on UCSD Data Mining Contest 2009 Dataset (anonymous and imbalanced) and it is found that the proposed model has very high fraud detection rate, balanced classification rate, Matthews correlation coefficient, and very less false alarm rate than other state-of-the-art classifiers.

Biblio-MetReS is a data-mining application that facilitates the reconstruction of molecular networks based on automated text-mining analysis of published scientific literature. Homol-MetReS allows functional (re) annotation of proteomes, to properly identify both the individual proteins involved in the process(es) of interest and their function. It also enables the sets of proteins involved in the process(es) in different organisms to be compared directly. The efficiency of these biological applications is directly related to the design of the shared database. We classified and analyzed the different kinds of access to the database. Based on this study, we tried to adjust and tune the configurable parameters of the database server to reach the best performance of the communication data link to/from the database system. Different database technologies were analyzed. We started the study with a public relational SQL database, MySQL. Then, the same database was implemented by a MapReduce-based database named HBase. The results indicated that the standard configuration of MySQL gives an acceptable performance for low or medium size databases. Nevertheless, tuning database parameters can greatly improve the performance and lead to very competitive runtimes.

A two-stage approach by self-organizing maps and K-means method is applied to segment 1,462 patients into twelve clusters. The average values of L, R, and F excluding monetary covered by national health insurance program are computed for each cluster. In addition, customer value matrix is used to analyze customer values of twelve clusters in terms of frequency and monetary. Customer relationship matrix considering length and recency is also applied to classify different types of customers from these twelve clusters. The results show that three clusters can be classified into loyal patients with L, R, and F values greater than the respective average L, R, and F values, while three clusters can be viewed as lost patients without any variable above the average values of L, R, and F. When different types of patients are identified, marketing strategies can be designed to meet different patients' needs.

J	Sahoo, AJ; Kumar, Y				Sahoo, Anoop J.; Kumar, Yugal			Seminal quality prediction using data mining methods	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Particle swarm optimization; multilayer perceptron; seminal; support vector machine	SEMEN QUALITY; FERTILITY; MEN; CLASSIFIERS; POPULATION; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORK; TRENDS; SVM	BACKGROUND: Now-a-days, some new classes of diseases have come into existences which are known as lifestyle diseases. The main reasons behind these diseases are changes in the lifestyle of people such as alcohol drinking, smoking, food habits etc. After going through the various lifestyle diseases, it has been found that the fertility rates (sperm quantity) in men has considerably been decreasing in last two decades. Lifestyle factors as well as environmental factors are mainly responsible for the change in the semen quality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to identify the lifestyle and environmental features that affects the seminal quality and also fertility rate in man using data mining methods. METHOD: The five artificial intelligence techniques such as Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), Navie Bayes (Kernel), Support vector machine + Particle swarm optimization (SVM + PSO) and Support vector machine (SVM) have been applied on fertility dataset to evaluate the seminal quality and also to predict the person is either normal or having altered fertility rate. While the eight feature selection techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), evolutionary logistic regression (LR), support vector machine plus particle swarm optimization (SVM + PSO), principle component analysis (PCA), chi-square test, correlation and T-test methods have been used to identify more relevant features which affect the seminal quality. These techniques are applied on fertility dataset which contains 100 instances with nine attribute with two classes. RESULTS: The experimental result shows that SVM + PSO provides higher accuracy and area under curve (AUC) rate (94% & 0.932) among multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (92% & 0.728), Support Vector Machines (91% & 0.758), Navie Bayes (Kernel) (89% & 0.850) and Decision Tree (89% & 0.735) for some of the seminal parameters. This paper also focuses on the feature selection process i.e. how to select the features which are more important for prediction of fertility rate. In this paper, eight feature selection methods are applied on fertility dataset to find out a set of good features. The investigational results shows that childish diseases (0.079) and high fever features (0.057) has less impact on fertility rate while age (0.8685), season (0.843), surgical intervention (0.7683), alcohol consumption (0.5992), smoking habit (0.575), number of hours spent on setting (0.4366) and accident (0.5973) features have more impact. It is also observed that feature selection methods increase the accuracy of above mentioned techniques (multilayer perceptron 92%, support vector machine 91%, SVM + PSO 94%, Navie Bayes (Kernel) 89% and decision tree 89%) as compared to without feature selection methods (multilayer perceptron 86%, support vector machine 86%, SVM + PSO 85%, Navie Bayes (Kernel) 83% and decision tree 84%) which shows the applicability of feature selection methods in prediction. CONCLUSION: This paper lightens the application of artificial techniques in medical domain. From this paper, it can be concluded that data mining methods can be used to predict a person with or without disease based on environmental and lifestyle parameters/features rather than undergoing various medical test. In this paper, five data mining techniques are used to predict the fertility rate and among which SVM + PSO provide more accurate results than support vector machine and decision tree.

Actual research focuses on Virtual Metrology (VM) using high sophisticated Machine Learning methods to predict a predefined metrology target based on statistical models trained on historical data. Enhancing physical metrology by predictive models leads to smart future fabs. Enabling scalable VM for fab-wide deployment depends on the extraction of only the most important out of typically hundreds to thousands of available process parameters. High Density Plasma (HDP) Chemical Vapor Deposition appears to be a process area in SM predestinated for application of thus required Data Mining. In low-volume-high-mixture fabrication plants, Knowledge Discovery in Databases is extremely challenging due to complex technology mixtures and reduced availability of data for comparable process steps. In this paper, a new Feature Selection wrapper method has been developed and is investigated to reveal only the most important process parameters for smart VM. Modeling of unknown functional interrelations and selection of these features is achieved to predict the layer thickness of dielectric layers deposited onto a metallization layer of the manufactured wafers with highest accuracy and reliability.

When running in combination on parallel platforms, these applications present a daunting variety of workload behaviors that challenge the effectiveness of any memory allocation strategy. Prior partitioning-based or random memory allocation schemes typically manage only one level of the memory hierarchy and often target specific workloads. To handle diverse and dynamically changing memory and cache allocation needs, we augment existing "horizontal" cache/DRAM bank partitioning with vertical partitioning and explore the resulting multi-policy space. We study the performance of these policies for over 2000 workloads and correlate the results with application characteristics via a data mining approach. Based on this correlation we derive several practical memory allocation rules that we integrate into a unified multi-policy framework to guide resources partitioning and coalescing for dynamic and diverse multi-programmed/threaded workloads. We implement our approach in Linux kernel 2.6.32 as a restructured page indexing system plus a series of kernel modules. Extensive experiments show that, in practice, our framework can select proper memory allocation policy and consistently outperforms the unmodified Linux kernel, achieving up to 119 performance gains compared to prior techniques.

Though privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) minimizes sensitive data disclosure probability, sensitive content analysis, privacy measurement and user's privacy awareness issues are yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a privacy management scheme that enables the user to estimate the risk of sharing private data like smart meter data. Our focus is to develop robust sensitivity detection, analysis and privacy content quantification scheme from statistical disclosure control aspect and information theoretic model.

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.

Compared to classical solutions which can require dedicated hardware and/or specialized data logging systems, the monitoring system we propose allows parallel monitoring of PV plants with different architectures and locations by taking advantage of the intrinsic monitoring capabilities of the inverters and their internet connectivity. The backbone of the system is a software system capable of collecting production measurements and current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve measurements from the inverters within each PV plant. The monitoring software stores the PV measurements in a data warehouse optimized for managing and data mining large amounts of data, from where it can be later visualized, analyzed and exported. By combining PV production measurements data with I-V curve measurements the diagnostic and condition monitoring capabilities of the PV system can be greatly enhanced. The practical implementation and operation of the monitoring system is demonstrated with a study case system deployed at Aalborg University.

A couple of studies have been performed in the last 20 years with the goal of extracting valuable information from the newborns' cry in order to find out valuable information that would normally be obtained from excessive invasive tests or not available at all with current state of the art medical techniques. Among the focuses of the most recent studies, pathologies like asphyxia, hypoxia, hypothyroidism or hearing disorders are investigated to determine correlations between these and features from the cry signal. In this study, a considerable amount of recorded cry signals from newborns' (300 subjects) is studied in order to classify, by the use of data mining techniques. For this classification four categories of newborns' were considered: newborns' with no detected health issues or problems at birth, newborns' that suffered umbilical cord strangulation at birth, premature born babies (before 38 weeks of pregnancy) and newborns' with different pathologies not included in one of the above categories. By the use of data mining techniques (classification trees, decision rules and lazy algorithms) a classification with very good accuracy has been made for the first three of the above mentioned newborn categories.

According to the protein name dictionary and heuristic rules published in related studies, core tokens of protein names can be efficiently detected. However, exact boundaries of protein names are hard to be identified. By regarding tokens of a protein name as items within a transaction, we apply mining associations to discover significant sequential patterns (SSPs) from the protein name dictionary. Based on SSPs, protein name parts are extended from core tokens to left and right boundaries for correctly recognizing the protein name. Based on Yapex101 corpus, Protein Name Recognition System (PNRS) achieves the F-score (74.49%) better than existing systems and papers.

A model should not be used to predict when it encounters unseen data in the scoring set because such predictions would be a guess or a speculation. This paper proposes an algorithm that will produce two simple images and a "level of guessing" (LOG) pie chart. These images will tell the analyst whether or not it is appropriate to use a statistical predictive model to make predictions on a particular scoring set. The proposed algorithm will offer a solution to the scoring adequacy problem based on subsets of the original data. The algorithm will be implemented with a user interface built with MATLAB code, which acts on MySQL databases that contain the data.

It combines two different data mining techniques to retrieve semantically related images: clustering and association rule mining algorithm. At the offline phase of the method, the association rules are discovered between the text semantic clusters and the visual clusters to use it later in the online phase. To evaluate the proposed system, the experiment was conducted on more than 54,500 images of ImageCLEF 2011 Wikipedia collection. The proposed retrieval system was compared to an online system called MMRetrieval and to the proposed system but without using association rules. The obtained results show that our proposed method achieved the best precision and mean average precision.

Although a number of relevant approaches have been proposed in recent years, they incur the problem of producing a large number of candidate itemsets for high utility itemsets. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient algorithm, namely BAHUI (Bitmap-based Algorithm for High Utility Itemsets), for mining high utility itemsets with bitmap database representation. In BAHUI, bitmap is used vertically and horizontally. On the one hand, BAHUI exploits a divide-and-conquer approach to visit itemset lattice by using bitmap vertically. On the other hand, BAHUI horizontally uses bitmap to calculate the real utilities of candidates. Using bitmap compression scheme, BAHUI reduces the memory usage and makes use of the efficient bitwise operation. Furthermore, BAHUI only records candidate high utility itemsets with maximal length, and inherits the pruning and searching strategies from maximal itemset mining problem. Extensive experimental results show that the BAHUI algorithm is both efficient and scalable.

In this context, microarrays are a powerful tool to analyze thousands of gene expression values with a single experiment. A number of approaches have been developed to detecting genes highly correlated to diseases, selecting genes that exhibit a similar behavior under specific conditions, building models to predict disease outcome based on genetic profiles, and inferring regulatory networks. This paper discusses popular and recent data mining techniques (i.e., Feature Selection, Clustering, Classification, and Association Rule Mining) applied to microarray data. The main characteristics of microarray data and preprocessing procedures are presented to understand the critical issues introduced by gene expression values analysis. Each technique is analyzed, and relevant examples of pertinent literature are reported. Moreover, real use cases exploiting analytic pipelines that use these methods are also introduced.

In this paper, a generalized nonlinear classification model based on single Choquet integral is summarized, and a novel generalized nonlinear classification model based on cross-oriented Choquet integrals is presented. Compared to the classification model based on single Choquet integral, a couple of Choquet integral are used to achieve the classification boundaries which can classify data in such situation as one class surrounding another one in a high dimensional space. The classification problems come down to properly specifying the fuzzy measure on which the Choquet integral(s) are defined and the classifying boundaries by which the different classes are separated. The values of these unknown parameters are optimally determined by evolutionary computation. The performance of these models are compared and validated with existed methods on a number of benchmark datasets.

This paper presents a novel approach using association rules for sentiment classification of web reviews. An optimal classification rule set is generated to abandon the redundant general rule with comparatively lower confidence. In the class label prediction procedure, we proposed a new metric named Maximum Term Weight (MTW) for the evaluation of rules and a multiple metric voting scheme to solve the problem when the covered rules are not adequately confident or not applicable. The final score of a test review depends on the overall contributions of four metrics. Experiments on multiple domain datasets from web site demonstrate that the voting strategy obtains improvements on other rule based algorithms. Another comparison to popular machine learning algorithms also indicates that the proposed method outperforms these strong benchmarks.

Various computational tools based on machine-learning and data-mining methods like feature selection/extraction have been proposed to escape the curse of dimensionality in large datasets. Incidentally, evolutionary studies, primarily based on sequentially evolved variations have remained un-facilitated by such advances till date. Here, we present a novel approach of recursive feature selection for hierarchical clustering of Y-chromosomal SNPs/haplogroups to select a minimal set of independent markers, sufficient to infer population structure as precisely as deduced by a larger number of evolutionary markers. To validate the applicability of our approach, we optimally designed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based multiplex to accommodate independent Y-chromosomal markers in a single multiplex and genotyped two geographically distinct Indian populations. An analysis of 105 world-wide populations reflected that 15 independent variations/markers were optimal in defining population structure parameters, such as F-ST, molecular variance and correlation-based relationship. A subsequent addition of randomly selected markers had a negligible effect (close to zero, i. e. 1 x 10(-3)) on these parameters. The study proves efficient in tracing complex population structures and deriving relationships among world-wide populations in a cost-effective and expedient manner.

Recent developments in data mining to extract risk estimates from extensive near- miss records (e.g., alarm databases) are reviewed. Building upon these techniques, the development and application of statistical methods to both predict abnormal events (generally resulting in alarm activations) with leading indicators and to diagnose their special (e.g., root) causes follows. In our view, the goal is to develop and implement techniques and safety systems to better provide plant operators actionable (e.g., valid, timely, non-redundant) information on emerging abnormal situations. These improved techniques should account for today's dynamic operation of process plants, which are more integrated and therefore have increased multivariable interactions that must be taken into account.

The methods considered are applied to the analysis of Earth's surface deformations by GPS and InSAR measurements of ground displacements. Often, the study of earth deformation is limited to the analysis of average strain rates only. It is shown that inclusion of the temporal component of GPS data allows one to find the relationship between seismicity and dynamics of the fields of horizontal surface deformations. Accounting for the temporal component of InSAR data allows identifying urban areas of land, which differ not only in the intensity of deformations process, but also in the type of their dynamics. The methods considered are realized in GIS GeoTime 3 (http://www.geo.iitp.ru/GT3/).

As is known, clustering analysis is one of the most effective tools that are commonly used in data mining. Based on this, in this article, a kernel density estimation based approach is proposed towards the clustering of spatio-temporal trajectories, with the aim to investigate the spatio-temporal clustering of trajectories. In this approach, firstly, the spatio-temporal neighborhood of each trajectory unit is built. Secondly, the trajectory unit sets that are with high densities are extracted in terms of the number of trajectory units their neighborhoods contain. Thirdly, the spatio-temporal kernel density of each trajectory unit is calculated with the Gauss kernel function. What follows next is to search all the density-attracting lines from the extracted trajectory unit sets. Finally, the spatio-temporal clustering of trajectories is executed based on the density-attracting lines, each of which is regarded as the center of a cluster. Last but not least, the feasibility and efficiency of the approach is validated using a real trajectory dataset.

Indirect association rule, a part of ARM, provides a different perspective in identifying the most useful infrequent patterns. Specifically, it refers to the property of high dependencies between two items that are rarely appeared together but indirectly occurred through another items. Besides generating nontrivial information, it also can implicitly reveal a new fact of relationship which cannot be directly determined using the typical interestingness measures. Therefore, in this paper we applied our novel algorithm called Mining Lease Association Rule (MILAR) and our measure called Critical Relative Support (CRS) to mine the indirect least association rule from the students' examination datasets. The experimental results show that the numbers of extracted indirect association rules are reduced when the threshold value of CRS is increased. This number is also lesser than the least association rule. In addition of decreasing the number of uninteresting rules, the obtained information also can be used by educators as a basis to improve their teaching and learning strategies in the future.

Nearly all of these algorithms considered the efficiency of the mining algorithm to survive the increasing size of the data. However, as the dimensionality of the data increases, not only the efficiency but also the effectiveness of traditional mining algorithms is compromised. For instance, clusters hidden in some subspaces are hard to be detected using traditional clustering algorithms, as the dimensionality of the data increases. In this paper, we consider both the huge size, and the high dimensionality of big data by providing a novel solution that presents a three-phase model for subspace stream clustering algorithms. Our novel model, overcomes the huge size of the big data in its first phase, by continuously applying a streaming concept over the huge data objects, and summarizing them into micro-clusters. Then, after each certain batch of data, or after upon a user request, the second phase is applied over the data summarized in micro-clusters, to reconstruct the current distribution of the data out of the current summaries. In the third phase, a subspace clustering algorithm is applied to overcome the high dimensionality of the data, and to find hidden clusters within some subspace. An extensive evaluation study over different scenarios that follow our model over a big data set is performed.

ESPs are sequential patterns whose frequencies increase from one time-stamp dataset to another. ESPs capture emerging trends with time in sequential datasets and they are proposed for trend prediction. This work presents a study on the effectiveness of such predictions made by ESPs. Our experimental results show that, ESPs improve patterns' re-occurrence prediction than frequent patterns, but the improvements are marginal. Further more, we note that both ESPs and frequent patterns do not fare well in predicting the continuous emergence of patterns with time. Hence, we conclude with suggestions on future works that will improve current ESPs definition to enable detect non-trivial and interesting ESPs which can help increase the precision of predicting future emerging patterns with ESPs.

As a basic graph operation, subgraph matching is the foundation of many of these algorithms. Consequently, the efficiency of subgraph matching is very important and determines the speed of the whole data mining process. The development of multi-core CPUs allows subgraph matching algorithms to process multiple data at a time. However, the number of threads is still limited, which has become a bottleneck of these CPU-based algorithms. A workaround is using clusters of powerful servers, which normally incurs very expensive network transfer overhead. Therefore, improving the efficiency and parallel abilities of a single computer is a better idea. One of the most effective way to achieve this is making use of GPUs. With the ability of executing thousands of threads simultaneously, GPUs have a great potential to accelerate the subgraph matching. In this paper, we leverage the power of GPUs and propose an efficient subgraph matching algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by an order of magnitude.

ILP systems may take a long time for analyzing the data mainly because the search (hypotheses) spaces are often very large and the evaluation of each hypothesis, which involves theorem proving, may be quite time consuming in some domains. To address these efficiency issues of ILP systems we propose the APIS (And ParallelISm for ILP) system that uses results from Logic Programming AND-parallelism. The approach enables the partition of the search space into sub-spaces of two kinds: sub-spaces where clause evaluation requires theorem proving; and sub-spaces where clause evaluation is performed quite efficiently without resorting to a theorem prover. We have also defined a new type of redundancy (Coverage-equivalent redundancy) that enables the prune of significant parts of the search space. The new type of pruning together with the partition of the hypothesis space considerably improved the performance of the APIS system. An empirical evaluation of the APIS system in standard ILP data sets shows considerable speedups without a lost of accuracy of the models constructed.

Combination of the Finite Element Method and Data Mining Techniques to Design and Optimize Bearings	INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE SOCO'14-CISIS'14-ICEUTE'14	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on SOCO, CISIS, ICEUTE	JUN 25-27, 2014	Bilbao, SPAIN	IEEE Secc Espana, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Capitulo Espanol, AEPIA, Gobierno Vasco, Diputac Foral Bizkaia, Ayuntamiento Bilbao, MIR Labs, Int Federat Computat Log		Finite Elements Method; Data mining; Design of Experiments; Double-Row Tapered Roller Bearing	KNOWLEDGE	Double-Row Tapered Roller Bearings are mechanical systems widely used in vehicles for the transmission of high load and moderate rotation speeds. These kinds of bearings are designed to withstand high contact stresses on their raceways, which are usually quantified using numerical methods such as the finite element method (FEM). This method has recently been widely used for designing mechanical systems, but has the disadvantage of requiring a high computational cost. The myriad of possible combinations of operating loads on the bearing (preload, radial load, axial load and torque) makes it much harder to calculate the distribution of these contact stresses. This paper shows the results of several regression models built using different Data Mining (DM) techniques that model and optimize the contact ratio obtained from the contact stresses in the outer raceway in Double-Row Tapered Roller Bearings. Firstly, a representative three-dimensional Finite Element (FE) model was generated according to the material properties, geometries and mechanical contacts of all parts which make up the bearing. Subsequently, a design of experiments (DoE) was performed considering four inputs (preload, radial load, axial load and torque), which were simulated in the FE model. Based on the contact stresses obtained from the FE simulations at different operating loads (inputs), a group of regression models (using linear regression (LR), quadratic regression (QR), isotonic regression (IR), Gaussian processes (GP), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and regression trees (RT)) were built to predict the contact ratio which acts on the bearing. Finally, the best combination of operating loads were achieved by applying evolutionary optimization techniques based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) on the best regression models previously obtained. The optimization of the bearing was achieved when the radial loads obtained were the maximum value while the contact ratios were close to 25%.

Improvement in Manufacturing Welded Products through Multiple Response Surface Methodology and Data Mining Techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE SOCO'14-CISIS'14-ICEUTE'14	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on SOCO, CISIS, ICEUTE	JUN 25-27, 2014	Bilbao, SPAIN	IEEE Secc Espana, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Capitulo Espanol, AEPIA, Gobierno Vasco, Diputac Foral Bizkaia, Ayuntamiento Bilbao, MIR Labs, Int Federat Computat Log		Optimization; Welding Process; multiple response surface methodology; Data Mining techniques	GMA WELDING PROCESS	Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an industrial process commonly used in manufacturing welded products. This manufacturing process is normally done by an industrial robot, which is controlled through the parameters of speed, current and voltage. These control parameters strongly influence the residual stress and the strength of the welded joint, as well as the total cost of manufacturing the welded components. Residual stress and tensile strength are commonly obtained via standardized hole-drilling and tensile tests which are very expensive to routinely carry out during the mass production of welded products. Over the past few decades, researchers have concentrated on improving the quality of manufacturing welded products using experimental analysis or trial-and-error results, but the cost of this methodology has proved unacceptable. Likewise, regression models based on Data Mining (DM) techniques have been used to improve various manufacturing processes, but usually require a relatively large amount of data in order to obtain acceptable results. By contrast, multiple response surface (MRS) methodology is a method for modelling and optimizing, which aims to identify the combination of input parameters that give the best output responses with a reduced number of data sets. In this paper, power consumption, cord area, tensile strength and tensile stress were modelled with quadratic regression (QR) models using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and were compared with regression models based on DM (linear regression (LR), isotonic regression (IR), Gaussian processes (GP), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and regression trees (RT)). The optimization of the parameters was conducted using RSM with quadratic regression and desirability functions, and was achieved when the residual stresses and power consumption were as low as possible, while strength and process speed were as high as possible.

We present a traffic analysis attack against over 6000 webpages spanning the HTTPS deployments of 10 widely used, industry-leading websites in areas such as healthcare, finance, legal services and streaming video. Our attack identifies individual pages in the same website with 90% accuracy, exposing personal details including medical conditions, financial and legal affairs and sexual orientation. We examine evaluation methodology and reveal accuracy variations as large as 17% caused by assumptions affecting caching and cookies. We present a novel defense reducing attack accuracy to 25% with a 9% traffic increase, and demonstrate significantly increased effectiveness of prior defenses in our evaluation context, inclusive of enabled caching, user-specific cookies and pages within the same website.

However, there is limited formal or structured guidance for new and complex problem spaces providing criteria for what analytics to use and how they are to be cascaded or integrated to obtain useful results and generate a range of alternate explanations of what is happening now, what is likely to happen soon, and what could happen in the long term. In this paper, we describe sixteen classes of analytics in which we extend previous work by Kaisler and Cioffi-Revilla [7]. We examine some issues and implementation challenges for analytics in the global business environment. We suggest several applications of these analytics to modern business problems and draw several conclusions that lead to further research.

The relationship between net flows is closely related to investor perception of the future and past performance of mutual funds. In order to explore the relationship between investor's perception of ETFs and subsequent net flows, this study is designed to shed light on the multifaceted linkages between fund characteristics and net flows. An international selection of 222 ETFs from one of the top three ETF providers is used in this study, of which fifteen attributes from each fund are used because they are likely to be contributors to fund inflows and outflows. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is used in this study accompanied with machine learning tools to develop a neural network which will forecast a positive or negative flow of net assets for ETFs.

Blood is collected, processed and transported by blood centers to hospitals, though some hospitals also collect blood directly from donors. Blood donation is very safe, but a small percentage of donors can have reactions and some of these reactions can lead to serious injury. Donor hemovigilance is the surveillance and analysis of donor reactions with the goal of understanding the factors influencing reactions and indentifying steps to improve donor safety [9]. Historically in the U. S., donor hemovigilance is managed by individual collection centers to improve their specific organization's donation processes. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has developed a software tool (called DonorHART (TM)) to collect, organize and analyze reactions that occur at different participating blood centers and hospitals [6, 8]. Data mining is used to analyze factors influencing the donor reactions, and the insights are shared with the community to help blood center and hospital managers and quality improvement administrators undertake interventions to improve donor safety [10]. The paper presents the history of the donor hemovigilance development and two data mining efforts performed on the data collected to improve the safety of blood donation processes.

However, existing Flickr trajectory data mining research has not considered mining frequent trajectory patterns whilst also considering the temporal domain. Therefore, a significant opportunity exists to demonstrate the application of a pattern mining algorithm to a large geo-tagged photo dataset. Thus, we present a novel application of the trajectory pattern mining algorithm to a 2012 Flickr dataset of Australia and encompassing state, Queensland. In our experiments we show that many interesting, previously unknown patterns discovered through our framework. Our framework is able to discover expected major landmarks such as cities and tourist attractions. In addition, we make the notable discover of what is theorized to be valuable tourist travel information about sequential movements between hot-spot attractions.

However, several recent approaches struggle under the challenge that only a small fraction of the data is actually provided with precise geo-tags or even GPS information of their origin. In this work we introduce two strategies that are suitable to assign probable locations of origin to social media messages of unknown locations. They are based on aggregated knowledge about the author and/or the textual content of the message. Using our prototype implementation and a collected dataset comprising more than one year of geolocated Twitter data, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. Our results show that we can locate up to 74% of all messages that were written in specific cities and about 20% of messages written in specific districts.

Scratch is primarily used by youth ages 8-16 years to program software like games, animations, and stories; their social interactions take place around commenting, remixing, and sharing computer programs (called projects). This exploratory work contributes to work in educational data mining by broadly describing and comparing comments about projects versus other topics in Scratch. Referencing communication accommodation theory, we found that user comments about projects exhibited different linguistic cues than other comments, and these cues were successfully used to classify comment topic. Further, results also suggest that project comments embody richer language than other comments. This suggests several future avenues for research on youth's online comments about programming and other technical projects that may reveal educational opportunities in creating and sharing projects.

S. the healthcare industry is often plagued by unpaid bills, collection agency fees, and outstanding medical testing costs. All these factors contribute significantly to the rising cost of healthcare. Health care providers often have to treat patients on credit, especially in emergency and trauma cases. Unlike financial institutions health care providers do not collect financial information about their patients. This lack of information makes it difficult to evaluate whether a particular patient-debtor is likely to pay his/her bill. In recent years researchers have started to recognize the potential of data mining methods in improving our understanding of medical bad-debt, but there is relatively little research that examines the effectiveness of data mining methods in classifying bad debt in healthcare. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in classifying bad debt in the healthcare context. The data analysis and evaluation of the performance of the ANFIS model are based on a fairly large unbalanced data sample provided by a healthcare company, in which cases with recovered bad debts are grossly underrepresented. Computer simulation shows that ANFIS is a viable method which produced under some scenarios good classification accuracy. More in-depth interpretation of the results, including nonlinear interaction between various factors, is provided through the analysis of the control surfaces generated by ANFIS and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) charts. Finally the paper also shows the potential of data mining models to classify unknown cases, which are a potential source of revenue recovery.

A key challenge is to tune the HOMO and LUMO energies and the HOMO-LUMO gap for particular applications. Sequence control of monomer order offers the ability to alter these optoelectronic properties, rather than synthesis of complex monomers. A set of over 4,000 sequenced hexamers is studied using stastical data mining of semiempirical quantum chemical calculations and compared to simple particle-in-a-box and Huckel models. The results suggest that conjugated polymers can be effectively tuned by sequence and block-length control in addition to monomer design.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH			English	Article								Nationally, Aboriginal people experience high levels of psychological distress, primarily due to trauma from colonisation. In Victoria, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) provide many services to support mental health. The aim of the present study was to improve understanding about Victorian Aboriginal people and mental health service patterns. We located four mental health administrative datasets to analyse descriptively, including Practice Health Atlas, Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Service (AODTS), Kids Helpline and Close The Gap Pharmaceutical Scheme data. A large proportion of the local Aboriginal population (70%) were regular ACCHO clients; of these, 21% had a mental health diagnosis and, of these, 23% had a Medicare Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP). There were higher rates of Medicare MHCP completion rates where general practitioners (GPs) had mental health training and the local Area Mental Health Service had a Koori Mental Health Liaison Officer. There was an over-representation of AODTS episodes, and referrals for these episodes were more likely to come through community, corrections and justice services than for non-Aboriginal people. Aboriginal episodes were less likely to have been referred by aGP or police and less likely to have been referrals to community-based or home-based treatment. There was an over-representation of Victorian Aboriginal calls to Kids Helpline, and these were frequently for suicide and self-harm reasons. We recommend primary care mental health programs include quality audits, GP training, non-pharmaceutical options and partnerships. Access to appropriate AODTS is needed, particularly given links to high incarcerations rates. To ensure access to mental health services, improved understanding of mental health service participation and outcomes, including suicide prevention services for young people, is needed.

They have a tight relation with the information systems. Our goal is to develop a system to support the diagnosis and the classification of epilepsy in children. Around 50 million people in the world have epilepsy. Epilepsy diagnosis can be an extremely complex process, demanding considerable time and effort from physicians and healthcare infrastructures. Exams such as electroencephalograms and magnetic resonances are often used to create a more accurate diagnosis in a short amount of time. After the diagnosis process, physicians classify epilepsy according to the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9). Physicians need to classify each specific type of epilepsy based on different data, e.g., types of seizures, events and exams' results. The classification process is time consuming and, in some cases, demands for complementary exams. This work presents a text mining approach to support medical decisions relating to epilepsy diagnosis and ICD-9-based classification in children. We put forward a text mining approach using electronically processed medical records, and apply the K-Nearest Neighbor technique as a white-box multiclass classifier approach to classify each instance, mapping it to the corresponding ICD-9-based standard code. Results on real medical records suggest that the proposed framework shows good performance and clear interpretations, albeit the reduced volume of available training data. To overcome this hurdle, in this work we also propose and explore ways of expanding the dataset.

Methods for outlier detection are well-developed, but outliers and classification noise have characteristics different enough to make outlier detection algorithms unsuitable for classification noise detection. In this paper, a new, specialized approach to detect classification noise is proposed, named relative density based classification noise detection (RDBCND). Computational experiments in artificial data sets described herein show that RDBCND has time complexity of O(n log n), indicating greater efficiency than traditional approaches, which exhibit time complexity of at least O(n(2)). The use of classification noise detection to improve the generalization ability of common classifier algorithms is also described. In particular, a new unified approach based on RDBCND is compared to a cross validation approach applied to a BP neural network. Trials in both artificial and real-life datasets show that the RDBCND-based approach can greatly accelerate the process of identifying the best decision function. The novel method can also eliminate underfitting, as the algorithm simply searches for the highest training accuracy. The experiments also show that the RDBCND-based method has greater accuracy and lower cpu time in reaching global solutions than the cross-validation method. Since the relative density is a local concept, our new approach can be directly used in nonlinear datasets without data transformation. It is a great advantage compared to some linear classifier algorithms. As in current linear classifiers, the kernel functions or other transformations need to be used to make them suitable for non-linear datasets, and that will increase their complexity.

Two of them belonged to glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) while the rest belonged to genes in family 3 (GH3). These proteins were then named according to the nomenclature as proposed by the International Union of Biochemistry (IUB), starting from the lowest pI and glycoside hydrolase family. Their properties were predicted using various bionformatic tools showing the presence of domains for signal peptide and active sites. Interestingly, one particular domain, PA14 (protective antigen) was present in four of the enzymes, predicted to be involved in carbohydrate binding. A phylogenetic tree grouped the two glycoside hydrolase families with GH1 and GH3 related organisms. This study showed that the various domains present in these beta-glucosidases are postulated to be crucial for the survival of this fungus, as supported by other analysis.	[Yeo, S.

Features selection is necessary to be adopted to enhance the model performance. A new predicting framework is proposed in this paper which uses complementary fusion of the multilayer features. Several subsets and new features were acquired according to feature factorization and feature construction respectively. The effective features were selected by multilayer complementary fusion which according to the contribution of feature subsets and new features. In this way, the imbalance defects of class distributions can be fixed, prediction accuracy can be improved and system stability can be reinforced. Five data mining models were applied in customer churn. Experimental results demonstrated that the method we proposed could preferably overcome the inelasticity of traditional feature selection algorithms, and more effective than those existing methods in telecommunications industry. Furthermore, we found optimal fusion with prediction model for customer churn prediction in telecommunications industry through exploring the advantages and limitations of each feature subset and prediction techniques.

The main driving factors of urban life water consumption are discussed. By the gray forecasting of the development trends of the main impact factors, a grey prediction of GM (0, N) model on urban life water is established. An instance proves to fit the data better.

Several machine learning approaches have been applied to malware detection, based on different features derived from dynamic analysis of the malware. While these methods demonstrate promise, they pose at least two major challenges. First, these approaches are subjected to a growing array of countermeasures that increase the cost of capturing these malware binary executable file features. Further, feature extraction requires a time investment per binary file that does not scale well to the daily volume of malware instances being reported by those who diligently collect malware. In order to address the first challenge, this article proposed a binary-to-image projection algorithm based on a new type of feature extraction for the malware, was introduced in [2]. To address the second challenge, the technique's scalability is demonstrated through an implementation for the distributed (Key, Value) abstraction in cloud computing environment. Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art malware detection techniques on malware corpus, and the proposed method could be a useful and efficient complement to dynamic analysis.

So an improved IWO-FCM algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm uses the chaos sequence to initialize the initial population in order to improve initial solution (seed) quality, then the crossover, mutation and part selection operation of the differential evolution algorithm are applied in the spatial distribution and selection process of IWO-FCM algorithm to keep the population diversity and enhance global optimization ability. By testing multiple high-dimensional data sets, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher optimization precision than FCM algorithm and IWO-FCM algorithm.

The attributes of the objects within the same cluster should be similar to each other, while the attributes of the objects within different clusters should be different. Most of classical clustering algorithms suffer from such disadvantages as local optima, initial centroid selection and the lack of a way to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, and thus fail to cluster datasets with complex distributions. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm based on artificial immune network with elitist learning (Ocopt-aiNet-EL). Some elaborated operators are implemented for automatic data clustering and the Manifold distance is used for the dissimilarity measure of antibodies. A number of benchmark cases including artificial datasets and real-world datasets are arranged to evaluate the performance of the proposed Ocopt-aiNet-EL algorithm and the other clustering algorithms, such as K-means, EAC and Ocopt-aiNet. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Ocopt-aiNet-EL is an effective and efficient clustering method.

For the ANN's structure selection the modification of COBRA that solves unconstrained optimization problems with binary variables is used. The ANN's weight coefficients are adjusted with the original version of COBRA. For the SVM-based classifier design the original version of COBRA and its modification for solving constrained optimization problems are used. Three text categorization problems from the DEFT'07 competition were solved with these techniques. Experiments showed that all variants of COBRA demonstrate high performance and reliability in spite of the complexity of the solved optimization problems. ANN-based and SVM-based classifiers developed in this way outperform many alternative methods on the mentioned benchmark classification problems. The workability of the proposed meta-heuristic optimization algorithms was confirmed.

This work uses a data mining approach to extract critical event variables from an urban study site that had been operational for a year (August, 2011 - August, 2012). Six applications occurred for four surfaces (driveway, garage door, grass perimeter, and house wall) and one application to the grass lawn following historic and revised practices. A Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) modeling approach was used to statistically model the percent of pyrethroid mass applied (percent washoff) from all surfaces. This approach yielded accurate models for all surfaces, with the driveway surface having the simplest model of percent washoff. The MARS modeling approach allows very dynamic changes in variables to represent complex behavior at the sites integrating many variables to calculate percent washoff. For all surfaces, a near-post application period (around 14 days for all surfaces except the grass lawn, which had an extended multiple month period post application) controlled washoff particularly during low intensity lawn sprinkler events. During natural and simulated rainfall events, the dynamics of washoff included multiple types of characterizing runoff factors (from 10, 20, 30, and 60 mm maximum runoff rates), the rainfall amounts, days since the previous application of a pyretheroid, among other factors. In addition, a number of other often minor factors were included by the MARS models for each surface for the calculation of percent washoff that warrant further investigation.

In this paper, our goal is to present a horror and a success story from the digital world of Social Media, in order to: (a). present a political affiliation profiling method, the Panopticon method, in order to reveal this threat and contribute in raising the social awareness over it. (b). describe an insider threat prediction method by evaluating the predisposition towards law enforcement and authorities, a personal psychosocial trait closely connected to the manifestation of malevolent insiders. The experimental test case of both methodologies is an extensive Greek community of YouTube users. In order to demonstrate our cases, we performed graph theoretic and content analysis of the collected dataset and showed how and what kind of personal data can be derived via data mining on publicly available YouTube data. As both methodologies set user's privacy and dignity at stake, we provide the reader with an analysis of the legal means for each case, so as to effectively be prevented from a privacy violation threat and also present the exceptional cases, such as the selection of security officers of critical infrastructures, where such methodologies could be used.

Additionally, in our data mining experiments we use global probabilistic approximations (singleton, subset and concept). The results of validation of such data, using global probabilistic approximations, were published recently. A novelty of this paper is research on the complexity of corresponding rule sets, in terms of the number of rules and number of rule conditions. Our main result is that the simplest rule sets are induced from data sets in which missing attribute values are interpreted as "do not care" conditions where rule sets are induced using subset probabilistic approximations.

The communities in real-world networks are often overlapped, i.e. some nodes may be a member of multiple clusters. How to uncover the overlapping communities/clusters in a complex network is a general problem in data mining of network data sets. In this paper, a novel algorithm to identify overlapping communities in complex networks by a combination of an evidential modularity function, a spectral mapping method and evidential c-means clustering is devised. Experimental results indicate that this detection approach can take advantage of the theory of belief functions, and preforms good both at detecting community structure and determining the appropriate number of clusters. Moreover, the credal partition obtained by the proposed method could give us a deeper insight into the graph structure.

ARM aims to extract the interesting rules from any given transactional database. This problem is well known to be time consuming in general. This paper deals with association rules mining algorithms to cope with very large databases and especially for those existing on the web. Many polynomial exact algorithms already proposed in literature have shown their efficiency when dealing with small and medium datasets. Unfortunately, their efficiency is not enough for handling the huge amount of data in the web context requiring a real time response. Not surprisingly, some bio-inspired methods seem to be clearly more appropriate. This paper mainly proposes a new ARM algorithm based on an improved version of bees swarm optimisation with three different heuristics for exploring the search area.

A group-specific tuning parameter for hybrid of SVM and SCAD in identification of informative genes and pathways	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						data mining; smoothly clipped absolute deviation; support vector machines; gene selection; bioinformatics	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; INCORPORATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; LUNG-CARCINOMA CELLS; MICROARRAY DATA; CANCER RISK; EXPRESSION; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; POPULATION; LINES	The pathway-based microarray classification approach leads to a new era of genomic research. However, this approach is limited by the issues in quality of pathway data. Usually the pathway data are curated from biological literatures and in specific biological experiment (e. g., lung cancer experiment), context free pathway information collection process takes place leading to the presence of uninformative genes in the pathways. Many methods in this approach neglect these limitations by treating all genes in a pathway as significant. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid of support vector machine and smoothly clipped absolute deviation with group-specific tuning parameters (gSVM-SCAD) to select informative genes within pathways before the pathway evaluation process. Our experiment on canine, gender and lung cancer datasets shows that gSVM-SCAD obtains significant results in identifying significant genes and pathways and in classification accuracy.

However, the main drawback is low yield or productivity of the desired products. Optimisation algorithms are implemented in previous works to identify the effects of gene knockout. Nevertheless, the previous works faced performance issue. Thus, a hybrid of Bees Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis (BAFBA) is proposed in this paper to improve the performance in predicting optimal sets of gene deletion for maximising the growth rate and production yield of certain metabolite. This paper involves two datasets which are E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The list of knockout genes, growth rate and production yield after the deletion are the results from the experiments. BAFBA presents better results compared to the other methods and the identified list may be useful in solving genetic engineering problems.	[Choon, Yee Wen; Mohamad, Mohd.

On the other hand, the position frequencies of the nucleosome-bound and linker DNA reveal most of their statistical properties. Therefore, two methods based on the statistical properties of the DNA sequences are proposed for nucleosome positioning. The first method defines the score profile based on the position-frequency differences of some dinucleotides which are most different in the nucleosome-bound and linker DNAs. Our second method is defined by combining the differences in dinucleotide position frequencies and the periodicity of nucleosome-bound DNAs. Experiment results on Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that our second method outperforms significantly other algorithms in nucleosome positioning performed in our paper. Furthermore, this algorithm also achieves the highest accuracy and F-score on the Simian virus 40 chromatin even if the dinucleotide position-frequency data are extracted from the S. cerevisiae.

Cognitive styles and the use of electronic journals in a mobile context	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Electronic journals; Cognitive styles; Mobile devices; Search behaviour	INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; WEB-BASED INSTRUCTION; LIBRARY USERS; STUDENTS; STRATEGIES; UNIVERSITY; DEVICES; PREFERENCES; RESEARCHERS; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how different cognitive style groups use electronic journals via mobile devices, with an emphasis on the use of search mechanisms, the approaches to judge the relevance and to refine the results, the use of horizontal screens, and on the influence of negative emotions. Design/methodology/approach - Participants' cognitive styles were identified as Holists and Serialists with Ford's Study Preference Questionnaire. The behaviour of the participants interacting with the ScienceDirect was observed and was analysed with both traditional statistics and data mining. Findings - Holists prefer to use multiple searches when undertaking the Expert Search only, which is a complex search mechanism. Conversely, Serialists have a tendency to use multiple searches, irrespective of the complexity of search mechanisms. Additionally, the Expert Search may be helpful for Serialists while the Basic Search seems beneficial to Holists. Regarding the judgement of relevance, Holists tend to use a variety of approaches while Serialists prefer to use a single approach. In general, the major results of this study confirm those of Vilar and Z. umer (2008). Originality/value - The novelty of this study covers two aspects. One is to examine the behaviour of Holists and Serialists in the mobile context of electronic journals and the other is to analyse data with an integrative approach that combines both traditional statistics and data mining. The former contributes to the understandings of how to design mobile electronic journals that can accommodate the needs of different cognitive style groups. The latter can not only strengthen the reliability of the results obtained from traditional statistics, but also discover findings neglected by traditional statistics.

Intelligent data mining of vertical profiler readings to predict manganese concentrations in water reservoirs	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA			English	Article						manganese; reservoir destratification; vertical profiling systems; water reservoirs; water treatment	NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIVER; MODEL; TEMPERATURES; NORMALITY; LAKE	Continuously monitoring and managing manganese (Mn) concentrations in drinking water supply reservoirs are paramount for water suppliers since high soluble Mn loads lead to discoloration of potable water. Despite the Mn level currently being manually sampled throughout the year, in subtropical monomictic lakes such as Hinze Dam, critical Mn concentrations in the epilimnion, where the water is drawn, are typically recorded only during winter lake circulation. A vertical profiling system (VPS) installed can continuously collect physical parameters that determine the transport process of Mn in the lake. Therefore, a long-term historical database gives opportunities for the development of a Mn prediction model. In the present study, VPS and sampling data were collected and analysed, and prediction models applying nonlinear regression techniques and data-driven equations were developed and assessed. They were able to accurately forecast future Mn concentrations from 1 to 7 days ahead and in particular the critical peak concentrations in the epilimnion during the lake destratification. The model also displays the probabilities of the Mn to exceed certain key-thresholds, thus assisting operators in Mn treatment decision-making. Such a tool is very beneficial for the water supplier, since costly and time-consuming water samplings for monitoring Mn concentrations can be avoided, thus relying only on the real time VPS-based model outputs.

Uncertainty is modeled qualitatively by assigning to tuples of data a degree of possibility with which they occur in a relation, and assigning to keys a degree of certainty which says to which tuples the key applies. The associated implication problem is characterized axiomatically and algorithmically. It is shown how sets of possibilistic keys can be visualized as possibilistic Armstrong relations, and how they can be discovered from given possibilistic relations. It is also shown how possibilistic keys can be used to clean dirty data by revising the belief in possibility degrees of tuples.

However, with the rapid growth in the production of online documents, people are facing the problem of information overload. Social bookmarking web sites offer a solution to this by providing push counts, which are counts of users' recommendations of articles, and thus indicate the popularity and interest thereof. In this way, users can use the push counts to find popular and interesting articles. A measure of popularity-based solely on push counts, however, cannot be considered a true reflection of popularity. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors propose to derive the degree of popularity of an article by considering the reputation of the users who push the article. Moreover, the authors propose a novel personalised blog article recommendation approach which combines reputation-based group popularity with content-based filtering (CBF), for the recommendation of popular blog articles which satisfy users' personal preferences. Findings - The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional CBF, item-based and user-based collaborative filtering approaches. The proposed approach considering reputation-based group popularity scores on neighbouring articles indeed can improve the recommendation quality of traditional CBF method. Originality/value - The recommendation approach modifies CBF method by considering the target user's group preferences, to overcome the limitation of CBF which arises from the recommending only items similar to those the user has previously liked. Users with similar article preferences (profiles) may form a group of users with similar interests. A group's preferences may also reflect an individual's preferences. The reputation-based group preferences of the target user's group can be used to complement the target user's preferences.

This proposed crossover method ensures the creation of new biclusters with better quality. To evaluate its performance, an experimental study was done on real microarray datasets.

Recently, several algorithms are proposed to address this problem, and can get acceptable results in most cases. However, the effectiveness of the algorithms for large datasets are often unacceptable. In this paper, we propose a global best artificial bee colony algorithm with an improved solution search equation for minimizing the test cost of attribute reduction. The solution search equation introduces a parameter associated with the current global optimal solution to enhance the local search ability. We apply our algorithm to four UCI datasets. The result reveals that the improvement of our algorithm tends to be obvious on most datasets tested. Specifically, the algorithm is effective on large dataset Mushroom. In addition, compared to the information gain-based reduction algorithm and the ant colony optimization algorithm, the results demonstrate that our algorithm has more effectiveness, and is thus more practical.

Moreover, the data mining algorithms based on these linguistic variables tend to orient themselves based on underlying semantics. This paper describes how to transform a real-world dataset consisting of numeric values using linguistic variables based on possibilistic variables. The transformed dataset is clustered using a recently proposed possibilistic k-modes algorithm. The resulting cluster profiles are semantically accessible with very little numerical analysis.

However, there are some reasons to cause the missing values in real data sets such as difficulties and limitations of data acquisition and random noises. Most of clustering methods can't be used to deal with incomplete data sets for clustering analysis directly. For this reason, this paper proposes a three-way decisions clustering algorithm for incomplete data based on attribute significance and miss rate. Three-way decisions with interval sets naturally partition a cluster into positive region, boundary region and negative region, which has the advantage of dealing with soft clustering. First, the data set is divided into four parts such as sufficient data, valuable data, inadequate data and invalid data, according to the domain knowledge about the attribute significance and miss rate. Second, different strategies are devised to handle the four types based on three-way decisions. The experimental results on some data sets show preliminarily the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Most recent works concerning unsupervised learning have been focused on clustering, showing great potential of ACO-based techniques. This work presents an ACO-based clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach restructures ACOC from a centroid-based technique to a medoid-based technique, where the properties of the search space are not necessarily known. Instead, it only relies on the information about the distances amongst data. The new algorithm, called MACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Partition Around Medoids) and with ACOC. The experiments measure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Size of matrices has been increasing with the development of computational resources and dissemination of big data. Huge matrices are memory- and computational-time-consuming. Therefore, reducing the size and computational time of huge matrices is a key challenge in the data processing area. We develop MOARLE, a novel matrix computation framework that saves memory space and computational time. In contrast to conventional matrix computational methods that target to sparse matrices, MOARLE can efficiently handle both sparse matrices and dense matrices. Our experimental results show that MOARLE can reduce the memory usage to 2% of the original usage and improve the computational performance by a factor of 124x.

Hence, efficient data mining techniques for discovering implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful frequent itemsets from data streams are in demand. Many existing stream mining algorithms capture important stream data and assume that the captured data can fit into main memory. However, problems arise when the available memory is so limited that such an assumption does not hold. In this paper, we present a data structure to capture important data from the streams onto the disk. In addition, we present two algorithms-which use this data structure-to mine frequent itemsets from these dense (or sparse) data streams.

On one hand, although text clustering methods are applicable to classify text data and facilitate data mining work such as information retrieval and recommendation, inadequate aspects are still evident. Especially, most existing text clustering methods provide either a hard partitioned or a hierarchical result, which cannot describe the data from various perspectives. On the other hand, multiple clustering approaches, which are proposed to classify data with various perspectives, meet several challenges such as high time complexity and incomprehensible results while applied to text documents. In this paper, we propose a frequent term-based multiple clustering approach for text documents. Our approach classifies text documents with various perspectives and provides a semantic explanation for each cluster. Through a series of experiments, we prove that our method is more scalable and provides more comprehensible results than traditional multiple clustering methods such as OSCLU and ASCLU while applied to text documents. In addition, we also found that our approach achieves a better clustering quality than existing text clustering approaches like FTC.

Many data mining tasks have been studied on it, among which similarity measure is a basic and important function. Several similarity measures have been proposed in heterogeneous information network. However, they suffer from high computation and memory demand. In this paper, we propose a novel measure, called AvgSim, which can measure similarity of same or different-typed object pairs in a uniform framework and has some good properties. AvgSim value of two objects is evaluated through two random walk processes along the given meta-path and the reverse meta-path, respectively. In addition, we implement AvgSim using MapReduce parallel model in order to enable the application in large-scale networks. Experiments on real data sets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of AvgSim.

From a new perspective, this paper measures and analyzes the user behaviors and regional differences in WMS, based on a big log dataset from the PC clients of a large-scale WMS provider. We give analysis on users' searching times from both macro and micro perspective, and point out that WMS data has a feature of searching behavior prediction, which is absent in other location-based datasets. Then, we observe and verify that the searching frequencies of point of interests in a city conform to Zipf distribution, and explain the underlying physical meanings of the corresponding parameters. In addition, we present a simple and intuitive approach to quantitatively study the inter-city fluidity and intra-city mobility patterns, and give semantic analysis on query categories in each city. And our work can serve as a measurement basis for future work in the area of WMS data mining.

Thus we should capture missing values to make data mining and analysis more accurate. Besides ignoring or setting to default values, many imputation methods have been proposed, but they also have their limitations. This paper proposes a human-machine hybrid workflow to study the missing value filling method with crowdsourcing. First we propose a missing value selection algorithm to select the missing values which are suitable to use crowdsourcing for filling. Then we propose three missing values filling methods according to different attribute types to select answers from crowdsourcing. Experimental results show that our algorithms could improve data quality significantly with low costs.

In digital libraries, summaries can be used as concise descriptions which the user can read for a rapid comprehension of the retrieved documents. Most of the existing approaches rely on the classification algorithms which tend to generate "crisp" summaries, where the phrases are considered equally relevant and no information on their degree of importance or factor of significance is provided. Motivated by this, we present a probabilistic relational data mining method to model preference relations on sentences of document images. Preference relations are then used to rank the sentences which will form the final summary. We empirically evaluate the method on real document images. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This paper focuses on the particular problem of speedy and accurate processing of customs declarations. We present a novel use of graph based spreading activation algorithm for the automated processing of customer declarations for commercial goods, based on supervised learning. This method allows us to build recommender systems for use by customs officers, traders, carriers and insurers. We examine the particular use case of the recommendation to assign or not assign an armed escort to a shipping vehicle in cases of elevated risk of theft. In contrast to the usual risk based approach, this algorithm is trained solely on shipment data rather than on traditional risk indicators. This is useful as the recommendation to customs officials can be explained in terms of the make-up of a shipment and can be verified in real-time. The feasibility of the approach was tested by application to 2500 custom records collected during a continuous period of one month at eight border checkpoints between Russian Federation and two EU countries. The algorithm achieved 100 % accuracy under experimental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One of the important topics is the question of public expenditures and their efficiency. This is applied not only on national but also on the EU level, namely regarding the Cohesion Policy and funding. It is without doubt that evaluating the efficiency of cohesion funding is going to be one of the key elements of the Cohesion Policy implementation in near future. However, to perform proper evaluation and use modern methods it is necessary to have a robust and complex database which allows researchers and policy makers to utilize modern data-demanding methods. Although there are many data sources in the Czech Republic there is no single complex database covering all cohesion expenditure. The data are scattered through various institutions and programs and the outcome is blurred. The intention of this article is to introduce a complex data source concerning cohesion funding in the Czech Republic based on authors' original research. It provides a descriptive statistics and basic statistical analysis of the data which bring quite interesting results regarding the cohesion funding properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These games are very popular and by nature numerical, they provide many tracks that we analyzed in terms of team play. We studied Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), where two teams battle in a game very similar to rugby or American football. Through topological measures area of polygon described by the players, inertia, diameter, distance to the base - that are independent of the exact nature of the game, we show that the outcome of the match can be relevantly predicted.

Such features flow into the diagnostic procedures. Personalized medicine, which aims to optimize clinical decision making by taking individual characteristics of the patients into account, relies on the findings of epidemiology on groups of cohort participants that have common risk factors and exhibit the outcome under study. The identification of such groups requires modeling and exploiting similarity among individuals described through medical tests. In this work, we study how similarity measures for complex objects contribute to class separation for a multifactorial disorder. We present a data preparation, partitioning and classification workflow on cohort participants for the disorder "hepatic steatosis", and report on our findings on classifier performance and identified important features.

In this study, we propose a framework to support clinicians decision making by integrating data from different EHR systems in a common data warehouse and applying data mining techniques to retrieve useful knowledge from patients data. This knowledge is then integrated with clinical guidelines in clinical decision support systems to facilitate decision making. Our framework will enhance the use of patients data in decision making and to encourage the use of clinical guidelines and evidence based medicine.

It has found application in several domains including signal processing and data mining. With the deluge of data faced in our societies, large-scale matrix and tensor factorizations become a crucial issue. Few works have been devoted to large-scale tensor factorizations. In this paper, we introduce a fully distributed method to compute the CPD of a large-scale data tensor across a network of machines with limited computation resources. The proposed approach is based on collaboration between the machines in the network across the three modes of the data tensor. Such a multi-modal collaboration allows an essentially unique reconstruction of the factor matrices in an efficient way. We provide an analysis of the computation and communication cost of the proposed scheme and address the problem of minimizing communication costs while maximizing the use of available computation resources.

Most of the existing works are based on the machine learning method with social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the results learned from some specific dataset may not apply to the future networks, since the social network structure is in a highly dynamic environment. Moreover, the dynamics of information diffusion are also heavily influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic interactions, which is generally ignored by existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks, which focuses on the users' behavior analysis from a microeconomics points of view. We also conduct experiments by using real-world Twitter information diffusion dataset, which shows that the proposed evolutionary game theoretic model is effective and practical in modeling the social network users' information diffusion dynamics.

In contrary to GPS L5 detection approach, the proposed technique utilizes civil GPS L1 signal formats in FSR exploiting GPS as a non-cooperative transmitter. In our previous studies it is shown that the use of the new power GPS signal L5, and the Forward Scattering effect providing a high SNR, at the detector input allows reliably to detect small air targets in conditions of the intense interference. In this paper we propose another approach, to enhance SNR, at the input of the detector in Forward Scattering Radar (FSR). The use of the effective filter (Local Variance Filter) for suppression of intensive sea clutter allows FSR reliably to detect small marine targets emerged in harsh sea clutter, but with GPS L1 signal, whose SNR is very small. At the classification level, the data mining approach is adopted, in which the target feature parameters are extracted from the preliminary filtered signals by utilizing the modified structure of a processor for target detection and parameter estimation in the time domain. Both, the decision tree-based and the neural network classifiers are featured and adapted for real-time implementation. The efficiency of the proposed technique is verified via analytical performance evaluations and experimental demonstrations.

The rationale behind this work is that the autonomic nervous system dynamics, non-invasively quantified through the electrodermal response processing, is altered by the specific mood state. Starting from the hypothesis that bipolar disorders are associated with affective dysfunctions, we processed data gathered from four bipolar patients through eleven experimental trials while an ad-hoc emotional stimulation is administered. Intra-and inter-subject variability were investigated. We show that, using a deconvolution-based approach to estimate sympathetic ANS markers and simple k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, the proposed methodology is able to discern up to three mood states such as depression, hypomania, and euthymia with an average intra-subject accuracy greater than 98% and inter-subject accuracy greater than 82%.

A typical, convex optimization-approach, that is often adopted is to identify a sparse plus low-rank decomposition of the adjacency matrix of the graph, with the (dense) low-rank component representing the clusters. In this paper, we sharply characterize the conditions for successfully identifying clusters using this approach. In particular, we introduce the "effective density" of a cluster that measures its significance and we find explicit upper and lower bounds on the minimum effective density that demarcates regions of success or failure of this technique. Our conditions are in terms of (a) the size of the clusters, (b) the denseness of the graph, and (c) regularization parameter of the convex program. We also present extensive simulations that corroborate our theoretical findings.

The lack of scalable methods for data mining and annotation poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art statistical dialog managers. This paper presents an approach that directly leverage billions of web search and browse sessions to overcome this hurdle. The key insight is that task completion through web search and browse sessions is (a) predictable and (b) generalizes to spoken dialog task completion. The new method automatically mines behavioral search and browse patterns from web logs and translates them into spoken dialog models. We experiment with naturally occurring spoken dialogs and large scale web logs. Our session-based models outperform the state-of-the-art method for entity extraction task in SDS. We also achieve better performance for both entity and relation extraction on web search queries when compared with nontrivial baselines.

Conversely high costs of the end product of Turkish building industry in general show that there is an important problem with the productivity and quality of construction crews. That's why most construction firms begin to realize the need for a detailed research on the factors affecting construction crew productivity. The purpose of this study is thus to classify the factors that affect the productivity of ceramic tiling crews by using data mining methods. To achieve the purpose of our study, a systematic time study was undertaken with ceramic tiling crews in Turkey. Daily productivity values of ceramic tiling crews were collected together with the information related with the factors like the crew size, age and experience of crewmembers. Collected data was classified by using Weka program. The outlier values were first removed from the dataset and decision tree method was used to classify the new dataset. Decision tree method was preferred due to its easiness of use and rapidness in classification. Apriori algorithm, which is the mostly preferred association algorithm in previous studies, was also used to highlight the general trend in the dataset. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Based on Traffic Performance Index (TPI), a dynamic macroscopic index showing the whole area congestion intensity developed in 2007, typical congestion patterns are identified by using clustering method. A comparative analysis is conducted on setting rules for different clustering indexes. TPI pattern curves are derived and verified under combinations of date, transportation demand management policy, holiday, weather condition and etc., according to the actual traffic operational status. The analysis and verification results show that the method used in this paper is effective and feasible. TPI patterns indicate that traffic congestion has inherent characteristics which are primary and essential for transportation managers. This paper lays the foundation for traffic congestion prediction and early warning and proactive alleviation of traffic congestions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Since different life choices are interdependent, transport and land use policies may have influences on people's various life aspects and sequentially on the QOL, and vice versa, which maybe affect transport and land use decisions. To capture such complicated interdependencies, this study applies an exhaustive CHAID approach (a data mining approach), based on a life-oriented analysis. Firstly, the influence of residential and travel behavior on QOL, measured in the form of life satisfaction and happiness is evaluated. Secondly, considering residential choices and travel behavior are a part of people's daily-life behavior (choices), the effects of daily-life behavior on residential and travel behavior are examined in reverse. This study adopted a life choice survey with 900 households collected in Japan in 2010. Analysis results show that the exhaustive CHAID approach is applicable to capture the behavioral interdependencies between residential and travel behavior, as well as QOL. It is confirmed that people's QOL can be greatly shaped by residential and travel behavior jointly.

In order to cover the shortage of the classical association rules optimized algorithm Eclat, this paper proposed and demonstrated that candidate sets which have the project as a prefix or suffix can be pruning calculated for both the properties. Then it proposed optimized method of frequent sets calculation-a method of parallel NEclat combining with cloud programming model. This method can solve the problem that Eclat algorithm cannot be calculated by pruning, and achieve a parallel compute. The practical application showed that, this method can reduce time waste by more than 40%, and it is suitable for the data mining of transport management information association rules.

In the proposed method, the best track datasets in the years 1949 similar to 2012 are used for prediction. Using the method, effective criterions are formed to judge whether tropical cyclones land on Hainan Island or not. The highest probability of accurate judgment can reach above 79%. With regard to TCs which are judged to land on Hainan Island, related prediction equations are established to effectively predict their characteristic factors. Results show that the average distance error is improved compared with the National Meteorological Centre of China.

Commonly, a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is considered as it is the most common form of genetic variations. In the literature, several statistical and data mining methods have been applied to GWA data analysis. In this article, we present a preliminary study where we examine the possibilities of applying biclustering approaches to detect association between SNP markers and phenotype traits. Therefore, we propose a multiobjective model for biclustering problems in GWA context. Furthermore, we propose an adapted heuristic and metaheuristic to solve it. The performance of our algorithms are assessed using synthetic data sets.

For such processes, performance analysis is important and it often targets the time that customers are delayed prior to service. However, this wait time cannot be fully explained by the load imposed on service providers. Indeed, it also depends on resource scheduling protocols, which determine the order of activities that a service provider decides to follow when serving customers. This work focuses on automatically learning resource decisions from events. We hypothesize that queueing information serves as an essential element in mining such protocols and hence, we utilize the queueing perspective of customers in the mining process. We propose two types of mining techniques: advanced classification methods from data mining that include queueing information in their explanatory features and heuristics that originate in queueing theory. Empirical evaluation shows that incorporating the queueing perspective into mining of scheduling protocols improves predictive power.

This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learning with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures.

Increasing amounts of biomedical data provided as LOD consequently offer novel opportunities for knowledge discovery in biomedicine. However, most data mining methods are neither adapted to LOD format, nor adapted to consider domain knowledge. We propose in this paper an approach for selecting, integrating, and mining LOD with the goal of discovering genes responsible for a disease. The selection step relies on a set of choices made by a domain expert to isolate relevant pieces of LOD. Because these pieces are potentially not linked, an integration step is required to connect unlinked pieces. The resulting graph is subsequently mined using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that presents two main advantages. First, the input format compliant with ILP is close to the format of LOD. Second, domain knowledge can be added to this input and considered by ILP. We have implemented and applied this approach to the characterization of genes responsible for intellectual disability. On the basis of this real-world use case, we present an evaluation of our mining approach and discuss its advantages and drawbacks for the mining of biomedical LOD.

The use of redundant, irrelevant, and noisy variables tends to compromise the performance of many statistical tools, leading to unreliable inferences and costly data collection. In this paper, we present a literature review on recent variable selection methods and applications in manufacturing and in the chemometrics field. These methods are deployed into two major categories: variable selection for prediction of continuous response variables and for prediction of a categorical variable (also referred to as classification).

One of the most active parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem was the Silk Road marketplace, in which highly illegal substances and services were traded. It was run by a person who called himself Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR), whose bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars at today's exchange rate. On October 1-st 2013, the FBI arrested a 29 year old person named Ross William Ulbricht, claiming that he is DPR, and seizing a small fraction of his bitcoin wealth. In this paper we use the publicly available record to trace the evolution of his holdings in order to find how he acquired and how he tried to hide them from the authorities. In particular, we trace the amounts he seemingly received and the amounts he seemingly transferred out of his accounts, and show that all his Silk Road commissions from the months of May, June and September 2013, along with numerous other amounts, were not seized by the FBI. This analysis demonstrates the power of data mining techniques in analyzing large payment systems, and especially publicly available transaction graphs of the type provided by the Bitcoin scheme.

It occurs when there is a increase in the normal diameter of the blood vessels by more than 50 percent. Approximately 90 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur infrarenally, but they can also occur pararenally or suprarenally. This is because of some catastrophic outcome. Due to this, the blood flow is exaggerated so the blood hemodynamic interaction forces are affected. Therefore this will tends to wall rupture. To identify the AAA, it is important to identify the blood flow interaction and the wall shear stress. The blood and wall interaction is the wall shear stress. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to get the results for the mechanical conditions within the blood vessels with and without Aneurysms. CFD contains vast computations with Navier Stroke Equations so this will be very time consuming. So to make these CFD computations very efficient, Data mining algorithms are to be used. And also DM algorithms will be a best method to predict the shear stress at the AAA. This will estimate the wall shear stress. There is in need of thousands of CFD runs in a single computer for creating machine learning data so grid computing can be used.	[Kumar, A.

In many real world applications, the number of sources over which this information is fragmented grows at an even faster rate, resulting in barriers to widespread application of data mining. This paper proposes feature selection by using Support Vector Machine is to reduce the computational complexity and increase the classification accuracy of the selected feature subsets and also paper evaluates the approach by comparing it with existing feature selection algorithms over 6 datasets from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning databases. The proposed method shows better results in terms of number of selected features, classification accuracy, and running time than most existing algorithms.

Apriori algorithm is very important algorithm in data mining discipline that enables organizations to mine large amount of historical data that they gather over period of time and discover hidden patterns in that data. Data mining techniques enable organizations to analyze market trends and user behavior. If the data set to be mined is very large then varying the basic algorithm for execution in a distributed environment makes sense because distributed technologies generally offer performance benefits. Grids have gained wide popularity in executing a task in distributed fashion and offer performance benefits. So in this paper we have made an attempt to implement distributed version of basic Apriori algorithm in a grid environment. The Grid environment has been constructed using Globus (R) Toolkit. Experimental results show that distributed version offers performance benefits over basic version of Apriori algorithm and hence is a good implementation choice if the data to be mined is really large and distributed.

However, in many cases, data sets contain unfrequent items that can reveal useful knowledge that most standard algorithms fail to mine. For example, if items are products, it might be that each of the products p(1) and p(2) does not sell very well (i.e., none of them appears frequently in the transactions) but, that selling products p(1) or p(2) is frequent (i.e., transactions containing p(1) or p(2) are frequent). Then, assuming that p(1) and p(2) are similar enough with respect to a given similarity measure, the set {p(1), p(2)} can be considered for mining relevant rules of the form {p(1), p(2)}->{p(3), p(4)} (assuming that p(3) and p(4) are unfrequent similar products such that {p(3), p(4)} is frequent), meaning that most of customers buying p(1) or p(2), also buy p(3) or p(4). The goal of our work is to mine association rules of the form D-1 -> D-2 such that (i) D-1 and D-2 are disjoint homogeneous frequent itemsets made up with unfrequent items, and (ii) the support and the confidence of the rule are respectively greater than or equal to given thresholds. The main contributions of this paper towards this goal are to set the formal definitions, properties and algorithms for mining such rules.

This led to an increase of different type of cyber-crimes. One of the most important is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which someone can unleash through many different isolated hosts and make a system to shut down due to resources exhaustion. The importance of the problem can be easily identified due to the huge number of references found in literature trying to detect and prevent such attacks. In the current paper, a novel method based on a data mining technique is introduced in order to early warn the network administrator of a potential DDoS attack. The method uses the advanced All Repeated Patterns Detection (ARPaD) Algorithm, which allows the detection of all repeated patterns in a sequence. The proposed method can give very fast results regarding all IP prefixes in a sequence of hits and, therefore, warn the network administrator if a potential DDoS attack is under development. Based on several experiments conducted, it has been proven experimentally the importance of the method for the detection of a DDoS attack since it can detect a potential DDoS attack at the beginning and before it affects the system.

The goal is to (1) find groups of samples corresponding to different phenotypes (e.g. disease or normal), and (2) find a subset of genes that can distinguish different groups. Due to the large number of genes and a mass of noise in microarray data, the existing methods are often of some limitations in terms of efficicency and effectiveness. In this paper, we develop an incremental updating based phenotype structure learning algorithm, namely FPLA. With a randomly selected initial state, the algorithm iteratively tries three possible adjustments, i.e. gene addition, gene deletion and sample move, to improve the quality of the current result. Accordingly, four incremental updating based optimization strategies are devised to eliminate the redundancy computations in each iteration. Further, by utilizing a harmonic quality function, it improves the result accuracy by penalizing the "outlier" effect. The experiments conducted on several real microarray datasets show that FPLA outperforms the two representative competing algorithms on both effectiveness and efficiency.

Discovery of hot routes is important to the applications that requiring classifies the traffic flow or profiles the dynamic of the city, such as targeted advertising, traffic management and control. The advances of location-acquisition technologies have led to a huge collection of objects' trajectories in the road network, which give us the chances to finding hot routes conveniently. However, it is difficult to effectively detect hot routes without the support of the available road map. To address this issue, we first develop a Road Network Constructing Algorithm (RNCA) that extract road network from vehicular trajectories using image processing methods, and then propose a Hot Route Inferring Algorithm (HRRA) based on the extracted road network. Meanwhile, a novel road matching operation is also developed to match trajectory points onto roads. We have conducted extensive experiments on real dataset of taxi trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed RNCA and HRRA are both effective and efficient.

Then, we construct some classification models for diagnosing enterprise distress based on RST, using a data mining technique of decision trees with the selected indicators and variables. The empirical results obtained from analysis of enterprise distress indicators, show that financial distress is not only affected by the traditional financial ratios, but also by corporate governance variables. In addition, enterprise distress diagnosis models constructed based on RST and decision trees can effectively diagnose firms in times of crisis. In particular, the RST models are more accurate. This study provides a reference for better understanding the symptoms that might lead to a company's financial crisis in advance and thus provide a valuable reference for investment decision making by stakeholders.

Most of the privacy preserving algorithms are focused on the centralized database. The algorithms on the distributed database are very vulnerable to collusion attack. The Privacy-Preserving data mining algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based on centralized database, and it can be used on the distributed database. The algorithm is divided into two steps in the distributed database. In the first step, the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to get the local Bayesian network structure. The purpose of the second step is getting the global Bayesian network structure by using local ones. In order to protect the data privacy, the secure sum is used in the algorithm. The algorithm is proved to be convergent on theory. Some experiments have been done on the algorithm, and the results prove that the algorithm is feasible.

Dealing with microblog data belongs to big data areas, the premise of which is to obtain a large amount of microblog data for further analysis and data mining. For commercial interests as well as security considerations, the access to the data is becoming increasingly difficult and the API Sina microblog officially provided doesn't support large amount of data mining. In this paper, we try to design a platform that is mainly based on the access mechanism of multistrategy and existing resources to collect data stably from Sina microblog. The results demonstrate that a combination of API and web crawler allows efficient data mining. In such way, sentiment analysis and opinion mining are performed on the data obtained by the multi-strategy method, which proved that the proposed solutions will be allowed to build straightforward application of hot words searching, opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

Current algorithm often depends on the cascading support counting, including the famous apriori algorithm, FP-growth, and some likewise derived algorithms. One thing should be pointed out that in these sorts of algorithms the items with very high support may lead to a poor time performance and very huge useless search space, especially when the items in fact are not the member of the result longest pattern. We reconsider the role of connection between the items and carefully analysis the hidden chains connecting items. Thus a new method of mining the longest pattern in transaction database is proposed in this paper. Our algorithm can have better performance when overcoming the bad side-effect of big-support items, especially in case of the items being not members of the result longest pattern.

It is interesting and challenging to discover meaningful information behind the data. Since the GPS data contains the time information, we take use of the time stamps of the GPS data in this paper for better discovering the places of interest. The collection usually contains large amounts of trajectories, where not every point has information. Therefore, a time stamp clustering algorithm is firstly proposed to reduce the size of raw data and also extract the points with more information. Different clustering algorithms are then conducted on the pre-processed data for extracting the places of interest. Finally, we compare the clustering algorithms on the GPS data by several external validity indexes.

In the past few years, researchers presented different solutions in extending conventional algorithms into uncertainty environment. In this paper, we review previous algorithms and proposed a hybrid solution to mine frequent itemsets from uncertain databases. The new scheme bases on traditional Eclat algorithm and mines frequent itemsets under the definition of frequent probability. Furthermore, the hybrid solution exerts fuzzy mining and precise mining adaptively according to the characters of the candidate databases, which addresses the problem of tradeoff between computation and accuracy. We tested our solution on a number of uncertain data sets, and compared it with the well known uncertain frequent itemsets mining algorithms. The experimental results show that our solution is efficient and accuracy.

In this paper, we aim to produce a knowledge discovery approach to extract a set of rules from a dataset for automatic knowledge base construction using cooperative approach between a multi-intelligent agent system and a domain expert in a particular domain. The proposed system consists of several intelligent agents, each one has a specific task. The main task is assign to associative classification mining intelligent agent to deal with a database directly for rules extraction using Classification Based on Associations (CBA) rule generation and classification algorithm, and send them to a domain expert for a modification process. Then, the modified rules will be saved in a knowledge base which is used later by other systems (e.g. knowledge-based system). In other words, the aim of this work is to introduce a tool for extracting knowledge from database, more precisely this work has focused on produce the knowledge base automatically that used rules approach for knowledge representation. The MIAKDD is developed and implemented using visual Prolog programming language ver. 7.1 and the approach is tested for a UCI heart diseases dataset.	[Kadhim, Mohammed Abbas; Alam, M.

Among the classes of derived knowledge, sequential patterns can be used to discover customer behaviors to facilitate efficient decision-making. The fast updated frequent-pattern (FUFP)-tree algorithm has been proposed to efficiently mine frequent itemsets through transaction insertion in incremental mining. The present study extends this algorithm to develop an incremental fast updated sequential-pattern (FUSP)-tree algorithm for efficiently handling sequential patterns whether the newly inserted transactions are from customers already in the database or from new customers. An FUSP-tree structure is designed to make the update process easier. The FUSP-growth algorithm is proposed for mining frequent sequences (sequential patterns) from the FUSP-tree. Experimental results show that the proposed FUSP-tree algorithm has good performance for incrementally handling newly inserted transactions.

In this paper, we introduce a new resampling approach based on Clustering with sampling for Multiclass Imbalanced classification using Ensemble (C-MIEN). C-MIEN uses the clustering approach to create a new training set for each cluster. The new training sets consist of the new label of instances with similar characteristics. This step is applied to reduce the number of classes then the complexity problem can be easily solved by C-MIEN. After that, we apply two resampling techniques (oversampling and undersampling) to rebalance the class distribution. Finally, the class distribution of each training set is balanced and ensemble approaches are used to combine the models obtained with the proposed method through majority vote. Moreover, we carefully design the experiments and analyze the behavior of C-MIEN with different parameters (imbalance ratio and number of classifiers). The experimental results show that C-MIEN achieved higher performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Through literature review, it was possible to observe that the missing data mechanisms are not always considered when methods of treatment or imputation are chosen. This work presents a review about the main treatment methods of missing data that can be considered in a process of knowledge discovery in database. We emphasize that attention should be given to the identification of the absence mechanism, for the choice the most appropriate treatment method.

Time is measured in terms of the number of database scans required to produce all frequent itemsets. Space is consumed by the number of potential frequent itemsets which will end up classified as not frequent. To overcome both limitations, namely space and time, we propose a novel approach for generating all possible frequent itemsets by introducing a new representation of items into groups of four items and within each group, items are assigned one of four prime numbers, namely 2, 3, 5, and 7. The reported results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our approach satisfies scalability in terms of number of transactions and number of items.

The method contributes to so-called semantic data mining, a data mining approach where domain ontologies are used as background knowledge, and where the new challenge is to mine knowledge encoded in domain ontologies, rather than only purely empirical data. The authors have developed a tool that implements this approach. Using this the authors have conducted an experimental evaluation including comparison of our method to state-of-the-art approaches to classification of semantic data and an experimental study within emerging subfield of meta-learning called semantic meta-mining. The most important research contributions of the paper to the state-of-art are as follows. For pattern mining research or relational learning in general, the paper contributes a new algorithm for discovery of new type of patterns.

Case-based Reasoning (CBR) solves problems using the already stored knowledge, and captures new knowledge, making it immediately available for solving the next problem. Therefore, case-based reasoning can be seen as a method for problem solving, and also as a method to capture new experience and make it immediately available for problem solving. Therefore, CBR can mine sparse and big data. It can be seen as a learning and knowledge-discovery approach, since it can capture from new experience some general knowledge, such as case classes, prototypes and some higher-level concept. In this talk, we will explain the case-based reasoning process scheme. We will show what kinds of methods are necessary to provide all the functions for such a computer model. We will develop the bridge between CBR and Statistics and show how case-based reasoning can mine big and sparse data. Examples are being given based on multimedia applications. Finally, we will show recent new developments and we will give an outline for further work. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm makes use of a specialized data structure, called DiSE-tree, for effectively and efficiently representing relevant information on diverse social entities while successfully supporting the mining phase. Diverse entities are popular in a wide spectrum of application scenarios, ranging from linked Web data to Semantic Web and social networks. In all these application scenarios, it has become important to analyze high volumes of valuable linked data and discover those diverse social entities. We complement our analytical contributions by means of an experimental evaluation that clearly shows the benefits of our tree-based diverse social entity mining algorithm. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Tightening upper bounds to the expected support for uncertain frequent pattern mining	KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATION & ENGINEERING SYSTEMS 18TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, KES-2014	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Annual International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems (KES)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Gdynia, POLAND	Gdynia Maritime Univ, KES Int	Pomeranian Sci & Technol	Data mining; data structure; expected support; frequent pattern mining; knowledge discovery; tree-based mining; uncertain data	ITEMSETS	Due to advances in technology, high volumes of valuable data can be collected and transmitted at high velocity in various scientific and engineering applications. Consequently, efficient data mining algorithms are in demand for analyzing these data. For instance, frequent pattern mining discovers implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge about relationships among frequently co-occurring items, objects and/or events. While many frequent pattern mining algorithms handle precise data, there are situations in which data are uncertain. In recent years, tree-based algorithms for mining uncertain data have been developed. However, tree structures corresponding to these algorithms can be large. Other tree structures for handling uncertain data may achieve compactness at the expense of loose upper bounds on expected supports. In this paper, we propose (i) a compact tree structure for capturing uncertain data, (ii) a technique for using our tree structure to tighten upper bounds to expected support, and (iii) an algorithm for mining frequent patterns based on our tightened bounds. Experimental results show the benefits of our tightened upper bounds to expected supports in uncertain frequent pattern mining. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effectively and efficiently mining frequent patterns from dense graph streams on disk	KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATION & ENGINEERING SYSTEMS 18TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, KES-2014	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Annual International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems (KES)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Gdynia, POLAND	Gdynia Maritime Univ, KES Int	Pomeranian Sci & Technol	Data mining; frequent pattern mining; graph streams; knowledge-based and intelligent information & engineering systems; knowledge discovery; limited memory; stream mining		In this paper, we focus on dense graph streams, which can be generated in various applications ranging from sensor networks to social networks, from bio-informatics to chemical informatics. We also investigate the problem of effectively and efficiently mining frequent patterns from such streaming data, in the targeted case of dealing with limited memory environments so that disk support is required. This setting occurs frequently (e.g., in mobile applications/systems) and is gaining momentum even in advanced computational settings where social networks are the main representative. Inspired by this problem, we propose (i) a specialized data structure called DSMatrix, which captures important data from dense graph streams onto the disk directly and (ii) stream mining algorithms that make use of such structure in order to mine frequent patterns effectively and efficiently. Experimental results clearly confirm the benefits of our approach. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In supervised classification, several approaches were proposed such as: Induction of Decision Tree and Formal Concept Analysis. The learning of formal concepts is generally based on the mathematical structure of Galois lattice (or concept lattice). The complexity of Galois lattice generation limits the application fields of these systems. In this paper, we discuss about supervised classification based on Formal Concept Analysis and we present methods based on concept lattice or sub lattice. We propose a new approach that builds only a part of the lattice, including the best concepts (i.e pertinent concepts). These concepts are used as classifiers in parallel combination using voting rule. The proposed method is based on Dagging of Nominal Classifier. Experimental results are given to prove the interest of the proposed method. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we proposed a variety of rule-based greedy algorithms that able to obtain knowledge contained in a given dataset as a series of inhibitory rules containing an expression "attribute not equal value" on the right-hand side. The main goal of this paper is to determine based on rule characteristics, rule length and coverage, whether the proposed rule heuristics are statistically significantly different or not; if so, we aim to identify the best performing rule heuristics for minimization of rule length and maximization of rule coverage. Friedman test with Nemenyi post-hoc are used to compare the greedy algorithms statistically against each other for length and coverage. The experiments are carried out on real datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. For leading heuristics, the constructed rules are compared with optimal ones obtained based on dynamic programming approach. The results seem to be promising for the best heuristics: the average relative difference between length (coverage) of constructed and optimal rules is at most 2.27% (7%, respectively). Furthermore, the quality of classifiers based on sets of inhibitory rules constructed by the considered heuristics are compared against each other, and the results show that the three best heuristics from the point of view classification accuracy coincides with the three well-performed heuristics from the point of view of rule length minimization.

A hybrid structure, the Smart Experience-based Knowledge Analysis System (SEKAS), is put forward in this paper to address issues of knowledge management and use. SEKAS combines a set of experience knowledge structures (SOEKS) with multiple techniques to provide a comprehensive knowledge management approach capturing, discovering, reusing and storing knowledge for the users. The SEKAS integrates a novel Decisional DNA (DDNA) knowledge structure with the traditional web crawler technologies. DDNA, as a knowledge representation platform, can help deal with noisy and incomplete data, with learning from experience, and with making precise decisions and predictions in vague and fuzzy environments. The paper outlines the investigation of the combination of DDNA and feature selection algorithms to guarantee the future performance for prediction. The proposed approaches are general and extensible in terms of both designing novel algorithms, and in the application to other domains. The SEKAS integrates the evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, using experience that is derived from a former decision event, to improve the evolutionary algorithm's ability to find optimal solutions rapidly and efficiently. The SEKAS application to solve a travelling salesman's problem shows that this new proposed hybrid model can find optimal or close to true, Pareto-optimal solutions in a fast and efficient way.

In this paper, we present a sports data mining approach, which helps discover interesting knowledge and predict outcomes of sports games such as college football. Our approach makes predictions based on a combination of four different measures on the historical results of the games.

These factors are identified on the basis of an internal database of a production enterprise and further used to estimate the duration of phases in product development projects. In the paper, some models and methodologies of the knowledge discovery process are compared and a method of knowledge acquisition from an internal database is proposed. The presented approach is dedicated to industrial enterprises that develop modifications of previous products and are interested in obtaining more precise estimates for project planning and scheduling. The example contains four stages of the knowledge discovery process including data selection, data transformation, data mining, and interpretation of patterns. The example also presents a performance comparison of intelligent systems in the context of variable reduction and preprocessing. Among data mining techniques, artificial neural networks and the fuzzy neural system are chosen to seek relationships between the duration of project phase and other data stored in the information system of an enterprise.

The aim of this work is to develop an expert system's architecture with data mining tools for solving the problem of technical exploitation of marine diesel engines based on fragmented, unreliable and possibly inaccurate information. The architecture of such expert system allows moving from normal monitoring to "information monitoring" in the specialized intelligent human-machine systems. Application of data mining technology allows optimizing database processing queries that retrieve the required information from the actual data in order to detect important patterns. An approach based on data mining and fuzzy logic in the expert system is shown on an example of solving technical exploitation of marine diesel engines problem.

Based on the concept of lean software development we propose an idea of lean data science research as a technology for data analysis software development. This concept includes the mandatory stages of the life cycle that meet the lean manufacturing principles. We have defined the business understanding stage with defining the targeted questions, the set of lean data analysis sprints and a decision support stage. Each lean data analysis sprint contents of the task statement step, a step of data integration, a step of data analysis and the interpretation of the results. This approach allows to build data analysis software with iterative improvement quality of the results. Some case study have been suggested as examples of the proposed concept.

Radiosensitivity is the relative susceptibility of cells, tissues, organs or organisms to the harmful effect of radiation. Effects of radiation include the mutation of DNA specialy in genes responsible for DNA repair. Identification of polymorphisms and genes responsible for an organisms' radiosensitivity increases the knowledge about the cell cycle and the mechanism of radiosensitivity, possibly providing the researchers with a better understanding of the process of carcinogenesis. To obtain this results, mathematical modeling and data mining methods were used.

Inspired by the Kullback-Leibler Divergence theory and the TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) measure, we propose a suspiciousness factor to rank potentially faulty transitions on the error traces in time Petri net models. This approach is illustrated using a best case execution time property case study, and then further assessed for its efficiency and effectiveness on an automated deadlock property test bed.

Rapid prototyping of DWs is necessary when OLAP applications are complex. Some work about the integration of Data Mining and OLAP systems has been done to enhance OLAP operators with mined indicators, and/or to define the DW schema. However, to best of our knowledge, prototyping methods for DWs do not support this kind of integration. Then, in this paper we present a new prototyping methodology for DWs, extending [3], where DM methods are used to define the DW schema. We validate our approach on a real data set concerning bird biodiversity.

Pairwise constraints such as must-link and cannot-link are used in order to improve clustering properties. This paper proposes a new type of semi-supervised hard and fuzzy c-means clustering with assignment prototype term. The assignment prototype term is based on the Windham's assignment prototype algorithm which handles pairwise constraints between objects in the proposed method. First, an optimization problem of the proposed method is formulated. Next, a new clustering algorithm is constructed based on the above discussions. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through numerical experiments.

This approach solely relies on the usage of the learning resources and does not consider their content or the relations between the users and the resources. In order to cluster the resources, we calculate higher-order co-occurrences, a technique taken from corpus-driven lexicology where it is used to cluster words based on their usage in language. We first outline how we adapt the approach to then present an extensive evaluation that shows the effects of the clustering. Finally, we show how the resulting clusters can be used to enhance recommender systems.

In this paper, we show how we utilized an online mathematics homework system where students simply provided final answers to exercises. We then asked, "What can we infer about the cognitive state of the student if they gave an incorrect response?" Through data mining techniques, we found we were able to ascribe a particular type of mechanical error or misconception to 60-75% of the incorrect responses learners made on the subset of problems we analyzed. As such, we illustrate methods for extracting this data to discover knowledge components embedded in an exercise, expose item bias, and reveal learners' cognitive states.

Materials discovery strategies have afforded numerous new dyes; yet, corresponding solution-based DSC device performance has little improved upon 11% efficiency, achieved using the N719 dye over two decades ago. Research on these dyes has nevertheless revealed relationships between the molecular structure of dyes and their associated DSC efficiency. Here, such structure-property relationships have been codified in the form of molecular dye design rules, which have been judiciously sequenced in an algorithm to enable large-scale data mining of dye structures with optimal DSC performance. This affords, for the first time, a DSC-specific dye-discovery strategy that predicts new classes of dyes from surveying a representative set of chemical space. A lead material from these predictions is experimentally validated, showing DSC efficiency that is comparable to many well-known organic dyes. This demonstrates the power of this approach.

The malware apps cause serious security and privacy concerns, such as accessing/leaking sensitive information, sending messages to the paid numbers, etc. Like traditional analysis and detection approaches for desktop malware applications, there have been many proposals to apply machine learning techniques to detect malicious apps. However unlike classical desktop applications, Android apps available on the "Google Play" [1] have a feature in "category" of app. In this initial work, we propose and investigate the possibility of improving the efficiency of machine learning approach for android apps by exploiting the category information. Experiment results performed over a large dataset, are encouraging which shows the effectiveness of our simple yet productive approach.

The misuse of this technique may disclose the database owner's sensitive information to others. Hence, the privacy of individuals is not maintained. Many of the researchers have recently made an effort to preserve privacy of sensitive knowledge or information in a real database. In this paper, we have modified EMHS Algorithm to improve its efficiency by using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. We have used ElGamal Cryptography technique of ECC for homomorphic encryption.

As a result, microblog search has emerged as a new option for covering user information needs, especially with respect to timely events, news or trends. However users are frequently overloaded by the high rate of produced microblogging posts, which often carry no new information with respect to other similar posts. In this paper we propose a method that helps users effectively harvest information from a microblogging stream, by filtering out redundant data and maximizing diversity among the displayed information. We introduce microblog posts-specific diversification criteria and apply them on heuristic diversification algorithms. We implement the above methods into a prototype system that works with data from Twitter. The experimental evaluation, demonstrates the effectiveness of applying our problem specific diversification criteria, as opposed to applying plain content diversity on microblog posts.

Optimizing a fuzzy inference system, however, presents some special challenges for the developer because of the imprecision that is inherent to fuzzy sets. This paper expands upon an earlier development of a fuzzy framework, adding components for dynamic self-optimization. What makes this approach unique is the use of relational database as a computational engine for the memetic algorithm and fitness function. The new architecture combines the power of fuzzy logic with the special properties of a relational database to create an efficient, flexible and self-optimizing combination. Database objects provide the fitness function, population sampling, gene crossover and mutation components allowing for superior batch processing and data mining potential. Results show the framework is able to improve the performance of a working configuration as well as fix a non-working configuration.

Determining subjects which user is looking at or controlling the operation of computer processes can serve as examples of these areas. However, making eye movement signal valuable requires some preparatory steps to be taken. They belong to a process called calibration aiming at creating a model for mapping output delivered by an eye tracker to user's gaze points. The quality of such model is assessed based on a calibration error defined as a difference between accurate data and this obtained from a model. The goal of the research presented in the paper was to analyse to what extent the calibration error depends on the specific participant's features - it is repeatable - or to what extent it may be avoided during the recalibration. Additionally an influence of two calibration method a polynomial and an artificial neural network (ANN) on the final results were studied as well.

Mining undecimated Wavelet Transform maxima lines: An effective way to denoise Partial Discharge signals	2014 ELECTRICAL INSULATION CONFERENCE (EIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)	JUN 08-11, 2014	Philadelphia, PA	IEEE, IEEE Dielectr & Elect Insulat Soc		partial discharges; measurement; denoising; wavelets; data mining		On-site and on-line partial discharge (PD) measurements are well recognized as difficult tasks due to the large scale and diversity of interferences usually encountered in high voltage facilities. Several techniques have been proposed in literature to improve test conditions on the field, based either on analog and digital approaches. More recently, wavelets and their derivatives have shown to be very effective for the processing of PD signals due to their potential to identify transient, time-localized signals. This paper presents the development and results of a new technique to denoise PD signals based on data mining concepts applied to Undecimated Wavelet Transform (UWT) modulus maxima lines propagation. The theory of modulus maxima lines is introduced and their use is justified as an effective way to identify and localize PD pulses. The UWT was employed as a way to increase robustness against the effects of decimation, which is a characteristic of the orthogonal Wavelet Transform that causes random losses of PD pulses. We took advantage of the improved UWT capability to recover signals by using a modified version of the cycle spinning approach. Denoising was performed by separating the maxima lines related to PDs from those related to noise, followed by reconstruction using the inverse UWT. Separation was achieved by the use of data mining tools. The performances of several algorithms were evaluated and compared, including investigations regarding statistically divergent noise types, effects of data pre-processing like normalization and cleansing, procedures for training and comparisons of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Results obtained for both simulated and measured PD signals confirm that the approach is superior when compared to standard linear filters and non-linear wavelet-based techniques. This is particularly noticeable when processing non-stationary time-localized interferences, a situation in which these techniques fail completely.(1)	[Khamseh, Hossein B.; Ruela, Victor S.

This data is very useful in making valuable medical decisions. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools to discover hidden relationships in data. The objective of this research is to mine the historical unstructured data of heart patients and to extract significant features and patterns. This work is based on a large amount of unstructured data in the form of patients medical reports collected from a renowned cardiac hospital in Pakistan. Firstly data preparation is done in which the unstructured (textual) data of heart patients is converted to structured (tabular) form and then pre-processed to make it suitable to apply different data mining techniques. After data preprocessing, unsupervised learning strategy is used in which K-Means clustering technique is applied to find out clusters in data which are further used to extract hidden patterns related to heart patients. These patterns can then be used for heart condition prediction besides helping medical practitioners in making intelligent verdicts. Finally, performance evaluation of k-Means with other clustering algorithms is done and results are compared.

An associator is a numerical measure of how closely associated two objects should be. Ensemble methods integrate information from multiple solutions to generate superior solutions. A simple evolutionary algorithm to quickly locate multiple biclusterings of synthetic test data. The good submatrices of these biclusterings are then used as associators. Associators are accumulated across many runs of the evolutionary algorithm to create a master association matrix. This matrix is then used, via simultaneous hierarchical clustering, to create a final ensemble biclustering. Results are presenting on tuning the evolutionary algorithm as well as for the overall biclustering algorithm. The algorithm correctly locates planted clusters in the data, providing proof of concept for the ensemble technique. The technique is modular with the evolutionary algorithm, fitness function, and ensemble integration technique all easily swapped for other techniques.

However, various accessible meta-data are associated with every message. Taking into account these meta-data, they can be very useful for analysis and making decisions. Applying OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) and data mining technologies on large volumes of tweets is a challenge that would allow the extraction of information and knowledge such as user behavior, new emerging issues, trends...

However, new tendencies in digital marketing are focusing on added interactivity, where the use of games as a marketing tool is not new. Moreover, the portion of population engaged in social networks is quickly increasing, turning these into preferred targets for marketing actions, considering the potential of retrieving valuable personal, demographic and geographic data. Forwarding recent advances in data mining and knowledge extraction to this model would therefore turn it into a powerful tool to measure the impact of marketing and branding actions, while reinforcing marketing strategy. In this paper we present GameFoundry, a new online platform that aims at creating an innovative Web Game Engine and Game Distribution system, which will provide support for knowledge management and game activity monitoring based on simple network games. It is intended to give the users the possibility of playing games in several environments, platforms and social networks, and to provide the clients of this product the ability to create, independently, a set of games with proprietary contents, distribute them over the network and have constant access to game activity, statistics and advanced user profiling, collective behavior and predictive models.

To adapt to such conditions, sensor networks often adopt machine learning techniques to eliminate the need for unnecessary redesign. Machine learning also inspires many practical solutions that maximize resource utilization and prolong the lifespan of the network. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review over the period 2002-2013 of machine learning methods that were used to address common issues in WSNs. The advantages and disadvantages of each proposed algorithm are evaluated against the corresponding problem.

This paper describes a program that can assist in tactical coaching for table tennis by extracting and analyzing video data of a table tennis game. The here described application automatically extracts essential information from a table tennis match, such as speed, length, height and others, by analyzing a video of that game. It then uses the well known machine learning library "Weka" to learn about the success of a shot. Generalization is tested by using a training and a test set.

A banded pattern in zero-one data is one where the attributes (columns) and records (rows) are organized in such a way that the "ones" are arranged along the leading diagonal. The significance is that rearranging zero-one data so as to feature bandedness enhances the operation of some data mining algorithms that work with zero-one data. The fact that a dataset features banding may also be of interest in its own right with respect to various application domains. In this paper an effective banding algorithm is presented designed to reveal banding in 2D data by rearranging the ordering of columns and rows. The challenge is the large number of potential row and column permutations. To address this issue a column and row scoring mechanism is proposed that allows columns and rows to be ordered so as to reveal bandedness without the need to consider large numbers of permutations. This mechanism has been incorporated into the Banded Pattern Mining (BPM) algorithm proposed in this paper. The operation of BPM is fully discussed. A Complete evaluation of the BPM algorithm is also presented clearly indicating the advantages offered by BPM with respect to a number of competitor algorithms in the context of a collection of UCI Datasets.

This problem is commonly found in classification task of data mining. Among the proposed solutions, the cost-based Class Distribution Estimation (CDE) shows the best performance in coping with difference in class distribution between train and test datasets. However there is still some problem, as CDE lost its performance when there is too much change in class distribution. In this paper, CDE-weight is proposed to reduce the impact of high change in class distribution. The idea is to use many models suitable with many class distributions along with dynamic weighting method that adjusts weight of each model according to its class distribution. Experimented results indicate that CDE-Weight methods are able to reduce the impact of misestimating and improve the classifier performance when train and test data are different.

To avoid these phenomena, various Representation learning algorithms are used as a first key step in solutions of these tasks to transform the original high-dimensional data into their lower-dimensional representations so that as much information about the original data required for the considered Data Mining task is preserved as possible. The above Representation learning problems are formulated as various Dimensionality Reduction problems (Sample Embedding, Data Manifold embedding, Manifold Learning and newly proposed Tangent Bundle Manifold Learning) which are motivated by various Data Mining tasks. A new geometrically motivated algorithm that solves the Tangent Bundle Manifold Learning and gives new solutions for all the considered Dimensionality Reduction problems is presented.

The aim of anomaly detection is to detect instances in a dataset that are remarkably different from the rest of the population. Knowledge about such anomalies is of immense practical value, such as for detection of fraud in financial transactions, for finding faulty equipment in industrial plants, and for detection of security breaches in a computer systems etc. In this paper we propose a new technique for identifying anomalies in numerical datasets. It is based on a metric for data points called the Cohesiveness-Based Outlier Factor (CBOF). CBOF determines the outlier-ness score of a data point, which numerically represents how well integrated a data point is within its neighborhood. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate that our method performs favorably when compared with another popular method for anomaly detection.

Over the past decade these algorithms were designed to mostly work with human assistance to extract characteristic, aligned patterns of equal length and scaling. Human assistance is not cost-effective. We propose our shotgun distance similarity metric that extracts, scales, and aligns segments from a query to a sample time series. This simplifies the classification of time series as produced by sensors. A time series is classified based on its segments at varying lengths as part of our shotgun ensemble classifier. It improves the best published accuracies on case studies in the context of bioacoustics, human motion detection, spectrographs or personalized medicine. Finally, it performs better than state of the art on the official UCR classification benchmark.

Traditional sequential patterns mining has its focus on mining frequently occurring sub-sequences. However, a number of applications motivate the search for more structured patterns, such as protein motif mining. This paper builds on the original idea of structural relation patterns and applies the Concurrent Sequential Patterns (ConSP) mining approach in bioinformatics. Specifically, a new method and algorithms are presented using support vectors as the data structure for the extraction of novel patterns in protein sequences. Experiments with real-world protein datasets highlight the applicability of the ConSP methodology in protein data mining. The results show the potential for knowledge discovery in the field of protein structure identification.

AMD is one of the leading causes of blindness in people aged over 50 years. The proposed approach is founded on the concept of a uniform 3D image decomposition into a set of sub-volumes where each sub-volume is described in terms of a "spatial gradient" histogram, which in turn is used to define a set of feature vectors (one per sub-volume). Feature selection is conducted using the maximum sum of the squared values of each feature vector for each sub-volume. After that, a "coding-pooling" framework is applied so that each image is represented as a single feature vector. The "coding-pooling" framework generates a representative subset of feature vectors called a dictionary, and then use this dictionary as a guide for the generation of a single feature vectors for each volume. Experiments conducted using the proposed approach, in comparison with range of alternatives, indicated that the approach outperformed other existing methods with an accuracy of 95.2%, sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 94.6%.

In turn, this knowledge may bring huge benefits to the healthcare management and leverage the healthcare system in all aspects. In the last decade, data mining has been widely applied to this domain and several approaches, technology and methods were developed for improving decision support. Despite the advances in healthcare mining, the characteristics of these data - complexity, volume, high dimensionality, etc. - still demand more efficient and effective techniques. In this work we present a case study on the healthcare domain. We propose to use a multi-dimensional model of the hepatitis dataset and to apply a multi-dimensional data mining algorithm to find all patterns in the database. These patterns are then used to enrich classification and results show a significant improvement on prediction.

Real-time tissue elastography (RTE), a recently developed method of ultrasound elastography, can be used to assess liver fibrosis noninvasively but the overlap between fibrosis stages limits its ability to assess liver fibrosis adequately when used alone. Methods: A multicenter collaborative study involving 542 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis who were scheduled to undergo liver biopsy compared the image features obtained from RTE image analysis, the liver fibrosis index (LFI), and pathological diagnosis. RTE and a blood test were performed on the same day as the liver biopsy. Data mining was also performed to construct a decision tree, and its diagnostic performance for assessing liver fibrosis was evaluated. Results: The LFI was higher in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) than in those with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). When a decision tree was constructed by data mining of RTE and serological findings, the diagnostic accuracy was very high for all fibrosis stages, with respective rates at F1, F2, F3, and F4 of 94.4, 54.1, 38.7, and 81.3% for patients with CHC and of 97.1, 50.0, 43.8, and 80.6% for patients with CHB. Conclusions: The variation in LFI values between the different etiologies appears to reflect the difference in the development style of liver fibrosis. The decision tree for assessing liver fibrosis constructed by data mining of both RTE and serological findings had a high diagnostic performance in assessing liver fibrosis and shows promising clinical utility.

Distinguishing the nuances between adjective synonyms is vital to linguistic understanding of a language, but WordNet currently does not encode the relative intensities of adjective synonyms that lie on the scale. Sheinman & Tokunaga (2009) proposed a solution of constructing Adjective Scales by data mining a web corpus. However, this process suffers from some limitations, most notably that of False Positives, which inaccurately suggest that adjective X is more or less intense than Y. This paper classifies the types of false positives that Sheinman's method generates, then proposes a method to diminish the quantity of these false positives using linguistic searches in WordNet.

However, to effectively fulfill user information needs, systems must be able to "look beyond" exactly matching data sources and offer information from additional/contextual sources (data source contextualization). For this, users should be involved in the source selection process - choosing which sources contribute to their search results. Previous work, however, solely aims at source contextualization for "Web tables", while relying on schema information and simple relational entities. Addressing these shortcomings, we exploit work from the field of data mining and show how to enable Web data source contextualization. Based on a real-world use case, we built a prototype contextualization engine, which we integrated in a system for searching the Web of data.

Unfortunately, the large volume and great heterogeneity of available open data requires significant integration steps before it can be used in applications. A promising technique to explore such data is the use of association rule mining. We introduce two algorithms for enriching Rdf data. The first application is a suggestion engine that is based on mining Rdf predicates and supports manual statement creation by suggesting new predicates for a given entity. The second application is knowledge creation: Based on mining both predicates and objects, we are able to generate entirely new statements for a given data set without any external resources.

Researchers are also broadening the range of environments within which these constructs are assessed. In this study, we develop sensor-free affect detection for EcoMUVE, an immersive multi-user virtual environment that teaches middle-school students about casualty in ecosystems. In this study, models were constructed for five different educationally-relevant affective states (boredom, confusion, delight, engaged concentration, and frustration). Such models allow us to examine the behaviors most closely associated with particular affective states, paving the way for the design of adaptive personalization to improve engagement and learning.

To avoid the costs and inconvenience of administering personality questionnaires, researchers have inferred author personality from their writings. Extending such methods will enable marketing, interface adaptation, and a variety of data mining applications. The proposed program of research examines elements of syntax, addressing the following questions: does authors' usage of English grammatical structures reflect their personalities? What methodology extracts and predicts personality from grammar usage? Key to this approach is the use of locally defined grammatical structures as described by Part of Speech n-grams.

However, the clustering of text data is still in early stage, because the research focused so far on the case of quantitative or categorical data. In this paper we propose a new method for improving the clustering accuracy of text data. Our method encodes the string values of a dataset using Huffman encoding algorithm, and declares these attributes as integer in the cluster evaluation phase. In the experimental part, we compared the cluster label assigned by the proposed method to each instance of the dataset with its real category, and we obtained a better clustering accuracy than the one found with traditional methods. This method is useful when the dataset to be clustered has only string attributes, because in this case, a traditional clustering method does not recognize, or recognize with a low accuracy, the category of instances.

The decision tree is one of the well-known data mining methods. In general, a decision tree can be grown so as to have zero error on the training data set. If there is any noise in the data set or it does not completely cover the decision space, then over-fitting occurs and the tree needs to be pruned in order to accurately generalize the test data set. In this paper, we propose a pre-pruning method with majority and minority properties for the decision tree. It uses two kinds of qualifying criteria to consider whether the ration of the highest class of a subtree is the majority of the subtree or a minority of the overall tree. New measures for these are added to the classifier with the extended data expression. Experiments show that a classifier using this pruning method can improve classification accuracy as well as reduce the size of the tree.

Therefore an algorithm which should be fast and deduce good result is needed. About it, a decision tree algorithm is much useful in the field of data mining or machine learning system for the problem of classification. However sometimes according to several reasons, a decision tree may have leaf nodes which are made of only noise data or include noise data. Therefore it should be excluded from a decision tree. Because those weak leaves is provided wrong results. This paper proposes a method using a classifier, UChoo, for solving a classification problem, and suggests how to exclude weak leaves as foreknow it whether each leaves is weak or not in decision tree. And, the experiment shows a gradient of the performance of a classifier, Uchoo, by changing the threshold for deciding between acceptable leaves and unacceptable leaves.

For example, data streams carry a characteristic that data vary by time, and there is probably concept drift in this type of data. Concept drifts can be categorized into sudden and gradual concept drifts in brief. Most of research only can solve one type of concept drift. However, in the real world, a data stream probably has more than one type of concept drift, and the type is usually difficult to be identified. In light of these reasons, we propose a new weighting method which can adapt more quickly to current concept than other methods and can improve the accuracy of classification on data streams with concept drifts.

In this paper, we aim to look at the patient appointment process as the hospital is experiencing high volume of "no shows". "No shows" have a high impact on longer appointment lead time for patients, poor patient satisfaction and loss of revenue for hospital. We use data analytics to identify pattern of "no shows", develop a statistical model to predict the probability of "no shows" and finally operationalizing the model to embed the analytics solution in the business process to reduce the number of "no shows" in the hospital. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used to find out the major causes of no shows based on patient demographic information, patient appointment detail and SMS reminder response. Data mining techniques such as logistic regression and recursive partitioning were used on training, test and validation data to predict patients who have high probability of "no show". We present the analytical outcomes and findings from our model. Our logistic regression model could predict around 70% of the "no show" cases correctly with a Kappa coefficient of 0.41 on validation data. Based on our fmding, we have recommended different strategies to the operations staff for possible reduction of no show slots.

These techniques are proving much more effective to overcome the limitations of the traditional in-vitro experiments on the constantly increasing sequence data. However, most critical problems that caught the attention of the researchers may include, but not limited to these: accurate structure and function prediction of unknown proteins, protein subcellular localization prediction, finding protein-protein interactions, protein fold recognition, analysis of microarray gene expression data, etc. To solve these problems, various classification and clustering techniques using machine learning have been extensively used in the published literature. These techniques include neural network algorithms, genetic algorithms, fuzzy ARTMAP, K-Means, K-NN, SVM, Rough set classifiers, decision tree and HMM based algorithms. Major difficulties in applying the above algorithms include the limitations found in the previous feature encoding and selection methods while extracting the best features, increasing classification accuracy and decreasing the running time overheads of the learning algorithms. The application of this research would be potentially useful in the drug design and in the diagnosis of some diseases.

Through the experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our GPU algorithm is quite faster than CPU programs and the speedup becomes much evident when the graph size is enlarged.

To verify the performance of the approach described in the following sections, we used a set of news. Text sources are considered high-dimensional data, where each word is treated as a single variable. In our work, a linear predictor model has been used to uncover the most influential variables, reducing strongly the dimension of the data set. Input data is classified in two categories; arranged as a collection of plain text data, pre-processed and transformed into a numerical matrix containing around 10,000 different variables. We adjust the linear model's parameters based on its prediction results, the variables with strongest effect on output survive, while those with negligible effect are removed. In order to collect, automatically, a summarized set of features, we sacrifice some details and accuracy of the prediction model, although we try to balance the squared error with the subset obtained.

However, most existing methods do not provide sufficiently scalable solutions. Thus, we propose a new technique, C-Mine, which combines two scalable techniques, data mining and SAT solving, to provide scale-up solutions. Data mining can efficiently extract patterns from an enormous data set, and SAT solving is famous for its scalable verification. The experimental results show that, compared to a recent publication, C-Mine can achieve compatible performance with an additional 5% energy savings, and 50x speedup for bigger benchmarks on average.

In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi-and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4-84x and 18-47x speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, run on a top of the line NVIDIA k20x GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.

However, batteries are expensive and have a limited life time. Having a deep understanding of how batteries operate in working situations is crucial to designing advanced control mechanisms. Battery performance and life time is highly dependent on how it is used and also on environmental working conditions. While batteries have been extensively studied through model-based approaches, there is no previous work about modeling behavior based on data analytic methods. In this paper, we propose an integrated data-driven framework to study the behavior of battery systems in a grid, based on data mining techniques. The proposed method provides a high level characterization of battery behavior and online parameter estimation using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. This work can be used in intelligent control systems and would help administrators to know what is happening inside a battery system.

We have extended the model of dynamical systems to analyze vehicles' temporal behaviors of both travel direction and rotational direction. By using this method, a symbol sequence was obtained for each trip. Therefore we could apply various data mining method to the obtained sequences. As for the first trial, a clustering method was applied to the sequences and characteristic segments to know the events happened on the vehicles were successfully found.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many biomedical applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration. These lead to strong data dependency, operation dependency, and hardware dependency, and sometimes ad hoc solutions that cannot be generalized to a broader scope. In this talk, I will present some open challenges faced by data scientist in biomedical fields and the current approaches taken to tackle these challenges.

However, the research of managing and retrieving these data efficiently is still in the development stage. The conventional tag-based searching approaches suffer from noisy or incomplete tag issues. As a result, the content-based multimedia data management framework has become increasingly popular. In this research direction, multimedia high-level semantic concept mining and retrieval is one of the fastest developing research topics requesting joint efforts from researchers in both data mining and multimedia domains. To solve this problem, one great challenge is to bridge the semantic gap which is the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features. Recently, positive inter-concept correlations have been utilized to capture the context of a concept to bridge the gap. However, negative correlations have rarely been studied because of the difficulty to mine and utilize them. In this paper, a concept mining and retrieval framework utilizing negative inter-concept correlations is proposed. Several research problems such as negative correlation selection, weight estimation, and score integration are addressed. Experimental results on TRECVID 2010 benchmark data set demonstrate that the proposed framework gives promising performance.

FastICA algorithm has a faster and more robust convergence speed than the traditional ICA algorithm. But its recovery results are not satisfied. Inspired by various successful applications of kernel and spectral clustering methods in machine learning and data mining community, probability density function of the source signal is estimated by the FSS-kernel algorithm, and then to restore the blind separation of mixed signals, FastICA algorithm is used, the negative entropy is the objective function. The simulation results show that the signal aliasing could be separated effecti- vely by this method. It is proved that the method has higher separation accuracy and adaptive capacity, by contrasting with the traditional ICA algorithms and FastICA algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive naive Bayes tree (NBTree) algorithm for scaling up the classification accuracy of multi-class classification problems, which considers the attributes that are used in the decision tree for the calculation of the naive assumption of class conditional independence. The NBTree is a hybrid classifier of decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers. In NBTree nodes contain and split as regular decision tree, but the leaves are replaced by naive Bayes classifier. We tested the performance of proposed algorithm against those of the existing decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the classification accuracy of real life challenging multi-class problems.

In real-time streaming environments concepts of instances might change at any time such as weather predictions, astronomical and intrusion detection etc. To address this issue, we present an adaptive ensemble classifier for data streams classification, which uses a set of decision trees for mining complex noisy instances in data streams. The ensemble model updates automatically so that it represents the most recent concepts in data streams. In each iteration, the ensemble model generates a new training data from original training dataset, then builds a decision tree using new training data and assigns a weight to the tree based on its classification accuracy on original training instances. Also it updates the weight of training instances in training dataset. We tested the performance of the proposed ensemble classifier against that of existing C4.5 decision tree classifier using real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results prove that the proposed ensemble classifier shows great flexibility and robustness in data streams classification.

Combined S-transform and Data-Mining Based Intelligent Micro-Grid Protection Scheme	2014 STUDENTS CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING AND SYSTEMS (SCES)			English	Proceedings Paper	Students Conference on Engineering and Systems (SCES)	MAY 28-30, 2014	Allahabad, INDIA	IEEE, Edutech, IEEE MNNIT Allhabad Student Branch		Distributed generations; S-transform; decision tree; fault detection; fault classification		The paper presents a combined S-transform and decision tree based intelligent scheme for fault detection and classification in the micro-grid. The proposed method preprocesses the faulted current signals using S-transform to extract differential statistical features at the ends of the respective feeder, which are used to build decision tree based data-mining model for final relaying decision. One cycle post fault current samples of each phase from fault inception at bus-ends of the respective feeder are used to derive differential features. The differential features are used to train the three decision trees to provide fault detection, fault detection in different operating mode and fault class associated in the fault process. The algorithm is tested on simulated fault data with wide variations in operating parameters of the power system and the extensive test results indicate that the proposed intelligent relaying scheme can reliably provide protection measure for micro-grid with different modes of operation.

As a working group we have carried out a research project, for many years now, on the themes about 3D survey; in particular we are testing the use of mathematical algorithms and programs as an additional tool, in the surveying photogrammetric process, for data mining and interpretation. Among our working experience related to archaeological survey we present a test on the use of the software Mathematica for new data processing on Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii. In particular we develop some algorithms which allows the semi-automatic extraction of the sections as well as planar surfaces contours and texture mappings (masonry walls, plaster or fresco walls, mosaic floors).

Its purpose is to discover useful information and knowledge from large databases for business decisions and other areas. One engineering topic of data mining is utility mining which discovers high-utility itemsets. An itemset in traditional utility mining considers individual profits and quantities of items in transactions regardless of its length. The average-utility measure is then proposed. This measure is the total utility of an itemset divided by the number of items. Several mining algorithms were also proposed for mining high average-utility itemsets (HAUIs) from a transactional database. However, the number of generated candidates is very large since an itemset is not a HAUI, but itemsets generated from it and others can be HAUIs. Some effective approaches have been proposed to prune candidates and save time. This paper proposes a new method to mine HAUI from transaction databases. The advantage of this method is to reduce candidates efficiently by using HAUI-Tree. A new itemset structure is also developed to improve the speed of calculating the values of itemsets and optimize the memory usage.

In our study, we employed RFNN to find out the correlation between the climate data and the runoff of Srepok River in Vietnam and then to model and predict the runoff of Srepok River in the current, as well as in the future. In order to prove the advantage of RFNN, we compare RFNN with an environmental model called SWAT on the same dataset. We conduct experiments using the climate data and the daily river's runoff data that have been collected in 22 years, ranging from 1900 to 2011. The experiment results show that the relative error of RFNN is about 0.35 and the relative error of SWAT is 0.44. It means that RFNN outperforms SWAT. Moreover, the most important advantage of RFNN when comparing with SWAT is that RFNN does not need much data as SWAT does.

First of all we discuss a method useful for spectra analysis - analytical programming and its implementation. Our goal is to create mathematical formulas of emission lines from spectra, which are characteristic for Be stars. One issue in performing this task is symbolic regression, which represents the process in our application, when measured data fits the best represented mathematical formula. In past this was only a human domain; nowadays, there are computer methods, which allow us to do it more or less effectively. A novel method in symbolic regression, compared to genetic programming and grammar evolution, is analytic programming. The aim of this work is to verify the efficiency of the parallel approach of this algorithm, using CUDA architecture. Next we will discuss parallel implementation of random decision forest (RDF) to classify huge amounts of various spectra. The mathematical formulas obtained via AP will be used to reduce attributes of explored spectra. Our goal is to propose scalable algorithm for classification of such data, which will preferably need only one pass over data, while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Later we will try to create module compatible with VO and DAta Mining and Exploration project.

A striking malware is obfuscation malware that is very difficult to detect. This kind of malware can create new variants that are similar to original malware feature but different about code. In order to deal with such types of malware, many approaches have been proposed, however, some of these approaches are ineffective due to their limited detection range, huge overheads or manual stages. Malware detection based on signature, for example, cannot overcome the obfuscation techniques of malware. Likewise, the behavior-based methods have the natural problems of a monitoring system such as recovery costs and long-lasting detection time. In this paper, we propose a new method (semantic set method) to detect metamorphic malware effectively by using semantic set (a set of changed values of registers or variables allocated in memory when a program is executed). For more details, this semantic set is analyzed by n-gram separator and Naive Bayes classifier to increase detection accuracy and reduce detection time. This system has been already experimented on different datasets and got the accuracy up to 98% and detection rate almost 100%.

Forty-five college swimmers attached the newly developed chest band sensor unit, which has a triple-axes accelerometer inside, and then performed a controlled interval training set with four stroke styles. The authors identified swimmer's states, such as the swimming/rest phases and the start, turn and goal touch events by using the trunk longitudinal acceleration (Ay). With the inductive inference based on the experimental results and the deductive inference based on the empirical rule on the interval training brought the estimation of the swimming time. For the classification of the swimming strokes, using the extracted swimming phase acceleration, the mean, variance and skewness of each bout were calculated. The authors compared different data mining algorithms for the stroke style classification with these descriptive statistics, such as mean, variance, skewness on the each axial acceleration as the independent variables and stroke styles as the depending variable. The accuracy of the stroke style classification by both the multi-layered neural network (NN) and the C4.5 decision tree were 91.1%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A case-comparison study of automatic document classification utilizing both serial and parallel approaches	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SYMPOSIUM 2013 (HPCS 2013)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	High Performance Computing Symposium (HPCS)	JUN 02-06, 2013	Ottawa, CANADA					A well-known problem faced by any organization nowadays is the high volume of data that is available and the required process to transform this volume into differential information. In this study, a case-comparison study of automatic document classification (ADC) approach is presented, utilizing both serial and parallel paradigms. The serial approach was implemented by adopting the RapidMiner software tool, which is recognized as the world-leading open-source system for data mining. On the other hand, considering the MapReduce programming model, the Hadoop software environment has been used. The main goal of this case-comparison study is to exploit differences between these two paradigms, especially when large volumes of data such as Web text documents are utilized to build a category database. In the literature, many studies point out that distributed processing in unstructured documents have been yielding efficient results in utilizing Hadoop. Results from our research indicate a threshold to such efficiency.	[Wilges, B.; Bastos, R.

This is due to the societal importance of the field and also the particular computational challenges posed in this domain of data mining. Early researches concentrated on sequential heuristics and later moved to meta-heuristic approaches due to the ability of these approaches to generate better solutions. The aim of this paper is to introduce the basic principles of a new meta-heuristic algorithm called Electromagnetism-like Mechanism (EMag) for neural network training. EMag simulates the electromagnetism theory of physics by considering each data sample to be an electrical charge. For neural network, EMag simulates the attraction-repulsion mechanism of each weight connection as charge partials to move towards the optimum without being trapped into local minimum. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in 12 of benchmark classification problems, and the computational results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the standard back propagation algoritlun.

Companies are using this tool to further understand their customers, to design targeted sales and marketing campaigns, to predict what product customers will buy and the frequency of purchase, and to spot trends in customer preferences that can lead to new product development. In this paper, we conduct a systematic approach to explore several of data mining techniques in business application. The experimental result reveals that all data mining techniques accomplish their goals perfectly, but each of the technique has its own characteristics and specification that demonstrate their accuracy, proficiency and preference.

However the effective methods for concept drift detection are seldom used in visual tracking in which drifting problems appear frequently. In this paper, we present a novel framework combining concept drift detection with an online semi-supervised boosting method to build a robust visual tracker. The main idea is converting updated templates to a data stream by similarity learning and detecting concept drift. The proposed tracker is both robust against drifting and adaptive to appearance changes. Numerous experiments on various challenging videos demonstrate that our technique achieves high accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Criterion-referenced assessment (CRA) attempts to determine students' score by comparing their achievements with a clearly stated criterion for learning outcomes. Scoring rubrics are usually used in CRA. The aim of this paper is on the use of Fuzzy ART to group students with scores from CRA, via scoring rubrics. Such approach is useful to assist instructors to establish a personalized learning system, to promote effective group learning, and to provide adaptive contents, for engineering education. In this paper, the applicability of Fuzzy ART-based approach is demonstrated with a real case study relating laboratory project assessment in Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, with positive results obtained. This paper contributes to a new application of an incremental learning neural network with no prefixed number of clusters required, i.e., Fuzzy ART, to engineering education.

So, depending on our available budget, from all unlabeled instances we are to select only a subset of them to ask the oracle for manual labeling. Thus, the query strategy, i.e., how relevant instances are selected to be sent to the oracle, plays an important role in active learning. Though active learning is a very established research area, only a few research works have been done on it in the context of stream data mining. Active learning for stream data is more challenging than for static data because the repetition of queries is not feasible as revisiting the data is almost impossible. In this paper, we propose two augmented query strategies for active learning in stream data mining, namely, Margin Sampling with Variable Uncertainty (MSVU) and Entropy Sampling with Uncertainty using Randomization (ESUR). These two strategies are derived and improved from the existing methods of Variable Uncertainty (VU) and Uncertainty using Randomization (UR) respectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed MSVU and ESUR strategies by comparing them against the original VU and UR on 6 different datasets using two base classifiers: Leveraging Bagging (LB) and Single Classifier Drift (SCD). Experimental results show that our proposed strategies offer promising outcomes for various datasets and detecting concept drift in the data.

This extensive use of SMS puts oil into fire of competition between different telecom companies. Only the one who manages to make subscribers believe "We care for you" can survive, obviously keeping company's own benefits and profits in mind. This research paper presents a technique to effectively design and develop smart SMS packages by using contextual information of SMS data. It also deals with the prediction of multiple patterns about subscriber's behaviour by using subscribers demographic and timing information.

These aspects are crucial for the management of any organizational entity. This work proposes a Data Mining (DM) approach in order to identify relevant data about patients' management to provide decision makers with important information to fundament their decisions. During this study it was developed 48 DM models. These models were able to make predictions in the hospital environment about beds tournover/patients discharges. The development of predictive models was conducted in a real environment with real data. In order to follow a guideline, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was adopted. The techniques used were the Regression Tree (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to perform regression tasks. Regression models were able to predict patient's discharges with Relative Absolute Error (RAE) lower than 100% -]38.26; 96.89[. Significant results were achieved when evaluated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) -]0.619; 4.030[ and Mean Squared Error (MSE) -]0.989; 34.432[. The use of these models can contribute to improve the hospital bed management because forecasting patient discharges makes possible to determine the number of beds available for the subsquent weeks.

The Mining Associations with Secrecy Konstraints (MASK) algorithm and its improved versions were proposed as data mining approaches for privacy preserving association rules. The MASK algorithm only adopts a data perturbation strategy, which leads to a low privacy-preserving degree. Moreover, it is difficult to apply the MASK algorithm into practices because of its long execution time. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on data perturbation and query restriction (DPQR) to improve the privacy-preserving degree by multi-parameters perturbation. In order to improve the time-efficiency, the calculation to obtain an inverse matrix is simplified by dividing the matrix into blocks; meanwhile, a further optimization is provided to reduce the number of scanning database by set theory.

Some limitations are exposed when traditional association rule mining algorithms are used to deal with large-scale data. In the Apriori algorithm, scanning the external storage repeatedly leads to high I/O load and brings about low performance. As for FP-Growth algorithm, the effectiveness is limited by internal memory size because mining process is on the base of large tree-form data structure. What's more, although remarkable achievements have been scored, there are still problems in dynamic scenarios. The paper presents a parallelized incremental FP-Growth mining strategy based on MapReduce, which aims to process large-scale data. The proposed incremental algorithm realizes effective data mining when threshold value and original database change at the same time. This novel algorithm is implemented on Hadoop and shows great advantages according to the experimental results.

Using the Collective Intelligence of Sports Fans to Improve Professional Football League Customer Service	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 IEEE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK IN DESIGN (CSCWD)	International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	MAY 21-23, 2014	Hsinchu, TAIWAN	IEEE, Natl Tsing Hua Univ, IEEE Systems, Man, & Cybernet Soc		Sports marketing; critical incident techniques; text mining; cluster analysis; collective intelligence		This research investigates sports fans' emotions and feelings toward a professional football game as a unique event offering related services, crowd interactions, performances, incidences, and outcomes. Critical incident surveys (open-ended, written text dialogues) were used to identify the most salient positive and negative phrases used to express football fans' game experiences. The key term frequencies were first analyzed using text and data mining techniques to form the ontological base (with a focus on emotions, feeling, and events); second by building a theory based ontology tree structure; and third by experts abstracting the dialogues into consistent key terms and phases related to a formal ontology structure. The collective intelligence of 37 Green Bay Packers fans' emotions, feelings, event related incidences, and outcomes were mapped to the derived ontology schema which in turn was re-submitted to the text mining algorithms. The ontology based, collective findings depicts the Green Bay Packers fans' deep opinions. Given the structured text data results, clusters form a theoretical base for creating initial causal models for future verification. The initial research provides a new means for effectively improving professional sports services, particularly in defining the interrelation of feelings, emotions, events, and the related object properties.

However, social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc.) provide a more economically more viable opportunity for these new companies to directly communicate with their potential customers. Social networks are significant marketing communication tools for established, and in particular, start-up companies. Some FB Pages contain hundreds of responses and receive good opinions from the readers whereas some Pages do not. By interpreting these Pages, it is possible to generate the key factors that attract customers and for the young entrepreneurs to react to new postings. Text mining the Pages helps to better understand and manage their Pages and build a closer relationship with the target audience. This research proposes an analytical process to interpret the dialogue between young entrepreneurs and their audience of Facebook Pages. First, collect consumer feedback from social networks, like FB. The interpretation of the dialogues into meaningful statistics, especially when attempting to model, cluster, and analyze the critical elements of posted Internet content, requires new text analysis techniques and methodologies. CKIP (Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing) is applied to extract the key phrases from the Chinese language dialogues. Then clustering is used to generate the critical points that customers care about and then to explore key factors that attracts customers and resolves their needs. Therefore, entrepreneurs better understand how to post an interesting topic to strengthen their marketing communications and increase their market share.

Among the reported overlapping clustering algorithms, OClustR is the one showing the best trade-of between quality of the clusters and efficiency, in the task of document clustering; however, it has a quadratic computational complexity so it could be less useful in applications dealing with a very large number of documents. In this paper, we propose two parallel versions of the OClustR algorithm, specifically tailored for GPUs and multi-core CPUs, which enhance the efficiency of OClustR in problems dealing with a very large number of documents. The experimental evaluation over standard document collections showed the correctness and good performance of our proposals.

Most of them require that a pattern and its occurrences are identical, thus, they rely on solving the graph isomorphism problem. In the last years, however, some algorithms have focused in the case in which label and edge structure differences between a pattern and its occurrences are allowed but maintaining a bijection among vertices, using inexact matching during the mining process. Recently, an algorithm that allows structural differences in vertices was proposed. This feature allows it to find patterns missed by other algorithms, but, do these extra patterns actually contain useful information? We explore the answer to this question by performing an experiment in the context of unsupervised mining tasks. Our results suggests that by allowing structural differences in both, vertices and edges, it is possible to obtain new useful information.	[Flores-Garrido, Marisol; Ariel Carrasco-Ochoa, Jesus; Fco.

It is recognized that the big data challenge can only be adequately addressed when knowledge of various different fields such as data mining, machine learning algorithms, parallel processing, and data management practices are effectively combined. This paper thus describes some of the 'smart data analytics methods' that enable a high productivity data processing of large quantities of scientific data in order to enhance the data analysis efficiency. The paper thus aims to provide new insights how various fields can be successfully combined. Contributions of this paper include the concretization of the cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISPDM) process model in scientific environments using concrete machine learning algorithms (e.g. support vector machines that enable data classification) or data mining mechanisms (e.g. outlier detection in measurements). Serial and parallel approaches to specific data analysis challenges are discussed in the context of concrete earth science application data sets.

E-learning systems are mostly unadapted to mobile platforms because they do not use responsive web design and progressive enhancement based on browser, device or feature detection. This paper presents the evolutionary cycle, current status and potential development of new platforms for e/m-learning in higher education. Educational computer games that serve as a motivational element in e/m-learning are presented, as well as the data structures that can complement the existing models of e/m-learning. The University of Rijeka uses MudRi e-learning system, which is based on Moodle open source software. This system collects data on the activity of participants in the educational process, which is suitable for data mining. A preliminary research on the correlation between the activity in forum discussions and the course pass or fail grade is carried out. The possibility of using data mining based on the data structure of the Moodle system and the models of e/m-learning and learning through play is described, aiming at finding optimal ways of learning and optimal learning results. Finally, a model of integrated system user interaction on which our future research will be based is presented.

The application of data mining (DM) methods on learning system logs is often used as a basis of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have the ability for automatic adaptation of some aspect of the learning process. Such a system was developed at our institution in the previous years and has been used in a number of courses. To improve our system we added an integration application to create a continuous feedback loop with a DM tool. Our goals, from the student's perspective, are to improve the quality of knowledge acquired by students as well as shorten the learning time by offering recommendations based on mined patterns of learning paths through the knowledge domain. From the perspective of teachers, our goal is to create a rich data visualization system (in the form of a Web application using standard Web technologies to create visualizations) to give them new insight into students' behaviours. In this paper we present the structure of our system and the research design that will be used to verify its results.

The goal is to provide the interested researcher with all the important pros and cons regarding the use of a particular tool. A comparison of the implemented algorithms covering all areas of data mining (classification, regression, clustering, associative rules, feature selection, evaluation criteria, visualization, etc.) is provided. In addition, the tools' support for the more advanced and specialized research topics (big data, data streams, text mining, etc.) is outlined, where applicable. The tools are also compared with respect to the community support, based on the available sources. This multidimensional overview in the form of expert paper on data mining tools emphasizes the quality of RapidMiner, R, Weka, and KNIME platforms, but also acknowledges the significant advancements made in the other tools.

Evaluation of importance of the features used in the prediction and their subsequent selection is an immensely important step in the process of classification and data mining. This paper presents a study on the importance of student demographic features in the process of predicting. The study and performed analyses used the demographic data collected from the Information System for Higher Education (ISVU). For determining the importance of demographic features in the study the following methods have been used: Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS). The results show the features rank, their importance weight in the prediction and comparison of the results and the use of different methods. Two classification algorithms for evaluating the impact of ranking features to the quality of prediction are used: Naive Bayes i Support Vector Machine (SVM). Final results provide guidelines for the development of a new prediction model.

Retail information systems commonly store large amounts of data which are subsequently used by sophisticated data mining tools for building forecasting models. Quality of these models is usually measured through their predictive accuracy as their most important property, followed by other measures which consider average underestimate and overestimate costs etc. Even though the choice of data mining algorithm is usually paramount, training set cleansing and preparation has a significant influence on final model performance. This article discusses and analyses the impact of training set preparation and tailoring on a final forecasting model performance used in a real world example from the retail industry.

This data is stored, but commonly not automatically evaluated. This historic data is the key to efficient operation and to quick recognition of errors and inefficiencies, a potential that is not exploited today. Instead, today the evaluation during operation delivers only alarming in case of system failures. Analysis is commonly done by the facility manager, who uses his experience to interpret data. Methods from data mining and data analysis can contribute to a better understanding of building operation and provide the necessary information to optimize operation, especially in the area of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Increases in energy efficiency and can be achieved by automated data analysis and by presenting the user energy performance indicators of all relevant HVAC components.

The research has been performed within the EU project MOSAIC, which gathers T2D patients' data coming from three European hospitals and a local health care agency. The main idea underlying our approach is to use a suite of temporal data mining methods in order to derive healthcare pathways. The approach starts by processing raw data, derived from heterogeneous data sources, and create event logs, which contain meaningful healthcare activities. Once event logs have been obtained and tasks and transitions defined, it is possible to explore how state-of-art process mining techniques can be used to gain insights into T2D patients care. In the experimental section of this paper we illustrate the results of this approach applied to an integrated data repository containing clinical and administrative data of 1,020 T2D patients.

A subset of the MOSAIC activities is centered on the development of Temporal Data Mining models to identify relevant clinical pathways in patients' histories and will in particular benefit from the data coming from the medical centers involved in the project. To best exploit this repository, the need for creating a common and sharable data model becomes immediately apparent. This model is the main subject of this paper. The proposed approach relies on the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) open source software tools. It provides an integrated research setting to merge clinical and environmental data that will enable obtaining a broader vision of individual patients' histories, which will be then mined with multivariate models to identify relevant clinical pathways.

Most previous work has solved the problem either by using discretization, normal method or kernel method. This study proposes the usage of different continuous probability distribution techniques for Naive Bayes classification. It explores various probability density functions of distributions. The experimental results show that the proposed probability distributions also classify continuous data with potentially high accuracy. In addition, this paper introduces a novel method, named NBC4D, which offers a new approach for classification by applying different distribution types on different attributes.

This process consists in dividing an image in different parts which share a common property, for example, identify a concrete object within a photo. Different approaches have been developed over the last years. This work is focused on Unsupervised Data Mining methodologies, specially on Graph Clustering methods, and their application to previous problems. These techniques blindly divide the image into different parts according to a criterion. This work applies a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm in order to perform good clustering results comparing to classical and modern clustering algorithms. The algorithm is analysed and compared against different clustering methods, using a precision and recall evaluation, and the Berkeley Image Database to carry out the experimental evaluation.

There are six main symptoms: tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movements), hand asymmetry, posture instability and freezing of gait. Nowadays any type of diagnose for this disorder is done through observation by a health care professional specialized in this area. Therefore a simpler and more efficient method that General Practioners can use to have some grounded information to decide to forward a possible patient to a specialist is needed. With this in mind different systems were studied coming to the conclusion that a mobile application is among the best options. This work can be split in four important phases (see Figure 1): (1) study of the current market for this problem and for the solution to be developed, (2) development of a smartphone application capable of gathering data of the early symptoms of Parkinson's taking into consideration all the smartphone's specifications; (3) use the application to gather data from real patients and a control group and (4) test and select a classification algorithm. The first phase involved two research topics: problem and solution. The problem consisted in studying all the symptoms that could theoretically be detected by the different smartphone components. The solution consisted in studying the different methods used to solve such a problem using data mining techniques (different feature selection and classification algorithms that best take advantage of the nature of the data gathered). The second phase consisted in the development of the smartphone application with four components (spiral analysis, tap analysis, simple questions and gait analysis). The third phase was dedicated in building the control group gathering data from healthy people and a Parkinson patients group for a total of 35 subjects. Finally, the fourth phase was using the studied algorithms to filter the different features and compare the different algorithms selected. With the available data from the test subjects it was possible to achieve promising results from the gait analysis of the patients where the pelvic sway was a good feature to help differentiate Parkinson patients from healthy ones.

Feature Selection in Classification of Eye Movements Using Electrooculography for Activity Recognition	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							INTERFACE; BLINKING	Activity recognition is needed in different requisition, for example, reconnaissance system, patient monitoring, and human-computer interfaces. Feature selection plays an important role in activity recognition, data mining, and machine learning. In selecting subset of features, an efficient evolutionary algorithm Differential Evolution (DE), a very efficient optimizer, is used for finding informative features from eye movements using electrooculography (EOG). Many researchers use EOG signals in human-computer interactions with various computational intelligence methods to analyze eye movements. The proposed system involves analysis of EOG signals using clearness based features, minimum redundancy maximum relevance features, and Differential Evolution based features. This work concentrates more on the feature selection algorithm based on DE in order to improve the classification for faultless activity recognition.

Reexamining knowledge from classical medical texts is expected to provide meaningful information that could be utilized in current medical practices. In this study, we used data mining methods to analyze the association between acupoints and patterns of disorder with the classical medical book DongUiBoGam of Korean medicine. Using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) method, we quantified the significance of acupoints to its targeting patterns and, conversely, the significance of patterns to acupoints. Through these processes, we extracted characteristics of each acupoint based on its treating patterns. We also drew practical information for selecting acupoints on certain patterns according to their association. Data analysis on DongUiBoGam's acupuncture treatment gave us an insight into the main idea of DongUiBoGam. We strongly believe that our approach can provide a novel understanding of unknown characteristics of acupoint and pattern identification from the classical medical text using data mining methods.

Rough set theory has been used as such a tool with much success. The main objective of this paper is to propose a feature selection procedure based on a special group of probabilistic rough set models, called confirmation-theoretic rough set model(CTRS). Different from the existing attribute reduction methods, the definition of positive features is based on Bayesian confirmation measures. The proposed method is further divided into two categories based on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the underlying rough set models. This study provides new insights into the problem of attribute reduction.

In this paper, we describe the application of data mining techniques in a case study of identifying contextual requirements for a context-aware mobile application to be used by a team of four long-distance rowers. The context of use for this application was dangerous and isolated, making it unobservable by the developers. The context situations for five mobile application requirements were defined by using a data mining algorithm applied to historical sensor data passively collected by the users while they crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. The performance of the resulting classifiers is analyzed over time with promising results demonstrating that the data mining approach is feasible with implications for requirements engineering, context-aware mobile applications, and group-context-aware mobile applications.

Existing adaptive approaches, however, are limited in terms of the extent to which such contextual factors are explicitly identified and utilised, despite their importance. In response, we propose an information-theoretic-based approach for systematic context identification, aiming to learn from data the contextual characteristics of the domain by identifying the context variables contributing to concept changes. Such explicit identification of context enables capturing the causes of drift, and hence facilitating more effective adaptation. We conduct experimental analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on both simulated datasets with various change scenarios, and on an actual benchmark dataset from an electricity market.

Identifying, detecting and adapting learning algorithms to non-stationary environments is a fundamental task in many data mining scenarios; however it is often a major challenge for current methodologies. Data analysis in the context of time-varying statistical moments is a very active research direction in machine learning and in computational statistics; but theoretical insights into latent causes of non-stationarity in empirical data are very scarce. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of the trajectory classification error statistic in order to detect a significant variation in the underlying dynamics of data collected in multiple stages. We analysed qualitatively the conditions leading to observable changes in non-stationary data generated by Duffing nonlinear oscillators; which are ubiquitous models of complex classification problems. Analyses are further benchmarked in a dataset consisting of atmospheric pollutants time series.

Previously, global transcriptome analysis of AD brains by microarray failed to identify the set of consistently deregulated genes for biomarker development of AD. Therefore, the molecular pathogenesis of AD remains largely unknown. Whole RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is an innovative technology for the comprehensive transcriptome profiling on a genome-wide scale that overcomes several drawbacks of the microarray-based approach. To identify biomarker genes for AD, we analyzed a RNA-Seq dataset composed of the comprehensive transcriptome of autopsized AD brains derived from two independent cohorts. We identified the core set of 522 genes deregulated in AD brains shared between both, compared with normal control subjects. They included downregulation of neuronal differentiation 6 (NeuroD6), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in neuronal development, differentiation, and survival in AD brains of both cohorts. We verified the results of RNA-Seq by analyzing three microarray datasets of AD brains different in brain regions, ethnicities, and microarray platforms. Thus, both RNA-Seq and microarray data analysis indicated consistent downregulation of NeuroD6 in AD brains. These results suggested that downregulation of NeuroD6 serves as a possible biomarker for AD brains.

Nevertheless, migrating face-to-face learning methodologies to an online teaching environment is certainly challenging. More specifically, collaborative work, which provides valuable learning outcomes in classroom-based environments, is apparently unable to meet the online paradigm due to its intrinsic specificities: widely heterogeneous profiles, considerably large numbers of subscribers, scarcely balanced and doubtfully relevant feedback concerning students' progress, and poorly conducted personal attention facilities. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Sagittarius, a novel Open Educational Resource that uses data mining techniques to overcome such limitations.

We focus particularly on attribute reduction, which is important especially for high-dimensional data sets. The main technical contribution of this paper is a complete framework for calculating short reducts using SQL queries on data stored in a relational form, without a need of any external tools generating or modifying their syntax. A case study of large real-world data is presented. The paper also recalls some other examples of SQL-based data mining implementations. The experimental results are based on the usage of Infobright's analytic RDBMS, whose performance characteristics perfectly fit the requirements of presented algorithms.

However, if decision makers need to make ranking/selection among the alternatives that belong to the same decision class-a typical multiple criteria decision making problem, the obtained decision rules are not enough to resolve the ranking problem. Using a group of semiconductor companies in Taiwan, this study proposes a decision rules-based probabilistic evaluation method, transforms the strong decision rules into a probabilistic weighted model-to explore the performance gaps of each alternative on each criterion-to make improvement and selection. Five example companies were tested and illustrated by the transformed evaluation model, and the result indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed evaluation method may act as a bridge to transform decision rules (from data-mining approach) into a decision model for practical applications.

Standard data mining focuses on patterns that summarize data and these patterns are required to be further processed in order to determine opportunities for action. To address this problem, it is essential to extract patterns by comparing the profiles of two sets of relevant objects to obtain useful, understandable, and workable strategies. In this paper, we present the definition of actionable rules by integrating action rules and reclassification rules to build a framework for analyzing big data. In addition, three new interestingness measures, coverage, leverage, and lift, are proposed to address the limitations of minimum left support, right support and confidence thresholds for gauging the importance of discovered actionable rules.

Even more, virtual teaching is currently acquiring a great relevance never seen before. The information that these systems record is a wealthy source of information that once it is suitably analised, allows both, instructors and academic authorities to make more informed decisions. But, these individuals are not expert in data mining techniques, therefore they require tools which automatise the KDD process and, the same time, hide its complexity. In this paper, we show how meta-learning can be a suitable alternative for selecting the algorithm to be used in the KDD process, which will later be wrapped and deployed as a web service, making it easily accessible to the educational community. Our case study focuses on the student performance prediction from the activity performed by the students in courses hosted in Moodle platform.

Atomic decompositions appeared in applications to signal processing and sampling theory among other areas. First we give a general definition of fuzzy normed linear spaces and we obtain decomposition theorems for fuzzy norms into a family of semi-norms, within more general settings. The results are both for Bag-Samanta fuzzy norms and for Katsaras fuzzy norms. As a consequence, we obtain locally convex topologies induced by this types of fuzzy norms. The results established in this paper, constitute a foundation for the development of fuzzy operator theory and fuzzy wavelet theory within this more general frame.

However, the instructional sensitivity of CAD logs, which describes how students respond to interventions with CAD actions, has rarely been examined. For the logs to be used as reliable data sources for assessments, they must be instructionally sensitive. This paper reports the results of our systematic research on this important topic. To guide the research, we first propose a theoretical framework for computer-based assessments based on signal processing. This framework views assessments as detecting signals from the noisy background often present in large temporal learner datasets due to many uncontrollable factors and events in learning processes. To measure instructional sensitivity, we analyzed nearly 900 megabytes of process data logged by our Energy3D CAD software as collections of time series. These time-varying data were gathered from 65 high school students who solved a solar urban design challenge using Energy3D in seven class periods, with an intervention occurring in the middle of their design projects. Our analyses of these data show that the occurrence of the design actions unrelated to the intervention were not affected by it, whereas the occurrence of the design actions that the intervention targeted reveals a continuum of reactions ranging from no response to strong response. From the temporal patterns of these student responses, persistent effects and temporary effects (with different decay rates) were identified. Students' electronic notes taken during the design processes were used to validate their learning trajectories. These results show that an intervention occurring outside a CAD tool can leave a detectable trace in the CAD logs, suggesting that the logs can be used to quantitatively determine how effective an intervention has been for each individual student during an engineering design project.

There were more than 150 participants from five engineering disciplines at universities in various locations. They attended project management courses at their own universities, but with a shared virtual experience in executing and managing their projects. Different aspects have been investigated, such as the feasibility of using an integrated and technological framework to help the integrated learning process, the use of Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques to provide additional feedback of students' performances and forecasting students' successes at an early stage, based on the collected data. In addition, a survey was conducted to assess the students' level of satisfaction and their learning. We concluded that the integrated framework has demonstrated its usefulness in promoting the project management learning process among geographically-dispersed students, even when they come from different engineering disciplines and environmental sciences. Further, an increasing amount of student feedback was received. This impacted the teacher's effort unexpectedly. Finally, specific behaviors were found to be closely related to the student's final score. The main finding is that practical application of immersive frameworks increases student motivation and the outcomes of the course, thereby closing the usual gap between theory and practice.

Through our constraints, we can extract episodes related to events and their precedent-subsequent relations, on which we focus, in a short time. This improves the efficiency of data mining using trial and error processes. A partite episode of length k is of the form P = < P-1, ... , P-k > for sets P-i (1 <= i <= k) of events. We call Pi a part of P for every 1 <= i <= k. We introduce the partwise constraints for partite episodes P, which consists of shape and pattern constraints. A shape constraint specifies the size of each part of P and the length of P. A pattern constraint specifies subsets of each part of P. We then present a backtracking algorithm that finds all of the frequent partite episodes satisfying a partwise constraint from an input event sequence. By theoretical analysis, we show that the algorithm runs in output polynomial time and polynomial space for the total input size. In the experiment, we show that our proposed algorithm is much faster than existing algorithms for mining partite episodes on an artificial and a real-world datasets.

This has led to an increasing necessity of adopting more intelligent ways to manage the existing resources, specially the ones related to energy. In this regard, one of the main aims of this paper is to explore the opportunities of using ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) as an enabling technology to reduce energy use in cities. This paper presents a study in which we propose a multidimensional hybrid architecture that makes use of current energy data and external information to improve knowledge acquisition and allow managers to make better decisions. Our main goal is to make predictions about energy consumption based on energy data mining and supported by external knowledge.

Combining hybrid rule ordering strategies based on netconf and a novel satisfaction mechanism for CAR-based classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; supervised classification; class association rules; rule ordering strategies	CLASSIFICATION MODEL; ASSOCIATION	In Associative Classification, building a classifier based on Class Association Rules (CARs) consists in finding an ordered CAR list by applying a rule ordering strategy, and selecting a satisfaction mechanism to determine the class of unseen transactions. In this paper, we introduce four novel hybrid rule ordering strategies; the first three combine the Netconf measure with different Support-Confidence based rule ordering strategies. The fourth strategy combines the Netconf measure with a rule ordering strategy based on the CAR's size. Additionally, we combine the proposed strategies with a novel "Dynamic K" satisfaction mechanism. Experiments over several datasets show that the proposed rule ordering strategies jointly with the "Dynamic K" satisfaction mechanism allow improving the performance of CAR-based classifiers.

Quality measures are important tools in very different scenarios like supervised classification, pattern based clustering, and association rule mining. Consequently, and due to the large collection of available measures, it is important to perform comparative studies for each particular context. Most published studies comparing quality measures are theoretical and in the context of association rule evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical comparison of the behavior of 33 quality measures in the context of supervised classification and contrast pattern filtering. A comprehensive experimentation using several databases compares the behavior of these measures in three different contexts: as aggregation value, as pattern evaluation for classification, and as pattern evaluation for filtering. Experiments also show that top-accurate quality measures for classification have a deceptive performance for pattern filtering, because they cannot distinguish among patterns with zero support in the negative class.

Methods and resources to monitor internet censorship	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						Data mining; Internet; Libraries; Electronic media	PUBLIC-LIBRARIES; CHINA INTERNET; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; SERVICES; NEEDS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance for library and information services (LIS) to take the responsibility to find a manageable way to regularly monitor internet censorship in their countries, and to suggest a framework for such monitoring and to encourage manageable on-going small scale research projects. Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows on contract research for the IFLA Committee on Freedom of Access to Information and Freedom of Expression on country specific trends in internet censorship. Based on an extensive literature survey (not fully reflected here) and data mining, a framework is suggested for regular monitoring of country specific negative and positive trends in internet censorship. The framework addresses search strategies and information resources; setting up alerting services; noting resources for data mining; a detailed break-down and systematic monitoring of negative and positive trends; the need for reflection on implications, assessment of need(s) for concern (or not) and generation of suggestions for actions; sharing findings with the LIS community and wider society; and raising sensitivity for internet censorship as well as advocacy and lobbying against internet censorship. Apart from monitoring internet censorship, the framework is intended to encourage manageable on-going small scale research. Findings - A framework of internet censorship monitoring can support the regular, systematic and comprehensive monitoring of known as well as emerging negative and positive trends in a country, and can promote timely expressions of concerns and appropriate actions by LIS. It can support sensitivity to the dangers of internet censorship and raise LIS' levels of self-efficacy in dealing with internet censorship and doing manageable, small scale research in this regard. Originality/value - Although a number of publications have appeared on internet censorship these do not offer a framework for monitoring internet censorship and encouraging manageable on-going small scale research in this regard.

Difficulties in optimization of process parameters correspond with large number of control variables, which should be considered in the technology design. Sensitivity analysis allows evaluating the importance of all process inputs on the final properties of material. Information on the most important inputs is crucial for further design of the process. Application of sensitivity analysis requires detailed knowledge of the process phenomena as well as the definition of the mathematical model of the thermomechanical process. Furthermore, some sensitivity analysis algorithms are of the high computational cost. Presented work concerns possibility of the application of data exploration approach in evaluation of the importance of process inputs as the alternative for sensitivity analysis. Use of data mining algorithms eliminates necessity of mathematical model development, it also does not require any apriori knowledge about the process. Authors presents the comparison of sensitivity analysis and data exploration approach in evaluating relationships between inputs and outputs of the hot rolling for dual phase steel strips. The presented approach and the perspectives of the practical application could lead to significant decrease of time necessary for the computations of process design. The theoretical considerations are supplemented with the results of both types of analysis.

A sensor configuration is considered optimal when it is able to predict the product quality (dimension, warpage, etc.) with a good accuracy (from experimental data provided by these sensors). Initially, plastic engineers integrated sensors in moulds to acquire knowledge about their processes and to have better understanding of physical phenomenon. This article presents a numerical methodology to identify optimal combinations of sensors. The methodology is firstly based on polymer injection molding simulation to collect virtual sensor data. In a second step, virtual sensor data are analyzed by modern data-driven modeling techniques to identify optimal sensor configurations.

According to the proposed approach, neighborhood is detected by reducts calculations and a rule-learning algorithm is applied to induce a set of decision rules that define the evolution of CA. Experiments were performed with use of synthetic as well as real-world data sets. The results show that the introduced method allows identification of both deterministic and probabilistic CA-based models of real-world phenomena.

However, their performance is always decreased by the noises in the datasets, among which, noisy type assertions play an important role. This problem has been mainly studied in the domain of data mining but not in the semantic web community. In this paper, we study the problem of noisy type assertion detection in semantic web datasets by making use of concept disjointness relationships hidden in the datasets. We transform noisy type assertion detection into multiclass classification of pairs of type assertions which type an individual to two potential disjoint concepts. The multiclass classification is solved by Adaboost with C4.5 as the base classifier. Furthermore, we propose instance-concept compatability metrics based on instance-instance relationships and instance-concept assertions. We evaluate the approach on both synthetic datasets and DBpedia. Our approach effectively detect noisy type assertions in DBpedia with a high precision of 95%.

For the classification task we classify households into different categories based on some statistical attributes of their energy consumption measurements. For the clustering task, we use average daily load diagrams to partition electricity-consuming households into distinct groups. The data contains electricity consumption measurements on each 10-minute time interval for each light source and electrical appliance. We perform the classification and clustering tasks using four variants of processed data sets corresponding to the 10-minute total electricity consumption aggregated from all electrical sources, the hourly total consumption aggregated over all 10-minute intervals during that clock hour, the total consumption over each four-hour intervals and finally the daily total consumption. The goal is to see if there are any differences in using data sets of various frequency levels. We present the comparison results and investigate the added value of the high-frequency measurements, for example 10-minute measurements, in terms of its influence on customer clustering and classification.

For each forecasting day, a set of 135 days is selected for the training of the neural network. Moreover, five similar prices days are identified for each hour from a set of 90 days corresponding to each training day. The average price of these five days at the particular hour is used as one of the inputs to the neural network to improve the forecasting accuracy. Forecasting experiments are carried out for nine days in 2012. Test results show that the proposed technique reduces the mean absolute percentage error significantly.

The precise forecasting of ticket sales in OTA companies is beneficial to budget control and service quality. The paper develops an integrated forecasting model by combining the internal factors immediately influencing the ticket sales and the external factors reflecting the ticket sales market. The internal factors are selected such as the number of calling in certain duration, while the external factors include the attention of relevant search engine query data. After several key features are extracted using feature selection model, the machine learning algorithms can get the more accurate prediction, in contract to the basic experiments to explore the inherent rule of the sales data itself. Our proposed user behavior-based prediction model provides a feasible and efficiency tool for ticket sales prediction.

Therefore, how to discover the objects of customers' demands becomes a critical task for business. Data mining is an important way to analyze and understand customer demands, behaviors and characteristics from large business databases However, traditional data mining is data-driven, therefore discovered patterns can be hardly understood or common sense for managers. To this end, the paper proposes domain driven data mining to tackle the above issues. Firstly, the paper constructs customer demand domain ontology and customer demand discovery task ontology. Further, the paper provides ontology based data mining framework, which is implemented for mining customer data from the case firm and knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns and rules. Our study provides a roadmap for businesses to conduct customer demand data mining and facilitate decision making and customer relationship management.

The contradiction between the demand of integrated medical and disciplines subdivision becoming more and more obvious, many diseases relying on only a medical specialty is not enough. For realizing the patient-oriented medical service objective, it is necessary to design the chain of care involved in the integration of multidisciplinary disease diagnosis and treatment methods, which covered different stages of the whole process including Early Prevention, Pre-hospital emergency, In-hospital Treatment, Rehabilitation and so on. The decision quality of the key points of chain of care has a significant effect on the overall quality of health care services. Based on collecting and organizing literature, there are still many deficiencies in previous studies. This paper intends to discuss the optimization and improvement of disease decision on this: to further study on disease decision problem systematically and to explore the decisions optimization of key points of chain of care. In view of the present decision technology is low efficiency, lack of flexibility and adaptability, this paper focus on the disease decisions optimization with data mining method.

The purpose of this work is to propose a stereoscopic vision system for dimensional measurements in an application of industrial robotics. The paper describes as a camera mounted on a six-axis robot manipulator can calculate the real dimension of a target object. So, in this application the vision system is not composed by two physical cameras, but the stereo system is created by the movement of a single camera. The work provides a calibration procedure of the camera preliminary to the stage of actual measurement. Experimental results on a target with a simple and well-defined shape have shown that the accuracy of the measurement is strongly influenced by a correct calibration.

In order to ensure anomaly awareness, the observed data can be used in accordance with data mining techniques to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS). There is an increase in the volume of sensor data generated by both cyber and physical sensors, so there is a need to apply Big Data technologies for real-time analysis of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a clustering based approach for detecting cyber attacks that cause anomalies in NCI. Various clustering techniques are explored to choose the most suitable for clustering the time-series data features, thus classifying the states and potential cyber attacks to the physical system. The Hadoop implementation of MapReduce paradigm is used to provide a suitable processing environment for large datasets.

Frequent itemsets generation produce extremely large numbers of generated itemsets that make the algorithms inefficient. The reason is that the most traditional approaches adopt an iterative strategy to discover the itemsets, that's require very large process. Furthermore, the present mining algorithms cannot perform efficiently due to high and repeatedly database scan. In this paper we introduce a new binary-based Semi-Apriori technique that efficiently discovers the frequent itemsets. Extensive experiments had been carried out using the new technique, compared to the existing Apriori algorithms, a tentative result reveal that our technique outperforms Apriori algorithm in terms of execution time.

The accurate annotation of the unknown protein using the classification of the protein sequence into an existing superfamily is considered a critical and challenging task in bioinformatics and computational biology. This classification would be helpful in the analysis and modeling of unknown protein to determine their structure and function. In this paper, a frequency-based feature encoding technique has been used in the proposed framework to represent amino acids of a protein's primary sequence. The technique has considered the occurrence frequency of each amino acid in a sequence. Popular classification algorithms such as decision tree, naive Bayes, neural network, random forest and support vector machine have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the encoding method utilized in the proposed framework. Results have indicated that the decision tree classifier significantly shows better results in terms of classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F-measure, etc. The classification accuracy of 88.7% was achieved over the Yeast protein sequence data taken from the well-known UniProtKB database.

SRM is recently introduce technology that is used to replicates the results of numerical simulation model. High computational cost and long processing time limits our ability to perform comprehensive sensitivity analysis and quantify uncertainties associated with reservoir because reservoir model that contains large number of grids in its geological structure takes considerable amount of time for a single simulation run. And also making hundred and thousands simulation runs is considered as a cumbersome process and sometimes impractical. SRM is considered as as a solution tool to tackle this issue. SRM uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique for the reservoir simulation and modeling. In this paper, the results of SRM for predicting BHFP is presented and a reservoir simulation model has been presented using Black Oil Applied Simulation Tool (BOAST). To build any SRM, it requires small number of runs to train the model. Once we train the SRM, it can generate hundred and thousands of simulation runs in a matter of seconds. As a part of this system, it is proposed to develop a SRM extraction based on ANN to enhance the realization run time.

It includes a data analysis method of structured products based on data warehouse and a data analysis method of non-structured products based on Hadoop. By means of the former method, firstly product data was filtered, tranformed and loaded into the warehouse, then the required data cube was extracted, lastly the structured product data was analyzed with the analysis tools of data warehouse. By means of the latter method, the product data firstly was loaded into the distributed file system, and the non-structured massive PLM product data was analyzed by the data mining algorithm, which was programmed by JAVA language based on MapReduce. By applying the methods mentioned above to massive PLM product data analysis, it shows that these methods hava a higher efficiency. PLM, running through the whole process of product planning, conceptual design, detailed design, manufacturing, sales and after-sales service, manages various types of data and a large category of information, therefore a large number of structured data and unstructured data are invloved in it. Mining the valuable information and knowledge quickly and accurately from these data can help enterprise managers make the right decision to guide the long-term development of enterprises and it is of great concern to the business circle([1,2]). Curently, there were some domestic papers which had made a systematic study on the product data mining under the PLM system, such as the research on technologies and applications of data mining for PLM by Zhejiang University and the research of data mining technology and its application in PLM by Northwestern Polytechnical University, etc. They mainly studied the theory and development of PLM systems, analysed the PLM-oriented data mining process, and designed a preliminary data mining system for PLM[3]. However, there still exists some problems: ( 1) data mining for PLM management system is just a prototype now, there are still some considerations not comprehensive enough, such as the expandability of the system is very poor; ( 2) total amount of data in PLM increases with the growing requirement of enterprises, which brings new challenge to data storage and processing. The traditional data analysis system was not competent enough to analyze and process massive data([4,5]). The rising of cloud computing, which adopts a management mode that make computing and storage centralized and pooled, provides a new way to the analysis of PLM product data. The combination of cloud computing and PLM product data mining can make the data processing system more flexible in analyzing data, customize the hardware resources required for data processing according to the actual need, at the same time it can save expenses needed for hardware maintenance and data backup([6,7]).

Nevertheless there are a lot of issues in this dataset which cannot be omitted. In order to establish good data mining models in intrusion detection and find the appropriate network intrusion attack types' features, researchers should have a well-known understanding on this dataset. In this paper, first and foremost we have made an in-depth analysis on the problems which the dataset are existed, and given the related solutions. Secondly, we also have carried out plenty data preprocessing on the 10% subset of KDD Cup 99 dataset's training set, giving better results to the following process. What's more, by comparing 10 common kinds of data mining algorithms in our experiment, we have analyzed and summarized that data preprocessing plays a vital role on the performance and importance to data mining algorithms.

The fact that the security is implemented directly at the hardware level, and moreover, relies on the laws of physics instead of conjectured hardness assumptions, justifies the use of quantum security in many cases. Limitations include 100 km communication range and installation of quantum channels between each pair of users of the network. Presently, with the current lack of trust in commercial security solutions, mostly due to the Snowden crisis, there is the need to improve such solutions. In this paper we discuss how quantum networks can be used to setup secure multiparty computation (SMC), allowing for instance for private data mining, electronic elections among other security functionalities. SMC relies mostly on establishing an efficient oblivious transfer protocol. We present a bit-string quantum oblivious transfer protocol based on single-qubit rotations that can be implemented with current technology based on optics and whose security relies only on the laws of physics.

Exploration of the OBIA methods available in SPRING non-commercial software to UAV data processing	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications V	SEP 23-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE		UAV; OBIA; SPRING (R) software	CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY	The increasing developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) platforms and associated sensing technologies, offer a broad range of solutions for different applications related to the acquisition of information about objects or phenomenon at the Earth. The huge amount of data, provided by UAVs, represents a new challenge regarding developments of image processing techniques. Object-based image classification (OBIA) is highly suitable for very high resolution imagery, where pixel-based classification is less successful due to the high spatial variability within objects of interest. An OBIA approach using SPRING (R) non-commercial software was implemented in this work. The UAV system used was a Swinglet from Sensefly. The ortho-mosaic, with 0.04 m of pixel size, from 20 of January of 2012 of Coimbra (Portugal) region with an apx. 500x400 m area was processed using the original 41 images. Different "similarity" and "area" parameters combination were computed in the segmentation stage (region-based). Firstly, a supervised classification was employed, considering 7 classes based on Corine land cover nomenclature. For several parameter combinations were obtained a Kappa>0.9 and an overall accuracy >90%. However, several objects were not classified. An unsupervised classification was performed and 27 classes were defined. After, a new supervised classification was performed considered 22 of the 27 classes identified, with an overall accuracy of 82.58%, and a Kappa of 0.817. We conclude that the algorithms employed in this work are not the most suitable for this kind of spatial resolution. The use data mining algorithms could improve the results.	[Teodoro, A.

Of particular interest is to identify those Critical Voltage Control Areas (CVCAs) in a transmission power grid, that may suffer reactive power deficiencies. Since speed of analysis is critical for on-line applications the approach will address the development of a scheme whereby CVCAs can be identified using data mining techniques from on-line power system snapshot (PMU). The database for storing/retrieving result of Modal Analysis can be used to construct decision trees (DTs) for each of the identified CVCAs using key power system attributes. The objective of this paper is to propose an new real-time methodology for identification of CVCAs, which is key function for preventive and remedial actions against instability of the Electrical Power System (EPS). This is carried out under various system operation and contingency conditions by using off-line trained decision trees generated and on-line PMU measurements. Numerical results on the 12-bus test system, shows the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Herein, a series of 3,7- and 4,7-disubstituted coumarin derivatives (1-34) with R-1 and R-2 substituents bearing aromatase inhibitory activity were modeled as a function of molecular and quantum chemical descriptors derived from low-energy conformer geometrically optimized at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Insights on origins of aromatase inhibitory activity was afforded by the computed set of 7 descriptors comprising of F10[N-O], Inflammat-50, Psychotic-80, H-047, BELe1, B10[C-O] and MAXDP. Such significant descriptors were used for QSAR model construction and results indicated that model 4 afforded the best statistical performance. Good predictive performance were achieved as verified from the internal (comprising the training and the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) sets) and external sets affording the following statistical parameters: R-Tr(2) = 0.9576 and RMSETr = 0.0958 for the training set; Q(CV)(2) = 0.9239 and RMSECV = 0.1304 for the LOO-CV set as well as Q(Ext)(2) = 0.7268 and RMSEExt = 0.2927 for the external set. Significant descriptors showed correlation with functional substituents, particularly, R-1 in governing high potency as aromatase inhibitor. Molecular docking calculations suggest that key residues interacting with the coumarins were predominantly lipophilic or non-polar while a few were polar and positively-charged. Findings illuminated herein serve as the impetus that can be used to rationally guide the design of new aromatase inhibitors.

Physical phenomena that affect pipe bursts, such as pipe-environment interactions, are very complex and only partially understood. This paper analyses the possible link between pipe bursts and climate-related factors. Many water utilities observed consistent occurrence of peaks in pipe bursts in some periods of the year, during winter or summer. The paper investigates the relationships between climate data (i.e., temperature and precipitation-related covariates) and pipe bursts recorded during a 24-year period in Scarborough (Ontario, Canada). The Evolutionary Polynomial Regression modelling paradigm is used here. This approach is broader than statistical modelling, implementing a multi-modelling approach, where a multiobjective genetic algorithm is used to get optimal models in terms of parsimony of mathematical expressions vs. fitting to data. The analyses yielded interesting results, in particular for cold seasons, where the discerned models show good accuracy and the most influential explanatory variables are clearly identified. The models discerned for warm seasons show lower accuracy, possibly implying that the overall phenomena that underlay the generation of pipe bursts during warm seasons cannot be thoroughly explained by the available climate-related covariates.

While these inspections provide essential information on the condition of pipes hidden from day-to-day view, they are expensive and often limited to small portions of an entire sewer system. Municipalities may benefit from utilizing predictive analytics to leverage existing inspection datasets so that reliable predictions of condition are available for pipes that have not yet been inspected. The predictive capabilities of data mining systems, namely support vector machines (SVMs) and decision tree classifiers, are demonstrated using a case study of sanitary sewer pipe inspection data collected by the municipality of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The modeling algorithms are implemented using open-source software and are tuned to counteract the negative impact on predictive performance resulting from class imbalance common within pipe inspection datasets. The decision tree classifier outperforms SVM for this classification task - achieving an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 and an overall accuracy of 76% on a stratified test set. Although predicting individual pipe condition is a notoriously difficult task, decision trees are found to be a useful screening tool for planning future inspection-related activities.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes the theory of social network analysis (SNA) to make a comprehensive evaluation model for rating commodities. Specifically, the paper shows how to apply the network analysis, how it works and what the advantage is. The paper further presents the new model's properties and validates the model's applicability. The paper finally analyzes the results with respect to various dimensions of a movie rating database and report on the insights generated by the model. Findings - Through the designed comparison analysis and the empirical analysis, the model is showed to be better than the traditional ones such as averaging, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and several mentioned dimension-reduction techniques (DRTs) in terms of consistency and its ability to deal with the missing data. Practical implications - The new model is solvable in polynomial time and proper for the large-scale data set. Furthermore, this model can also be seen as a data mining method which would be useful to improve insights into customer behavior. Originality/value - The proposed method enables to give comprehensive rating results which can preserve the rankings implied by all the customers' ratings, adapt to the database with the missing data and cost a low algorithm time and space.

To compete and survive in this ever-changing global marketplace, individual companies can hardly survive in isolation of their business partners, suppliers, and other service providers. However, the lack of a seamless interchange and efficient data analysis hinders the formation of an effective information infrastructure that serves as the platform for data interchange of the heterogeneous database systems in the supply chain network. This paper proposed an infrastructure of information system that encompasses data mining and workflow management capability by adopting the advanced technologies of Online Analysis Process (OLAP) and workflow management system to facilitate supply chain management.

An ensemble consists of a set of independently trained classifiers whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper we use applied technology to built an ensemble using a voting methodology of Boosting-BAN and Boosting-MultiTAN ensembles with 10 sub-classifiers in each one. We performed a comparison with Boosting-BAN and Boosting-MultiTAN ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique was the most accurate. These results argue that boosting algorithms deserve more attention in machine learning and data mining communities.

The correlation between self-efficacy and such four factors as anxiety, learning strategies, motivation and learners' past achievement is analyzed by means of data mining and the extent to which the above factors affect self-efficacy in language learning is explored in this paper. The paper employs the decision tree algorithm in SPSS Clementine. C5.0 decision tree algorithm is adopted to analyze data in the study. The results are elicited from the researches carried out in this paper. The increased anxiety is bound to weaken learners' motivation over time. It is obvious that learners have low self-efficacy. It is very important to employ strategies in foreign language learning. Ignorance of using learning strategies may result in unplanned learning with unsatisfactory achievements in spite of more efforts involved. Self-efficacy in foreign language learning may be weakened accordingly. Learners' past achievement is a reference dimension in measuring self-efficacy with weaker influence.

In addition, Minimal Enclosing Ball (MEB) has a limitation with a large dataset, and the training computational increases as data size becomes large. This paper presents an improved two approaches based SVMs reduced to Minimal Enclosing Ball (MEB) problems. These approaches find the concentric balls with minimum volume of data description to reduce the chance of accepting abnormal data that contain most of the training samples. Our study is experimented on speech information to eliminate all noise data and reducing time training. Numerical experiments on some real-world datasets verify the usefulness of our approaches for data mining.

On the foundation of the existing algorithm based on DBSCAN, a new improved incremental DBSCAN clustering algorithm is proposed. Combining with cloud computing open source framework Hadoop, the improved algorithm use the programming model of MapReduce which can easy write distributed applications and simplify distributed programme to divide a huge amounts of data elements into chunks and distribute the chunks across the cluster and run the algorithm as a MapReduce job, in this way, this improved algorithm of data mining is integrated with framework Hadoop by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. When data manipulation (add or delete) has occurred in the database, what we need to do is to mine the mutative data and merge the similar clusters, and ultimately form the final knowledge mining. Compared with single node server serial arithmetic and the overall mining, the time delay of data processing will be reduced. In the last part, the paper verified the effectiveness by experiments and data analysis.

This problem is particularly challenging in distributed environments such as campus clusters, grids or clouds on which the basic computation routines are offered as web/cloud services. In this paper, we propose a locality-aware workflow-based solution for evaluation of large-scale matrix expressions in a distributed environment. Our solution is based on automatic generation of BPEL workflows in order to coordinate long running, asynchronous and parallel invocation of services. We optimize the input expression in order to maximize parallel execution of independent operations while reducing the matrix transfer cost to a minimum. Our approach frees the end-user of the system from the burden of writing and debugging lengthy BPEL workflows. We evaluated our solution on realistic mathematical expressions executed on large-scale matrices distributed on multiple clouds.

Bringing expertise into educational in-production systems is complicated because companies are reluctant to invest a lot of effort into integrating new technology that they do not fully trust, while the technology cannot prove its worth without access to real, valid data. In this paper we explore the requirements that machine learning systems have to be applied to specific learning problems (sequencing and performance prediction), and then propose a minimally invasive protocol for sequencing (based on web services) to easily integrate Learning Analytics Services into e-learning systems.

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.

It can be applied to a wide range of areas with good practical value and application significance. We propose a novel algorithm called iDBMM based on the improvement of DBMM algorithm. At first, iDBMM algorithm classifies the training set to obtain the basic characteristics of each role. Then it scores the test set relative to each role and distribute the role of the highest score to the corresponding node. Finally, the transition model is obtained by the statistical method. Experimental results show that new method determines the distribution of the roles of the nodes effectively to make up for the shortcoming of non-negative matrix factorization and improve the prediction accuracy.

A key idea behind complex system constructed by intelligent agents is to establish cooperation between different agents so as to solve problems more effectively and efficiently than a single agent can do. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that promote and maintain cooperative behavior is recognized as a major theoretical problem where the intricacy increases with the complexity of the participating individuals. We presents current research on the effect of the "probability of learning" (Pl) and the "probability of reconnecting" (Pr) in NIPD game in evolution experiment based on complex network system, static and dynamic. We show that the "probability of learning" (Pl) is not the decisive factor on static network but it plays an important role on dynamic network where the "probability of reconnecting" (Pr) is not zero.

Attackers are able to compromise web services, collect confidential information from web data bases, interrupt or completely paralyze web servers. In this study, we consider the analysis of HTTP logs for the detection of network intrusions. First, a training set of HTTP requests which does not contain any attacks is analyzed. When all relevant information has been extracted from the logs, several clustering and anomaly detection algorithms are employed to describe the model of normal users behavior. This model is then used to detect network attacks as deviations from the norms in an online mode. The simulation results presented show that, compared to other data mining algorithms, the method results in a higher accuracy rate.

The interval fuzzy c-means (IFCM) clustering method was proposed to deal with symbolic interval data. However, it still has noisy and outliers problems. Hence, in this paper we propose interval fuzzy possibilistic c-means (IFPCM) clustering algorithm to overcome the IFCM clustering algorithm for the symbolic interval data clustering in noisy and outlier environments under smart phone. From the results of simulation shows that the proposed IFPCM clustering algorithm is implemented on windows mobile (smart) phone and demonstrated nice performance as expected.

We have constructed a system that uses clustering techniques and tool catalog data to support the determination of drilling conditions for printed wiring boards (PWBs). Variable cluster analysis and the K-means method were used together to identify tool shape parameters that have a linear relationship with the drilling conditions listed in the catalogs. The response surface method and significant tool shape parameters obtained by clustering were used to derive drilling condition decision equations, which were used to determine the indicative drilling conditions for PWBs. Comparison of the conditions recommended by toolmakers demonstrated that our proposed system can be used to determine the drilling condition for PWBs. We carried out the drilling experiments in accordance with the catalog conditions and mining conditions, and estimated the board temperature around a drilled hole, the drilling forces, and the roughness of the drilled hole wall.

Given a subset I subset of U it should be possible to quickly compute I boolean AND S, i.e., the elements in I satisfying the sampling condition. Consistent sampling has important applications in similarity estimation, and estimation of the number of distinct items in a data stream. In this paper we generalize consistent sampling to the setting where we are interested in sampling size-k subsets occurring in some set in a collection of sets of bounded size b, where k is a small integer. This can be done by applying standard consistent sampling to the k-subsets of each set, but that approach requires time Theta(b(k)). Using a carefully designed hash function, for a given sampling probability p is an element of (0, 1], we show how to improve the time complexity to Nu(b(inverted right perpendicular) (k/2) (inverted left perpendicular) log log b + pb(k)) in expectation, while maintaining strong concentration bounds for the sample. The space usage of our method is Theta(b(inverted right perpendicular) (k/4) (inverted left perpendicular)). We demonstrate the utility of our technique by applying it to several well-studied data mining problems. We show how to efficiently estimate the number of frequent k-itemsets in a stream of transactions and the number of bipartite cliques in a graph given as incidence stream. Further, building upon a recent work by Campagna et al., we show that our approach can be applied to frequent itemset mining in a parallel or distributed setting. We also present applications in graph stream mining.

However, the literature appears not to include methods or techniques for exploring databases to obtain classifications for this quality; nor is there a consensus as to the definition of "education quality". To address these issues, this article proposes a methodology similar to the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) to classify Education Quality in schools comparatively, based on grades scored in school performance tests. For the purposes of this study, the test used was the Prova Brasil examination, which is part of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) used in Brazil. The methodology was applied to public municipal schools in the town of Araucaria in the metropolitan district of Curitiba in Parani State. Seventeen schools that offer elementary and junior high school education were included. All the grades of every student were considered from the early and later years at the schools. During the Data Mining stage, the main stage of the KDD process, three comparative methods were used for Pattern Recognition: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Genetic Algorithms. These methods supplied satisfactory results in the classification of schools represented by way of a "Quality Label", with Artificial Neural Networks having the best performance for the problem in question. With this quality label, educational managers can decide on which measures to adopt at all the schools to help them achieve their goals.

Drawing on original survey and interview findings about public attitudes toward collection and use of personal information, it maintains that the inability to anticipate the potential uses of such data is a defining attribute of data-mining processes, and thus of the forms of sorting and targeting that result from them.

At the same time, the term "large-scale" suggests completeness, while ease of collection and analysis suggest that little else need be done. Both tend to crowd out other interpretations; hence understanding their limits should be of the utmost concern. This article discusses a number of the issues of concern that arise out of the necessary but potentially problematic simplifications/standardizations found in LSDS.

Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME)	SEP 08-10, 2014	Verona, ITALY	Univ Verona			INFERRING FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES	Temporal functional dependencies (TFDs) add valid time to classical functional dependencies (FDs) in order to express data integrity constraints over the flow of time. If the temporal dimension adopted is an interval, we have to deal with interval-based temporal functional dependencies (ITFDs for short), which consider different interval relations between valid times of related tuples. The related approximate problem is when we want to check if our data satisfy, without any constraint for the schema, a given ITFD under a given error threshold 0 <= is an element of <= 1. This can be rephrased as: given a relation instance r, is it possible to delete at most is an element of . vertical bar r vertical bar tuples from it in such a way that the resulting instance satisfies the given ITFD? This optimization problem, ITFD-Approx for short, may represent a way to discover (data mining) important dependencies among attribute values in a database as well as a way to control data consistency. In this paper we analyze the complexity of problem ITFD-Approx restricting ourselves to Allen's interval relations: we will see how the complexity of such a problem may significantly change, depending on the considered interval relation.

The algorithm is using the MDT measurements to construct statistics of reselection and handover distributions for different mobility categories to learn how network topology and UE velocities are correlating in local geographical neighborhood. The distributions are used to self-optimize LTE Release 8 MSE thresholds by employing a standard score linear classifier. This allows simple, backward compatible and cost-efficient optimization of MSE thresholds. Moreover, such self-optimization results in a high classification accuracy of UE mobility states and decreases operator's manual parameter configuration complexity. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm was done by conducting extensive system simulations. The performance results indicate that in the studied sparse and dense heterogeneous networks the average classification accuracy was 72.2% and 78%, respectively.

The proposal describes mathematically observed users, objects, and their interactions at a given time as a set of graphs (a usage pattern) whose node is a user or an object and edge is assigned depending on a physical distance between two nodes. It is validated that the proposal can provide useful data for interview planning and evidences for interview results. On the validation, detection of frequent local usage patterns, detection of rare spatial layouts among usage patterns, and grouping hours containing similar local usage patterns are demonstrated with the 324 pictures taken at the collaborative learning space in Chiba University Library.

It follows that team performance depends on the player's adaptation to (suitability for) a certain role (position in the team) and the relationships between different roles. We assume that team performance is related to physical and psychological features. Many researchers have proposed that physical features determine a player's suitability for a position. Psychological features have also been researched as factors of position adaptation. However, each feature has been investigated independently. The present research aims to develop a clustering method that considers both physical and psychological features in judging an individual's role and adaptation in the game. This paper reports the concept of the algorithm and result of psychological data analysis using self-organizing maps and principal component analysis.

Among various approaches to scalable learning, sampling techniques can be exploited to address the issue of scalability. This paper presents our study on applying a newly developed sampling-based boosting learning method for multi-class (non-binary) classification. Preliminary experimental results using bench-mark data sets from the UCIrvine ML data repository confirm the efficiency and competitive prediction accuracy of the proposed adaptive boosting method for the multi-class classification task. We also show a formulation of using a single ensemble of non-binary base classifiers with adaptive sampling for multi-class problems.

In this process, data mining techniques have achieved interesting and successful results. However, when it comes to prognosis the same quality of results is not being achieved. We argue that this happens thanks to the inability of the used techniques to capture the inherent temporal dependencies present on the data. Specifically, the temporal evolution of a patient is not being taken into account when performing prognosis. In this paper, we propose a different approach, independent of the domain, to address this issue. We present our preliminary results on two different datasets that show an improvement in the overall precision of the prognosis.

Many interesting real-world data sets are high dimensional. Detection of anomalies in such datasets is hampered due to the curse of dimensionality. In such datasets the anomalies are hidden in smaller subspaces of attributes. However the number of subspaces possible from a given attribute set increases in a combinatorial fashion. Consequently an exhaustive search through all possible subspaces for anomalies is not computationally feasible. In this paper we propose a method for exploring the subspaces in a high dimensional data set in an effective and organized way to detect anomalies within them while avoiding an exhaustive search over all possible subspaces. The new method is called eSelect. Through extensive experimentation we compare eSelect to a well-established subspace selection method and demonstrate that our newly proposed method attains marked improvements.

In addition its events are connected with the evolution of the exploiting policies still ongoing. The critical observations of its features aim at providing tools able to support the decisions about subsides and local property taxes. This study continues the observations we have carried out for five years, this time involving clustering analysis, a data mining technique able to recognize different submarkets, and suitable to make the valuation pattern fit to the different market areas.

Therefore, the task of understanding, modelling and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of air pollution in urban zones is an interesting and challenging topic having many research axes from science-based modelling to geostatistics and data mining. Recently, the application of land use regression models (LUR) for air pollution analysis and mapping in urban zones has demonstrated their efficiency. The present research deals with a new development of nonlinear LUR models based on machine learning algorithms. A special attention is paid to the Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest algorithms and their abilities to model the NO2 pollutant in the urban zone of Geneva.

However, generating of sequential dataset from log file is quite complicated and difficult. Therefore, in this study we proposed a sequential preprocessing model (SPM) and sequential preprocessing tool (SPT) as an attempt to generate the sequential dataset. The result shows that SPT can be used in generating the sequential dataset. We evaluated the performance of the developed model against the log activities captured from UMT's e-Learning System called myLearn.

The future LBS services will be more anticipatory of users needs and will exploit a broader range of information on users. In order to anticipate users' needs, LBS providers should be able to understand users' behaviours, preferences and interests automatically and without asking the user to specify them. Then using the user's current situation and previously extracted behaviours, interests and dislikes, the user's needs can be predicted at the relevant moment and provide the most appropriate sets of services. This paper shows the application of data mining techniques over anonymous sets of tracking data to recognise mobility behaviours and preferences of users such as Point of Interest (PoI). Tracking data are first anonymised then stored in a spatio-temporal database. Then, using data mining techniques, rules, models and patterns are recognised. Such knowledge, patterns and models are subsequently used for intelligent navigation services as input making suggestions.

This paper firstly describes the background of digital television information delivery. Then details information delivery's algorithms and models based on user profiles analysis and information delivery analysis. Our research solved the problem that people cannot deliver the information to clients efficiently and accurately, and also avoided wasting information network bandwidth.

It is suitable for solving the nonlinear and higher-dimensional pattern recognition problem with a small amount of samples. SVM is mainly used to solve classification problems (SVC) and regression problems (SVR). If we regard the securities market trend prediction as a classification of rise or fall, the securities market trend prediction can be converted into a classification problem. In this paper, a kind of securities market month K line forecast model based on SVC was put forward. Eighty times of simulation experiment were performed. The comprehensive accuracy of the forecast model was 61.90%, and the rise forecast accuracy was 64.00%. If we trade stock according to the prediction, the income will be 11.82% a year. The simulation experiment results proved that the securities market month K line forecast model based on SVC was feasible and had certain practical significance.

As one of the typical clustering algorithms, K-Prototypes can deal with mixed type dataset. However, there remains two limitations: (1) the randomly selected initial points lack representativeness; (2) the dissimilarity definition is still rough. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm called L.K-Prototypes to remedy above two drawbacks. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, we implemented and conducted experiments with a real dataset. The results showed that L.K-Prototypes can improve both the accuracy and efficiency of clustering.

In applications deriving from business intelligence, potentially valuable data from large databases often cannot be used in an unrestricted way. Privacy constraints may not allow the data modeler to use all of the existing feature variables in building the classification models. In certain situations, preprocessing the original data can lead to intermediate datasets, which hide private or commercially sensitive information but still contain information useful enough for building competitive classification models. To this end, we propose to cooperatively use both unsupervised Clustering and supervised Support Vector Machines. For an instance of real-life credit client scoring, we then evaluate our approach against the case of unrestricted use of all data features.

We see numerous strategies proposed for organizations namely in areas of business intelligence applications, such as Data Mining. However, these applications are not fully introduced in electricity supply industry and inform managers of the value of information (VoI) that they generate. Management often does not see the value of such information and how they can relate the information to some measure, such as monetary value or critical business decisions. This produces a gap where managers are unable to identify key information that is important to their business roles with the ability of the technology provided to identify these valuable data. This paper provides an insight to the value of information (VoI) in electricity supply and distribution management and proposes a conceptual model to identify and classify key information value for managers and administrators at all levels of management. The study begins by analyzing revenue-related business processes to identify key information that directly influence the business performance. Qualitative data collection is conducted to solicit information relating to the execution of the business processes to capture other relevant information. A framework is developed to identify and classify the key data and information based on an identified set of criteria for each level of management. This research produces Key Information Value Identification and Classification Framework, which is very useful for companies to enhance their decision-making process at every level or management. This paper provides the preliminary result for development of such framework.

This has given a signal to the researchers to identify the key factors that affect the results of classification. Previous study has discussed about Motion Capture (MoCap) data on physical and mental attributes on static and dynamic motion. However, the effect of number of attributes towards the performance of classification accuracies has not been addressed. Therefore, this paper was aimed to study the impact of number of attributes on the quality of static and dynamic motion classifications. Two main case studies were used: Yoga activity as static motion; jumping, walking and running as dynamic motion. The Cartesian coordinate system was used to measure the numerical attributes: x-coordinate, y-coordinate and rotation angle. The classification accuracy is evaluated via Bayes. Function. Lazy. Meta, Misc, Rule and Trees classifiers built-in WEKA data mining tool. Results revealed that the triple attributes factor has performed best for both static and dynamic motion with average classification accuracies of 80.32% and 72.69% respectively. To determine the significant of mean difference between numbers of attributes confident level of 90%. ANOVA results presented significant difference (P=0.063) in level of mean for dynamic motion and non-significant difference (P=0.198) in static motion. The findings demonstrated that the classification accuracy of static and dynamic motion is directly proportional to the number of attributes but the impact on number of attributes is rather more significant on the dynamic compared to the static motion.

This includes the utilization of optimization algorithms that mimics the behavior of insects or animals. This paper presents an experiment on document clustering utilizing the Gravitation Firefly algorithm (GFA). The advantage of GFA is that clustering can be performed without a pre-defined value of k clusters. GFA determines the center of clusters by identifying documents with high force. Upon identification of the centers, clusters are created based on cosine similarity measurement. Experimental results demonstrated that GFA utilizing a random positioning of documents outperforms existing clustering algorithm such as Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means.

However, if a single byte of a file is changed, then cryptographic hashes result in a completely different hash value. It would be very useful to work with hashes which identify that files were similar based on their hash values. The security field has proposed similarity digests, and the data mining community has proposed locality sensitive hashes. Some proposals include the Nilsimsa hash (a locality sensitive hash), Ssdeep and Sdhash (both Ssdeep and Sdhash are similarity digests). Here, we describe a new locality sensitive hashing scheme the TLSH. We provide algorithms for evaluating and comparing hash values and provide a reference to its open source code. We do an empirical evaluation of publically available similarity digest schemes. The empirical evaluation highlights significant problems with previously proposed schemes; the TLSH scheme does not suffer from the flaws identified.

In parallel with the spread of the Internet, cybercrime has rapidly evolved from a relatively low volume crime to a common high volume crime. A typical example of such a crime is the spreading of spam emails, where the content of the email tries to entice the recipient to click a URL linking to a malicious Web site or downloading a malicious attachment. Analysts attempting to provide intelligence on spam activities quickly find that the volume of spam circulating daily is overwhelming; therefore, any intelligence gathered is representative of only a small sample, not of the global picture. While past studies have looked at automating some of these analyses using topic-based models, i.e. separating email clusters into groups with similar topics, our preliminary research investigates the usefulness of applying authorship-based models for this purpose. In the first phase, we clustered a set of spam emails using an authorship-based clustering algorithm. In the second phase, we analysed those clusters using a set of linguistic, structural and syntactic features. These analyses reveal that emails within each cluster were likely written by the same author, but that it is unlikely we have managed to group together all spam produced by each group. This problem of high purity with low recall, has been faced in past authorship research. While it is also a limitation of our research, the clusters themselves are still useful for the purposes of automating analysis, because they reduce the work needing to be performed. Our second phase revealed useful information on the group that can be utilized in future research for further analysis of such groups, for example, identifying further linkages behind spam campaigns.

The ever evolving new intrusion types pose a serious threat to network security. Although numerous network security tools have been developed, yet the fast growth of intrusive activities is still a serious issue. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect intrusive activities on the network. Machine learning and classification algorithms help to design "Intrusion Detection Models" which can classify the network traffic into intrusive or normal traffic. In this paper we present the comparative performance of NSL-KDD based data set compatible classification algorithms. These classifiers have been evaluated in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment using 41 attributes. Around 94,000 instances from complete KDD dataset have been included in the training data set and over 48,000 instances have been included in the testing data set. Garrett's Ranking Technique has been applied to rank different classifiers according to their performance. Rotation Forest classification approach outperformed the rest.

As converting data from multiple relations into single flat relation usually causes many problems so classification task across multiple database relations becomes challenging task. It is counterproductive to convert multi-relational data into single flat table because such conversion may lead to the generation of huge relation and lose of essential semantic information. In this paper we propose two algorithms for Multi-Relational Classification (MRC). To take advantage of linkage relationship and to link target table with different tables, a semantic relationship graph (SRG) is used. In First approach we have used Naive Bayesian Combination to combine heterogeneous classifiers result to get class label. This will classify the instance accurately and efficiently. Second approach is Multi-Relational Classification using Decision Template (DT). Decision profile is created to combine heterogeneous classifiers output. Based on similarity measure decision template and decision profile is compared to get final output. DT takes contribution of each classifiers output rather than class-conscious. So classification accuracy is improved.

By the application of CRM, greater efficacy and effectiveness in delivering strategies could be achieved. To support CRM in retail sector, many data mining techniques are applied in identifying, attracting, developing and retaining the customer's relationships. On the other hand, the retailers are unable to predict the demand of products which may leads to inconsistencies in profit by the use of CRM. To overcome this disadvantage, an integrated version of CRM along with Supply Chain Management (SCM) is designed which affords the stock requirement from SCM based on the demand in CRM. Thus SCM with CRM enhances the retailers profit, meet the customer's demand and retain the current customers.

In developed countries, among one in eight women develop breast cancer at some stage of their life. Early diagnosis of breast cancer plays a very important role in treatment of the disease. With the goal of identifying genes that are more correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer, we use data mining techniques to study the gene expression values of breast cancer patients with known clinical outcome. K-means clustering is used to compare the result based on test data. As a result, a set of genes are identified that are potential bio marks for breast cancer prognosis which can categorize the patients based on the certain attributes. A comparison is made on gene expression levels that are discovered with gene subsets identified from similar studies using clustering techniques.

The health care industry collects a huge amount of data which is not properly mined and put into optimum use resulting in these hidden patterns and relationships often going unexploited. Advanced data mining modeling techniques can help overcome these conditions. The health care knowledge management, especially in heart disease, can be improved through the integration of data mining with decision support system. Almost 60% of the world population fall victim to the heart disease. Heart disease management is a complex task requiring much experience and knowledge. Traditional way of predicting heart disease is through physician's examination or a number of medical tests such as ECG Stress test, Heart MRI, CT etc., Computer based information along with advanced data mining techniques are used for appropriate results. The main aim of this study is to detect the various causes of cardiovascular diseases by means of machine-learning techniques with the help of clinical diagnosis. For detecting these image analysis data is used. The aim of this research work is to develop a framework for detecting causes by means of data mining and machine-learning techniques.	[Mohan, K.

One of the bottlenecks for their dissemination is the number of computed patterns that appear to be either trivial or uninteresting with respect to available knowledge. Integration of domain knowledge in constraint-based data mining is limited. Relevant patterns still miss because methods partly fail in assessing their subjective interestingness. However, in practice, we often have in the literature mathematical models defined by experts based on their domain knowledge. We propose here to exploit such models to derive constraints that can be used during the data mining phase to improve both pattern relevancy and computational efficiency. Even though the approach is generic, it is illustrated on pattern set discovery from real data for studying soil erosion.

Such predictions are mostly provided by physical or statistical models, both of which rely on accurate forecast of solar irradiance. For the short-to-medium-term forecast horizon (hours to days), irradiance forecast is provided mostly by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, in spite of a recent effort to improve irradiance prediction within current NWP models, its quality is still not satisfactory and it is responsible for a majority of uncertainty in photovoltaic power forecasting. A promising method of improving NWP solar irradiance prediction is multi-model approach. This paper presents preliminary results from a data mining approach to combining irradiance forecasts from multiple NWP models.

The massive volume and increased complexity of information challenge traditional methods of data analysis but at the same time provide unprecedented opportunities to test hypotheses or uncover new relationships viamining of existing databases and literature. In this review, we discuss analytical approaches that are beginning to be applied to help synthesize the vast amount of information generated by the data deluge and thus accelerate the pace of discovery in plant pathology. We begin with a review of meta-analysis as an established approach for summarizing standardized (structured) data across the literature. We then turn to examples of synthesizing more complex, unstructured data sets through a range of data-mining approaches, including the incorporation of 'omics data in epidemiological analyses. We conclude with a discussion of methodologies for leveraging information contained in novel, open-source data sets through web crawling, text mining, and social media analytics, primarily in the context of digital disease surveillance. Rapidly evolving computational resources provide platforms for integrating large and complex data sets, motivating research that will draw on new types and scales of information to address big questions.

These tasks are highly complicated and very difficult. Many researchers have made valiant attempts in data mining to devise an efficient system for stock market movement analysis. In this paper, we have developed an efficient approach to stock market prediction by employing fuzzy C-means clustering and artificial neural network. This research has been encouraged by the need of predicting the stock market to facilitate the investors about buy and hold strategy and to make profit. Firstly, the original stock market data are converted into interpreted historical (financial) data i.e. via technical indicators. Based on these technical indicators, datasets that are required for analysis are created. Subsequently, fuzzy-clustering technique is used to generate different training subsets. Subsequently, based on different training subsets, different ANN models are trained to formulate different base models. Finally, a meta-learner, fuzzy system module, is employed to predict the stock price. The results for the stock market prediction are validated through evaluation metrics, namely mean absolute deviation, mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error used to estimate the forecasting accuracy in the stock market. Comparative analysis is carried out for single Neural Network (NN) and existing technique neural. The obtained results show that the proposed approach produces better results than the other techniques in terms of accuracy.

Numerical investigation is performed on a range of longitudinal gap ratios (2.0 <= L/D <= 4) and transverse gap ratios (2.0 <= T/D <= 4) between the cylinders arranged in tandem and staggered configuration. The effects of interference cylinders at specific relative positions were analyzed; subsequently, it is identified that the reduced velocity (U/fD) and relative positions (spacing ratios) were significantly influences the induced vibration excitation in the elastically mounted circular cylinder. Hence, in this article, an accent is laid on the efficient of 'SPSS Tool' for analyzing the results of flow induced vibration excitation in an elastically mounted circular cylinder at different interference conditions. From the results, it is observed that, reduced velocity must be lesser than the threshold value and also the observed that the relative positions (spacing ratios) is playing a significant role when compared to the reduced velocity. Further, from the observed results, the fluid flow characteristics of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with two interfering cylinders at staggered arrangement in upstream conditions, the oscillatory amplitude ratio (A/D=0.250) is found to be minimum.

However, it is of great challenge to efficiently discover "pure'' high-order (n > 3) word association patterns, especially in the rapidly expanding data collection. Here, by "pure,'' we mean that those words form an inseparable semantic entity, i.e., the high-order dependence that cannot be reduced to the random coincidence of low-order dependence. Our aim is to find pure high-order word associations in large data sets. This paper proposes a distributed pure dependence mining (DPDM) algorithm based on information geometry, which can efficiently mine the pure dependence between words. We also construct a distributed pure dependence mining framework (DPDMF) to mine pure high-order word associations from data sets. Extensive experiments show that DPDM algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency when mining the pure high-order patterns from large data sets. Finally, we apply the extracted high-order word association patterns in the text classification tasks, which will also achieve significant improvement.

Nevertheless, in deep web, the entire data sets are stored in back-end databases and cannot be accessed directly, and data can only be retrieved over the Internet through query forms. The only particular method for mining a deep web data source is to sample the data set, which caused several unique challenges. In this paper, according to active learning, instead of traditional one-time sample allocation, we use multiple phases of sample allocation, which improves the representativeness of our gained samples. At the step of stratified sampling in each phase, we sample parts of representative samples for initial clustering. Using gained clusters, we can explore boundary points in them. A boundary point owns much uncertainty than others; for example, it contains more information. Sampling on a boundary point is useful to gain more representative samples. According to our experiments, our method performs better than random sampling and two-phase sampling in Liu and Agrawal (Int Conf Data Mining 70-81, 2012) at the same sampling costs.

Hence, some works proposed to use artificial intelligence theory in CRNs to promote its intelligence. In order to obtain an accurate spectrum sensing results, CR samples wireless signal frequently. Furthermore, as we know, the wireless channel state may be the same in different time-slots. Hence, it is necessary to use the historical sensing data to reduce the uncertainty of current sensing data, and thus improve spectrum sensing performance. Meantime, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) was recently proposed in artificial intelligence field to realize automatically data clustering, which may be used to cluster the historical sensing data with different hidden channel states, and derive a consensus spectrum state within each cluster. In this paper, we first briefly review CRNs and HDP, respectively. Then, we discuss the possible implementation of HDP over CRN, especially in spectrum sensing problem.

In an attribute reduction algorithm, significance measures of attributes, search strategy, and stopping criterion are the three key points. We assume that the attribute which has a bigger maximal information coefficient (MIC) with the class label is more important to discriminate classes. An experiment is designed to examine the relationship between MIC and the classification accuracy. The experiment uses KNN and SVM algorithm to classify four datasets from UCI. Each attribute is used to classify their dataset, and the corresponding accuracies are recorded. Linear fitting models display the relationship of these accuracies and the MIC scores between each attribute and class label. The results of four datasets show that the MIC scores between each feature and class label have a positive linear relationship with classification accuracy. Furthermore, omitting some of the attributes with lower MIC value would not lessen the classification accuracy significantly.

As the important media for data transmission, the Internet is the significant part for big data processing research. With the large-scale usage of the Internet, the data streaming of network is increasing rapidly. The speed level in the main fiber optic communication of the present has reached 40Gbps, even 100Gbps, therefore data on the optical backbone network shows some features of massive data. Generally, data services are provided via IP packets on the optical backbone network, which is constituted with SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). Hence this method that IP packets are directly mapped into SDH payload is named POS (Packet over SDH) technology. Aiming at the problems of real time process of high speed massive data, this paper designs a process system platform based on ATCA for 40Gbps POS signal data stream recognition and packet content capture, which employs the FPGA as the CPU. This platform offers pre-processing of clustering algorithms, service traffic identification and data mining for the following big data storage and analysis with high efficiency. Also, the operational procedure is proposed in this paper. Four channels of 10Gbps POS signal decomposed by the analysis module, which chooses FPGA as the kernel, are inputted to the flow classification module and the pattern matching component based on TCAM. Based on the properties of the length of payload and net flows, buffer management is added to the platform to keep the key flow information. According to data stream analysis, DPI (deep packet inspection) and flow balance distribute, the signal is transmitted to the backend machine through the giga Ethernet ports on back board. Practice shows that the proposed platform is superior to the traditional applications based on ASIC and NP.

Furthermore, data collection, if implemented at all, typically exposes only a fraction of the information available within log files created by the tool. This leaves a veritable wealth of information languishing unused in tool log files - data that could provide key insights toward improvements in tool performance, processes and utilization. This paper discusses a reusable, lightweight framework for mining data from mask shop tool log files. It details the categories of data that can be mined using this framework, as well as different actions that can be triggered based on the data. The paper also proposes a generic log file format that mask shop tool vendors can implement on any tool to facilitate tool troubleshooting and simplify automated data collection.

The parametrizations are piecewise constant over the state space and also contain, in addition to previous results, a piecewise linear state feedback term. A new data mining algorithm is presented, tailored to determine such parametrizations offline. A refinement step for the parametrizations is formulated which guarantees constraint satisfaction and thereby enables application of the parametrizations in an asymptotically stabilizing overall MPC scheme online. In an example, superior performance of the new results is demonstrated.

In this paper, we propose continuous skyline queries over dynamic data set. Since the dynamic data set constantly changes as time passes, continuous skyline queries processing over dynamic data set becomes ever more complicated compared with static data set. We propose a multiple layer grids scheme for efficiently processing continuous skyline queries over skewed data set. The proposed scheme divides the work space into multiple layer grids and creates the skyline influence regions of each layer grid based on the existing data set. The continuous skyline queries are handled only when the dynamic data points update within the skyline influence regions of each layer grid.

Interest-based relevance modeling was extracted from user interaction in a cross-platform social media Big Data repository. The goal of this study was twofold: first we addressed theoretical dilemmas of a cross-platform user experience; second, we implemented an android-based mobile application and designed a cloud architecture to account for theoretical parameters of Big Data User-centric approach and interactivity. To address cross-platform Big Data challenges, we relied on cloud computing to perform computationally intensive operations such as searching, data mining, and data processing at large scale. Our use case was based on a cross-platform interest-based navigation and content filtering across multiple radio content streams. The streams consisted of tags from radio stations' programming and social media content through a discovery process. User interaction was geared to enable preferred topic filtering, flexibly shifting participation roles, notifications, and navigation through external data sources. We tested our application on a list of popular radio stations and their social media content streams (including Facebook, Twitter, Google+) to generate a Big Data scenario. Even if diverse and nature, data stream traffic generated through a mobile application KASU has proven to be a robust Big Data source with a list of ad hoc user-centric applications.

Sparse coding provides a class of unsupervised algorithms for learning a set of over-complete basis functions, allowing to reconstruct the original signal by linearly combining a small subset of the bases. A shortcoming of most existing sparse coding algorithms is that they need to do some sort of iterative minimization to inference the sparse representations for test points, which means that it's not convenient for these algorithms to perform out-of-sample extension. By additionally training a non-linear regressor that maps input to sparse representation during the training procedure, predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) can naturally be used for out-of-sample extension. Hence, PSD has recently become one of the most famous learning algorithms for sparse coding. However, when the training set is not large enough to capture the variations of the sample, PSD may not achieve satisfactory performance in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called denoising PSD (DPSD), for robust sparse coding. Experiments on real visual object recognition tasks show that DPSD can dramatically outperform PSD in real applications.

Unlike the classification algorithm, clustering belongs to the unsupervised type of algorithms. Two representatives of the clustering algorithms are the K-means and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Linear regression analysis was extended to the category-type dependent variable, while logistic regression was achieved using a linear combination of independent variables. To predict the possibility of occurrence of an event, a statistical approach is used. However, the classification of all data by means of logistic regression analysis cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results. In this paper, the logistic regression analysis is applied to EM clusters and the K-means clustering method for quality assessment of red wine, and a method is proposed for ensuring the accuracy of the classification results.

This paper discusses the process of employing a data mining algorithm to improve the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm. The targeted algorithms to be hybridized are the Meta-heuristic for Randomized Priority Search (Meta-RaPS) and an algorithm used to create an Inductive Decision Tree. This hybridization focuses on using a decision tree to perform on-line tuning of the parameters in Meta-RaPS. The process makes use of the information collected during the iterative construction and improvement phases Meta-RaPS performs. The data mining algorithm is used to find a favorable parameter using the knowledge gained from previous Meta-RaPS iterations. This knowledge is then used in future Meta-RaPS iterations. The proposed concept is applied to benchmark instances of the Vehicle Routing Problem. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an effective drill wear feature identification scheme based on robust clustering techniques. Three types of drill wear (namely; chisel wear, chipped edge and flank wear) are artificially induced on the drill point. The drill cutting edge wear related features are extracted experimentally by processing the force signals from a three-axis piezoelectric load cell in both the time and frequency domains. Techniques based on the short time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet transform (WT) and statistical parameters are utilized for feature extraction. The sensitivity of the proposed method is tested under different cutting feed and speed conditions. The computational study is conducted using the features extracted from three dimensional vibration and cutting force signals. The type of drill wear and related variations in the cutting forces are identified using robust clustering methods. The objective is to isolate regions in the feature space, each region corresponding to one of the drill wear types. Results show that power spectral density data clusters better than data obtained using wavelet coefficients. The clustering results can be used to design classifiers for real time monitoring of wear conditions while drilling. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, this is often not the case and the data extraction becomes more complicated. This contribution is focused on extracting social networks from a dataset which was not adapted for this type of extraction and where there was no relation among students: a set of remote laboratories where students individually test their experiments by submitting their data to a real remote device. By checking which files are shared among students and submitted individually by them, it is possible to know who is sharing how many files with who, automatically extracting what students are bigger sources. While it is impossible to extract the full real social network of these students, all the edges found are clearly part of it. These relations can indeed be used as a new input for performing the analytics on the dataset.

Frequent itemsets are obtained by compressing the transaction matrix efficiently by a new strategy. The new algorithm optimizes the known mining frequent itemsets algorithms based on matrix given by some researchers in recent years, which greatly reduces the temporal complexity and spatial complexity. It is more feasible especially when the degrees of the frequent itemsets are high.
